You will have so much fun watching it and in the end you finally know the real truth about one of the greatest German soccer players of all times Guenther Netzer.Only thing you should not do is  like almost every time  relay on the trailer. If you have seen the trailer you think this one is going to be a big laugh scream comedy full of nasty humor and slapstick. But it is not! All big laughs are already included into the trailer. The other 85 minutes of this movie you will have a great time with a huge smile on your face a small tear of emotion running down your cheek and the warm feeling in your heart you always feel while listening to the old stories of yesterday. And this worked out even for me being born in the 70s and never seeing Netzer playing soccer live. All in all a fine uncommon and very special comedy!".

	schema:reviewBody "Aus einem deutschen Leben literally from a German life but titled Death is my Trade in the subtitled version is a Holocaust film like none other that I've seen.  Where The Gray Zone focused on life in Auschwitz and Jakob der Lgner aka Jacob the Liar focused on life in a Jewish ghetto Death is my Trade centers on the life of Rudolph Hss the commandant of Auschwitz IIBirkenau for the majority of its existence.The main character's name in the film is Franz Lang.  This name change was deliberate to ensure that the character is not automatically viewed as being some sort of villain or demon.  Franz is an average German kid growing up during World War I.  The film follows Franz as he grows up and becomes a hard efficient organized worker who eventually joins the National Socialist party in Germany.  Impressionable young Franz takes orders as one of the utmost points of honor and duty so when he is eventually asked by Heinrich Himmler to become commandant of the largest extermination camp built during WWII he barely hesitates to consider how heavy such a burden will be.The film is based on the memoirs written by Rudolph Hss during the last few months of his life in a Polish prison before his execution in 1947.  This is a beautiful look into the life of a German caught up in the Nazi revolution in Germany.  It is beautiful because it does not demonize the Nazis as being inhuman they were just as human as you and I.  This film shows how it could have been anyone but it just happened to be Rudolph Hss.  A good piece of history even if it isn't the greatest work of cinema for the time.  This movie wasn't made for entertainment it was made to inform the ignorant.710 for a film but a true look into the humanity of the Nazis.".

To most Germans first and foremost known for his role as police inspector in the hugely popular Tatort TVseries I was genuinely surprised to discover this fine piece of acting from his earlier work. This movie is relatively unknown but would deserve much more attention.The movie follows its main character Franz Lang from his youth during WWI until the end WWII and his incarceration. The movie portrays a man with a high degree of selforganisation consequence a firm belief in honour and a strong belief in hierarchy and obeying orders from superiors. At the same time he develops a firm however abstract idea of patriotism. These traits and believes should later dominate almost all of Franz' decisionmaking in life.The movie shows the economic hardships after WWI as well as the crushed selfesteem and disorientation of men many of them veterans after the collapse of the royal Kaiserreich. Their longing for a hierarchical system that promised guidance and order but also for the reinstallation of lost honour and old values made it easy for the stillinsignificant NSDAP to win over Franz who joins the SA. Franz gets noticed by party officials for his loyalty in the fight with communists and enemies of the state.Franz gets more and more entangled in the NSDAP and does not refuse the call to become commanding officer in a new type of as he first believes educational camp  the KZ in Dachau. He later gets transferred to Auschwitz and after some time is asked to convert it into a massmurder machinery. Franz accepts this call not questioning the order. He takes no responsibility for these actions as his own ones but follows his leaders blindly with unlimited faith.Franz is shown not as a careerist or opportunist neither imbued by hate. Instead he carries out the mass murder in a somewhat detached manner which made it ever more intense as behind all of his actions you can still see the human being. That is in my view one of the main achievements of this movie. Franz is very well played by Goetz George who shows some very precise acting never giving in to the temptation to overplay. Also great job from Hans Korte subtly playing coldblooded Heinrich Himmler.The movie is rather lowbudget and shot in simple style. It is slowly paced and unagitated in a wellobserving style. Overall the movie left me in a depressed mood and deeply moved. Worth seeing.".

	schema:headline " A careerdefining role for George";
	schema:reviewBody "Aus einem deutschen Leben or Death Is My Trade is a West German Germanlanguage film from 1977 so it will have its 40th anniversary next year. The German title is actually fairly neutral as it basically means About a German Life. The film comes pretty close to the 150minute mark and it stars actor Gtz George who sadly died recently as Franz Lang. Now that name will not be known to many but it is actually the story of Rudolf H the man who operated the Auschwitz concentration camp. This is the most known cinematic work by writer and director Theodor Kotulla and he adapted Robert Merle's novel here. One important aspect that people sometimes not understand is that this is about Rudolf H and not Rudolf Hess another high profile German Nazi. I will not go into detail about the latter who he was and what he did as this will only make things more complicated. So this one is about H. And it does not only focus on the days when he worked in Auschwitz but also about his early days during World War I for example and between that first big war and the Nazi reign. But looking at the film's runtime this should not surprise anybody. I am quite a fan of George and this is probably why I enjoyed the film more than other people might. I think it is important to make biopics about truly evil people if you can call H that? Your decision to make. And not just about the likes of Hitler or Stauffenberg. H is certainly somebody who deserves a biopic because of his role in history. A big part of the film has to do with the question how much can you blame him for following orders because if he hadn't done it killed all these people then somebody else would have in his place. And this does not refer to the days after the Nazi reign but already to the days during said reign. H' woman plays a major role in this question of moral. She is played by Elisabeth Schwarz who really wants her husband to succeed and is always happy when he is about to get a promotion quite the opposite to H who is a calm thinker and very reliable man who does not display any emotions at all a true professional. But when she finds out about what he does she cannot just accept it. Or can she in the end? Anyway I also liked the brief intertitles inbetween scenes in this movie. It definitely helped with the chronology for such a long film and helped audiences to not lose a connection with when we are right now as it's also not a problem if you are not 100 concentrated during one time or scenario. George played actually quite a few criminals in his long career and I think he did a fine job here. After launching his career next to the Schneider women and appearing in some Karl May westerns afterward this film here is a big improvement for him and if he wasn't before already it catapulted him into the elite of German actors where he stayed until his recent death. I do believe that this film has some lengths but it also has some very rewarding moments and I recommend it to everybody with an interest in German politics of the 20th century especially the years of Nazi Germany. Go see it.".

Also there are many little social comments that those who haven't lived in visited or studied Soviet Union wouldn't understand completely i.e. the obvious ridicule of the social reports and the black market commentary.Nevertheless she liked it and I was dumbfounded.This film is popular and remembered because of its many layers. You may enjoy it simply as slapstick someone else can view it for the language while yet others can view it as a social commentary. It adds up if you know the Russian language and history but even if you don't you will still find it funny and charming because there is always something to take away.".

A couple of awkward chases and a lot of awesome jokes. One of the best Russian comedies second to none except 'Brilliantovaya ruka' by the same film director.It is interesting that the film spans not only the time of Ivan the Terrible and the 70's but also the 20's when Bulgakov's original was written. Although the influence of the 20's is mainly atmospheric it is nevertheless visible in the fact that most of the character's names sound funny in the way usual for the satirical literature of that period.Contrary to what may seem to a foreign audience the chase sequences in the movie serve only as a rather ineffectual background for the main comical action which is almost entirely verbal and basically relies on the combination of contemporary language with its archaic counterpart of the 16th century  a detonating mixture that is guaranteed to kill the nativespeaking audience.Considering the fact that the movie is featuring some of the most popular Soviet actors it is not surprising that this lowbudget and obviously slapdash production has managed to gain the nationwide reputation of a classic with most of its memorable quotes nearly approaching the status of catchphrases.The film can be tentatively recommended to advanced learners of Russian and certainly to all those who specialize in the study of this language.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ivan Vasilievich Changes Profession is a film capable of appealing to audiences outside the Soviet Union with its universally smart humor. From the onset it is obviously influenced by Western cinema one cannot tell if Shurik's bedroom is Russian or American until Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov begins playing from the TV. This homogeneous consumer culture is evident all throughout the film especially in the luxuries of Shpak's apartment the electronics black market and the character of Shurik's wife in the dream plot line. In fact Shurik's wife in the separate dream world seems almost a caricature of Hollywood with her posters and dreams of falling in love with Yakin and finding fame. Gaidai's camera work utilizes quick photography. This is exemplified in the episode in which Miloslavsky is robbing Shpak's apartment and cannot get out Gaidai cuts to the many faces of statues and paintings that in context are shocked and seem to mock him. This is an amusing riff on the Kuleshov Effect. The sets themselves are also fantastic and Ivan's the tsar not the bureaucrat palace appears lifted straight out of Eisenstein's 1947 feature. Ivan Vasilievich both of them too is an exact copy of Eisenstein's tsar pointy beard and all! These visual homages would have been obvious one assumes to Russian audiences of the time and surely would have made it all the more comedic. However Gaidai's humor is not intrinsically Russian like earlier Soviet comedies but appeals internationally. The humor lies in the situational the policeOprichniki chase the switching of identities the mad scientist even a regal food fight. The only context clues to the time are slight jabs at Soviet rations the black market and housing codes. These tropes give the film the ability to transcend the trappings of a fifteen minute fame and allow it to be just as funny if not more decades later.".

This is an amusing riff on the Kuleshov Effect. The sets themselves are also fantastic and Ivan's the tsar not the bureaucrat palace appears lifted straight out of Eisenstein's 1947 feature. Ivan Vasilievich both of them too is an exact copy of Eisenstein's tsar pointy beard and all! These visual homages would have been obvious one assumes to Russian audiences of the time and surely would have made it all the more comedic. However Gaidai's humor is not intrinsically Russian like earlier Soviet comedies but appeals internationally. The humor lies in the situational the policeOprichniki chase the switching of identities the mad scientist even a regal food fight. The only context clues to the time are slight jabs at Soviet rations the black market and housing codes. These tropes give the film the ability to transcend the trappings of a fifteen minute fame and allow it to be just as funny if not more decades later.";

One event that stood out and was rather comedic is the scene where Ivan the Terrible sees a painting in Aleksandr's apartment.

One scene which showcases the melodramactic aspects of the film is the scene where Zina Aleksandr's wife meets Ivan the terrible and Yakin the film directo starts to question which actor is portraying Ivan only to have Ivan get real upset and start to attack Yakin in a comedic way. The use of color in the film was used to separate the dream portion from reality.

Ivan Vasi'lievich Changes Profession 1962 starts off as an absurdist comedy as the mad scientist Shurak watches his television and accidentally sucks up his cat into his vacuum cleaner Shurak using two staple domestic products of the Brezhnev years. The film becomes a sciencefiction adventure as Shurak's newly operational time machine unwittingly sends Ivan the Terrible into 1970s Moscow forcing the old Russian czar to adjust to the struggles of modern life. And finally Ivan Vasi'lievich transforms into a musical as Shurak's apartment superintendent Ivan Vasi'lievich and Miloslavksy perform a dance in the sixteenth century echoing Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible Part II 1958 but this film would have never survived the harsh censorship of Late Stalinism. The Soviet citizen during the Brezhnev years saw an increase in the standard of living prompting a greater middle class and permanently instilling a lifestyle of consumerism.

It's not like I hated it I actually still quite enjoyed it but that doesn't prevent this movie from being an overrated one.Most of the movie its comedy comes from the character looking and talking into the camera and comical sequences that are being played fastforward Benny Hillstyle. It just doesn't work out as being THAT funny. The movie of course has a couple of nice moments but overall the comedy is really lacking which is a disappointing aspect of the movie.The story however is quite original at least for its time it was. It involves time traveling and mistaken identities when Ivan The Terrible find himself in 'modern' Russia while another man from the modern Russia and Czar Ivan lookalike takes over his place in return in the 16th century. This concept of course provides the movie with plenty of comical situations but still I feel that this movie didn't exploited all of its potential. The movie and its comedy mostly remain very simplistic and therefore also somewhat predictable.Aside from its horrible bleak '70's Moscow look this movie is a quite good looking one with professional looking sets and costumes. No doubt that this was quite a cheap movie to make but for most of the time this doesn't show on screen. Directingwise the movie is quite flawed as some of the sequences don't flow in well with each other and the movie features some little mistakes such as a boommike hanging in frame. Leonid Gaidai was a director who felled comfortable within the comedy genre and worked with a lot of famous Soviet comedians during his career. This movie is perhaps his best known and most popular one.The actors also didn't convinced much within this movie but luckily saying your lines convincingly isn't the most needed required for a comical movie.Nothing too horrible but also far from the best that the genre has to offer.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

This one benefits from crisp direction from soon to be legendary Diector Budd Boetticher a great supporting cast and good story. It stars Audie Murphy in one his early and best roles.Bill Doolin aka The Cimarron Kid Murphy is paroled from prison and intends to go straight. Unfortunately the train on which he is riding is held up by the notorious Dalton Gang I always thought that there were four Daltons but this story has six. One of the gang Red Buck Hugh O'Brian complete with red hair and beard recognizes the Kid. The passengers think that the Kid is a part of the gang and try to restrain him. The Kid escapes and goes to the Dalton's camp.The Daltons led by Bob Dalton Noah Beery Jr. welcome him into the gang. The overly ambitious Red Buck doesn't trust the Kid and a conflict develops. The gang has a two bank heist planned for Coffeyville Kansas. Seasonedw western fans will know what happens there. With the gang decimated the Kid takes over as leader and they flee to the ranch of Pat Roberts Roy Roberts to hide out with Marshal John Sutton Leif Ericson and Railroad detective Tilden Eugene Baxter hot on their trail. Naturally Roberts has a comely young daughter Carrie Beverly Tyler who is attracted to the Kid and likewise.The gang in spite of several setbacks continues to operate. Dynamite Dick Dalton John Hudson who was believed to be lost returns to the hideout with a proposal. With the help of his brotherinlaw Geaorge Webster John Hubbard he proposes the robbery of a train carrying gold bullion and replacing it with lead. As the plan unfolds the Kid discovers a double cross and.........................................As with most of Universal's westerns the supporting cast consists of several of their up and coming contract players sprinkled with a few recognizable veterans. In addition to those mentioned above we have James Best Gregg Palmer aka Palmer Lee Rand Brooks and William Reynolds as the other Daltons as well as Yvette Duguay as Best's girlfriend Rose John Bromfield Richard Garland and Frank Silvera as Dalton Gang members and Tristram Coffin as a womanizergambler.The boyish looking Murphy was developing into a competent actor by this time and would enjoy a long career at Universal making these excellent little westerns.".

The gang has a two bank heist planned for Coffeyville Kansas. Seasonedw western fans will know what happens there. With the gang decimated the Kid takes over as leader and they flee to the ranch of Pat Roberts Roy Roberts to hide out with Marshal John Sutton Leif Ericson and Railroad detective Tilden Eugene Baxter hot on their trail. Naturally Roberts has a comely young daughter Carrie Beverly Tyler who is attracted to the Kid and likewise.The gang in spite of several setbacks continues to operate. Dynamite Dick Dalton John Hudson who was believed to be lost returns to the hideout with a proposal. With the help of his brotherinlaw Geaorge Webster John Hubbard he proposes the robbery of a train carrying gold bullion and replacing it with lead. As the plan unfolds the Kid discovers a double cross and.........................................As with most of Universal's westerns the supporting cast consists of several of their up and coming contract players sprinkled with a few recognizable veterans. In addition to those mentioned above we have James Best Gregg Palmer aka Palmer Lee Rand Brooks and William Reynolds as the other Daltons as well as Yvette Duguay as Best's girlfriend Rose John Bromfield Richard Garland and Frank Silvera as Dalton Gang members and Tristram Coffin as a womanizergambler.The boyish looking Murphy was developing into a competent actor by this time and would enjoy a long career at Universal making these excellent little westerns.";

	schema:headline " Audie Murphy as outlaw Bill Doolin in a compact western";
	schema:reviewBody "THE CIMARRON KID 1951 was one of about two dozen westerns Audie Murphy starred in at Universal Pictures in the period from 19501966. In brief it tells the story of outlaw Bill Doolin who rode with the infamous Dalton gang in the disastrous raid on Coffeyville Kansas and went on to lead the gang's survivors in a subsequent robbery spree. A WWII heroturnedmovie star Murphy plays Doolin as a misunderstood youth who gets forced into a life of crime through guilt by association and persecution by an overzealous railroad detective. Further complications ensue when Doolin falls in love with a rancher's daughter who wants him to go straight.The film was directed by western specialist Budd Boetticher who provides quite a number of interesting touches. One of the gang members played by James Best has a Mexican girlfriend known as Cimarron Rose Yvette Dugay who is an equal participant in the action and is used to acquire information about payroll shipments and assorted robbery targets. The other major woman character rancher's daughter Carrie Roberts Beverly Tyler is pretty strong and forthright on her own and makes no attempt to play coy in her meetings with Doolin. She even comes up with a plan to help him leave the outlaw life but one which he rejects.Also there is a significant black character a man named Stacy Frank Silvera who provides support services for the gang and who while not actually a participant in their crimes is dealt an equal share of the proceeds. There is a scene of him at home with his familya wife and three childrenthat indicates his choice of a domestic life over an outlaw one yet he is always treated with respect by the other men.The rest of the cast consists of a mixed bag of character actors like Noah Beery Jr. Leif Erickson Roy Roberts John Hubbard and Rand Brooks and upandcoming Universal contract players James Best Hugh O'Brian John Bromfield John Hudson William Reynolds Palmer Lee Greg Palmer. At times they threaten to crowd the softspoken unassuming Murphy off the screen but Audie ultimately manages to hold his own. Boetticher and Murphy would work together one more time on Murphy's last film A TIME FOR DYING 1971 in which the actor has a cameo as Jesse James.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Cimarron Kid is directed by Budd Boetticher and written by Louis Stevens and Kay Lenard. It stars Audie Murphy Beverly Tyler James Best Yvette Dugay John Hudson Leif Erickson Noah Beery Junior and Hugh O'Brian. Music is by Joseph Gershenson and cinematography by Charles P. Boyle.Murphy stars as Bill Doolin AKA The Cimarron Kid who leaves prison intending to go straight. However when the Dalton Gang rob the train he is a passenger on one of them recognises him and vocally brings it to the attention of the rest of the passengers. Incorrectly earmarked as one of the gang Doolin finds himself on the run from the law and forced to hide out with the Dalton's. Bitter and angry at the false way he has been perceived Doolin becomes an active part of the gang but there is love in the air with Carrie Roberts Tyler offering hope of a new on the right side of the law life.Boetticher is a name dear to the hearts of Western fans he would go forward from here to make the Ranown Westerns with Randolph Scott thus leaving a considerable mark in the psychological Western pantheon. Invariably his other forays into the genre struggle to hold a torch to those later efforts but although they lack the insightfulness and quality of narrative of those pictures made with Scott the likes of this and The Man from the Alamo are minor gems well worth discovering.The story on premise terms doesn't offer anything new where the core beat of the picture is about a man who has been dealt some bad life cards and can't escape his criminal past. Yet the story is unfolded in such away that hope is dangled in front of The Kid and we are never sure how it will pan out for him? In fact the finale has a couple of kickers that ensure it's well worth the viewing experience. There's the usual roll call of gang character's including the loose cannon O'Brian but that familiarity of genre convention is off set by the addition of Yvette Dugay's Rose of Cimarron. She's a crafty and athletic part of the set up a well written part and Dugay performs it well whilst joining Tyler in the gorgeous Technicolor darlings stakes.This is also a picture high on action and filled with lovely outdoor photography. Locations used are the historical parks at Columbia State and Railtown 1897 both are photographed expertly by Boyle with Boetticher deftly utilising them to aid the story. Best of the action comes with a shoot out and escape after the Coffeyville bank raids resplendent with burning hay wagon while the quite excellent and extended shoot out centred around Railtown's turntable is one of the finest action constructions on Boetticher's CV. Cast are strong led superbly by a thoughtful Murphy performance of substance and prolific Western scorer Gershenson adds the required bombast and tenderness when required.Its B movie worth sometimes shows such as handcuffs that mysteriously disappear from the escaping Doolin but taken as a whole this is a little cracker of an Oater and highly recommended to Western fans. 810".

Audie Murphy puts in a decent performance playing against type as Doolin. Beverly Tyler is good enough as love interest Carrie Roberts but Yvette Duguay is the most memorable of the female cast she plays Rose whose job it is to get information about targets for their robberies... it is great to see a female character doing more than occasionally act as a nurse or only get involved in the action when it is absolutely necessary Rose is very much one of the gang. There is plenty of varied action including people jumping from a train onto horses a burning hay wagon being pulled through a town and an impressive shoot out in a railway yard. The film was made in some stunning scenery although as was often the case it is Californian scenery not Oklahoman. This might not be an all time great but it is a pretty good western and fans of the genre should check it out if they get a chance.".

Check Out that Railroad Turnstile Scene has there ever been another Shot with an Attention to Detail. Also Notice the Strong Female Mexican Character Yvette Duguay as Important and Cunning as any of the Gang and Absolutely Beautiful.These Slightly OffTrack Ingredients and His Mastery Showcase of the Camera Lighting and Action Scenes show why the Director would soon become Legendary Teaming Up with Randolph Scott to make a Series of Westerns that are Considered some of the Best of the Decade.There are Scenes with Actors in the Foreground in Nothing but Shadow Faceless and Baroque. Take a Look at the Gun Battles and the way Botteicher makes them a Rapid Fire Standout Realistic although Heightened with Visual Flare.Murph also Shows just how Photogenic He could be Displaying BabyFaced Features that Hide His Strong and Steely Interior. He Captures the Frame even when Surrounded by a Gaggle of Gang Members.Overall this is as Attractive and Action Packed as any Western of the Period and can Hold its Own with the Best of the Early Fifties. Note...Look for an almost unrecognizable bearded redhaired Hugh O'Brian as a nasty villain appropriately named Red Buck.".

Also Notice the Strong Female Mexican Character Yvette Duguay as Important and Cunning as any of the Gang and Absolutely Beautiful.These Slightly OffTrack Ingredients and His Mastery Showcase of the Camera Lighting and Action Scenes show why the Director would soon become Legendary Teaming Up with Randolph Scott to make a Series of Westerns that are Considered some of the Best of the Decade.There are Scenes with Actors in the Foreground in Nothing but Shadow Faceless and Baroque. Take a Look at the Gun Battles and the way Botteicher makes them a Rapid Fire Standout Realistic although Heightened with Visual Flare.Murph also Shows just how Photogenic He could be Displaying BabyFaced Features that Hide His Strong and Steely Interior. He Captures the Frame even when Surrounded by a Gaggle of Gang Members.Overall this is as Attractive and Action Packed as any Western of the Period and can Hold its Own with the Best of the Early Fifties. Note...Look for an almost unrecognizable bearded redhaired Hugh O'Brian as a nasty villain appropriately named Red Buck.";

After all I am not a huge fan of westerns and the films appeared pretty unremarkable. However when I noticed both films were directed by Budd Boetticher I remembered that THIS was why I'd put these films on my list many months earlier. Boetticher was a wonderful director who managed to make his westerns better than the normwith stories that lack many of the usual clichs. Unfortunately this film is not typical of Boetticher's better films as there are a lot of clichs spread throughout the movie.This is an odd film since it is a remake of another movie The Doolins of Oklahoma that was released just three years earlier! While remakes were very common remaking a film so quickly wasn't. In the case of The Cimarron Kid Audie Murphy takes on the role previously played by Randolph Scottand frankly no one can play a western role better than Scott so Murphy is at a big disadvantage.The film begins with Murphy being pardoned and released from prison. It seems that he'd been convicted of robbery based solely on his friendships and the law finally realized her was innocent. However when the train he's on is robbed by his old friends people naturally assume he's one of themand he's a wanted man all over again! So in an odd twist he DOES join the gang. But because he's basically a swell guy he leads the gang in becoming more thoughtful and less prone to just blasting peoplesort of a kinder gentler form of banditry. I really expected this all to pay off better than it did. But the film is morally ambiguous and seems to say that Murphy is a good badguy! And until it concludes there are lots of clichssuch as the quicktempered guy Hugh O'Brian who you just know will have a showdown with Murphy sooner or later the lady who thinks Murphy is not beyond redemption and several others. Despite the clichs and the strange leading character the film was well made and is interestingeven with the dumb ending that made little sense.I should also add that while I love Boetticher films I also hate westerns that portray and glamorize minor western villains like the Daltons Jesse James or Billy the Kid. 99 of the exploits they do on film are untrue and the men were mostly a lot of cheap crooksyet Hollywood raised them almost to hero status and fictionalized their lives. So when Murphy infiltrates this famous gang I felt a bit annoyed...the sort of annoyed that history teachers like myself are good at becoming!By the way during the roundhouse scene why was it important for Rose to activate the turntable?! Really. The gang was NOT using a train!!".

I was surprised to see how quickly the Daltons faded from the story but the events of their raid on Coffeyville Oklahoma were portrayed fairly accurately. The historical Bill Doolin rode with the Daltons for a while but whether he was with them on the Coffeyville run remains a matter of conjecture.Be that as it may this Western is about par for the course for Audie Murphy's movie output. He played both heroes and villains in his pictures trading on the personal popularity he gained as a real war hero during the Second World War. I don't think you'll find many reviewers who would call him a great actor but he managed to entertain well enough and that's about the most one can expect from films like these.The puzzler for me in this film was why Murphy's character turned to a life of crime after being exonerated and recommended for parole over his associations with outlaws like the Daltons. His character was one that could have swayed either way so when he goes the bad guy route I felt the film makers missed an opportunity. A scene I thought was pretty clever was the one in which Carrie Roberts Beverly Tyler wrangled an engagement ring out of the Kid when she wasn't even trying. Seems like Dad Roberts Roy Roberts was pretty much OK with it too.Now I've seen Hugh O'Brian in outlaw roles before but giving him red hair and a red beard was a bit much wasn't it? I guess it had to do with his character's name Red Buck. On hand as a foil to Bill Doolin's position in the gang as nominal leader after most of the Daltons get wiped out Red doesn't make it out of Rigby during the shootout there. Speaking of which the inclusion of that railroad turntable was a neat distraction since it had nothing to do with the outcome.Well the real life Emmett Dalton survived the Coffeyville Raid and after serving prison time wound up going to Hollywood to consult on films like When the Daltons Rode. He was given short shrift in this story because the only Dalton survivor in this one was Dynamite Dick John Hudson who wound up double crossing Bill Doolin.

The the outdoor locations though actually California were well chosen to look suitably like Okieland. As an added bonus there are lots of period railroad equipment with a shootout in a rural roundhouse one of the rousing action scenes.There is not really much to find wrong is this little oat burner except for Audie Murphy's awful acting. Let's face a wooden cigar store Indian with a microphone implant could do little worse. But even that serious handicap is overcome by Boetticher's skillful direction and a creative script that concentrates on the interesting supporting cast of characters especially Noah Berry Jr.'s Bob Dalton and the love relationship between Bitter Creek Dalton James Best and Cimarron Rose Yvette Duguay. This device happily keeps the camera away from Murphy's frozen features for most of the screen time. Yvette Duguay though only fourthbilled actually steals the show as the outlaw gang's resourceful gun moll. Pretty exotic lively and sexy she is more interesting and appealing in every way than Audie's hohum love interest secondbilled Beverly Tyler. Good support is also contributed by veteran character actors Roy Roberts and Leif Erickson. Altogether a very satisfying little Western. Better than some of the bigger productions from the same early 1950's era and certainly superior to any of the pretentious plates of tripe passed off as Westerns today.".

A Technicolor production the location's for the shoot were at Moab Utah with Arches National Park Colorado River Courthouse Wash Ida Gulch and Professor Valley forming the backdrops to the story.The film is a fictionalised account of The Bascom Affair of 1861 and the Battle of Apache Pass that occurred in 1862 the latter of which saw the Indians witness for the first time in the region an artillery attack by means of mountain howitzers. It deals in the events that led up to the battle and focuses on the in fighting between Chiricahua warriors Cochise and Geronimo.Although both Chandler and Silverheels reprise their character roles from Broken Arrow 1950 The Battle at Apache Pass takes place prior to the events depicted in the 1950 movie. As solid as they come story wise and with beautiful Technicolor scenery Sherman's film is only really let down by not having acting gravitas in the American roles. Messrs Lund Cowling and Hudson are OK but the material needed more assured performers to play off of the excellent Chandler. On the feminine side Cabot does the best with what little she is given to do while Beverly Tyler playing a pretty important character narratively speaking is just a pretty tugofwar prop device. However it's easy to look away from the lack of dramatic worth in the acting because Sherman's action set ups are very good with the actual battle of the title brilliantly constructed in a rock formed valley featuring reams of extras lots of warfare and the thunder of howitzers filling the ears. While Boyle's Horizon's WestTomahawk photography is sumptuous and a credit to the cinematographer's craft. Salter's score tho is only standard fare with familiar Redskin strains for the Indians and drum beat military thrusts for the Cavalry sequences.A fine film to look at with a more than interesting story driving it forward it sadly tho needed more grit from a good portion of the cast. 6.510".

Chandler is more convincing as Cochiseand complements well the Canadian Indian actor Jay Silverheels best known as Tonto in the Lone Ranger series where he always struck me as being a bit wooden here he gets some dialogue and a couple of good fights which he loses as Geronimo.There's a suggestion of an instant romance between Lund and Beverly Tyler as the wagontrain survivor but this is so feeble it might as well have been omitted.The action scenes are well handled especially the climatic battle in Apache Pass.".

	schema:reviewBody "This colorful western is a rousing yarn that is one of the best of the 1950s. The picture is based on two historical events the shameful Bascom affair and the fight in Apache Pass in which two mountain howitzers foiled a wellplanned ambush by the Indians. Cochise's Chiricahuas and the U.S. cavalry do all they can to keep peace in the southwest but renegade Mogollons and greedy scheming whites are just as determined to cause trouble between the Apaches and the soldiers. Jeff Chandler reprises his role as Cochise in the landmark western Broken Arrow as does Jay Silverheels as the warlike Geronimo. John Lund is the major who is sympathetic to the Indians and values his friendship with Cochise. Bruce Cowling and Jack Elam are the white men who have other ideas about how to deal with the Indians. Richard Egan and Hugh O'Brian are also good as army lieutenants. Tech credits are great especially the camera work by Charles Boyle and the music score by Hans Salter.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Battle At Apache Pass is dependent on its verisimilitude for the notion that most Americans are ignorant of the fine points of the true story of the various American Indian wars. Broken Arrow took place in the early 1870s and it's where Tom Jeffords and Cochise formed a peace pact that included all the Apaches except those followers of Geronimo.In this prequel the Civil War has come and a lot of soldiers are ordered back to fight in the east. Some ambitious people on both sides like Geronimo for the Apaches and Bruce Cowling a political hack Indian agent with ambitions to be territorial governor try to break an informal peace established by the friendship of Major John Lund and Cochise as played by Jeff Chandler who returns as Cochise. Jay Silverheels as Geronimo is the only returnee from Broken Arrow. The Battle At Apache Pass is not in the same league of greatness as Broken Arrow but it still is a pretty good western. If the film has a moral it is blessed are the peacemakers because they have their work cut out for them. It doesn't take much to start a war but a lot of work and sacrifice is needed to end one. There are enough examples in real life right down to today to affirm that notion.Through it all Lund and Chandler retain a mutual respect for each other and both are afforded the opportunity to save the women that each other loves Beverly Tyler for Lund and Susan Cabot for Chandler.Besides those I've already mentioned standing out in the supporting cast is Jack Elam at his squinty eyed evil best as a scout working for Cowling and Richard Egan as a tough but compassionate sergeant. His scenes with Susan Cabot where he shows her a world of respect as due the first lady of a nation have a lot of depth to them.Not as good as Broken Arrow but still a fine western The Battle At Apache Pass holds up very well for today's audience.".

	schema:headline " Stimulating and moving Western beautifully shot in Technicolor about the famous Indian leaders  Cochise and Jeronimo";
	schema:reviewBody "Pretty good western chronicles a strong fight between the Indian tribes and the US cavalry in New Mexico territory . Set during the American Civil War  this is the story of Maj. Jim Colton John Lund  a hardworking officer who has a nice relationship with Apache leader Cochise Jeff Chandler. Indians and US cavalry intend to make peace but the tribal chiefs feel their treaty has been violated . Then  at Fort Buchanan shows up the nasty and politically ambitious Indian agent Neil Baylor Bruce Cowling along with his supporter Mescal Jack Jack Elam  and  subsequently  there takes place the kidnapping a local farmer's son . The corrupt Baylor convinces Lt. George Bascom John Hudson that Cochise is the main responsible  and both of them execute an attack against Indians . Meanwhile  leader Jeronimo Jay Silverheels carries out razzias against the US Cavalry  caravans and settlements . The Apaches and Cavalry later meet in a battle that ends in disaster  with hostages executed by hanging on both sides . Shortly after  the cavalry column advances into the Apache pass and things go wrong . AUniversalInternationalPicture gets Western action  exciting assaults  go riding  shootouts  breathtaking Indian raids on Yankees regiments and resulting to be quite entertaining . This moving movie is an epic portrait of the thrilling story about tribal chiefs decide to unite their forces against the trespassing whites that break their treaties . The movie depicts a fictionalized account of The Bascom Affair of 1861 and The battle of Apache pass of 1862 . At Apache pass took place an impressive battle  the first time that the Indians meet modern  for the age  artillery U.S. All the battle scenes in this production were actually photographed at Arches National Monument Park . Producers gratefully acknowledge the assistance of the national Park Service of the United States Department of the Interior whose splendid cooperation made these scenes possible . It is medium budget film with good actors  technicians  production values and pleasing results . At the ending  when takes place the Indian attack  possesses all the sweep  grandeur and noisy action of the greatest Westerns of an age long past . The picture contains spectacular charges of Indian riders  including an overwhelming final when the US soldiers are besieged at a rocky pass . Nice acting from a great cast . As John Lund is good as a honorable Major who is in charge of maintaining order and attempts to keep the peace between US cavalry and Indians . The best acting is given by Jeff Chandler who provides stature to the role  delivering sincerity and bravura . Chandler was known  until his early death  for playing Indian chief Cochise  a dignified portrait well shown in  Broken arrow 50 by Delmer Daves  that was the first time the Red Indian was depicted as a human being rather than a brute savage merely to bite the dust at the hands of the US cavalry  as well as Battle of Apache Pass 1952 and Taza  son of Cochise 1954 by Douglas Sirk  this latter JeffCochise is briefly glimpsed as a dying man at the beginning and handing over the reins of power to Rock Hudson as Taza . Although Chandler also played all kinds of genres  such as  Return to Peyton Placedrama  Flame of Araby adventure  Merrill's marauders wartime  in his last film  until his early death at 42yearold . In addition  support cast is frankly excellent  such as  Beverly Tyler  John Hudson  Richard Egan  Gregg Palmer  Regis Toomey  Hugh O'Brian  James Best  and Jay Silverheels in his usual role as Geronimo  a violent Indian chief vowing to lead the tribes in battle against the encroaching white men . Furthermore  special mention for the usually baddie Jack Elam . This stimulating and stirring Western was beautifully photographed in Cinemascope  print in Technicolor by Charles Boyle  Universal's ordinary cameraman . And an original and shining score from Has J salter .This motion picture was professionally directed by George Sherman in colorful style  though has a few flaws . He realized a great number of films  especially Westerns . As he specialized almost exclusively in B westerns  including the Three Musketeers series which featured a young John Wayne. George directed lots of Westerns as The Last of the Fast Guns  The Lone Hand Santa Fe stampede  Red skin War Arrow Chief Crazy Horse Calamity Jane Relentless  Comanche Territory  Dawn at Socorro Border River and many others . He also made occasional forays into action and horror themes often achieving a sense of style over substance . The only Agrade films to his credit were two westerns starring John Wayne Comancheros 1961 as producer and The big Jack 1971 . His last films were realized in Spain as Find That Girl  The new Cinderella and Joaquin Murrieta. Rating  610 . Acceptable and passable . Well worth watching .".

Chief of the Chiricahau Apaches Cochise believes in peace with the army and is friends with Major Kim Colton the commanding officer of the local fort. The peace is doomed though when Neil Baylor arrives he has been sent from Washington to oversee Indian Affairs and is determined that the Apaches will leave their land and move to a designated reservation where there is nothing to hunt and the people would rely on government handouts. Baylor isn't going to wait for something to go wrong he is duplicitous and promises Geronimo weapons if he will attack a trading post and leave evidence implicating the Chiricahau. Colton is convinced that it is a set up but while he is out searching for Geronimo newly arrived Lt. Bascom is persuaded to go out and capture Cochise. Cochise escapes and it isn't long before the whole Apache nation is on the warpath. By the time Colton returns it is too late to stop the conflict his only hope is that he can evacuate his camp to Fort Sheridan to do that they will have to get through Apache Pass where Cochise and Geronimo are waiting for them! This was a surprisingly enjoyably film from the title I assumed it would be about the 'heroic cavalry' fighting off the 'ferocious Apaches' but the majority of the Apaches were depicted as peaceful people and the villain of the story was very much Baylor the Indian Affairs man. It is a pity that most of the Indian characters were played by white actors but given the time that it was made it isn't a surprise. Jeff Chandler did a good job as the honourable Cochise as did John Hudson who played Lt. Bascom a man who didn't understand the Apache and believed in doing everything according to army regulations right down to wearing a cap that offered no protection from the burning New Mexico sun. There was plenty of exciting action leading up to the spectacular battle in the final scenes. It was good to see that this was filmed in the harsh but stunning terrain of New Mexico rather than somewhere in California like so mane westerns were. This might not be a classic with well known stars but I'd certainly recommend it to fans of the genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hollywood in the 1950's was in the throws of changing the mystic conception that White men were always beating the Native Americans in war. In this film called  The Battle at Apache Pass  is one of the new attempts at glorying the U.S. Calvary's version of that now infamous battle. To be sure the movie portrays the Indian as an undisciplined savage out to kill every white man and the U.S. cavalry as military pawns of opportunistic land grabbing marauders. However within the ranks of the Apache are two of the more notorious names who's names are inscribed in Western Lore. This movie purports to have Geronimo Jay Silverheels and Cochise Jeff Chandler engaged in battle with Maj. Jim Coltton John Lund and George Bascom John Hudson using the first use of western field cannons. The dialog between the Whites and Indians is standard Hollywood but does depict some of the actual atrocities committed on both sides.

In this film called  The Battle at Apache Pass  is one of the new attempts at glorying the U.S. Calvary's version of that now infamous battle. To be sure the movie portrays the Indian as an undisciplined savage out to kill every white man and the U.S. cavalry as military pawns of opportunistic land grabbing marauders. However within the ranks of the Apache are two of the more notorious names who's names are inscribed in Western Lore.

For an action movie this is a plus. I am not a movie buff but I do enjoy a good mentally relaxing movie and this one fits the bill. The acting is good and the action is definitely not true to life but what action movie is. If you enjoy Quentin Tarentino movies then you will like this film. I would say it is a cross between a Kill Bill and Deliverence but with out the hard core southern stereotyping. No squel like a pig or racist behavior. Just some classic shoot em up action.".

	schema:reviewBody "'THE BAYTOWN OUTLAWS' Four and a Half Stars Out of FiveThis is one of those movies that really caught me by surprise. I had heard a little about it upon it's limited release in theaters but it of course wasn't playing anywhere around me and the synopsis and lack of hype didn't peak my curiosity in the film. It's about three vigilante redneck brothers 'for hire' who agree to help a woman get her godson back from her asshole ex. They find an assortment of crazy mercenaries after them when they rescue the boy and try to bring him back to his godmother. It stars three mostly unknown actors in the leads Clayne Crawford Travis Fimmel and Daniel Cudmore and was directed and cowritten with Griffin Hood by an actor turned director making his feature film directorial debut Barry Battles. The film also features some bigger stars in supporting roles like Billy Bob Thornton Eva Langoria Andre Braugher Zoe Bell and Michael Rapaport but it was made on a budget of just 4 million and not given much publicity or attention at all. I loved it and think it's sure to be a cult favorite for many years to come. If you're a film nut you have to see it. The film is set in Alabama where brothers Brick Crawford McQueen Fimmel and Lincoln Oodie Cudmore who you might recognize as Colossus from the 'XMEN' movies work for the local Sheriff Braugher murdering criminals vigilante style in order to help keep the crime rate there the lowest in the state. After botching one job and not getting paid they find a woman at their door named Celeste Langoria offering the boys 25000 to rescue her godson Rob Thomas BrodieSangster from her asshole crime boss ex Carlos Thornton. The brothers take the job and retrieve the kid but fail to kill Carlos as Celeste instructed them to. They then find all kinds of assassins 'for hire' after them as they try to get Rob safely home to Celeste. They oddly bond with the boy at the same time. The movie really struck me as effective in the way it introduces it's three lead characters as disgusting villains and then instead makes you care for them more and more throughout the film. Their relationship with the boy was really well done and all four lead actors are really good in the film. If this movie had better backing it could easily make Crawford Fimmel and Cudmore stars but with their charisma and talent I'm sure they can find other work to help them do that. The rest of the cast is all exceptional as well and Barry Battles really makes a name for himself with this film. For a debut effort it really is an exceptional production all around and I can't wait to see what he does next. It's got a lot of heart it's funny tons of excessively violent action lots of sex appeal including a gang of hot female biker assassins and is just a really fun time at the movies! A lot of people will label it a clich driven Tarantinoesque B action film but it's much more well done and creative than that gives it credit for.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vIHU1MR5VpzY".

I really loved the cast and what each one of them brought to the table. Billy Bob Thorton's role was right up his alley. And he nails the part. I will say that being from the south North Louisiana you could tell that some of the accents were put on and a little overboard at times.. But anyone from Pittsburgh wouldn't even notice probably.

One could argue a few parts of the movie in regards to realism but it is a movie. A film of this caliber does not need a sophisticated back story as I perceive that the intent was to thrust the viewers into the day in the life of some good old boys doing what they do.

It's so gratifying to know that you can find little gems like this among all the crap that gets feed to us in the theaters Yeah I'm talking to you 'Oz the Great and Powerful' and 'Jack the Giant Slayer' and every Jason Statham movie made since 'The Italian Job'. Baytown is about three brothers who only know violence and mayhem. They live their life one mark at a time and always looking for the one last big score. They find it in smoking hot Eva Longoria. She commissions them to get back her god son from the evil clutches of drug lord Carlos Billy Bob Thornton. Thornton plays the same character he's played over the past couple of years 'Bad Santa' 'Bad News Bears' and I still love it. This movie is a cool blend of other films like 'The Warriors' 'The Way of the Gun' and 'Smokin' Aces'. Its definitely worth a watch and should also restore your faith in the DirecttoDVD bin. 7.5 out of 10.".

Storyline whilst quite simple and basic was OK there were certainly plenty of plot holes and the story was weak in places but at the end of the day this was just a schlockfest of violence and one liners. Billy Bob Thornton whilst getting top billing played quite a minor role which could have been developed more thoroughly and comedically. Although I have never heard of any of the main 3 actors I am sure they must have had prior quality roles. There was a bit of schmaltz in this movie with the invalid boy  well played by Thomas Brodie Sangster of Game of Thrones fame giving a performance akin to Daniel day Lewis in My Left Foot receiving some gush from the brothers.

Its got a lot of violence guns a bit of sexy appeal that only a gang of murderous biker hookers could provide and Eva Longoria isn't in enough scenes to ruin the movie as she usually does  see A Dark Truth. Well save yourself and please don't. There is a reason why Longoria has been buried in Soap Operas for so long. She is great eye candy but her acting abilities....yeah not so much.The Bad. A lot of the script is just plain stupid and bad. The story is lame as well. Let's face the facts though. This movie wasn't made to impress critics or win awards it was made for action entertainment and in that regard you can ignore most of the script and storyline and just bathe in the action and violence. It was well done in that regard and for those interested in those critically acclaimed areas don't bother watching it.I give it a 7. I was entertained and that was the whole point of the film. The actors portraying the brothers weren't very good but they didn't have to be and the contract killing motorcycle gang of hookers were hot eye candy. So get out the popcorn and watch the action and violence and have fun with it. If your not into that sort of movie than you have no business watching this one.".

It has many plot elements that Tarentino uses antisocial psychotic antihero's violent groups of women cheesy over the top violence revenge and vengeance an interesting plot twist politically incorrect language.... Even some of the camera angles and camera shots reassembled Tarentino movies. This isn't a thinking man's movie... There's no moral or message to be gotten out of it that you can't see in any number of movies. It did hit the spot though as far as entertainment goes... While there isn't much of a plot to speak of there was no shortage of action. That action was mixed and varied enough to keep my attention. Over all it came off like Kill Bill meets The Devils Rejects With even a nod to the Devils Rejects with the use of Lynyrd Skynyrd's Freebird which I caught and thoroughly enjoyedI'm not much of Billy Bob Thorton fan with very few exceptions he's always come off as stiff and awkward. I felt the same about his performance in this and it seemed like he just phoned in his performance to me. I'm sure if your a fan of his you might enjoy him in it though. I felt Eva Longoria's performance wasn't much better. Fortunately their screen time was limited and the actors that played the 3 brothers were the stars and the action of the movie carried it.In spite of my criticism I'd definitely give the movie a thumbs up and recommend it.".

While there isn't much of a plot to speak of there was no shortage of action. That action was mixed and varied enough to keep my attention. Over all it came off like Kill Bill meets The Devils Rejects With even a nod to the Devils Rejects with the use of Lynyrd Skynyrd's Freebird which I caught and thoroughly enjoyedI'm not much of Billy Bob Thorton fan with very few exceptions he's always come off as stiff and awkward. I felt the same about his performance in this and it seemed like he just phoned in his performance to me. I'm sure if your a fan of his you might enjoy him in it though. I felt Eva Longoria's performance wasn't much better. Fortunately their screen time was limited and the actors that played the 3 brothers were the stars and the action of the movie carried it.In spite of my criticism I'd definitely give the movie a thumbs up and recommend it.";

	schema:reviewBody "I just stumbled across another guilty pleasure that I truly enjoyed. Filmed in a B Movie genre style this movie is a combination 'Mad Max' meets 'The Warriors' with plenty of blood guts and raw carnage to go around. Budgeted at only 4 Million dollars WriterDirector Barry Battles does an excellent job of getting plenty of bang for his buck with his limited resources. This film was highly entertaining brought depth to it characters and was a totally unexpected pleasure to view.The film centers around three unlikely heroesantiheroes Brick McQueen and Lincoln Oodie. Not the sharpest crayons in the box however after watching the film you will see that they mean well and that these boys actually have hearts of gold. Orphaned at a relatively young age and forced to raise themselves the Oodie brothers are vigilante guns for hire. Without giving too much away let's just say that the Oodie brothers are paid to eliminate the seedy underbelly world of drugs organized crime and all things that are bad and under the radar in Montgomery Alabama. Their world is turned underside down once they accept a job from Celeste Eva Longoria to kidnap her son Rob Thomas BrodieSangster from her ex Carlos Billy Bob Thornton.Once our trio of misfits successfully secured Rob in their possession all hell breaks loose as Carlos puts out a contract on the Oodie brothers for Rob's returns. The gangs called upon to ensure Rob's return include a group of hooker biker chicks a post apocalyptic road warrior crew and a scalp hungry Indian clan complete with bow and arrows. It's pure unadulterated gratification as the body count and blood splatter action sequences are top notch and exceptionally executed and totally unforeseen in a film with such a small budget. Clayne Crawford Brick Travis Fimmel McQueen and Daniel Cudmore Lincoln do an unbelievable job breathing life into their blood encrusted characters. Kudos to writerdirector Barry Battles for successfully building characters that the audience actually cares about character development in a film of this variety was definitely not expected and absolutely great to see.I highly recommend seeing this film however this is definitely not a film for everyone. Fans of the 'B Movie'  blood splatter bullet blaring action genre will find true delight in this film. See more of my reviews on FB  The Faris Reel".

	schema:reviewBody "RED BALL EXPRESS 1952This Universal International production is about a lesser known part of the battle for France after DDay. After slogging it out with the German Army in Normandy for 6 weeks. The Allies have broken out of the bridgehead and are pursuing the Germans across France. The British and Canadians battle north towards Antwerp and its vital port. The Americans give chase across France to the retreating Germans. Until the port at Antwerp is captured and put into service the further the Army advances the further the supplies must travel to reach the front.The RED BALL EXPRESS is the story of the men who fixed the supply issue. The Army rounded up as many trucks as possible over 5000 along with drivers and had the supplies moving 247.Jeff Chandler is a Lt. in charge of a small part of the Red Ball Express. He was a truck driver in civilian life. His men include Charles Drake Bubber Johnson Hugh O'Brian Davis Roberts Jack Kelly Sidney Poitier and Alex Nicol. There is tension right from the start between unit Sgt Nicol and Chandler. The two know each other from the States. Nicol also a trucker blames Chandler for his brother's death in a truck crash.The trucks are loaded and sent off on the 200 plus mile trip to the front outside Paris. The men are warned to keep their weapons handy as they could run into pockets of German troops along the route. This happens and men are killed. There is a brisk firefight and the convoy moves on.Now being a 1950's film the makers throw in some female types.

	onyx:emotionText "RED BALL EXPRESS 1952This Universal International production is about a lesser known part of the battle for France after DDay. After slogging it out with the German Army in Normandy for 6 weeks. The Allies have broken out of the bridgehead and are pursuing the Germans across France. The British and Canadians battle north towards Antwerp and its vital port. The Americans give chase across France to the retreating Germans. Until the port at Antwerp is captured and put into service the further the Army advances the further the supplies must travel to reach the front.The RED BALL EXPRESS is the story of the men who fixed the supply issue. The Army rounded up as many trucks as possible over 5000 along with drivers and had the supplies moving 247.Jeff Chandler is a Lt. in charge of a small part of the Red Ball Express. He was a truck driver in civilian life. His men include Charles Drake Bubber Johnson Hugh O'Brian Davis Roberts Jack Kelly Sidney Poitier and Alex Nicol. There is tension right from the start between unit Sgt Nicol and Chandler. The two know each other from the States. Nicol also a trucker blames Chandler for his brother's death in a truck crash.The trucks are loaded and sent off on the 200 plus mile trip to the front outside Paris. The men are warned to keep their weapons handy as they could run into pockets of German troops along the route. This happens and men are killed. There is a brisk firefight and the convoy moves on.Now being a 1950's film the makers throw in some female types. There is a pair of Red Cross workers Cindy Garner Judith Braun as well as French lass Jacqueline Duval.The trucks are manned by two man crews that spell each other during the trip. Once offloaded they head back to the beach outside Cherbourg. More supplies then back on the road to the front. A lack of sleep soon causes a number of wrecks.

That everything moves on a commerce. That war is a commerce. It's the delivery of the goods to the points of consumption that is everything. Almost nothing else matters because if soldiers and tanks didn't have ammo and gas there's no action. Everything in this world is the same way.This kind of organized mobility decides the outcome of the war. America had good commander to realize this and tactical minds to put it into action.

	schema:reviewBody "The setup in case you don't already know it is this. The troops of the western Allies were bottle necked in Normandy France for the first month or so after the DDay landings. The armies finally broke through the German defenses and Gen. George Patton's Third Army rapidly advanced across central and northern France. So rapidly that they outpaced their supply lines. The U.S. Army put together a truck convoy system to keep Patton's forces supplied and named it the Red Ball Express. Aside from managing to keep up with Patton's advance the outfit is also noted for being one of the few integrated units in the U.S. armed forces at the timeI use the term integrated somewhat guardedly since that usually meant white senior officers leading black junior officers and enlisted men which is not what would first come to my mind as integrated. Regardless around 75 of the servicemen in the Red Ball Express were African Americans.You wouldn't know that from this movie where the ratio seems to have been reversed. However I'm willing to give the filmmakers some credit for at least trying to address the integration issue at the time when they were working rather than castigate them for not doing what we might expect a presentmoment filmmaker to do. That's not the real problem with this movie as a movie. Acting is not the problem with this movie either as another reviewer suggested. The acting is workmanlikeneither outstanding nor poor just efficient. No the weakness of this movie is that it is simply another clichridden war movie blame not the messengers but rather the script. First there is the clichd unit. Our two lead characters have a troubled past and surprise surprise are forced to work together in the same outfit of all the gin joints in all the towns . ... The unit has a romantic it has a runt of the litter with glasses it has a stolid misunderstood commander it has a guy clearly from Brooklyn and so forth. Just like any other war movie of the day think of say Air Force or Guadalcanal Diary. What's new here for the time is that the filmmakers exchanged African Americans for some of the other stereotypical roster of average Americans you got in any war movie. Notably there are NO characters who are clearly supposed to be white Southernersan omission that itself speaks volumes about how sensitive race relations were in the early 1950s in the U.S. and especially in the thenrecently desegregated U.S. armed forces.The clichd unit is indicative of the rest of the flick. You've seen this movie before. Bunch of misfits forced to work together overcome their differences and become a cohesive fighting unitwell except here I never really got the sense we were watching an outfit of misfits. Yes there's the guy with the racial issue vs. Sidney Poitier and yes there's the lead characters with the troubled pastone of whom is the main stumbling block that's keeping this outfit from fully coming together what's that you say? That setup sounds like Flying Tigers? no wait Sands of Iwo Jima? no wait . . .but the movie is in too much of hurry to get this outfit on the road to really show how this outfit becomes a team. Essentially it just is. What else you ask? How about the sweettalking American and the saucy French girl? Rivalry with another outfit with other outfit finally recognizing our heroes are indeed Heroes? The guys who think there mission is going to be a cakewalk only to discover the Harsh Reality Of War? Etc. etc.Oh the movie is solid enough and hits all the standard pointssome action some down time some roughhousing a romantic moment or two some grousing some let's pull together timeand some of the cast members are likable enough that all told you won't feel like you wasted your time watching this one. However aside from the thentimely touch of trying to show an integrated outfit there's nothing here to see you haven't seen before.".

Even after 60 years it is fresh and relevant because it tells about life the way it was in World War II as experienced by people of the era in a way that is credible.We get a good mix of the workmanship of war combined with down time and deadly time. Chandler plays the officer who realizes how dangerous it is to be lax as one might be when 98 of your duty is simply workmanship like driving loading and unloading supply trucks. It is the unforeseeen incident that gets you. It is being unready. It is the fluke or freak occurrence that will be deadly.We have a star studded cast here fairly common for old war films but impossible for the twentyfirst century simply because of the dilution of movie making. Not that dilution is bad but it's simply the fact that if everyone and his cousin is making a movie then there are millions of actors and thus no way for more than a few dozen to ever gain the sort of fame that hundreds of actors used to have.The integration was splendid in this film and believable. The white and black troopers behaved and spoke in a way that made you think they were from the mid twentieth century.This is hard to do today. It is done today but it is hard to sell that concept today. However one must remember one thing in making World War II movies. If one makes it for the lingo of the era as this film does then it always remains true and credible. If one makes it for the lingo of 1990 or 2000 it will get a huge following for that generation but in 80 years it will be scoffed at by later generations while films like Red Ball Express continue to stick around.The acting is great and the characters are great. Each character brings his own story to the screen so we have many subplots. There are 3 major ones each involving the major stars.The subplots are handled well and while the one with Chandler and Nicol is over the top it is dramatic and theatrical and well handled.Chandler was the big star at the time. O'Brien is a minor mainstay somehow always remaining a recognizable individual that is rare for leading man types. Poitier is a legend with Lillies Heat Dinner and Bedford insuring his status. Drake will always remain a mainstay as a player of lovable rogues. This may be his best role as he pretty much steals the show. Alex Nicol is the wild card. Films like this Then There Were Three and The Man From Laramie will go back and forth to and from classic status and he will be a huge name in classic film a hundred years from now. He probably never realized this while he was making B budget movies.".

	schema:headline " The Men of the Red Ball Express Deserved Better";
	schema:reviewBody "Budd Boetticher made his share of good movies during his distinguished 30year plus career in Hollywood. Mostly he is remembered for his Randolph Scott westerns in the 1950s. The Red Ball Express qualifies as one of his lesser efforts. Mind you this historic epic during World War II when the American military endeavored to keep General George Patton supplied with fuel and ammunition deserved cinematic treatment. Unfortunately this sturdy Aaron Rosenberg production featuring a screenplay by John Michael Hayes Marcy Klauber and William Grady Jr. trivializes this event with standard issue heroics. Jeff Chandler stars as Lieutenant Chick Campbell as the officer in charge of delivering part of Patton's desperately needed supplies. Alex Nicol costars as Campbell's Sergeant Red Kallek. These two guys are enemies from the start. Before they entered the U.S. Army Chick and Red drove trucks hauling gasoline over dangerous terrain. Red's brother rode with Chick in a truck that turned over and blew up. The way that Chick tells it he was hurled from the vehicle and rendered unconscious by the blow while Red's brother died terribly in the ensuing fire.

Antoinette's grateful family gives him the last of their food and Partridge pledges to replay their kindness twice over.

	onyx:emotionText "Budd Boetticher made his share of good movies during his distinguished 30year plus career in Hollywood. Mostly he is remembered for his Randolph Scott westerns in the 1950s. The Red Ball Express qualifies as one of his lesser efforts. Mind you this historic epic during World War II when the American military endeavored to keep General George Patton supplied with fuel and ammunition deserved cinematic treatment. Unfortunately this sturdy Aaron Rosenberg production featuring a screenplay by John Michael Hayes Marcy Klauber and William Grady Jr. trivializes this event with standard issue heroics. Jeff Chandler stars as Lieutenant Chick Campbell as the officer in charge of delivering part of Patton's desperately needed supplies. Alex Nicol costars as Campbell's Sergeant Red Kallek. These two guys are enemies from the start. Before they entered the U.S. Army Chick and Red drove trucks hauling gasoline over dangerous terrain. Red's brother rode with Chick in a truck that turned over and blew up. The way that Chick tells it he was hurled from the vehicle and rendered unconscious by the blow while Red's brother died terribly in the ensuing fire. Red has never forgiven Campbell for this accident. He feels strongly that Chick could have saved his brother's life so the sergeant smolders with rage over this injustice. This conflict between the two leading men threatens to destroy their efficiency as they work against time to get the goods to Patton. These two guys eventually overcome their hatred for each other because duty to Uncle Sam comes first. This trivial clash overshadows the miracle of the Red Ball Express. This massive effort extended over 80 days with almost 6thousand truck carrying over 12hundred tons of supplies on a daily basis. This drive originated from the port facilities at Antwerp Belgium and plowed deep into France after the triumphant Allied invasion at Normandy on sixth June 1944.

The completely nondescript directorial style with its continual falling back on uninspired closeups would seem to betray the director as a dross inthepan recruit from TV who after this failure had deservedly returned to the dregs of anonymity from which he came. Yet the credits say the film was directed by Budd Boetticher. Well that's a smack in the eye for the French critics but I suppose they will still be able to find the film bursting with significant themes. Yeah. It's got themes all right and such themes  all of them straight from the Hollywood hoke factory. The lieutenant in charge of this squad is a real tough disciplinarian see but....

In any event guess what happens at the climax? Blow me down if the sergeant is not involved in a similar accident and this time the lieutenant... And then there's this Negro corporal who thinks the lieutenant is prejudiced against the black folks whereas in actual fact.... And guess what happens when one of the trucks has a slight accident? There's this gorgeous French dish see who just happens to be standing right on that actual spot way out in the middle of nowhere.... Yeah this film has themes all right and for my money the French movie critics are welcome to every one of them.Still these significant themes are punctuated with a bit of action now and again. and the film has been produced on a surprisingly expansive budget with a large cast of secondstring players some of whom are now quite wellknown though their admirers are not going to thank anyone for reviving these early efforts. Production credits are capable but aside from the fairly spectacular fire climax undistinguished.OTHER VIEWS I wasn't very interested in Red Ball Express. I liked Jeff Chandler but not war films. My own experience of the war is still too recent for me. I don't want any more mud filth and bloodshed. And I don't like to make a film where the lead character is not master of his own destiny.

It involves a bunch of civilian truck drivers drafted into Uncle Sam's army in 1944 and it's those men who keep the allied front lines supplied . It's a rather predictable story of Americans fighting against Germans and where you think the most likable guy in the squad has bought the farm only for them to appear minutes later alive and well . Like I said very predictable I guess somewhere the producers wanted to point out  Though this would probably be known to an American audience in 1952  why every American war film made at the time always revolved around white American soldiers fighting . This was because the American army was segregated until 1947 and with very few exceptions black Americans didn't serve in the front lines . Despite the producers wanting to speak up fr the Black American war effort it looks painfully dated now since the blacks have lovely singing voices and sing in unison about beating Hitler which comes across as being very stereotypical and highly patronising and I doubt if a studio would be able to get away with this nowadays . Thankfully it serves to remind a wider audience in the 21st Century why war movie GIs are almost always white".

The director is Raoul Walsh whose westerns were always above average. Rock Hudson is very good as J. Wesley Hardin a man that could not keep out of trouble so there is no lack of action here. Julie Adams is at her best more sexy than usual. Only after I saw the credits did I notice John McIntire played a a dual role the strict and often cruel father and the good hearted uncle. It is wonderful to see Lee Van Cleef as the tough bad guy. For those who enjoyed the westerns of the fifties this Universal release is a great experience. It is an unusual western the story told from an outlaw's point of view in flashback. When Hardin wounded is talking to his son it reminded me of the last scene of The Gunfighter1950.

Almost immediately he kills a local gunslinger and plunges into the life of a rootin tootin cowboy gambler and outlaw.It has a classic opening a dignified man walking out of the prison gates shaking hands with the warden and sniffing the air of freedom.  It has an equally recognisable ending back at the ranch to see how his wife and family have managed during the long years of incarceration.The final scenes of the film are lovely it won't spoil the film to say he learned from his experiences and lived a long and happy life.There is nothing new in this film. Although it claims to be an autobiography it is one of countless 1950's Westerns with a theme of a young man seeking adventure and finding redemption. The real strength of the movie is its star Rock Hudson barrel chested and manly who shoots rides kisses gambles and drinks as well as any of his contemporaries.  One of the baddies is a young Lee Van Cleef who easily steals scenes from his fellow wrongdoers.It won't change your life the way Shane might have done but it won't hurt you to watch it and to remember Rock Hudson in the way he should be remembered.".

One of the baddies is a young Lee Van Cleef who easily steals scenes from his fellow wrongdoers.It won't change your life the way Shane might have done but it won't hurt you to watch it and to remember Rock Hudson in the way he should be remembered.";

	schema:reviewBody "Many motion pictures work on two levels  the way they read and the way they look. This is especially true of Bmovies in the 1950s when the studios would buy any old pulp screenplay and allocate a minimal budget with recycled sets and costumes and yet turn over total creative control to a seasoned and professional director who used to be a big shot. This was the situation with virtually every Raoul Walsh picture from this period. He'd long since had his day and his bosses gave him little more than turkeymaterial to shoot and yet he continued to imbue every picture with the intensity and romanticism that had always been his hallmark.The Lawless Breed supposedly chronicles the career of reallife outlaw John Wesley Hardin. It announces itself as the result of new research and just as they used to say in Police Squad only the facts have been changed. Hardin's two love interests the names of people he killed the number of children he had not to mention his general character are all completely made up. Writers William Alland and Bernard Gordon have essentially invented a fictional character and given him Hardin's name. But the point of this is not to tell it as it really happened  this is a classic Western after all. The point is to give you a picture of the Old West and a typical Western hero as posterity has remembered them.And this is what makes it the sort of project Walsh would really get his teeth into. For Walsh there was romance and nostalgia in the open plain. Look at how he begins the picture with rather confined shots of the town with foreground business and buildings bordering the frame. Then when we cut to Hardin's childhood we are hit with the beauty of the wide open spaces. As opposed to the yellows and browns of your average Technicolor horse opera this is an abundantly green West and Walsh seems to have worked closely with cinematographer Irving Glassberg and art directors Bernard Herzbrun and Richard Riedel to bring this tone to the fore. Green here represents freedom hope and the good life and it either covers the screen or retreats to a distant corner as appropriate even worked in as a reminder during indoor scenes such as the tree outside the window when he visits Jane by night. In his monochrome pictures Walsh would often use lighting to chart the hero's rise and fall They Died with their Boots on 1941 is a good example and here he uses colour to the same effect. The bold greens give a warm and homely feel to Hardin's cherished dream of a farm and whenever he drifts away from that dream we turn to stark offwhites.In the leading role Rock Hudson is a middling success. He's just too steady and selfassured to convince as the young hotheaded outlaw. On the other hand he develops very well into the older and wiser Hardin and as he would later show in Giant 1956 his forte seems to have been playing middleaged. As is typical in a Walsh Western the rest of the cast are an appropriately motley bunch with no shortage of dusty faces and grizzly whiskers. Even though their performances aren't exactly outstanding John McIntire hits the right notes in his dual role as Hardin's father and uncle and Julie Adams is tough and unglamorous enough to portray both the saloon lass she starts out as and country wife she becomes. Also worth a mention is a young Lee Van Cleef in one of his numerous thirdbaddieontheleft appearances before he became a big star in Italy. Although Hugh O'Brien is ostensibly the leader of the Hanley clan it's clear Van Cleef's menacing presence was being noticed as he is given all the most threatening lines and bits of macho business.There's no escaping the fact however that as written The Lawless Breed is a rather lacklustre affair. The dialogue throughout is either corny or simply dull. A setpiece like Hardin continuing to play cards after being given an hour to get out of town doesn't seem able to decide whether it is being played for tension or for laughs. And yet there is a precious handful of moments which Walsh has been able to stage with pure and compelling visuals such as the confrontation with the Hanleys on a windswept street or the ageing hero's bittersweet return to his home and family and these are absolutely stunning. And such is Walsh's devotion to the feel of the picture even the most boring of scenes looks nice and fits in with the tone of the whole piece. The story may be a poorlywritten roughshod ride over the truth but in its imagery The Lawless Breed has a beauty that is engaging and sincere.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lawless Breed The 1953  out of 4 Solid Western has John Wesley Hardin Rock Hudson walking out of prison and handing over a book with his life story in it. A publisher then reads the story which starts as a young Hardin battles with his preacher father John McIntire and soon he's on his own and on the run from the law. If it's history you're after then you will want to stay away from this film as it turns the coldblooded killer into a misunderstood nice guy and the film even goes as far as to change a reallife ending apparently test screenings didn't like the truth. With that said if it's entertainment you're after then this here is a real gem as we get to see the young Hudson in his first topbilled performance. It was smart for Universal to surround him with some great character actors but to also put a veteran like Walsh on the film. We're dealt a pretty typical story in terms of Westerns but Walsh brings some nice style to the production and certainly keeps it moving a lot better than it deserves. One of the best moments in the film happens early on as Hardin is about to get in a shoot out with a large gust of wind blows dust all over the place making it hard to see what's going to happen. This was a wonderful little sequence as was the made up ending. What really keeps the film moving are some wonderful performances by the starstudded cast. Hudson is terrific in the lead role and you can view this and see why he would become a major star. The character has some dark moments which the actor captures just fine but the sweet side is where Hudson really shines. He really does make this a complete character and makes Hardin someone to care for. Julie Adams plays the woman he eventually marries and does a nice job even though she doesn't have much to do. The Hanley family are the ones Hardin does battle with early on and we have Lee Van Cleef Glenn Strange and Hugh O'Brian playing the brothers. McIntire Forrest Lewis and Richard Garland also turn in fine performances. We even get a young Dennis Weaver in a small role. Once again those who are wanting a history lesson are going to hate this film due to have many facts it twists and turns but either way the movie is solid entertainment that has enough going for it to make it worth seeing.".

If it's history you're after then you will want to stay away from this film as it turns the coldblooded killer into a misunderstood nice guy and the film even goes as far as to change a reallife ending apparently test screenings didn't like the truth. With that said if it's entertainment you're after then this here is a real gem as we get to see the young Hudson in his first topbilled performance. It was smart for Universal to surround him with some great character actors but to also put a veteran like Walsh on the film. We're dealt a pretty typical story in terms of Westerns but Walsh brings some nice style to the production and certainly keeps it moving a lot better than it deserves. One of the best moments in the film happens early on as Hardin is about to get in a shoot out with a large gust of wind blows dust all over the place making it hard to see what's going to happen. This was a wonderful little sequence as was the made up ending. What really keeps the film moving are some wonderful performances by the starstudded cast. Hudson is terrific in the lead role and you can view this and see why he would become a major star. The character has some dark moments which the actor captures just fine but the sweet side is where Hudson really shines. He really does make this a complete character and makes Hardin someone to care for. Julie Adams plays the woman he eventually marries and does a nice job even though she doesn't have much to do. The Hanley family are the ones Hardin does battle with early on and we have Lee Van Cleef Glenn Strange and Hugh O'Brian playing the brothers. McIntire Forrest Lewis and Richard Garland also turn in fine performances. We even get a young Dennis Weaver in a small role. Once again those who are wanting a history lesson are going to hate this film due to have many facts it twists and turns but either way the movie is solid entertainment that has enough going for it to make it worth seeing.";

If I was watching this on a DVD instead of Encore Westerns I certainly would have replayed it to hear again.The Lawless Breed is loosely based on the life of Western outlaw John Wesley Hardin. I'm no expert but the way he's portrayed here makes him out to be a somewhat misunderstood hero all the while attempting to stay one step ahead of the law. Even in this picture the number of his selfdefense victims seemed to challenge the law of averages and it's probably safe to say that the real Hardin with over forty dead men to his credit probably killed a few of them under questionable circumstances.Rock Hudson who I generally wouldn't call to mind as a Western movie hero comports himself well enough in the film's lead role. However his age and matine good looks probably work against the picture's credibility as the character he was portraying was supposed to be only about twenty years old at the beginning of the story. Likewise he seemed to get over Jane Brown's Mary Castle death rather quickly conveniently having saloon gal Rosie Julie Adams to run off with when the heat was on.At least the picture had some of the high points of the historical Hardin's life correct. In 1874 he killed Deputy Sheriff Charlie Webb in Comanche Texas. Using the alias John Swain he did open a grocery store but in Gainesville Florida not Polland Alabama. For Hardin it was a quick line of work as he was recognized on the very first day his store was open by a couple of cattlemen. As the movie depicts he was captured by the Texas Rangers spent time in Huntsville Prison and was pardoned after roughly fifteen years. However he used his prison time to study law and actually became a lawyer upon release. His practice floundered though prompting him to write his autobiography. On August 9th 1895 John Wesley Hardin was shot by a lawman with a grudge an event the film makers wouldn't put Rock Hudson through with his leading man charisma and future star potential.".

The movie does come up with a bunch of upandcoming supporting players like Van Cleef Weaver Ansaratoo bad they don't get more screen time. Then too McIntire's unusual dual role both with Old Testament beards had me confused until I consulted IMDb. I expect there's a backstory to this duplicate casting. Producer Alland went from here to producing some of the most entertaining scifi of the decade e.g. It Came from Outer Space 1953 Creature from the Black Lagoon 1954.

In the Hardin role Solid Rock Hudson blacks out most of the screen while he exhibits an amazing ability to read the script's dreary purplelaced dialogue from the idiot board without giving the game away by moving his eyes but charismatic he most certainly is not. Nor is hammy John McIntire the least bit convincing as Hardin's biblebashing dad. Unfortunately many of the better players such as Lee Van Cleef Buddy Roosevelt and Dick Wessel are lost in tiny roles. In all it's mighty hard to believe that this dreary movie was so leadenly directed by Raoul Walsh who did such a magnificent job with 1951's The Enforcer.".

	schema:headline " Thoroughly Average Oater About John Wesley Hardin with a TopNotch Cast.";
	schema:reviewBody "Rock Hudson made his starring debut in Raoul Walsh's western saga The Lawless Breed about the life of notorious gunman John Wesley Hardin. Circus World Bernard Gordon penned the screenplay ostensibly based on Hardin's autobiography. Hudson delivers a robust performance even to the point of playing Hardin as an older man. Nevertheless not even a veteran director like Walsh who knew his way around oaters could do much for this solemn rather dreary affair about the evils of lawlessness. The supporting cast is good especially John McIntire who plays a duo role and Julia Adams plays Hardin's dancehall girl wife. Glenn Strange Hugh O'Brien and Lee Van Cleef are a devilish trio that dog Hardin for the first halfhour until things settle down. The second half deals with Hardin being imprisoned for his crimes.The Lawless Breed opens at the state penitentiary in Huntsville Texas as an older but wiser John Wesley Hardin Rock Hudson of Bend of the River leaves jail Sentenced to 25 years Hardin has been paroled after 16 years. Before he climbs aboard a train to take him back to Alabama and his horse breeding ranch Hardin stops off at the local newspaper office. He gives the editor a copy of his handwritten autobiography and asks him to read it and get back to him. Consequently The Lawless Breed reverts from a chronological sequence of events to a flashback and remains that way for most of its 83 minutes.During the first half we learn that John Wesley is a reckless boy who doesn't get along with his preacher of a father that loves to wield a bullwhip on his son. Wes Hardin's father was a preacher and a circuit rider. According to Wes his father was a strong Godfearing man who carried his Bible like a sixgun and fought with the devil wherever he found him. When his intolerant father discovers that his son has purchased a revolver from his winnings at poker he whips him and then storms out of the barn. An orphan who lost her family during the Civil War Jane Brown Mary Castle has been living with the Hardins and cooking for them. Wes and she grew up together and he calls her as the prettiest girl in Texas. Wes promises Jane that he wants to get a place of their own with green grass water that runs all year around and a white painted house.Later that evening after curfew Wes rides into Bonham to sell his law books after his father has given him a whipping. He sits in on a card game with three fellows among them Gus Hanley and beats them. Gus objects that he didn't deal him a certain card. Gus Michael Ansara of Soldiers Three pulls his pistol but Wes beats him on the draw and kills him. Holding the shotguntoting barkeeper at bay Wes exits with his winnings. No sooner does he leave the saloon than he runs into trouble from the army of occupation. The Yankee troops try to corner him in town but he eludes them. Gus' three brothers Ben Glenn Stranger of House of Frankenstein Ike Hugh O'Brien of Red Ball Express and Dirk Lee Van Cleef of High Noon show up to claim Gus' corpse. The U.S. Army vows to bring John Wesley to trial. Dirk steps forward and warns the army officer. Mister you ain't going' to need no witnesses Dirk stipulates 'cause there ain't going to be no trial. After he escapes from Bonham Wes rides out to his Uncle John's ranch. John Clements is half brother to John Wesley's father. Wes joins Clements and his sons Jim Dennis Weaver of Gunsmoke and Joe Richard Garland on a cattle drive to Abilene. The Hanleys Brothers trail Wes to Abilene and Wes kills Dirk in a gunfight. Walsh stages this brief shootout in a way bolsters the drama because the wind is blowing hard and objects attached to the surrounding buildings are making a lot of noise. Afterward Wes resumes gambling in the saloon while he awaits the completion of a wedding dress for Jane. Wild Bill Hickok Robert Anderson of High School Hellcats gets the drop on Wes but Wes outfoxes the legendary lawman and Hickok allows him to stay in town for an hour.An hour later Wes pulls out and returns to his father's ranch. Jane refuses to elope with Wes because she has promised Wes' father that he will marry them. Wes' father refuses to marry them until Wes is cleared of killing the Hanleys. The Army is pulling out and J.C. Hardin calls on a judge to clear things up. Wes agrees to turn himself in but Ike prods a lawman Sheriff Charlie Webb George Eldredge of Dead Reckoning into arresting Wes. When Wes resists arrest Webb shoots him in the back. Wes kills him and Ike Hanley and heads back to his father's ranch. Jane refuses to have anything to do with Wes because he is a killer. The posse shows up at the Hardin ranch. The wounded Wes manages to escape but one of the posse kills Jane by accident. Hardin and his new girlfriend settle in Alabama under assumed names and live peacefully until certain Texans decide that Hardin must be found at any cost and incarcerated. Hardin receives a 25year sentence but the governor releases him after 16 years.Presumably Universal Studios didn't give The Lawless Breed a big budget because there are no major setpieces. The narrative plays out in saloons ranches and on the trail but there aren't any sprawling scenes of carnage etc. Formulaic pretty much summarizes the narrative. John Wesley is presented as a man wronged for a murder that he did not commit. His youthful vigor got him into later trouble and somebody in his life important to him died when a posse attacked his home.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I received a DVD from Netflix with this film and The Cimarron Kid on it I wondered why I'd placed this disk on my queue. After all I am not a huge fan of westerns and the films appeared pretty unremarkable. However when I noticed both films were directed by Budd Boetticher I remembered that THIS was why I'd put these films on my list many months earlier. Boetticher was a wonderful director who managed to make his westerns better than the normwith stories that lack many of the usual clichs.This film is set during the war for Texas independence from Mexico in the mid1830s. Soon after the film begins you see a brief recreation of the Battle of the Alamo. Just before the compound is overrun the commander has the married men draw lotsthe one selected will sneak away from the fort and look after the families left behind. Glen Ford is the one chosen but when he arrives home he learns that his family had been murdered. And people begin to talk and think he was a coward since he leftthough he was following orders. And now that the battle is over he's going to use all his energy tracking down the gang dressed as Mexicans responsible for his family's deaths. So he infiltrates a gang...hoping to find out who is ultimately responsible.The film is helped by having some good support for Ford. Neville Brand one of the scariest looking heavies in film history Victor Jory Hugh O'Brian and Chill Wills all are available to provide nice color and good old dependable acting. And Boetticher at the helm sure didn't hurt either. Together they are able to take an okay story and make it a lot better than it should have been. While it's not as good as the BoetticherRandolph Scott collaborations it's quite good.By the way they did NOT have revolvers and repeating rifles back then. The very first guns of these types were not yet available until AFTER this war and really were very rare until well into the Civil War. All too often I have seen Hollywood mess up this detailperhaps because it would be less exciting to see everyone stop to reload after each shot...and because reloading would take at least 30 seconds and quite possibly more. But unfortunately that IS how they would have fought in the old days. And by the way the inexperienced women in the film managed to reload in about five secondssomething even the best soldiers never could have accomplished at the time!".

	schema:reviewBody "As the war for Texas independence heightens the Alamo has become a critical point of time buying interest. Fearing their families will perish under the might of the marauding Mexican army the men of the Alamo draw lots to see which one of them will flee the Alamo battle to steer the respective families out of harms way. John Stroud is the man faced with the task but upon reaching his destinations he finds he's too late to save anyone. However this is just the start of his worries as he finds he has been branded a coward for leaving the Alamo where all have now perished while his attempts to avenge the murder of his family are beset with problems at every turn.In truth no great shakes in the Western genre here and certainly not even close to being amongst the better work of director Budd Boetticher The Tall T  Comanche Station or Glenn Ford The Big Heat  Blackboard Jungle. It's also not high on production value and doesn't have location vitality to give it an earthy sheen it still however manages to be an entertaining piece putting an interesting offshoot to the Alamo legend. Glenn Ford is a watchable star at the best of times and he manages to keep this picture afloat by putting a bit of cool bravado urgency into the role of John Stroud with dashes of emotional fortitude his relationship with the young recently orphaned Carlos gives the film its emotional weight and when that sits alongside the usual array of shoot them up sequences it makes for good honest Western fare.Of the supporting cast Chill Wills and Neville Brand put in some fine work while there has been far far worse female leads in this genre than the radiant Julie Adams. Of Boetticher's direction? It's just about adequate where working within the confines of the lot and it's lowly budget origins he manages to pull it thru but in truth probably himself cringed at some of the final night time sequences in the cut. He of course a couple of years down the line would go on to direct some of the best genre pieces on the market so he owes the genre fan very little all told. So good and bad here folks with the good far outweighing the technically bad deficiencies on offer. But I mean come on now if you can't enjoy Ford having a good old punch up on the brink of a waterfall? Well you're probably better off not watching a 50s B movie Western in the first place then. 6.510".

	onyx:emotionText "As the war for Texas independence heightens the Alamo has become a critical point of time buying interest. Fearing their families will perish under the might of the marauding Mexican army the men of the Alamo draw lots to see which one of them will flee the Alamo battle to steer the respective families out of harms way. John Stroud is the man faced with the task but upon reaching his destinations he finds he's too late to save anyone. However this is just the start of his worries as he finds he has been branded a coward for leaving the Alamo where all have now perished while his attempts to avenge the murder of his family are beset with problems at every turn.In truth no great shakes in the Western genre here and certainly not even close to being amongst the better work of director Budd Boetticher The Tall T  Comanche Station or Glenn Ford The Big Heat  Blackboard Jungle. It's also not high on production value and doesn't have location vitality to give it an earthy sheen it still however manages to be an entertaining piece putting an interesting offshoot to the Alamo legend. Glenn Ford is a watchable star at the best of times and he manages to keep this picture afloat by putting a bit of cool bravado urgency into the role of John Stroud with dashes of emotional fortitude his relationship with the young recently orphaned Carlos gives the film its emotional weight and when that sits alongside the usual array of shoot them up sequences it makes for good honest Western fare.Of the supporting cast Chill Wills and Neville Brand put in some fine work while there has been far far worse female leads in this genre than the radiant Julie Adams.

	schema:headline " Superior Glen FordBud Boetticher western with complex web of ironies";
	schema:reviewBody "Glen Ford as Texan settler John Stroud finds himself threatened with death by 3 opposing groups during the fight for Texas independence from Mexico his only apparent friend an orphan Mexican boy the only survivor of a raid by American renegades dressed as Mexicans who killed Stroud's family and burned his house. Stroud was one of the American defenders holed up inside the crumbling Alamo mission being used as a fort until he drew the black bean used to decide who would try to ride through the Mexican lines to lead the families around his farm in a retreat. But he discovered that the renegades had already destroyed everything before he got there. The Mexican boy decides to 'adopt' Stroud as his new father but when they go to town the people figure out that he is the man who quit the Alamo thus he is labeled a notorious coward. His association with the boy further suggests to them a proMexican stance.The screenplay is very tightly constructed and includes a complex web of ironies which is one of the main selling point of the film. For example the renegades unwittingly saved Stroud's life twice 1 the report of their proximity to some settlements caused Stroud to leave the Alamo thus saving his life 2 Later the renegades save Stroud from an imminent lynching by the enraged town people. This was an incidental result of their attack on the town with the goal of robbing the bank and freeing one of their members from jail. Stroud professes his desire to join them but they don't really trust him. Thus he engages in several fist fights with them the last leaving him presumably dead after tumbling down a long rocky slope. But  he is found by searching members of the fleeing townies plus cavalry protectors and after recovering he organizes the defense of the seemingly defenseless townies minus their men after the cavalry unit receives orders to immediately join Houston at San Jacinto. The women kids old men and Stroud manage to annihilate the renegades using borrowed cavalry firearms. Thus Stroud achieves his revenge and resurrects his reputation as a brave and smart man.Chill Wills and the other townies along with Hugh O'Brian as commander of the cavalry unit want to lynch Stroud when he refuses to vacate the region. Ironically Wills is later pressured by BethJulie Adams into doctoring the unconscious Stroud after his long tumble against an overriding sentiment to let Stroud die. Again ironically O'Brian's troops soon thereafter are called to abandon the wagon train and join Houston. Initially O'Brian refuses to obey but Stroud convinces him that he can lead an effective defense of the wagon train. Thus the man they wanted to kill a short time before becomes their savior. Stroud effectively rescued the Mexican boy from starvation. but the association of the boy with Stroud increases the perception of Stroud as proMexican thus increasing the call to lynch him. The boy tries to tell the others why Stroud really left the Alamo which Stroud inexplicably refuses to do. But initially he is disbelieved. Later the boy saves Stroud's life by leading a search for him after he tumbled down that hill and insisting that Wills try to revive Stroud. Also he corroborates Stroud's statement why he left the Alamo thus diffusing a renewed demand by the fleeing townies to kill Stroud. At the end the implication is that Stroud the boy and Beth will form a new family.The biggest weakness of the screenplay is the extreme reaction of some of the Alamo defenders and of the townspeople to Stroud's leaving the Alamo and his curious refusal to adequately explain why he did so until late in the film. Also Stroud recovered awfully quickly from his long tumble down that hill and his being found by the boy is unlikely.Ford's character is very loosely based on the disputed historical fact or legend that one manMoses Rose chose to leave the Alamo when given a choice. He said he saw no reason to stay and die in a hopeless defense. Thus he was labeled a coward. Unlike the portrayal of Houston's attitude toward defending the Alamo the historic Houston sent Bowie with instructions to remove the cannon and destroy the makeshift fort as being indefensible! While at the Alamo Stroud risks his life to reraise the Texas flag on the wall while under cannon bombardment. The scenes of Mexican cannon bombardment are pretty cheesy.Only some of the firearms are the historicallyrelevant flint locks. The use of repeating firearms speeds up the gunplay for the audience. Yes the women reloaded their muskets impossibly fast! Also an obvious photocopy of President Hayes187680 should have been removed from the jail wall!Several of the renegade actors took impressive bodyslamming falls when shot off their horse or their horse was shot. Also Victor Jory as the head renegade Jess Wade takes quite a plunge down a waterfall. I don't see how this could have been faked. The assumption is that Wade drowned. However it looks survivable to me assuming a deep plunge pool.Presently part of the Classic Western roundup Vol. 2 DVD set along with The Texans California and The Cimarron Kid".

He then goes to the town of Franklin where he learns that The Alamo has fallen and all have been killed. He also learns that the town has branded him a coward for deserting the fighting and want to string him up when Lt.

My only problem is that this wasn't shot in widescreen.As far as the supporting cast goes Chill Wills is always fun to watch while the incredibly beautiful Julie Adams is always fun to look at and Neville Brand delivers some great macho swaggering villainy that easily overshadows the more subdued Victor Jory.On the other hand I can't quite understand the Golden Globe win by Hugh O'Brian. He's okay but slightly bland as Ford's main accuser.".

	onyx:emotionText "Drawing straws or in this case beans Texas patriot Glenn Ford is picked to leave the Alamo in order to evacuate his and his neighbor's families only to find them all dead at the hands of marauders and himself branded a coward.Starting with a fairly colorful lowbudget Alamo siege shot on a soundstage! this is pretty compelling all the way with an excellent hardboiled performance from Ford and nice direction from the great Budd Boetticher one of the best unsung western filmmakers ever.This is almost as good as Boetticher's later collaborations with Randolph Scott. My only problem is that this wasn't shot in widescreen.As far as the supporting cast goes Chill Wills is always fun to watch while the incredibly beautiful Julie Adams is always fun to look at and Neville Brand delivers some great macho swaggering villainy that easily overshadows the more subdued Victor Jory.On the other hand I can't quite understand the Golden Globe win by Hugh O'Brian. He's okay but slightly bland as Ford's main accuser.";

Budd Boetticher got good performances out of his cast which besides those mentioned include Julie Adams. Hugh O'Brian Neville Brand and Chill Wills who as we all know was in John Wayne's blockbuster film on the same subject.The film is very similar to a lot of the westerns that Boetticher did with Randolph Scott and I wouldn't be surprised if the film wasn't created with Randy in mind originally for the lead.

	schema:reviewBody "Deserving of its obscurity The Man From the Alamo 1953 is probably Director Budd Boetticher's weakest Western and Glenn Ford's weakest film. While not actually horrible it is not something to seek out for exciting entertainment or for a showcase of the talent of those two Hollywood immortals. It's another of those lame historical fiction stories that would be at least tolerable if the names and places had been changed to protect the innocent. In fairness the film would have been easier to take back in 1953 a couple of years before Fess Parker and later John Wayne told slightly less fictional Alamo stories and established lasting mental pictures of the event and the participants. The Man From the Alamo is probably most noteworthy for its overuse and misuse of day for night filming. There are endless day for night scenes with many among the worst examples I have ever seen. One camp scene is so underexposed to simulate nighttime darkness that it's just five minutes of disembodied voices. The scenes at the Alamo itself are lame sound stage stuff.Also amusing are the sequences of the wagon train traversing the same California valley in scene and scene the high hills in the background and the dry valley just don't square with the alleged East Texas location.While Boetticher was normally excellent at pacing in The Man From the Alamo he dissipates the tension way too early and the film drags along to an unexciting snore ending. The wily renegades turn out to be totally inept creampuffs and the viewer is left waiting for a tactical surprise that never happens. The story opens with John Stroud Glenn Ford as part of the Alamo's garrison. We never meet General Santa Anna but there are brief scenes with Travis Crockett and Bowie. Stroud and his group draw lots to see which one will leave the Alamo to protect their ranches and families from a band of renegades. But he arrives too late and finds all the ranches have been burned and most of the families killed.Since no one at the Alamo survives Stroud is labeled a deserter and is about to be lynched in the first town he enters. But the renegades attack the town and Stroud infiltrates their merry little band led by Jess Wade Richard Jory so that he can get revenge. There is not much challenging acting required although Neville Brand is quite effective as one of the Renegades. Hugh O'Brien gets a lot of mock fest moments as a kind of combo of George Custer and Kit Carson complete with a tight buckskin costume. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

	schema:reviewBody "Travis Crockett Bowie and the rest are back behind the barricades at the Alamo in 1836. Budd Boetticher directed this tale of Glen Ford the only escapee and survivor. Of course Glen Ford would not have left except that he and a dozen other heroic defenders had families and ranches up there around Oxbow and they drew lots actually beans to select the single one of them to leave the Alamo and see that those families thrive.So when Travis draws his famous line in the sand and says All of you who are with me step across this line only Glen Ford hangs silently back. Travis arranges Ford's escape and the others who don't know beans about the lottery sneer at him and call him a coward.Well it didn't do the families of Ford or any of the others any good. It seems there are a gang of traitorous Texans who have been promised land grants by Santa Ana after the war. The gang is led by the evervillainous Victor Jory as Jess Wade  a name to conjure with  and the ineffably viperous Neville Brand. They have murdered all the families and burned all the ranchitos. This fills Ford with rage.Ford rides into town to warn the residents of the approach of Santa Ana's troops but Hugh O'Brien's soldiers are already there and O'Brien knows about Ford's leaving the Alamo.Complications follow involving multiple shoot outs a Mexican kid devoted to Ford the pursuit of the town's wagon train by the gang the slow melting of O'Brien's hatred towards Ford the gathering warmth of Julia Adams' schoolmarm the destruction of Jory's gang and the redemption of Ford.This is a thoughtprovoking movie. So okay. Everyone considers Ford a coward and deserter because he fled under fire. The only men who knew the reason for it are dead. When townsmen soldiers women and children spit on him and get ready to lynch him  why doesn't he EXPLAIN why he left? That's the principal thought the film provokes.But of course Glen is not the kind of man who talks excessively or feels sorry for himself or tries to excuse any of his actions. Here's another example of what I mean. He's in the midst of a shoot out with Victor Jory atop a mountain. The footpath gives way under his boot and he seems to roll down the slope for several thousand yards before sprawling apparently dead in the scree. Jory smiles down at the body way below and doesn't even bother to shoot him.The unconscious Ford is about to die but is rescued by the little Mexican kid and Julia Adams. They manage to pull him through after a day or so. Ford regains consciousness and begins to climb to his feet. No no say his two saviors wait until you regain your strength. A man's gotta get up sometime. Why not now? You don't seriously expect this guy to EXPLAIN himself do you? Now I am not an historian or a gun freak but my impression is that this movie does to historical accuracy what a bulldozer does to asphalt. The Old West roughly 1865 to 1895 depicted in movies can be divided into three tiers. 1 Absolute disregard for accuracy as when John Wayne gallops his horse along a road lined with telegraph poles. 2 The Movie West in which wardrobe and plot conventions are as taken for granted as our most primitive beliefs. 3 The Realistic West in which somebody has done some research and spent some money on period props. This one purports to belong to the third tier but yearns with all its soul to leap down to the second tier and finally unlike the defenders of the Alamo surrenders willingly.The Battle of the Alamo took place in 1836 not during the conventional period. And there are some nods to period accuracy  soldiers wear the hats of sea captains one carries a saber there are a sprinkling of buckskin shirts the ersatz Mexicans wear embroidered jackets and the hat brims are sometimes wider than usual though not always.But that's it. The rifles and muskets are muzzle loading as they should be but they're shorter than usual so they don't get in the way of the action. And for only one brief moment do we see one being loaded the gals in the bonnets. Too much exposure to the inexpert use of balls ramrods powder horns and the like would slow the tempo from agitato to moderato. The pistols aren't flintlocks but the Colt and Remington six shooters common to all Westerns. At one point Glen Ford fans his pistol and gets off a quick series of blasts. They're carried in conventional gun belts and holsters not clipped to belts or stuck through them. The men wear ordinary shirts with string ties and vests. The tight bodices and wide skirts of the women are generic and ex post filmo. They all seem checkered and loud. They might have been seen at a Nebraska picnic in 1920. I don't mean to suggest that this detracts in any way from Julia Adam's recherch appeal any more than does the concave profile of her nose which seems to begin in the middle of her forehead.If there's a lot of stereotypy in the plot is it at least well executed helped by the dialog? No. Boetticher needed the poetic Burt Kennedy as a writer and the marmoreal Randolph Scott as the lead.It's okay if there's nothing better to do or if you want to be wafted away into a world as remote from the real as Oz.".

Now I am not an historian or a gun freak but my impression is that this movie does to historical accuracy what a bulldozer does to asphalt. The Old West roughly 1865 to 1895 depicted in movies can be divided into three tiers. 1 Absolute disregard for accuracy as when John Wayne gallops his horse along a road lined with telegraph poles. 2 The Movie West in which wardrobe and plot conventions are as taken for granted as our most primitive beliefs. 3 The Realistic West in which somebody has done some research and spent some money on period props. This one purports to belong to the third tier but yearns with all its soul to leap down to the second tier and finally unlike the defenders of the Alamo surrenders willingly.The Battle of the Alamo took place in 1836 not during the conventional period. And there are some nods to period accuracy  soldiers wear the hats of sea captains one carries a saber there are a sprinkling of buckskin shirts the ersatz Mexicans wear embroidered jackets and the hat brims are sometimes wider than usual though not always.But that's it. The rifles and muskets are muzzle loading as they should be but they're shorter than usual so they don't get in the way of the action. And for only one brief moment do we see one being loaded the gals in the bonnets. Too much exposure to the inexpert use of balls ramrods powder horns and the like would slow the tempo from agitato to moderato. The pistols aren't flintlocks but the Colt and Remington six shooters common to all Westerns. At one point Glen Ford fans his pistol and gets off a quick series of blasts. They're carried in conventional gun belts and holsters not clipped to belts or stuck through them. The men wear ordinary shirts with string ties and vests. The tight bodices and wide skirts of the women are generic and ex post filmo. They all seem checkered and loud. They might have been seen at a Nebraska picnic in 1920. I don't mean to suggest that this detracts in any way from Julia Adam's recherch appeal any more than does the concave profile of her nose which seems to begin in the middle of her forehead.If there's a lot of stereotypy in the plot is it at least well executed helped by the dialog? No. Boetticher needed the poetic Burt Kennedy as a writer and the marmoreal Randolph Scott as the lead.It's okay if there's nothing better to do or if you want to be wafted away into a world as remote from the real as Oz.";

Her coming will mean an eternal darkness. She is supposedly the tennyo from the old legend of the angel who lost her feathered robe and was unable to return to her home in heaven.Inuyasha and the gang gets drawn into all of it when Kagura and Kanna appear to steal a part of the Fire Rat Robe that Inuyasha wears wouldn't it have been safer just to slay a Fire Rat and rent a seamstress to make a robe of it I wonder... doesn't Kagura and Kanna fear Inuyasha now that he has supposedly killed their old boss?. Anyway Inuyasha and the gang also meet an ancestor of Houjoukun who posesses the tennyo's robe that Kaguya desires. They figure out what's going on and decide to prevent Kaguya from being unleashed.The basic plot is sound but the movie suffers slightly from involving too many of the IYcharacters. Kikyou's scenes are completely unnecessary  the only thing they accomplish is remind us that she is wierd. The Kohakustory was slightly farfetched but given it's final developement it passes for accetable. At this point I'm just thankful they didn't try and squeeze Sesshoumaru into the story as well.The problem with the movie is that it's slightly too short. Another 510 minutes would have been enough to let the plot sink in and allow the viewer to understand what is going on. For instance the quick 2line explanation given as to why Kanna and Kagura starts serving Kaguya doesn't make any sense at all.This movie is despite its flaws excellent. It has the regular nice IYhumor the characters feel deep and real and the KagomeInuyasharelationship is warmer than ever sweeet. The badguy is somewhat shallow and singleminded but she makes up for it in style. She feels even more powerful than Naraku.This movie is a mustsee for anyone who whatches the tvseries. It contains some really longedfor moments and the action is superb.Don't miss it!".

So make sure you watch it! This movie contains fighting romancecomedy adventure and suspense. And a lil bit of nudity there in a hotspring but they don't show there whole body and stuff Everything you could ever want! I think its awesome. The only thing i don't like is just its too short. They should make it longer. D Also this movie doesn't have an age rating. Personally i would rate it pg 13. Just cause it says curse words a lil bit of nudity and violence.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw the first movie I was great disappointed by what I saw especially for a series as good as InuYasha. My expectations first watching Castle Beyond the Looking Glass were not as high but I was in for a surprise. In every single way I can think of Castle Beyond the Looking Glass is a vast improvement over Affections Touching Across Time.For the most part the second movie's story is as stock quality as the first movie. It does however try to go into the realm of alternate universe though it still really takes place in the canon storyline by posing the question What would it be like if Naraku died right now? And in my opinion the interpretation is pretty good. Castle Beyond the Looking Glass does something however that really makes it just like many other Japanese animated movies by incorporating story elements from the fairy tale Tale of the Bamboo Cutter. While it does so in a tasteful way it kind of gave me the impression of overused just as the first movie's story felt. Getting past that though the villain Kaguya is far superior to Menomaru if only because she was less corny. So the story which features all our favorite characters rather evenly meaning there is something for everybody to enjoy is actually more compelling.The animation and music is about the same level as the first movie. Actually I say the music was better for this movie because the first movie sounded as though it ripped a lot of tracks right off the television show. In contrast I'm pretty sure most if not all the music used for Castle Beyond the Looking Glass was original using the same melodies possibly but at least played in a different way.I thoroughly enjoyed Castle Beyond the Looking Glass much more than Affections Touching Across Time. The DVD also has some nice features that you shouldn't miss.".

The movie also uses the basis of the famous Japanese fairytale The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter and the main character from that story Princess Kaguya who serves as the film's villain. Unless you have familiarity with the fairytale certain parts of the plot won't make any sense.The animation is stunning and uses very little to no CG unlike the first movie. The action scenes are fluid and some of the comedy is very hilarious at times. Also part of the plot revolves around the fact that Kagomes likes Inuyasha for the way that he is and not a full fledged yokai. This leads to the best part of the movie where we get to see Inuyasha and Kagome kiss on screen for the first time in the series. Unfortunatly its never acknowledged in the TV show but hey.Castle Beyond the Looking Glass is a great addition to the Inuyasha film series and a good What If story if Naraku was gone and everyone returned to their normal lives even if it was but for a brief moment.".

The music and sound fx are great and it really has this Inuyasha feel to it.The downside is that Sesshmaru isnt in this one and Kikyou has only a small role.The upside is that it does not end the Inuyasha saga so there may be more Inuyasha series after this movie i hope i give it an 710".

I loved the playfulness which nodded at Welles's work without doing anything as crass as obvious references. It's an enjoyable story. Not a great thriller the insights and revelations weren't surprising but that only made it more real and engrossing.Huston was encouraged to do part Orson and part his Father John. He's a likable believable hero matched by a good mainly Serbian cast. Paz Vega is excellent as the heroine and Diego Luna gives a wonderful turn as the second hero to Welles reminds me of James Macavoy only likable.".

Like all 'what if's there's a modicum of truth here Welles did exile himself in Europe in 1948 where he did appear in some fairly dire movies and of course he was divorced from Rita Hayworth around that time. The film has him lining up an investor for his version of Othello to be shot in Italy when the current film is in the can whereas although he did write direct and star in Othello it was actually made in Morocco in 1952. Danny Huston really needs to do more than wield a cigar to come over as Welles and perhaps wisely he makes no attempt to reproduce that distinctive timbre though he might have had a stab at that impish twinkle in the eye that was so much a part of Welles. Pick of the rest is Anna Galieni so great in The Hairdresser's Husband for Patrice Leconte. As a curio this is worth a look but that's about it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Our subject film gets underway by showing Mr. Welles in a very inauspicious light as evidenced by his tepid if not sarcastic reception at the Rome airport as he arrived at the terminal almost unnoticed and visibly upstaged by Ty Power's arrival. But what's our guy to do given his current set of circumstances brought upon him by Ms. Hayworth giving him the old heaveho and thereby ending their marriage? So now he's in post WWII Rome where he shall try to undergo some face saving he hopes by attempting to reinvigorate his career by directing his slightly convoluted version of Othello that starts to look like a comedy of errors at the immediate onset of this dubious production.But camp turns to tragedy as one of the actors gets murdered not long into the production. The dying thespian whispers something into Mr. Welles' ear just before passing on and now a whole new chain of events starts to take place. One mystery begets other mysteries in a sort of arithmetic progression and the serious side of this dramamystery starts to unfold.

	onyx:emotionText "Our subject film gets underway by showing Mr. Welles in a very inauspicious light as evidenced by his tepid if not sarcastic reception at the Rome airport as he arrived at the terminal almost unnoticed and visibly upstaged by Ty Power's arrival. But what's our guy to do given his current set of circumstances brought upon him by Ms. Hayworth giving him the old heaveho and thereby ending their marriage? So now he's in post WWII Rome where he shall try to undergo some face saving he hopes by attempting to reinvigorate his career by directing his slightly convoluted version of Othello that starts to look like a comedy of errors at the immediate onset of this dubious production.But camp turns to tragedy as one of the actors gets murdered not long into the production. The dying thespian whispers something into Mr. Welles' ear just before passing on and now a whole new chain of events starts to take place. One mystery begets other mysteries in a sort of arithmetic progression and the serious side of this dramamystery starts to unfold.

	schema:reviewBody "Danny Huston is Orson Welles in Fade to Black a 2006 release directed by Oliver Parker and featuring Paz Vega Diego Luna Christopher Walken Anna Galiena and Nathaniel Parker.In this story Welles goes to Italy after his divorce from Rita Hayworth to make a film Black Magic. He also wants to raise money for his film version of Othello. While in Italy one of the actors in the film is murdered and as he's dying he whispers the word Nero in Orson's ear. Welles intends to find out who killed him. But he finds himself not only involved with shady characters but embroiled in the politics of the country. As time goes on he begins to hear different stories about the actor somewhat contradictory in nature. On top of which Tyrone Power is a much bigger star in Italy and Welles keeps coming up short except on a hit list!This is a nice blend of fact and fiction. Welles did go to Europe around this time and he made several films which he often did when he was trying to get money together. His marriage to Rita Hayworth was a complicated one. When his political ambitions led nowhere in the '40s Rita so desperate to get out of show business turned to Aly Khan instead. Welles adored her but her insecurities made her difficult to live with and was a bad combination with his egotism.It's doubtful that Welles would have gotten himself mixed up in anything that didn't somehow lead to his own selfaggrandizement but I could have gone along with it if the script had been better. It tries to cram in too much plot.Italy after the war was a horrific mess. The production values for Fade to Black are wonderful and show the postwar ruination as well as striking differences between rich and poor. Of course Cinecitta the film studio is in Rome and Tombolo the place where deserters and collaborators escaped is way up north though it's not clear if they're speaking of a district or the city. In any event it's a wooded area seemingly not far from Rome. The word tombolo has more to do with a mound or beach so the woods would be the name for it.Danny Huston doesn't look or sound like Welles except on the film that plays behind his magic act  there we see him in the typical Welles big overcoat and hat in black and white. He does a good job though I do believe Welles was a bit showier. As the mother and daughter who knew the murdered actor Paz Vega and Anna Galiena are gorgeous and look just like mother and daughter. Both have a mysterious aura which adds to the film.The denouement is no surprise. Still this is an enjoyable film about one of Hollywood's most electrifying people a brilliant maverick with a flamboyant personality. Sadly though he resented the discipline and structure dictated by a Hollywood studio he needed it. Once he left he was never the same.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure how this was as a novel but the film version has the classic flaw of all book adaptations. In trying to cram hundreds of pages of narrative into a couple of hours on screen things need to be cut out. Sometimes things that are important even vital to the prose have to be sacrificed to the demands of cinema and other elements expanded or enhanced to take their place. Fade to Black has a great setting and a great hook but needed to severely restructure its plot in order to take full advantage of them. Any movie about genius filmmaker Orson Welles also needs to be a hell of a lot more visually imaginative than this. Those weaknesses mean that a film which starts out quite strong and has a lot of initial appeal never manages to fulfill your expectations. Watching it is an okay experience but also vaguely disappointing.In 1948 with his career on the down slope and his personal life in ruins Orson Welles Danny Huston travels to Italy to play the bad guy in a twobit production called Black Magic. After one of his costars mysteriously dies Welles decides to investigate and finds himself caught up in the political intrigue of Italy's first postwar election and winds up a name on somebody's hit list. With the aid of his driver Tommaso Diego Luna and the distracting motivation of a beautiful actress Lea Paz Vega Welles discovers that reality is more twisted than any fantasy he can dream up.Fade to Black has three major strengths. Wellfour if you count the presence of Paz Vega. Danny Huston is very appealing as Orson Welles. Who's to say how personally accurate the portrayal is but Huston does a fine job at capturing the essence of a wunderkind that was no longer a kind who felt no rules applied to him and didn't handle it well when he discovered some did. The moments here that play up Welles love of filmmaking are nicely contrasted by his conflicted relish of fame and dread of celebrity. Plopping Welles down into the middle of a murder mystery is also a great idea. So is using Welles as a window into the turmoil of postMussolini Italy and the dawning of Cold War political manipulation.Unfortunately combining the mystery and the political machinations proves to be too much for the film to tolerate especially when it turns out neither has much to do with the other. Perhaps they were woven together better in the novel. Here each vies for your attention and stunts the growth of the other. When it comes time for big developments in either the murder or the political underhandedness it feels a bit hollow because there hasn't been the proper build up. One of them needed to be kept in the background with the other come fully to the foreground and a subplot involving the fate of Italian Jews and an ill fated Resistance cell should have been done away with entirely. As it is Fade to Black starts out entirely about the mystery then becomes totally about the politics then flips back and forth between the two until the very end.I don't want to be overly critical because I did like this movie. It came so close to being a lot better than it is though it's hard not to be caught up in those lamentable failings. If writerdirector Oliver Parker had embraced Huston's Welles as the story's heart and soul and not felt obligated to elevate Diego Luna's Tammaso to nearly his equal which may have been true to the Italian novel this is based upon but is nothing but false to the potential of this movie he might have made something compelling. What he created instead was merely satisfactory. That's much better than most but in this instance it isn't enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "Of course this is a fictional account and as the narrator Welles says if you want history read a history book. First for people who will see this film Black Magic while having Italian help was really an American film and Welles is reputed to have directed his own scenes and if you see that film you will be able to see his trademark. The film Black Magic is also not that bad a movie. I had heard about this film being possibly made in the late 90's and was surprised to see that it actually had been. The man who directed this film also had ironically directed Othello in 95. the use of Orson Welles in a thriller is something unusual. I love Orson Welles movies and wonder if we all were cheated that he was not able to do more. I suspect that I like others are part of an Orson Welles cult following and that is why such a film is made with Orson Welles as a lead character. It is ironic that seven years before this film was made Leiv Shreibner I probably spelled his name wrong played a very convincing Welles and sometimes seemed to look like him. especially when he moved across to an elevator. I couldn't help but feel that it would have been something of a great sequel if the same actor had played Welles in this film and not Danny Huston.I don't want to suggest that Danny Huston is a failure in this film but I think that if the film does not really grab our intention and our future memories of film his performance in the film may be one of the reasons for that. I first remember Danny Huston in the Austrailian film The Proposition a film in which I feel he gave an excellent performance. In this film however I think the idea of the filmmakers and perhaps Huston was to portray Welles as really an everyman not a leading figure in a movie that we would like. When he is kissing a woman in a scene we feel that woman is only kissing him because he is someone important not someone they find attractive. Even his costar in the film he is about to do shows scorn for him. Everyone else in the film seems to be more of an interesting person that he is. When he meets his friend from long ago Pete played by Christopher Walken in a good performance Walken seems more magnetic than Huston as Welles. This Welles in a clumsy and has to be pulled out of a few situations by his Chaufeuer and I guess body guard played by Mexican actor Diego Luna. this Welles as someone comments towards the end of the picture does not seem important at all. Only during a scene where Huston portrays Welles doing his magic trick does the character of Welles really shine through and perhaps suggests that Welles was just another guy in this world but through magic was able to make him on screen and on stage more magnificent than the real person. If the filmmakers had this in mind make everyone else perhaps more interesting I think that this was a miscalculation and perhaps not very flattering on the life of Orson Welles. Hustons portrayal of him does not make Welles look either interesting or likable. The film which starts out as a murder mystery leads more to a conspiracy than just a possible murder itself. The idea is interesting and asks some questions itself which I won't say because it might give away to much. Though you can see things in this film a mile away.".

	schema:reviewBody "For those of you who loved Beverly Hills Chihuahua including myself I am sad to report that Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2 is not a worthy sequel to its enormously entertaining predecessor. Obviously patched together rather quickly to capitalize on the success of Chihuahua 1 BHC2 is a straight to DVD concoction. All the actors have been replaced except for George Lopez who reprises the voice of Papi. Also missing are stars Jaime Lee Curtis who had a short but effective role as the dog loving businesswoman Aunt Viv and Drew Barrymore who had the starring voice role as Chloe.BHC2 begins right away with the wedding of Papi and Chloe. A few months later Chloe gives birth to a brood of five pups four girls and a boy. Chloe's owner Rachel and her mother Aunt Viv are off on a trip to the Amazon rain forest and have even lesser roles here than in the original 'Chihuahua'. The audience is further shortchanged when Delgado the German Shepard former police dog is relegated to a supporting role as he attempts to locate his long lost 'sons' who are now police dogs for LAPD.It takes a very long time before we break into 'Act 2' in BHC2 and that occurs when Sam and his parents the Cortez's are faced with losing the family home. While BHC1 had a menacing and realistic drug cartel member as an antagonist coupled with his equally scary canine counterpart 'El Diablo' all BHC2 can muster up is a buffoonish bank executive entrusted with taking possession of the Cortez family home.Sam needs to come up with 50K cash so they decide to enter a prestigious dog show. Somehow the dogs are allowed to enter the contest without any investigation into their pedigree. It's only after Papi ends up winning by arranging flower petals into the shape of a heart that it finally occurs to the stuffy lead judge that Papi isn't a full pedigree. Papi is disqualified and Sam is back to square one trying to figure out how to get the cash to prevent foreclosure of their home.The 'dark moment' at the end of the Second Act occurs when the puppies follow Delgado who's still looking for his long lost sons. Sam Papi and Chloe are frantic that the little ones are now lost. The puppies end up in duffel bags containing stolen cash carried by criminals who have just robbed a bank. Papi's brother Pedro finds a cap belonging to the one of the robbers and the scent leads the dogs to a bread factory where they rescue the puppies and chase the robbers out into the arms of the police.Unlike BHC1 which had an extremely inventive plot and all kinds of interesting characters and production numbers remember that wonderful 'Aztec warrior' Chihauhau dance? BHC2 is simply a formulaic Disney secondrate comedy. While BHC1 was full of laugh out loud jokes BHC2 simply expects us to laugh merely by offering up a bunch of talking dogs without the wit of the original. For those who haven't seen BHC1 please pick up a copy and try to forget the sequel!".

A few months later Chloe gives birth to a brood of five pups four girls and a boy. Chloe's owner Rachel and her mother Aunt Viv are off on a trip to the Amazon rain forest and have even lesser roles here than in the original 'Chihuahua'. The audience is further shortchanged when Delgado the German Shepard former police dog is relegated to a supporting role as he attempts to locate his long lost 'sons' who are now police dogs for LAPD.It takes a very long time before we break into 'Act 2' in BHC2 and that occurs when Sam and his parents the Cortez's are faced with losing the family home. While BHC1 had a menacing and realistic drug cartel member as an antagonist coupled with his equally scary canine counterpart 'El Diablo' all BHC2 can muster up is a buffoonish bank executive entrusted with taking possession of the Cortez family home.Sam needs to come up with 50K cash so they decide to enter a prestigious dog show. Somehow the dogs are allowed to enter the contest without any investigation into their pedigree. It's only after Papi ends up winning by arranging flower petals into the shape of a heart that it finally occurs to the stuffy lead judge that Papi isn't a full pedigree. Papi is disqualified and Sam is back to square one trying to figure out how to get the cash to prevent foreclosure of their home.The 'dark moment' at the end of the Second Act occurs when the puppies follow Delgado who's still looking for his long lost sons. Sam Papi and Chloe are frantic that the little ones are now lost. The puppies end up in duffel bags containing stolen cash carried by criminals who have just robbed a bank. Papi's brother Pedro finds a cap belonging to the one of the robbers and the scent leads the dogs to a bread factory where they rescue the puppies and chase the robbers out into the arms of the police.Unlike BHC1 which had an extremely inventive plot and all kinds of interesting characters and production numbers remember that wonderful 'Aztec warrior' Chihauhau dance? BHC2 is simply a formulaic Disney secondrate comedy. While BHC1 was full of laugh out loud jokes BHC2 simply expects us to laugh merely by offering up a bunch of talking dogs without the wit of the original. For those who haven't seen BHC1 please pick up a copy and try to forget the sequel!";

The film is quick too with an 84 minute run time. It is a nice little kids movie. The dogs are cute as buttons which I think is the point of these movies. My 12 year old enjoyed that. I did as well.

	schema:reviewBody "Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2 is an irresistible Disney comedy with tons of adventure that is perfect for the entire family! It is directed by Alex Zamm and written by Dannah Feinglass Danielle Schneider and Jeffrey Bushell. Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2 is about two newlywed Chihuahuas named Papi and Chloe who start a family. Chloe gives birth to 5 impetuous and reckless puppies but the pups soon get their act together when they find out their human owners have trouble paying off the mortgages for their house. The dogs decide to enter the Beverly Hills dog show in hope for the 50000 prize to help their owners keep the house but unfortunately the dogs do not win. However a bank robbery occurs and the pups decide to stop the crime. Their mischievousness leads them to capturing the robbers and saving the day but will this good deed be enough to stop the bank from foreclosing their human owners' house? The voice over of the movie is excellent. The dogs' voices fit their personalities well and the voice over contains a lot of emotion. For example Delgado voiced over by Miguel Ferrer who is a sleuthhound had a husky voice which matched well with his appearance as well as his role in the movie. Papi's voice also adjusted well to things that were going on in the movie. For example when he told his pups nightly bedtime stories his voice would become low in pitch and he would sound mysterious. The movie is also very comical. I found myself giggling in almost every scene! This movie overall is exhilarating and it contains heartwarming messages such as true love is worth any risk love fearlessly and help others share their hearts as well family is about who you love not just who you are born to we are stronger together than we are alone and stick by your loved ones even in hard times. The message stick by your loved ones even in hard times is perhaps the most significant message in the movie because Papi's entire family as well as his owners' family tried their best to prevent the bank from foreclosing their home. I would recommend this movie to ages 6 and up. Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2 is a splendid family film but if director Alex Zamm created more suspense while the dogs were enjoying their escapades the movie would have created a bigger impact on the audience and hence become more captivating. Nevertheless all in all this film is perfect for anyone who wants to watch a humorous entertaining adventure about talking dogs! Reviewed by Gabriella Chu KIDS FIRST! Film Critic age 14".

	schema:headline " Powerful film about love honor redemption and connection";
	schema:reviewBody "It's hard for me to understand the scorn that has been heaped upon this film. You'd think Lee Daniels had created a film praising Hitler the Antichrist and communism. Also it's hard to understand why some critics have focused on certain aspects of the film. Zac Efron in his tidy whities or Nicole Kidman urinating on Mr. Efron. The level of titillation that is being shown would be credible in a 7year old but not for adult critics. To focus on these rather minor points shows a deep misunderstanding of what this film is about. So what is this film about? While I think it's hard to reduce a work of art to the level of a short essay I am so fed up with what has been written about this film that I shall attempt to do so. For starters I believe this film reflects the world as it is and not as we want it to be. I think this film is saying that our deepest need is for love connection and moral truth but these needs become warped when filtered through the liesdespair and degradation that American society has offered up as the truth. Mainstream films never go here and while some indie films touch on this theme they don't usually go for as deep a dive. The only other director that I can think of even approaching this level of an unblinking stare into the abyss is Todd Soldendz. The characters in the film consist of Ward Jansen Matthew McConaughey a journalist who has come back to his home town to investigate whether or not Hilary Van Wetter John Cusack a man on death row received a fair trial. Ward's attention has been drawn to this case by Charlotte Bless Nicole Kidman a woman who has maintained a jail house correspondence with Mr. Van Wetter and who believes she is in love with him. Ward brings with him a colleague Yardley Acheman David Oyewolo a black journalist from London. They are assisted by Ward's younger brother Jack Jansen Zac Efron who still lives at home. The Jansen family maid Anita Chester Macy Gray is Jack's confidant and a stand in for the mother that left the family several years ago. Each character's story is that of connection or love that has been twisted or thwarted for various reasons. Jack's playful relationship with the family maid can never be a relation between equals because of his racism. Jack can see that she is his natural ally and friend but his racism denies them both a deeper connection. As brothers Ward and Jack share a powerful bond of affection but no amount of affection between the brothers can halt Ward's impulse to selfdestruction brought on by his inability to accept being homosexual. Charlotte Bless is looking for love and thinks she can find it by writing to men in prison. She receives a response from Van Wetter and because of its seeming indifference to what other men want from her she decides this man loves her. The delusion is so powerful that even when real love is offered by Jack she doesn't understand it. The film doesn't make it clear why she is so selfdestructive. We can only assume it is the logical end to the toxic sexism that forces women to see themselves as worthy only if they are desired by a man any man. Jack's impulse toward love and connection with this woman is driven by the damage done by the abandonment Jack experienced at the hands of his mother.Yardley is a black man trying to have a decent career as a journalist at a time 1969 when racism almost guaranteed that black men remain in lowly positions and did not allow them to rise to their full potential. It is this very racism that makes him betray his colleague and his principals and forces him to assume an identity other than his own. Van Wetter is I think a kind of stand in for a force of nature. It is when you face up to these kind of forces that your innermost strengths and weaknesses are revealed. Through these characters Lee Daniels is showing the damage done to human relations forcing people to act in ways that are not pretty to watch and so the world he shows us is not pretty. It's hard and brutal. But so are the forces that drive these characters. To the critics who hated this film if you want pretty watch Lucy and Desi. Mr. Daniels world is the real world flawed messy and hard to look at but with humanity and the impulse to transcendence at its core.".

Sometimes there is no justice in the film world just ask Ben Affleck about being overlooked by AMPAS as Best Director this year for Argo.It's well performed directed with few flaws and the cinematography hits the spot perfectly but the trouble is in terms of ratings that it isn't easy to sell. Essentially The Paperboy is a dialoguedriven film about an idealistic reporter Ward Jansen Mathew McConaughey who returns to his hometown in the backwaters of the rednecked American south to investigate the conviction of a man on death row convicted of murdering a sheriff. When Charlotte Bless Nicole Kidman the infatuated penfriend of Hillary Van Wetter John Cusack the murderer in question approaches Ward for help he recruits his bother Jack Zac Efron and colleague Yardley David Oyelowo and sets about investigating ineptitude and corruption surrounding the case.It isn't a pretty story it doesn't race along at breakneck speed and it isn't a film that haunts the viewer long after the credits have rolled. It is however a thoroughly enjoyable tale that meanders through some murky and terrible swamps both literal and metaphorical and will satisfy those with a penchant for the underbelly of society.Based on a true story and one from the official selection for Cannes 2012 The Paperboy is a dark story that at times is very unpleasant. It goes to places you almost certainly want to avoid in your life. There are no sweet and lovely twodimensional characters here but 'regular Joes' with twists in their psyches and the relationships between the principal four keeps us on our toes. Each has secrets or sides to their characters they try to hide and each is capable of damaging another willfully and yielding or ignoring their conscience after the event in their own selfharming manner.Efron shows signs of shaking off his teenybopper roots and it is encouraging to see him take a long and effective step away from such pulp as last year's predictable The Lucky One. At last we see something of a character developing from him and Jack's relationship with the maid Anita Macy Gray who also narrates much of the story gives a hint of warmth to an otherwise cold and twisted collection of characters.Both McConaughey and Kidman stepped away from the 'beautiful' roles sometime ago though there is still a feeling of them playing 'against type' here which isn't fair as both are very fine actors with some startling performances in recent years. Here they allow themselves to be engulfed by the perversions of their roles and are eminently watchable though you wouldn't much 'alone time' with either of them. Gray is overlooked largely and though her Anita is supposed to be the allseeing character that fills in the gaps for us she feel inconsequential much of the time.It is Cusack that startles most of all here. He often frustrates as a fine actor in turkeys Hot Tub Time Machine The Raven and then blindsides us with another performance we've been desperately hoping for. As Hilary he initially causes reserved sympathy from us as he stumbles into the scene disheveled and emotionally crushed. We can almost smell the grease in his hair and his fetid breath and recoil at the thought of Charlotte sharing anything more than a letter with him. But he evolves and repulses as The Paperboy unfolds in a performance every bit the antitheses of his signature role Martin Q. Blank but equally memorable. Whilst an unpleasant character with whom to share time the performance is absorbing. Just please don't let this be the last time we enjoy Cusack for another five years.Daniels has crafted a film of relationships with confused issues. Life isn't always clearcut and often it is just plain dirty. Though less successful financially than Precious The Paperboy is a far more mature film with a great deal more flare. Although Daniels hasn't had the courage to shoot it entirely in the style of the period there are enough references to the late sixties and seventies with split screens and flares to transport us back the era of segregation and Tarantino's favourite word.It won't last long at the box office but The Paperboy is a DVD treat for an evening that calls for something more than schmaltz or easy laughs and requires some emotional investment.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.".

	schema:headline " Great Performances but Somewhat Weak Story";
	schema:reviewBody "The Paperboy 2012  out of 4 Lee Daniels' adaptation of the Peter Dexter novel taking a look at some swamp trash and a mystery surrounding them. Reporter Ward Jansen Matthew McConaughey returns to his hometown to try and solve the mystery behind a sheriff who was killed. Hillary Van Wetter John Cusack is on death row for the crime but the reporter believes he is innocent and drags his younger brother Zac Efron and a trashy woman Nicole Kidman into things. THE PAPERBOY is a pretty unpleasant look at a bunch of characters you can't help but hate and it's funny to see McConaughey really changing his image here as well as in the year's earlier KILLER JOE. I think the best thing about the picture are the performances as well as the authentic feel that director Daniels brings to the picture. The biggest problem is the screenplay and a story that I just felt wasn't all that captivating. The entire mystery surrounding what really happened to the sheriff seems to take a backseat and it really just seems to come and go at times. I'm really not sure why it was thrown in the background as much and especially with the twists that come towards the end. With the twists you'd think that the filmmakers were wanting the story itself to be important but it just never really takes off. It also seems that the director wants to shock the viewer with some rather graphic violence and sexual situations which have the stars all doing some pretty wild things. It really does seem as if the film is just building up to each of these scenes and it's fair to say that they're quite memorable. The performances from the entire cast are terrific with both McConaughey and Kidman doing wonders with their swamp trash characters. I thought both of them were incredibly believable and hats off to them for going as far out as they did. I was also impressed with Efron and thought he handled the character's development quite well. Cusack was terrific playing the creepy bad guy and we also got strong support from David Oyelowo Scott Glenn and Macy Gray. The cinematography is also good as is the music score and the atmosphere. THE PAPERBOY as is is a good showcase for its stars but you can't help but feel it's a missed opportunity as a stronger story would have made it even better.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film reminded me quite a bit of Deliverance. It's about how wellmeaning people can end up way over their heads by getting involved with people and subcultures with which they're not familiar. It's less riveting than Deliverance but has more sympathy toward its characters.The plot revolves around a small group of people who join forces for a cause A woman who wants to free a prisoner she's become enamored of by mail and a couple of newspaper reporters who want to dig up the truth about the crime. One of the reporters is seeking justice the other has a slightly different agenda. The idealistic reporter has a younger brother Zac Efron who is an innocent. Innocence idealism and romanticism come up against opportunism and sociopathy and some of what happens is not too much of a surprise. The end of the movie had a great deal of dramatic potential and could have been more suspenseful in the hands of a more polished director. The movie overall is somewhat lurid a Southern Gothic but not as lurid as some critics have claimed. Overall it is a movie with some poignancy.".

	schema:reviewBody "'THE PAPERBOY' Three and a Half Stars Out of Five An allstar cast highlights this bizarre dramatic thriller based on the book of the same name by Pete Dexter. The cast features Zac Efron Matthew McConaughey Nicole Kidman John Cusack David Oyelowo Scott Glenn and Macy Gray all playing against type in unusual roles for each actor. It was written along with Dexter and directed by Lee Daniels who is most well known for directing the critical darling and Oscar nominated 'PRECIOUS' which was also based on a popular book. The movie itself has gotten mostly bad reviews but Kidman has gotten plenty of high critical praise and award recognition for her performance in it including a supporting actress Golden Globe nomination. The rest of the cast has been well received as well and Daniels is still seen as a skilled director but the trashy content of the film as well as it's overall muddled nature have been negatively criticized by many. I agree with the criticisms but still feel like I have to give it a lot of respect and credit for what it does manage to accomplish.The film revolves around a man named Hillary Van Wetter Cusack who's on death row for the murder of a local sheriff in a small Florida town. He's been communicating with a woman Charlotte Bless Kidman he's never met via letters. Charlotte believes she's in love with Hillary and calls on the help of two reporters from Miami Ward Jansen McConaughey and Yardley Acheman Oyelowo to help her prove he's innocent. Believing new evidence is available the two reporters travel to the Florida town which is a return home for Ward to the town he grew up in. Ward visits his dad Glenn and his new girlfriend Nealla Gordon who distribute his paper there. He also reunites with his kid brother Jack Efron who helps with their investigation. Jack is young and inexperienced with women and immediately falls for the sexy Charlotte. The Jansen's maid Anita Gray is Jack's only friend and she narrates the story.The movie is sleazy and trashy pulp like the films of yesteryear. Daniels brings a lot of style to his storytelling but it's still a mess. The visuals are often haunting and disturbing and you never really know where the film is going or what to make of anyone or anything in it. It is bizarrely interesting though and entertaining in a somewhat bitter way. Like a lot of films it has a lot of great moments but a lot of bad ones in between as well. The cast is all fantastic Cusack is very strange and creepy McConaughey seems to be playing a character like many others he's done before but he does take a sharp character twist Efron is good as the shy yet determined heart of the film and Kidman is fantastic as the sex obsessed vixen. The movie is a mixed bag but it definitely has it's qualities.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vOcoZRlVFMzA".

Nicole thinks he knows nothing because he's young but one of the films myriad themes is the value of youthful idealism Jack is the only one of the main characters yet to plunge down a rabbithole of hopelessness and selfservice.

It skitters along with little attention paid to the audience with precise relationships between characters rarely spelled out and chunks of action entirely elided. It's not quite as funny or bleak as the similarly southernfried Killer Joe but I do believe that The Paperboy has a more humanist agenda than William Friedkin's film basically emerging on the side of people broken as they often become.Like Precious this is a film containing difficult individual scenes and a troubling ambivalence about whether we're investing in a set of real characters or peering at them through museum glass. But there's no doubt when the camera starts rolling that Daniels sets out to challenge his audience. In that respect he has succeeded.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Paperboy has received some harsh criticism not just divisive but mostly negative reviews. I'm happy to provide an opposite perspective but it is worth mentioning that most critiques seem to come from a superficial pointofview. Anita Macy Gray as the narrator takes us down to small town life in Florida in the late 1960s where she worked as a maid for the white upper class Jansen family. Nothing is as it seems.The youngest brother Jack Jansen Zac Efron has just returned home after a short stint as a star swimmer at university. He's lost with no purpose and no real desire. The elder brother Ward Jansen Matthew McConaughey is a reporter at the Miami Times and has just returned home to investigate a racial murder case. To help him he has brought home his newspaper partner and friend Yardley Acheman David Oyelowo. Yardley comes from an upper class African American family from London.The film has found a place in time where racism was rampant in some parts of the world and barely an issue in other parts of the world. It was definitely an issue for Hillary Van Wetter John Cusack who apparently committed murder due to race but he could also have been unjustly imprisoned due to race. At this point in the film most viewers are still reeling from the introduction of all the actors. Cusack is playing a Southern white trash murderous hick and Nicole Kidman is playing his white trash fiance Charlotte Bless who likes chasing after imprisoned criminals. Viewers remain in a state of shock when Hillary and Charlotte decide to pleasure themselves upon first meeting with all other paper players present. Contrary to popular belief that scene was not just for pure shock value it was also used to help establish who the innocent characters are and who deserves our sympathies.The most intuitive and considerate character Ward has also returned home to look after his little brother. Their mother died when they were young and with a stubborn and distant father and scheming stepmother tobe Jack is prone to misunderstood loneliness and Ward hires him as a driver for their newspaper article on Hillary's case. Jack is more innocent and sheltered than his age suggests. He's never been in love and he doesn't even know how to find love. So when Charlotte shows up with bleachblonde hair and a skintight shorterthanappropriate hooker dress he's in love. Or infatuation but he doesn't know the difference and then the film starts exploring that.But after all Jack Efron is the title character of The Paperboy. This film is about him. It also happens to be about love sex race murder and acceptance. It is extreme chaotic and tragic but it's not terrible. It's actually a very intelligent film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I understand why some people think this movie is OK. It has some good actors and it explores some dark issues. Unfortunately it is a rollercoaster ride going from mundane to awkward with little point to the journey. There is no cleverness no real plot and nothing of note to keep you watching except for the hope of a good ending. Too much effort went into trying to shock the viewer than went into actually making an involving story. The characters are obviously intended to polarise viewers but they have tried too hard and the characters have been made uniformly unlikeable. The ending shows promise but then true to the movie's form it crashes back to mediocrity. The flashback concept is also so pointless. It has no relevance and no real callback to the present. The consequences of the story lead nowhere and your are left feeling that sitting through this movie was equally pointless.

	onyx:emotionText "I understand why some people think this movie is OK. It has some good actors and it explores some dark issues. Unfortunately it is a rollercoaster ride going from mundane to awkward with little point to the journey. There is no cleverness no real plot and nothing of note to keep you watching except for the hope of a good ending. Too much effort went into trying to shock the viewer than went into actually making an involving story. The characters are obviously intended to polarise viewers but they have tried too hard and the characters have been made uniformly unlikeable. The ending shows promise but then true to the movie's form it crashes back to mediocrity. The flashback concept is also so pointless. It has no relevance and no real callback to the present. The consequences of the story lead nowhere and your are left feeling that sitting through this movie was equally pointless. The dialog also leads to confusion it doesn't help to engage you at any deeper level and I couldn't really be bothered to dissect it too much. This paperboy does not deliver.";

The quality of the film itself is so crummy it's a wonder this high profile cast was attracted to it. Through all the cheesy and trashy aspects of the film The Paperboy at least pushes the boundaries of what we expect and creates some shocking scenes in its plot.The screenplay does have a fairly intriguing plot it's bites off a lot of issues to talk about but never fully realizes any of them. Sometimes the issues are so thin they slide right by the viewer. The most fun for the viewer is to watch the interaction between Zac Efron and Nicole Kidman's characters. It's an usual romantic relationship. Everything unusual is what The Paperboy has going for its screenplay. The script does develop the characters fairly well some of the characters more than others.The acting is the saving grace of The Paperboy and is what makes it watchable. Though John Cusack doesn't convince us in his juicy role the rest of the cast is good. Zac Efron is decent in his protagonist role Matthew McConaughey does fairly good work but the true star is Nicole Kidman. It's a role that requires a lot of courage. The actress who had to play Charlotte would had to embarrass herself completely Kidman owns that and brings the character out through those humiliating moments. Lee Daniels is the man who screwed the project up. It was never destined to be a groundbreaking film but Daniels holds it back from being at least decent as a movie. It becomes campy has stereotypical racism and messy scenes drowning in disarray. The narrative isn't strong enough to overcome Daniels's misdirection even with the cast trying their best.

The film is structurally muddled with surrealistic fantasy sequences mixed with hard realism and big splashes of sexy Southern Gothic melodramatics. The sound recording is in the main low and nearly inaudible. The cinematography is the standard indie mix of shakycam amateurishness lens flare and out of focus artsiness. The story meanders wildly and with no particular focus on any of its several narratives strands. The acting is more interesting than good with McConaughey Cusack and Kidman playing against type but too no real purpose. Lee Daniels crush on Zac Efron's torso means Efron is showcased lovingly but at an embarrassing centerfold length. Several reviews I've seen called this movie a hot mess. I'd emphasize the mess end of that critical construction.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lee Daniels is a great director in firm control of conveying dark and powerful forces. He is not afraid to handle very controversial material and he can go back and forth between simple but effective scenes and other moments where what you are seeing is on the screen is unbelievable devastating overwhelming.Pretty much like Precious but with very little of the fantasy moments that brought a little relief to the existence of that movie's heroine The Paperboy offers no break to the audience. Each one of its characters is fully exposed at times literally and we might have a hard time handling the movie but it's still remarkable because it's an honest story of souls that inhabit a very ugly world and in the words of one of them Things might be even worse if we saw their darker sides.Kidman as usual fully fleshes out the character of the deluded and hungry lonely soul who falls for a convicted killer. She is outstanding showing an intense physical side we have never seen before. It's a raw portrayal of a sad but somehow pragmatic character who makes bad choices. Equally amazing is McCounaghey who has made it tough for Academy members when they choose his best role this year. He is a man who walks the tightrope between love and selfhate. When he is around his younger brother we can see his demonstrations of affection and it's obvious he's hiding something and we'll be in shock when we see what lies behind his tortured facade.There are the other players doing great work. Macy Gray plays the resilient and obedient servant who is much wiser than most people believe. She is the narrator of the Greek tragedy that happens in the '60's Florida. It's a mystery with corrosive details a tail that scars many who lived through it and will probably shock more than a few in the audience. Zac Efron takes plenty of chances baring more than his soul here as the conflicted and impulsive young man who must learn to grow up pretty fast and lives in a world that is changing by the minute. Things might be a bit too much for him to handle.The most incredible transformation is that of John Cusack an intelligent but reserved performer who has managed to avoid the spotlight in spite of the powerful forces he seems to be capable of portraying. He is unleashed here as the accused killer and he like Charlize Theron is almost unrecognizable as the shameless and depraved product of an unforgiving area of our country. He is ruthless and scary. At first we think it's all madness but there is a driving force here and it's evil. Cusack shows a dark side movies rarely achieve. It's truly a frightening acting tourDeforce.So the question is can we handle and believe what is shown here? It's up to the audience to decide because we usually read about this but here is like in Precious a film that pushes the boundaries of what contemporary cinema passes as drama. It's not gratuitous it's daring and powerful moviemaking.".

It's what a friend of mine would maybe call a swamp storyand by that he meant all the messy mired personal histories of a group of people getting in the way and making for high drama. In this case it becomes literally the swamps of the Gulf Coast and some pretty harrowing scenes result.The three leads are huge stars and all are portrayed in a gritty sometimes very unattractive way. Nicole Kidman plays a trashy rural woman well coming on to those who can't resist and then getting in trouble big trouble with one of them. Matthew McConaughey is a troubled reporter and he ends up in worse shape than Nicole Kidman partly because it takes longer to get him there. And John Cusack plays a convincing psycho criminal released in time to make mayhem for the rest of the cast. There is also an odd small role by David Oyelowo who has a voice so much like Sidney Poitier it's surprising.So this swamps story with a stellar cast seems to have potential and it even is structured in an inventive way with a disjointed arranging of the narrative pieces some shaky camera and so on. But director and screenwriter and producer Lee Daniels manages to make a muck of it all. The plot doesn't seem terribly complicated but it's weirdly hard to completely follow. The motivations of the charactersfrom the writer to the woman to another younger man who has sexual needs that seem weirdly bottled upare never clarified. People act in disturbing ways and you're curious as can be but you never quite know why things are happening except maybe from Cusak's character since he's supposed to be nuts and he acts it. You keep groping for sense to it or at least artful nonsense and it doesn't gel. Some of the dialog is forced as well so despite all the realistic grit you are thrust away from realism at the same time.I'm guessing the book is terrific because there is something great going on here behind all the broken parts. Daniels is behind the disturbing but well made movie Precious and so I expected something more together on this one. It's as if he's traded sensation for meaning and for me it's a false and frustrating trade.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Paperboy was an interesting film to watch in that I wasn't always sure where the film was headed and I wasn't always so sure if the film even cared about where it was headed as well. The film is really more of a character story then it is a southern noir narrativea coming of age story somehow mixed up with a southern Gothic noirbut the plot is pretty irristiable if you're a fan of films like Night of The Hunter or much more on the mark comparison wise The Gingerbread Man a much better film i think this might make an interesting companion piece to sometime down the line The plot for those of you who don't already know essentially is Matthew McConaughey is a reporter who returns home to write a story about a convicted sheriff killer John Cusackthere seems to be a story involving the question of his actual guilt. Meanwhile McConaughey's hires his college drop out brother Zac Efron to do some driving around while he does his investigations. Cusack's convict has been having a steamy penpal relationship with a rather hot to trot Nicole Kidman. When Zach Efron first sets his eyes on herhe falls head over heels in love with herand things develop somewhat senselessly from there.I just want to state that everyone here is severely miscast with the exception of Macy Gray as the maid to the family the two brothers are fromif you have a film with these actors in it and the most effective performance comes from someone who's not known for being an actorthat's a major sign that something's not working right here. McConaughy and Kidman try their best to sell their characters' but both get tripped up by the script here. Its nice that Cusack and Kidman were given the chance to play someone so 180 degrees from their normal screen persona yet neither really seems to impress in their role Kidman makes the most of her character's trashinessand there are some turns in the later half that Kidman does her best to sell but the film almost completely lets her down in terms of character development....Cusack however is terrible herehe's supposed to be someone so hard headed and mean but when you first see him on screen you don't see the man the characters are seeing...you see Cusacki suppose director Lee Daniels was hoping to use Cusack's past screen performances here in order to sucker punch the audience with how much of a brute his character isbut this really only works against the film in that I kept asking myself Is he supposed to be like some of Cusack's prior characters or is this just something that wasn't intended? It actually would have made more sense if Cusack and McConaughey had switched roles and Cusack was the embittered reporter and McConaughey had been the southern brute because then at least the casting would have made some sort of sense. Efron is all right enough but i don't feel he especially offers any insight into what the character might be thinking or feelingit all seems to be what's on the page in the script and he's just playing that....but at least he doesn't take you out of the moviein fact one of the best things I can honestly say about this movie is that nothing really takes you out of the moviethe narrative does a good job of pushing through whatever plot obstacles the writing and performances seem to throw in its way and its that kind of pacing that helps keep the movie nicely watchable even when what your watching doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense.The movie is again fairly well pacedand you won't be bored watching what happensyou may have some questions and be rather disappointed where it all ends uphaving not read the book i can't say whether or not the ending was effective there but the ending of this film felt so tacked on and so arbitrary it was almost as if the screenwriter was just throwing up his hands and saying i guess i have to end this somehow. I suspect the book was a lot better in terms of character motivation and plot specifics but there were definitely some questionable character behaviorthings that seem completely out of the blue based on what we had already seen from these characters on screen already but whatever i guess. The movie is also plot and character and acting aside nicely visualizedLee Daniels really does a fine job putting a visual stamp on Efron's obsessive lust for Kidman's character and the atmosphere of the southern swamps where Cusack's character lived as an alligator skinner resulting in a really gross scene where you see an alligator being skinned and its innards fall completely out in complete closeupits actually kind of awesome Daniels' seems to be trying to go for a real 70's like atmosphere here style wiseand I would say he pulls it off quite nicelysome of the jittery jump cuts of Kidman or the gauzily lit ways Efron day dreams of Kidman are presentedand the soundtrack is nicely handled too.So when all is said and done you have a halfway watchable movie here but one that is almost so completely bogged down by plot questions sketchy characterizations and some pretty bad casting decisions that it almost feels like it was trying so hard to impress and be a wonderfully sleazy classic for the ages that they let some of the more important and basic things a movie needs to nail down slide by without checking to see if these movie basics actually work. Of course none of this will really matter when you stumble across it on cable TV at 3 in the morning where it will keep your attention and hook you in that you'll want to keep watching even though you know you should probably turn it off way that sometimes movies at that time do.".

Kidman was the perfect amount of sexy broken and mysterious. Cusack played an incredibly creepy deadeyed sociopath and McConaughey even stepped up to do quite well. While the plot line was odd and brutal the last 15 minutes had me in between a state of shock and sadness. For some reason it was a very emotional movie for me sort of like Requiem For A Dream another movie I highly recommend to those who appreciate the weirdly artistic and psychologically grotesque films.

	schema:reviewBody "Brace yourself for one of the biggest Bollywood chickflicks in recent history. Although I seriously doubt how many chicks will really like this movie!!! First of all I'm not sure if this movie was intended to be a parody of all the classic Bollywood love stories or that is just wanted to use the clichs for the entertainment factor. I cannot understand that when the lead pair is good looking young and reasonably talented why would the director not put more effort into making an original love story? We have been subjected to Hollywood rip offs for so long.....but seriously Mr Director Bollywood rip offs are in no way better!!! For heavens sake let the classics remain classics. With the exception of the opening scenes of the film which revive memories of some of the hit love stories of the past DDLJ Dil Kehta Hai and Hum Tum I didn't see the point of making any further reference to past movies. The director has tried to humorously incorporate all the clichs of the great Bollywood love stories and tried to give it a modern twist as in Om Shanti Om......but unfortunately there is nothing new or different about this movie. It just didn't work.Sonam is as cute as a button. She is surely one of the most beautiful actresses we have in our industry today. Her character however is silly and superficial. Imran is cool and can easily pass of for the playboy types but he seriously needs to learn how to emote. He does well in the scenes where he is supposed to be cool and funny but when the time comes for him to profess his love he might as well be talking to a wall! I hope he takes some tips from his famous maamu. I wish I could say that I loved the chemistry between the lead pair....but I would be lying through my teeth. And please what was with Soman's loser BF always color coordinating his clothes with her?? Is that supposed to indicate the depth of love or something?? The trait of a good director is to put hisher point across without being ridiculous in the process! The reason I gave this movie 5 stars I am being extremely generous here is because I think both Sonam and Imran look great and have the potential to be good actors some of the humorous dialogues were original the music of the film is hummable Imran's fat friend was funny at times and the cinematography was generally good.".

	onyx:emotionText "Brace yourself for one of the biggest Bollywood chickflicks in recent history. Although I seriously doubt how many chicks will really like this movie!!! First of all I'm not sure if this movie was intended to be a parody of all the classic Bollywood love stories or that is just wanted to use the clichs for the entertainment factor. I cannot understand that when the lead pair is good looking young and reasonably talented why would the director not put more effort into making an original love story? We have been subjected to Hollywood rip offs for so long.....but seriously Mr Director Bollywood rip offs are in no way better!!! For heavens sake let the classics remain classics. With the exception of the opening scenes of the film which revive memories of some of the hit love stories of the past DDLJ Dil Kehta Hai and Hum Tum I didn't see the point of making any further reference to past movies. The director has tried to humorously incorporate all the clichs of the great Bollywood love stories and tried to give it a modern twist as in Om Shanti Om......but unfortunately there is nothing new or different about this movie. It just didn't work.Sonam is as cute as a button. She is surely one of the most beautiful actresses we have in our industry today. Her character however is silly and superficial. Imran is cool and can easily pass of for the playboy types but he seriously needs to learn how to emote. He does well in the scenes where he is supposed to be cool and funny but when the time comes for him to profess his love he might as well be talking to a wall! I hope he takes some tips from his famous maamu. I wish I could say that I loved the chemistry between the lead pair....but I would be lying through my teeth.

The main problem is that nothing happens! They keep repeating the same point over and over again. Also there was no real chemistry between the lead pair. There were a few funny dialogues but not enough to save the film. Imran Khan delivers his dialogues really well except for a couple of scenes where I thought he actually wanted to laugh. Sonam should hang up her acting hat. She wouldn't know how to say a sentence with emotion if it came and bit her in the you know where.

	schema:headline " A youthful movie in looks but too old  dull in content.";
	schema:reviewBody "To begin with I would like to mention all the young and energetic names associated with this movie. First of its reputed banner of Karan Johar who himself is known as a Master of Love Stories. Secondly it is directed by a debutant young director Punit Malhotra who is the nephew of famous fashion designer Manish Malhotra. And then it has the two most energetic  talented names Imran Khan  Sonam Kapoor who look adorable as a couple on the screen. So obviously one is forced to expect something new fresh and novel in terms of content from a talented ensemble like this.But shockingly what is served is neither something new nor it has any kind of fresh or innovative treatment given by the director to captivate his audience. Very unexpectedly the film is as predictable as the night coming after the day. In straight words the only USP of the movie is its fresh paring of the lead actors and thats it.Before the intermission the proceedings are cute and the sequences are fine but you simply keep watching them only because you are expecting something new to unfold on the screen any moment. But nothing happens of that sort and post interval the film moves on to the same ages old path of realizing the mistakes and returning to the lady love as usual. However the director does throw few funny one liner dialogues and some comic sequences to give you the much required relief at regular intervals. But that's really not enough for the hungry viewers who were expecting a lot from this big movie. Talking about the storyline you can easily guess it by only looking at its various posters for a while. The plot of hatred within a young couple working together getting converted into love is known to the Indian Viewers as Rice in their daily meals. Interestingly both Imran Khan and Sonam Kapoor have only few releases to their credits till now and they are also known for their extremely choosy nature and rejection of scripts after their recent flops. But I simply couldn't understand that out of all the scripts being offered to them why did they choose this particular one which was only a rehashed version of many other HIT Love stories of the past and had nothing of its own as original. May be the director also convinced his producers on the basis of some new kind of treatment he had in mind for the overused plot. But unfortunately the fresh treatment is not visible on the screen in any frame and he completely misses the big opportunity given to him by the makers.Coming to the other aspects of the film it no doubt excels in its technical departments namely in its Styling Cinematography Production Values and the Soundtrack. But sadly everything else takes a back seat if you have nothing to offer as far as the main content of the movie goes.Imran Khan looks fine in both aspects of his character but again why did he agree to do a role quite similar to the one he had already done in Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na. Sonam looks amazing on the screen and has a fresh magnetic power in her beauty. She performs well in her role of a Set Designer but with not a single HIT in her career till now she got to be extra cautious to choose her future projects after IHLS. Samir Soni who plays a Bollywood director in the movie resembling Sanjay Leela Bhansal's persona is OK. Samir Dattani underplays it well playing Sonam's boyfriend. Aamir Ali as the HERO is impressive but Pooja Ghai as the HEROINE doesn't get enough lines or scenes. Ketaki Dave  Anju Mahendru too have nothing much to do in the screenplay. But out of the entire supporting cast Bruna Abdullah and Kavin Dave of Sprite Commercial fame truly stand out. In reality the most enjoyable scenes of the movie are the ones featuring Kavin Dave as Imran's friend.Musically IHLS holds the merit with few good numbers composed by VishalShekhar out of which the Title Track is surely the best. The Background score also proves its presence in the movie smartly. Another engaging aspect of IHLS is that throughout its entire screenplay the characters keep pointing towards some big names in a taunting way. The movie starts with the actual film clipping of the Three Khans and there are continuous references to Sanjay Leela Bhansali and his movies such as Saawariya  Devdas. May be the writers were following the real life story of Sonam Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor who did actually worked as assistant directors to Sanjay Leela Bhansali at the start of their careers. A particular scene also talks about Aamir Khan and his Lagaan along with a dialogue pointing towards his forthcoming home production Peepli Live. And there are paintings and dance sequences used in the movie similar to Karan Johar's Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham.But here the strange paradox is that even after sarcastically talking about all the big names and Hit movies in his film the director Puneet Malhotra himself comes out with a product which is quite mediocre in execution and content in comparison to all. In other words a debutant director like him should have essentially worked on his own project first to prove his caliber before making mockery of some reputed names of the Industry.To sum up if you can appreciate love stories made with the same seen before familiar moves and if you really rate the starcast more important than the movie itself then you may like IHLS. But for me it's a project which had some great potential only before its release. Sharing a common theme with the 2009 release I Hate Valentine's Day it comprises of only one visual treat and that's Sonam Kapoor alone.".

As the saying goes if you can't beat them join them.However it has its youthful eye candy cast added to its advantage as it plods through its rather meandering and cumbersome plot involving J Imran Khan a production assistant who has worked on countless of romantic films by hotshot director Veer Kapoor Samir Soni and Simran Sonam Kapoor who is employed under the same production umbrella. To J work means a constant rolling of the eyes because he just doesn't subscribe to nor see the appeal of formulaic romantic movies even if his employer is the best in the business. And for Simran it's just the reverse feeling privileged to be part of movie magic as she expounds her own blissfully perfect relationship with fianc Raj Sammir Dattani.So begins the clash of the believer and the nonbeliever made worst when J is ordered to be working under Simran who is the new art director for Veer's upcoming love saga Pyar Pyar Pyar which I have to admit that writerdirector Punit Malhotra managed to weave in a film in production within a film that drew nice touches of parallels between J and Simran's developing love affair until the final act which somehow had to conform to hammed up clichs. On one hand I thought it was quite brilliant to get the audience engaged through two levels one which is the reality the characters live in and the other the ultrahyped film reality which exists in Pyar Pyar Pyar with extremely over the top performances and delivery used to elicit plenty of laughter especially from fans of Bollywood romances.We'd expect the usual clash of the opposites where J the noncommittal playboy unwittingly turns on his charm on the onthewaytoblissfulmarriage Simran who by the time the interval rolled by is at odds with wanting to settle down with the man she thought will provide that level of stability through routine or someone who's more of the livewire even if you started out hating the guts of the person? The story seems to play on the theme of close proximity having that big a role to play in demolishing stability and like all nicely crafted clichs which you can see coming from a mile away J and Simran inevitably fall in love which takes one of them by surprise leading to plot development reserved for after the interval.If not for the young film starlets as the leads it'll be quite hard to imagine how love can make them do silly things with plenty of assumptions drawn up that the characters inevitably fall for. Nothing new gets added to the flavour of the story and while it doesn't stand out it also doesn't fall flat on its face as well making this a simple breezy romantic tale to sit through. Imran Khan pulls through his J quite effortlessly since I suppose the easygoing good natured guy is almost always easier to play as opposed to Sonam Kapoor's emotional Simran who has ample opportunity to show her acting chops in what's only her third major role in her film career compared to contemporary peers such as Ranbir Kapoor or even Deepika Padukone.Perhaps the only thread of interest here to sustain your attention will be the numerous film references from dialogues to sets and even downright spoofs or if you're the incurable romantic then yes this film will be right up your alley.".

	schema:headline " I hated this story.... the cast the production everything!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "I was obliged to see this movie by my classmates who kept importuning me for not accompanying them for the films. I normally try to evade them as their main interest is the masala Hindi flicks devoid of credible acting teemed with amateurish clichs and ostentatious drama and completed with a happy ending. This film highlights the tumultuous love 'saga' as they mentioned of Simran and Jay. Their relationship is equated into Jay's and then Simran's rejection with the other. By the time love pervades the movie becomes drab and overlong. The main concern of this trainwreck is the impertinent appendages made by the scriptwriter to generate laughter which includes the character of the director to go bananas whenever he converses with Jay and only because he is a director and has to emote. Bottomline He ain't that funny!Another irrelevant inclusion is the screentime provided to Aamir Ali who can decimate robots a cryonically frozen primeval being a senile turtle and a meditating ascetic in terms of facial contortions and expressions. In the first interaction with Jay he comes across as an egotistical and cocky actor who personifies selfimportance. He is constantly lulling after chicks and asks Jay whether there were any hot ones on the set. In the next shot he is playacting a scene where he is supposed to be comforting his lover who's evidently on the deathbed. His countenance is so inexpressive and inflexible I wonder why such an acclaimed director  as the director in the movie proclaims would cast such a weak lead. At least the lady who plays the actress seems more actressy. Then towards the end he talks to Imran about his butt and to wear tight jeans to attract ladies. I could palpably see why the director wanted to include that scene. Dostana made people laugh I was bored though and gay references are a fad now. So in the end when Jay cheekily tells him that he has a great butt in front of girls he feels abashed and the girls distance themselves from him. But the scenes are so desperately seeking better comictiming and cheesy giggles that it all falls flat. Please promote anyone but Aamir Ali because he seems to be the posterity of the Grand Old Oak trees. Another bad apple was Sameer Soni as the whimsical director who made one commercial hit after another. He seems to be raising colonies of red forest ants in his pants as he keeps shouting at all times. But in the end he somehow manages to influence Imran Khan everyone who seems bad acts good towards the end to raise the actor's spirit and make him fall in love. But I think I have seen such characters before.A sour mango was Sonam who in the process of looking beautiful has exfoliated all the layers of acting and emotions. Now she seems to be a mordant beautyqueen who simple has to faces a happy one and a bitter one. She is supposed to be addicted to love stories and feels that she is living in a dreamily lovable world where everything is right but realizes that its not and falls for the right wrong guy in the end. But like most other actresses in modern Bollywood she seems to have foregone the depth that she could have added to her performance. She looks tangy in one scene then sweet in the other then tangy then again sweet and so on. Its like watching a cycle ride a uniformly bumpy path where the bumps are equally distanced from one another.Imran too hasn't proved much in the film except that he is now completely a commercial actor i.e one that inexorably has to look buffed and beefy sprouting a bodybuilder physique and having shallow acting skills or at least pretending to have one. He horribly emoted in the sad scenes not even trying hard to show his love. HE tells Sonam I don't know how but I have fallen in love with you or something like that but in the end is left heartbroken. Well even Rosie O'Donnell would have refused the offer because he recites those lines devoid of any realization. Another thing I noticed was the increasing emulation of Aamir Khan in the film that he tries to do but falters miserably. He raises his eyebrows unnecessarily and talks more like the former. A few words of advice Do not become Harman Baweja. Then there is the protuberant friend of Jay who plays the same way he does in the countless commercials that he appears in. Another caricature becomes does he alas....Another thing that bugged me infinitely was the abnormally high usage of voiceover used childishly in the movie. Have nothing to take the story forward  use voiceovers. I advice the director to watch Adaptation where the voiceover has been adeptly incorporated.The songs seemed uninspired and flaccid the screenplay riddled with idiosyncrasies and the acting gives a looming feeling of boredom. Jaane Tu was implausible and a bit stupid but had a few watchable moments but this has none. A commercial claptrap like this deserves a 2 out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "I was obliged to see this movie by my classmates who kept importuning me for not accompanying them for the films. I normally try to evade them as their main interest is the masala Hindi flicks devoid of credible acting teemed with amateurish clichs and ostentatious drama and completed with a happy ending. This film highlights the tumultuous love 'saga' as they mentioned of Simran and Jay. Their relationship is equated into Jay's and then Simran's rejection with the other. By the time love pervades the movie becomes drab and overlong. The main concern of this trainwreck is the impertinent appendages made by the scriptwriter to generate laughter which includes the character of the director to go bananas whenever he converses with Jay and only because he is a director and has to emote.

	schema:headline " Don't demand too much and you'll be happy...";
	schema:reviewBody "It's been several months since we've seen anything frothy and fun from Dharma Productions and Karan Johar. Karan attempted achieving cinematic maturity with his Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna and My Name is Khan but frankly his earlier K movies were a lot more fun Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Kabhie Khushi Kabhi Gham mainly because they had Shah Rukh and Kajol in unadulterated romantic mode. Over the past couple of years Karan Johar has shrewdly mentored new younger talent and produced a number of maiden efforts for debutant directors the charmingly silly Dostana the pitchperfect Wake Up Sid! Wake Up Sid! and Luck By Chance are the BEST debuts in recent Hindi film history and the slick Kurban.Similarly I Hate Luv Storys boasts a freshly minted director Punit Malhotra nephew of Manish Malhotra the designer who has kept Hindi film heroines in sequins and chiffons for over a decade. The new film put me off with its gimmicky misspelled title but I enjoyed watching Sonam Kapoor in Delhi6 and Imran Khan in Jaane Tuya Jaane Na so I trooped off to catch it on opening day in North America.For a film whose protagonist claims to be antiromantic clichs as defined in Hindi masala films it certainly takes a lot of artistic license with reality of the kind that you and I experience most of the time. Simran the leading lady is a movie art director who works for the most successful director of formulaic Hindi blockbuster love stories while monolettered J for Jayant Dhingra but that's not hipthe selfstyled cool dude herois an Assistant Director with aspirations of directing real cinema real soon but marking time with this job.In a twist I've never seen in my film work the director of the film within the film dispatches his A.D. to work as props buyer for the art director. Hmmm usually it's folks with the demonstrated skills and most appropriate experience or sensibilities that are assigned such jobs. Very rarelyif everdoes one come across such interdepartmental transfers. But I'm quibbling if this didn't happen just how would Simran and J get to spend much time with each other given that they are chalk and cheese and their initial meetings are anything but felicitous? His best attempts at irony are construed by her as abrasiveness how cute is that! Simran and J spend the rest of the movie making sporadic stabs at playing Art Director and A.DProps Buyer whenever they are not surreptitiously sneaking longing looks at each other which is pretty much ALL the time.Of course Simran is the ultimate girly girl and has a perfect fianc a drip actuallythroughout the movie he wears shirts that match his girlfriend's clothes named Raj. If you miss the reference to the 90s hit Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge don't worry. Punit Malhotra and his writers will clobber you over the head with the filmi references till you beg for mercy or whimper Bachao!. The film within the film appears to be a pastiche of all the films from the Yashraj and Dharma Productions oeuvre in recent memory. Lines songs and entire scenes are lifted parodied and cannibalized to emphasize how unoriginal and creatively lazy Hindi films are capable of being and are most of the time.There is some deliciously nonsensical business like the prima donna director demanding exactly four drops no more no less of rain falling on his leading lady's dewy cheek. Toocoolforschool A.D. J rolls his eyes andto the director's delightsquirts exactly four drops out of a squeeze bottle. The goofy swaggering oversexed hero of the film within the film has all the stereotypical traits of movie leading men but surprisingly ends up giving J a sound bit of advice.

	onyx:emotionText "It's been several months since we've seen anything frothy and fun from Dharma Productions and Karan Johar. Karan attempted achieving cinematic maturity with his Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna and My Name is Khan but frankly his earlier K movies were a lot more fun Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Kabhie Khushi Kabhi Gham mainly because they had Shah Rukh and Kajol in unadulterated romantic mode. Over the past couple of years Karan Johar has shrewdly mentored new younger talent and produced a number of maiden efforts for debutant directors the charmingly silly Dostana the pitchperfect Wake Up Sid! Wake Up Sid! and Luck By Chance are the BEST debuts in recent Hindi film history and the slick Kurban.Similarly I Hate Luv Storys boasts a freshly minted director Punit Malhotra nephew of Manish Malhotra the designer who has kept Hindi film heroines in sequins and chiffons for over a decade. The new film put me off with its gimmicky misspelled title but I enjoyed watching Sonam Kapoor in Delhi6 and Imran Khan in Jaane Tuya Jaane Na so I trooped off to catch it on opening day in North America.For a film whose protagonist claims to be antiromantic clichs as defined in Hindi masala films it certainly takes a lot of artistic license with reality of the kind that you and I experience most of the time. Simran the leading lady is a movie art director who works for the most successful director of formulaic Hindi blockbuster love stories while monolettered J for Jayant Dhingra but that's not hipthe selfstyled cool dude herois an Assistant Director with aspirations of directing real cinema real soon but marking time with this job.In a twist I've never seen in my film work the director of the film within the film dispatches his A.D. to work as props buyer for the art director. Hmmm usually it's folks with the demonstrated skills and most appropriate experience or sensibilities that are assigned such jobs. Very rarelyif everdoes one come across such interdepartmental transfers. But I'm quibbling if this didn't happen just how would Simran and J get to spend much time with each other given that they are chalk and cheese and their initial meetings are anything but felicitous? His best attempts at irony are construed by her as abrasiveness how cute is that! Simran and J spend the rest of the movie making sporadic stabs at playing Art Director and A.DProps Buyer whenever they are not surreptitiously sneaking longing looks at each other which is pretty much ALL the time.Of course Simran is the ultimate girly girl and has a perfect fianc a drip actuallythroughout the movie he wears shirts that match his girlfriend's clothes named Raj. If you miss the reference to the 90s hit Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge don't worry. Punit Malhotra and his writers will clobber you over the head with the filmi references till you beg for mercy or whimper Bachao!. The film within the film appears to be a pastiche of all the films from the Yashraj and Dharma Productions oeuvre in recent memory. Lines songs and entire scenes are lifted parodied and cannibalized to emphasize how unoriginal and creatively lazy Hindi films are capable of being and are most of the time.There is some deliciously nonsensical business like the prima donna director demanding exactly four drops no more no less of rain falling on his leading lady's dewy cheek. Toocoolforschool A.D. J rolls his eyes andto the director's delightsquirts exactly four drops out of a squeeze bottle. The goofy swaggering oversexed hero of the film within the film has all the stereotypical traits of movie leading men but surprisingly ends up giving J a sound bit of advice. What's lovely is that both of them are tipsy and we're never sure if the guy has unexpected depth or it was merely the alcohol talking.The shifts between poking derisive fun at Hindi formula films and then ferociously tugging at the heart strings using those same filmi tropes aren't smooth.

She works in Mumbai as a movie art director. She is in love with Raj Dholakia her fianc whom her mother favours. Veer Kapoor Simran's boss assigns Jay Dhingra to work in the same department as Simran friction arises. She's a sentimentalist he loathes romance.So how will the love triangle proceed?The project they will be working is on location in New Zealand. Do we ever get there?

Raj tells Simran he's going to Delhi he hopes his old Simran is present when he comes back.Simran thinks she's fallen in love with Jay but he's still a dog. She is rather hurt when she catches him with another woman. She tells him her feelings and he tells her sentimental love is nonsense. She agrees and gets rather depressed. He finds that he misses her smile. She breaks up with Raj. She leaves early for the new project. Jay has a lot of regrets with musical accompaniment. He tries his old stomping grounds to pick up someone but fails for lack of will. Eventually he goes to the project in New Zealand and starts seeing Simran again.Oh this goes on forever. Raj shows up on set as well just to make things interesting.Jay goes direct to Simran but she tells him she just cannot go through loving him again. He tries indirect via Giselle for the jealousy angle. Liked the 'blah blah blah' scenes with Raj Simran and Giselle.Raj and Simran get married. Raj and her parents are happy but Simran is not. Ah too bad.So how will this resolve? With multiple clichs of course.ScoresCinematography 1010 Varies from competent plus to extremely beautiful.Sound 1010 No problems. Incidental music is a bit florid but lovely to the ear.Acting 310 Imran Khan minus four. Sanom Kapoor minus three. The movie sinks or swims with these two given the proportion of screen time spent on them. They are irritating while not entertaining. Otherwise dull but competent performances.Screenplay 410 This would have been a nice 20 minute short. The film is low in content long on making Jay look like an idiot. He completed that task in the first three or four minutes on screen. Continuing to beat the dead horse is not helpful. Raj is made out to be a placeholder punching bag so the level of romantic tension is always underwater.Musical Numbers 610 First one I Hate Luv Storys was OK. Second Jay making fun of sentimental Indian films not nearly as good. Third Simran and Jay spending time together fine singing but I missed the dancing. Fourth Simran and Jay dancing in public singing good but short. Fifth in movie dance and song was rather nice.....'Lost and Lonely' was beautiful as was the number where Jay is daydreaming during a shoot beneath the mountains in NZ.".

Entry Sonam Kapoor who's a 'DDLJ' kinda a girl who gives her heart to the antilove youngster. Thus follows a series of events of complications jealousy and unwanted emotional melodrama.'I Hate Luv Storys' is not a bad film but in fact a boring film. If the firsthour has it's moments the secondhour plays a complete spoilsport. The culmination is the weakest link.

I sincerely believe that one needs intelligence to even cleverly copy or properly insult someone else s work. This lame and boring movie has no intelligence to do either  it makes fun of love stories  even going to the extent of saying love stories are clichd and then repeats the clich in every possible manner emulating love stories we have seen a dozen times before. Not just the broad outlines but even the subplots are picked from somewhere. Samir Dattani gives a white flower to Sonam every time they meet  uhhh..subodh from DCH anyone?! .The background score of KJO's past movies in almost every 3rd scene made me start hating him!! Imran khan should stick to cool and cynical  he can't emote to save his life and stop aping his uncle. The female character is the role of a dumb  confused bimbo to the hilt. Why oh why can't directors create humorous  witty female characters who can actually give back sharp comments instead of just raising eyebrows and laughing silly. She consistently maintains her dumb routine even when a nobody subordinate makes fun of her fiance. Really despite the fact that all her movies come through her dad's undying efforts sonam kapoor can do better. I am not even going to comment on the other characters  I feel really sorry for them actually.I don't know who the target audience was for the director because the story was juvenile even for teenagers. I am still thinking if there was anything good in the movie  oh yes I didn't really watch the entire movie. !!".

	schema:reviewBody "I caught up with this movie on TV after 30 years or more. Several aspects of the film stood out even when viewing it so many years after it was made.The story by the little known C Virgil Georghiu is remarkable almost resembling a Tolstoylike story of a man buffeted by a cosmic scheme that he cannot comprehend. Compare this film with betterknown contemporary works such as Spelberg's Schindler's List and you begin to realize the trauma of the World War II should be seen against the larger canvas of racism beyond the simplistic Nazi notion of Aryan vs Jews. This film touches on the Hungarians dislike for the Romanians the Romanians dislike of the Russians and so on..even touching on the Jews' questionable relationships with their Christian Romanian friends while under stress.As I have not read the book it is difficult to see how much has been changed by the director and screenplay writers. For instance it is interesting to study the Romanian peasant's view of emigrating to USA with the view of making money only to return to Romania and invest his earnings there.   In my opinion the character of Johann Moritz was probably one of the finest roles played by Anthony Quinn ranking alongside his work in La StradaZorba the Greek and Barabbas. The finest and most memorable sequence in the film is the final one with Anthony Quinn and Virna Lisi trying to smile. The father carrying a daughter born out his wife's rape by Russians is a story in itself but the director is able to show the reconciliation by a simple gesturethe act of carrying the child without slipping into melodramatic footage.Today after the death of Princess Diana we often remark about the insensitive paparazzi. The final sequence is an indictment of the paparazzi and the insensitive media director Verneuil also makes a similar comment during the court scene as the cameramen get ready to pounce on Moritz.The interaction between Church and State was so beautifully summed up in the orthodox priest's laconic statement I pray to God that He guides those who have power to use them well. Some of the brief shots such as those of a secretary of a minister doodling while listening to a petitionsaid so much in so little footage. The direction was so impressive that the editing takes a back seat.   Finally what struck me most was the exquisite rich texture of colors provided by the cameraman Andreas Windingfrom the brilliant credit sequences to the end. I recalled that he was the cameraman of another favorite French film of mine called Ramparts of Clay directed by JeanLouis Bertucelli. I have not seen such use of colors in a long while save for the David Lean epics.There were flaws I wish Virna Lisi's character was more fleshed out. I could never quite understand the Serge Reggiani characterthe only intellectual in the entire film. The railroad station scene at the end seems to be lifted out of Sergio Leone westerns. Finally the film was essentially built around a love story that unfortunately takes a back seat.To sum up this film impressed me in more departments than one. The story is relevant today as it was when it was made.".

In my opinion the character of Johann Moritz was probably one of the finest roles played by Anthony Quinn ranking alongside his work in La StradaZorba the Greek and Barabbas. The finest and most memorable sequence in the film is the final one with Anthony Quinn and Virna Lisi trying to smile. The father carrying a daughter born out his wife's rape by Russians is a story in itself but the director is able to show the reconciliation by a simple gesturethe act of carrying the child without slipping into melodramatic footage.Today after the death of Princess Diana we often remark about the insensitive paparazzi. The final sequence is an indictment of the paparazzi and the insensitive media director Verneuil also makes a similar comment during the court scene as the cameramen get ready to pounce on Moritz.The interaction between Church and State was so beautifully summed up in the orthodox priest's laconic statement I pray to God that He guides those who have power to use them well. Some of the brief shots such as those of a secretary of a minister doodling while listening to a petitionsaid so much in so little footage. The direction was so impressive that the editing takes a back seat.   Finally what struck me most was the exquisite rich texture of colors provided by the cameraman Andreas Windingfrom the brilliant credit sequences to the end. I recalled that he was the cameraman of another favorite French film of mine called Ramparts of Clay directed by JeanLouis Bertucelli. I have not seen such use of colors in a long while save for the David Lean epics.There were flaws I wish Virna Lisi's character was more fleshed out. I could never quite understand the Serge Reggiani characterthe only intellectual in the entire film. The railroad station scene at the end seems to be lifted out of Sergio Leone westerns. Finally the film was essentially built around a love story that unfortunately takes a back seat.To sum up this film impressed me in more departments than one. The story is relevant today as it was when it was made.";

	schema:headline " A Haunting Kafkaesque Tale And IMHO Anthony Quinn's BEST Role";
	schema:reviewBody "I was reading reports of the John Demjanjuk trial today and it immediately reminded me of this film. Like most others I haven't seen this film in over 20 years and Quinn who in my opinion gives his BEST performance ever is luminous as Johann Moritz a simple Romanian peasant who is caught up as the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time throughout World War 2 and has absolutely no idea why. Yet through the entire story he never loses his essential goodness compassion and humanity.Spoilers Follow Quinn plays Moritz as an easygoing Romanian peasant married to Verna Lisi who is coveted by the local police chief. Falsely denounced by the Chief as a Jew he is shipped off to a concentration camp with the other Jews of his town. While an inmate with his friends in the Concentration camp he is spotted by an SS officer from the Nazi Office of Racial Purity who questions him about his background and ancestry. As a result he is pronounced of Pure Aryan blood by the SS given a job in the SS guarding the same camp where he was formerly an inmate and publicized in the German propaganda of the day. He uses his new position to smuggle food to his friends and ultimately saves their lives by killing the other SS guards who want to execute them. Captured by the Russians he is thrown into prison for three years until he is tried as a War Criminal only to be acquitted because of the testimony of the Jewish friends whose lives he saved.Throughout the film Moritz never loses his essential humanity and acts out of love and friendship to do the right thing. Quinn inhabits the role of Moritz and displays the gamut of emotions far beyond even La Strada or Zorba. Many have compared this film to Schndler's List but I think a more apt comparison would be to Agniezka Holland's Europa Europa or Jiri Menzel's I Served The King Of England as similar stories. Henri Verneuil's direction captures the Romanian peasant society perfectly while illustrating that ethnic prejudice was not confined to GermansJewish alone. Verna Lisi's performance is among her finest and the rest of the supporting cast are equally welldone.As a result of all this I actually found New DVD copies of this film available on Amazon.com. I ordered a copy for myself and HIGHLY recommend it to everybody else. SEE THIS FILM. If you're like me and most other reviewers here it will simultaneously uplift your spirits and haunt you for years as it illustrates the fundamental absurdity of War and Hate.".

Evil is as evil does.This movie teaches a valuable lesson and I recommend it especially to e.g. church groups or civil rights organizations.I don't expect it will be too easy to find and rent but I'd really like to see it again because there is one amazing scene in it which gives a totally unintentional yet interesting glimpse of the banal intricacies of race expertise. In this scene the protaganist who was taken prisoner by the Nazis at the beginning of the war is discovered by an SS race authority and ushered into a room. There the two play a sort of guessing game where the SS officer is able to determine where our hero Anthony Quinn's character came from  and where his ancestors came from. Well come to find out that Quinn's character isn't a member of an inferior race after all but to the contrary he's a perfect archtypical Aryan! Which doesn't mean a whole lot to Quinn's character who is more interested in talking about the towns rivers and mountain ranges that the SS guy had just been naming... Nevertheless being a perfect Aryan archetype has its perks. Among other things he gets to leave his job in a slave labor factory where he wears striped rags and into a slave modeling job where he gets to wear tailored Nazi uniforms. Yeah it's a better gig for sure for a guy who always did appreciate wearing nice clothes... until the Allied armies arrive and recognize his face from magazine covers.".

It seems a bit far fetched to have happened for real but one never knows....

In 1967 Anthony Quinn was at the peak of his acting career and popularity. Three years before he had brought to screen Alexis Zorba the most memorable of his characters in Zorba the Greek. A year later he was going to be Leon Alastray in Guns for San Sebastian and another year after mayor Bombolini in The Secret of Santa Vittoria. The director was Henri Verneuil also close to the peak of his career. The book that inspired the movie however had been published almost two decades earlier in 1949 the same year that Orwell published his '1984'. The reference is not simply coincidental. While there is a gap of fame and maybe also of literary quality between the two books 'Ora 25' written by a Romanian exiled named Constatin Virgil Gheorghiu who was running away from the Communist regime that had taken over his country and Orwell's masterpiece deal with the same theme  the absurdity of the fate of the single individuals crushed by the wheels of history.While Orwell's '1984' was looking into the future making the novel to belong to the genre of political futuristic dystopia Gheorghiu's novel was set in the recent past and derived directly from his personal experience in the Second World War . There are some problems here which people familiar with the biography of the writer and the history of Romania before and during WWII will recognize but which will be lost to many other viewers of the film. The film starts in 1939 in a quasiidyllic Romania where peasants prosper but racial laws against the Jews start to be implemented. This may be almost right only the details in the movie are wrong. Deportation of Jews to work camps did not begin until 1941 when Romania entered the war as a ally of Germany. Germany did not occupy Romania in October 1940 as claimed in the movie. There were German troops in the country but that's different they were allied to Romania. It was not king Carol who started the deportations and in October 1940 he was gone having abdicated one month earlier after Romania had lost parts of his territory to the USSR Hungary and Bulgaria. The real responsibility of most of the Jewish persecutions and deportations was the regime of the fascist dictator Ion Antonescu the one under which writer Virgil Gheorghiu served as a minor rank diplomat. There is a subtle but hard to accept deformation of history here and a dose of selfdissolution in his own identification with the main character and with another supporting character the antifascist writer role played by Serge Reggiani who in the film Writes a book with the same name.All these historical details are important for the historical record for Romanians and Jews who lived the period and their successors. Not that much maybe for the film itself. The story of the Romanian peasant denounced and deported as a Jew by the chief of the police in the village who had a look at his beautiful and virtuous wife Virna Lisi develops as a Kafkaesque story of injustice and struggle to survive in the Absurd universe of Europe devastated by war. Anthony Quinn the eternal optimist and unbreakable human being from Zorba builds on another character of the same caliber. We must appreciate however the courageous approach of the authors of the script and especially of director Henri Verneuil who dared balance horror and humor in describing the saga of the wanderings of Johann  Yankele Moritz  successively confused as Jew Romanian spy Nazi  always On the losing side always beaten but never lose hope. At the time when the WWII conflict was still described on screens on heroic style and manichaeistic terms the authors of this film created an emotional and human story and a character that anticipates by almost three decades those in the films of Radu Mihaileanu and Roberto Benigni about the Holocaust. After an initial quite conventional start the viewer will now discover a movie with a catching story deep meaning and wonderful acting.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film tells us a story of highsociety prostitution corruption power and money but it is essentially a good portrait of Portuguese society nowadays! The plot is very well conceived and touches in some crucial points which are rotten in our society We all know that money and sex are the things that make the world turn around and this movie proves it clearly! The plot is about the president of a little village in the south Portugal between Alentejo and the Algarve and a touristic project that he didn't want to approve because it would cause a major impact on the local environment. But behind this project there was an important multinational with too much power and they don't want to give up from the project because there's too much money involved so they use a dirty way to catch him They contract a highsociety call girl Maria played by Soraia Chaves to seduce the President Meireles played by Nicolau Breyner and control him to the point of making him sign the project. Beautiful as she is Meireles was caught from the first moment! He didn't resist as expected! Beside from the beginning of the plot we also follow two detectives of Polcia Judiciaria Madeira Ivo Canelas and Neves Jose Raposo that by chance get noticed of this crime of corruption and start investigating. The result you will see in the end of the movie That's why this country is like it is! I won't spoil the end of the movie because I think that is right there where is the main social critic of this movie and even being a bit predictable I think it's a good ending which doesn't deserve to be spoiled! About the acting I think it's very good from generally all actors. Soraia Chaves does a great job. She's beautiful and she does perfectly this role of Call Girl because she fits very well in the character. I read somewhere that she said something like this I don't believe that will be the shapes of my body that will determinate the success of this movie In fact if in the first time I read that I laughed now I must say I agree with Soraia! There's no doubt that Soraia's nudity in this film works like an attraction to the viewer. Almost like Mr. President the viewer is caught by Soraia's beauty but this film has much more to offer besides it! It's a good social critic it has a nice storyplot acting production I think it's a very good movie to Portuguese standards! That's what Soraia meant to say I suppose So her nudity works just like marketing to attract the common Portuguese viewer that is so disbelieved in Portuguese cinema!...Nicolau Breyner also has an excellent performance much better that in his other recent Portuguese film CORRUPO Well generally I think this film is a good example of what Portuguese cinema can be. We need more like this one!".

Still the movie is quite well done it has pace some action characters are developed enough and of course the lead actress shows a lot of flesh. This flesh thing which may be one of the main reasons to attract the male crowd and the movie is being advertised mostly based on that not so minor item was an interesting surprise at least for a female viewer it's not that gratuitous. Well the girl is a hooker and you should understand what arguments she has to drive men crazy as she's supposed to and she does have plenty of those still the sex scenes are not graphic at all and in fact you never see any real in a cinematic sense of course interaction between her and her partners the most revealing scene is a onewomanshow. This said the acting is very acceptable with Nicolau Breyner the Mayor who's the Call Girl victim standing from the crowd a nice job from the other actors and even the modelturnedactress Soraia Chaves defends her role. Particularly interesting are the dialogs albeit all the swearing which sound very natural and realistic for what Portuguese cinema has gotten us used to.

A call girl when used as a means of corruption can be used in two ways by corrupting directly the man with her sexual performances or at certain point refusing to go on with them without huge payments which forces the man who fell in love with her to accept the proposal of the bribers or corrupters in order to pay her and not lose her. This is basically the movie story admirably told and admirably acted by all the performers including the two police inspectors that are trying along the whole movie to detect the corrupting business and arrest its intervenients.

Even though I am not a movie expert I believe that the comments made above by Rui Resende are a little bit too harsh. As a Portuguese citizen he should know that  we rarely produce such good movies. If this script would be produced in Hollywood it would certainly be a hit. So Thank you very much Mr. Vasconcelos.The movie starts with two different stories that eventually merge. On one hand we have this beautiful escort  obviously a magnificently gorgeous Portuguese brunette you will fall in love with her!  that desires a life of luxury. She gets hired by an old business partner Joaquim d' Almeida Clear and Present Danger Desperado Behind Enemy Lines The Chronicles of Riddick etc. to persuade this Mayor to approve a golf resort project in this traditional little town in Alentejo. On the other we have this ambitiousrebel young detective and his experienced partner that end up coming from Lisbon to investigate a couple of deaths in this little town  not related to the attempted bribery that is going on. After this point the movie continues at an exciting pace and the detectives end up investigating the bribery... there are a couple of surprises that definitely make this movie worth watching!!! As good as any other millionaire Hollywood production with similar kind of plot with the advantage of getting to know the Portuguese society and enjoy some beautiful scenarios. If I could improve something in this movie it would be solely the soundtrack.If you like movies about corruption and the vices of society then you will also enjoy Portugal S.A. like Resende mentioned above. Nonetheless I prefer Call Girl. Another recent Portuguese movie that may be worth watching is Corrupcao  I have not seen it yet. The latter is based on a book written by a former lover of the President of a main soccer team in Portugal F.C. Porto and assesses the bribery of referees and the dangerous connections between the soccer world and the local government  it has also beautiful shots including scenes in Santiago de Compostela Spain.Cheers!".

It might be a film of social impact Portugal SA made it 4 years ago with a relative success in America we might think of films such as 'Wall Street' 'All the president's men' or 'Wag the dog'. Can we link that to a noir driven construction? maybe. 'Wag the dog' did it. Here we have the detective we have a 'femme' maybe fatal. Let's talk about her The director and i suppose the collective will of Portuguese film goers is trying to define an image to our girl. She has talent i think she may have the looks if she's well used but she's got to have a cinematic personality. By now cinema gave us a full variety of female postures it's a matter of choosing what suits her best. I personally don't think she may be Marylin Monroe as it was hinted here even though mixed with the idea of controlling woman as say Sharon Stone probably performed it in the beginning of the nineties. But i frankly think she might have been a Hitch's blond but as a brunette i personally think a Portuguese femme fatal wouldn't be brunette... this is intuition or preconception i don't know. So by now i'd model Soraia Chaves after Novak Hedren and Kelly. She would not suit the HepburnHepburnRoberts tradition nor the parallel close shot tradition FalconettiKarinna. All these women live much on the face on the smile on expression. Soraia sticks better to my view to the small moves to the implicit actions she is more Dietrich than Monroe. But she also has sex stamped on her face as Hitchcock might have said. Or maybe she has been misportraited so far in her short career. Vasconcelos compared her to Ava Gardner it would be interesting to see Ava Gardner stick to her. Let us wait and see.Back to the plot we had the noir hints and the social flaws theme. But the game is opened the mystery is gone and besides the morality and real intentions of our girl there's little more to find out. So the noir which could work is gone. As noir i understand the ability to place the spectator behind the specific vision of a character here that one might have been Ivo Canelas and let the spectator know as much as that character but with the feeling that some outer force god superior character is moving the strings and pupeteering the whole action out of our site. The fact that Canelas had in fact a past relation with Soraia Chaves could work perfectly in this logic of superior forces fate... American cinema is exquisite in the way it handles with these things. In fact just before i went to the theatre to watch this i had seen Ace in the Hole by Wilder a non? author and this is all there the ambiguity on whether Douglas is writing the story or not and than who is writing it. A film has to come embedded on these deeper notions in order to fully work. Otherwise it's limp incomplete. That's a lesson one can take from American cinema and can't understand how Vasconcelos skipped it since he wrote the story. So from the moment the decision is to let the spectator get to know everything at stake every move on and of stage the interest in following this sticks to acting and directing. Here are the strong aspects of the film which make the whole experience worthwhile. The last expression in Nicolau Breyner's face is heartbreaking that ability Breyner had to tell us so much out of a face is something i'll keep with me wherever i go. The upper angle in that shot helps. And the whole direction is focused much more than the storyline or the scriptwriting. The editing is not perfect but it is competent Vasconcelos has a very interesting way to disapear in order to bring out his stories and specific scenes here he truly is what he intends to so his moves are always subtle and enough.So i believe we needed stronger writing here to bring all this to another level the kind of writing of 'Os imortais' which was much more clear focused and interesting. This one has problems with cinematic orthography and it kills a good part of the experienceMy opinion 35 the acting and directing make up partially for the flawshttpwww.7olhares.wordpress.com".

The escort Nick played by Dermot Mulroney isn't your average Gigolo. No he's what you would consider the cream of the crop and he doesn't come cheap. A cute nonthreatening premise for a genuinely cute nonthreatening romantic comedy.You can't go in expecting genius because that's not what you'll get. The Wedding Date however is a glorious indulgent movie that will leave you smiling. It's a movie for women by a woman director and it's really for any girl who ever wished she could have a happy ending like Cinderella. It's not all roses of course which keeps it interesting. It's all par for the course however when it comes to romantic comedies. Plus the few glimpses of a barebottomed Mulroney will keep you interested too.I ranked this movie an 8 out of 10. I wasn't comparing it to Gone with the Wind or the Godfather. I was comparing it to other cute romantic comedies and as far as they go this was a good one.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS THROUGHOUT.The wedding Date seems to be getting a lot of ratings of 1 and 10 respectively. I do not think this was either great or dreadful. The movie was most definitely entertaining and I loved the concept but there is no denying the movie had flaws.As far as romantic comedies go this one was pretty fun to view at times. What made it that way was Dermot Mulroney plain and simple. He played the part of the charismatic escort perfectly. His performance was a 10 of 10 and with a lesser actor in this role this movie could have potentially turned out dreadful because while Mulroney's Nick had an edge the rest of the movie certainly didn't.SPOILERS THROUGHOUT POSTWedding Date was a book first which I have happened to read I think it had a different title. The book was much better overall. There were a few major flaws here First the movie didn't develop Kat and Nick's relationship at all. When it starts she has already hired him. That alone is a problem because the audience is immediately thrust into watching the unfolding of a relationship between two people they've been given no time to develop any rapor with. The story is just thrust on us without any lead up or introduction. It's like there's an assumption we are supposed to know Kat and root for her but she's never even been properly introduced to us. I was a bit disappointed with the way the movie started with no leadup at all.Second is the unrealistic relationship between the twoescort and client. I am not saying that two people in this situation could not fall in loveJulia and Richard convinced me in Pretty Woman. But with wedding Date there is no enfolding of their relationship. One minute their strangers then he's her shrink then they flirt a little then some sex then they can't live without each other. But their relationship never plays out on screen. We never see them getting to know each other and as such it feels hopelessly contrived when they do fall in love. It's made worse by the fact that in the few moments that ARE devoted to the two of them interacting we can see that this couple has chemistry. But to much was squeezed into the movie in to short a time.Another problemhow Nick is depicted. At first I didn't think that would be a problem because Mulroney really played Nick well and gave him just enough charm coupled with a certain street smart quality and brooding sexiness that he seemed plausible. The matter of fact way he says to Kat that sex costs extrait was done well and believably. There were some really good lines such as each woman has the love life she wants and his comment to Kat about how do you know I'm being myself? Even all the girls falling for him at the wedding and everyone confiding in him I could believe becausewellhe's an escort and it's his job to charm people. So he's good at his job and charms everyone.So for a time I really did think that part anyway was going to be OK. That was before the sex.After that point any reality that Nick's character may have held fell away quicklyand that's not Mulroney's fault because as good as he was he had no control over the dialog. And what dialog it was too. The word dialog is the keyunless I can somehow believe that a savvy young escort who never gets emotionally involved with clients and only a short time ago was trying to get his client to pay him for sex would then say to the same client a short time later meaning it no payment involved bearing in mind this is a customer he'd only just met a very short time before and there were no signs of major feelings between them I think I'd miss you even if we'd never met.or something close to that.I am not sure if they were doing a Jerry Mguire or something but You had me at hello sounded and felt real. This just sounded and felt rehearsed. I am not saying perhaps this wouldn't really happen somewhere to someone but I didn't believe Nick would say this to Kat. I mean you never saw anything between them for most of the movie except sex. So the limits of believability were really tested.LASTLYThis guyhow did he come to be an escort? That is never explained. He is a bit to perfect why isn't he running one of Donald trump's companies? Shouldn't we have been told WHY he became an escort who this man was? OKnow that I've listed the negativesI'd still rate it a 6. It was fun and entertaining and a bit above many romantic comedies in the last few years because these two people were actually interesting. If the movie did not have the problems I mentioned I'd probably rate it an 8 because the entertainment factor was there there was some mild comedy and most of all was Mulroney's performance. I hadn't ever been a major fan of his before and in all honesty wouldn't have first thought of him for the role of mysterious escort he seemed to boy next door to fit the part but he not only fit it he made it his. The chemistry between him and Messing also helped make the movie chemistry can make or break sometimes and these two had it.I'd watch this again if it came to television. But I wish it had a bit more edge. More focus should have been given also to Nick as a person. Many of the elements that made Pretty woman a success were not present here and that's to bad. But for what it was it was a bit above average.".

The movie was most definitely entertaining and I loved the concept but there is no denying the movie had flaws.As far as romantic comedies go this one was pretty fun to view at times. What made it that way was Dermot Mulroney plain and simple. He played the part of the charismatic escort perfectly. His performance was a 10 of 10 and with a lesser actor in this role this movie could have potentially turned out dreadful because while Mulroney's Nick had an edge the rest of the movie certainly didn't.SPOILERS THROUGHOUT POSTWedding Date was a book first which I have happened to read I think it had a different title.

The story and characters are refreshing and different enough that it doesn't mimic other movies for me. The English countryside is beautiful and the other scenes added a romantic touch too.

It highlighted how families can put the 'fun' in 'dysfunctional'. It also had some very good serious moments between father and daughter and man to man.

The problem seems to be the way the screen writers have transplanted the story to London when basically this seems to be a typical American situation that not even the setting will be able to fix. Then there is the problem with the stars. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulrooney? They have as much chemistry as oil and vinegar!Since the Kat and Nick have no conflict from the start the viewer is not pulled into the film the way the creators thought they would be. It's clear that Kat will fall for Nick and viceversa in this predictable story.

We're both pretty well versed in films considering she's been a film minor and I had an internship with a production office last year and we agree that this movie has absolutely no purpose. To begin it's hard to believe that Kat wouldn't try to make some attempt to tell Nick about her life. Their stories don't even coincide until her crazy aunt asks what he does and Kat pulls him into a closet to tell him he's a therapist and give him 6000 in a brown envelope. There is no flow in the movie at all. Its like the writer had all of these great ideas but had no clue how to put them into a cohesive movie. Kat and Nick know each other for 3 days and all of the sudden they fall in love. This is also after Kat finds out that her sister who's a half sister even though you don't find this out until half way into the movie has slept with her exfianc who is her sister's fianc's best friend yeah its that confusing. But the funny thing about this part of the movie is that Kat doesn't get mad at her exfianc or sister but rather at Nick for not telling her HELLO he's known her for 3 days why does he think it matters??? This movie goes from bad to worse as the writer tries to frantically make everyone have a happy ending by the end of the movie...but the subtitles are just sexual and pointless. Honestly one of the things that I didn't get the most was that despite having supposedly grown up in England neither of the girls had an English accent. It felt like the director wanted a vacation so was like 'Ok let's shoot this movie in England.' I would never recommend this movie to anyone and despite a few cute quotes that come from the movie this is a horribly written film and should be banned. And NO I'm not just a bitter unromantic...I cried at Hitch and the Notebook and I just appreciate well done films.".

If you're not a chick flick person just don't bother.Overally I found it quite enjoyable really almost perfect. My biggest gripes if you can call them that are 1 that we're asked to believe that Dermot Mulroney's character is so into Debra Messing's character pretty early on without much to back it up and 2 that some of the most romantic lines in the movie are spoiled by being used in the trailer I hate it when that happens.I thought the casting was well done and that there was a good amount of character development probably surprisingly more so in the secondary characters. As an added bonus Sarah Parish as Debra Messing's cousin has some really funny lines that almost steal the show. If I had to compare it to something I'd call it a bit more risqu version of My Best Friend's Wedding but really don't not go because you think it's already been done or is too clichd  this is a really funny movie that had people in the audience clapping and laughing the whole way through.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tepid unoriginal reworking of several other better films on the subject of weddings such as 4 Weddings and a Funeral  My Best Friends Wedding with a generous heaping helping of Pretty Woman. Beautiful Kat Debra Messing revisiting her Will  Grace character by rotepays 6000 for a male escort Dermot Mulroney to accompany her to her halfsister's wedding in England.I have to mention that Will  Grace in the first place is basically a reworking of the film My Best Friend's Wedding ANYHOW with Ms. Messing filling in for the similarly longredhaired Julia Roberts with a gay friend she is practically in love with and in that film Dermot Mulroney ALSO played her old boyfriend! Talk about referencing.Wedding Date is based on a chiklit novel set in England and the story is updated unnecessarily and confusingly with the lead actresses being American. This doesn't even make sense as Kat and her sister are supposedly raised in England from a very young age and yet both speak with American accents especially odd for the sister who doesn't even LIVE in the US. It took me nearly half the film to even figure out their relationship it was portrayed so confusingly.Mulroney and Messing have no sex appeal or chemistry together and the dialogue is not witty or charming enough to carry the viewer across the many plot roles or unbelievable circumstances such as why a gorgeous babe like Kat has to hire a male prostitute when any redblooded man would be eager to date her. The reworking of the Pretty Woman plot line is very thin as male prostitutes are much rarer than female and because we culturally find the idea of a woman paying for sexual pleasure sorta icky Kat never actually pays for sex and Dermot's character actually pays back his 6000 fee thus negating the whole hookerjohnor jeanette relationship.Utterly without any romance this is the worst chiklit type film I have seen since Bridget Jones The Edge of Reason and actually it's worse. The audience I saw it with was mostly female and over 50 and they were bored out of their minds. Several left before the unsuspenseful end. Part of the pleasure of this sort of film is the will they or won't they get together? aspect and that's entirely missing here.".

Honestly! Underneath each Englishman does not lurk a wildly inappropriate Austin Powers and frankly good luck finding an Englishspeaking barman in London nowadays!Debra Messing is good in 'Will and Grace' and was either seriously underused and cast only to whip up publicity for this film as anyone off the street could have played this onedimensional role or perhaps just comes off well in 'Will and Grace' because of the chemistry with her costars something which was in embarrassingly short supply here. Her best friend or cousin or something played by Sarah Parish is more irritating than a fungal infection. All the other characters are hollow outdated stereotypes.I came out of the cinema thinking give me or most people for that matter a hundredth of that budget and I could make a film twice as good.

Everyone who played a part in bringing it to our cinema screens and coercing us to part with a hardearned 5 should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves if indeed they have a soul and are able to feel human emotions.

When I saw it I was horrified. The acting was horrible  flat and sometimes the audio didn't match  and I found it difficult to become engaged with the characters. The plot seemed stale and did nothing to draw me in. There was no suspense. There was absolutely zero chemistry between the leads. It was hard to tell when the characters started loving one another. I wasn't expecting this to be an Oscarworthy movie but it was awful for it's genre. This movie fails even to reach chickflick standards.".

When I saw it I was horrified. The acting was horrible  flat and sometimes the audio didn't match  and I found it difficult to become engaged with the characters. The plot seemed stale and did nothing to draw me in. There was no suspense. There was absolutely zero chemistry between the leads. It was hard to tell when the characters started loving one another. I wasn't expecting this to be an Oscarworthy movie but it was awful for it's genre. This movie fails even to reach chickflick standards.";

To say they lack charisma is putting it mildly  what is the opposite of charisma now .. repulsion? Who on earth would want to watch these two and who thought people would be prepared to pay to watch them? It astonishes me that movies like this get made at all and is proof that artistic integrity and Hollywood do not make comfy bedfellows.Just who owed whom a favour is unknown but there's no way this movie got through on merit. Mr Mulroney is surely the most arrogant wooden miscast person in history. He can't act even a little bit he can barely speak and he looks not 0.1 as good as he thinks he does or is supposed to in this role.Ms Messing is well suited to him in those respects. She can't act her way out of a paper bag. She does not look like a leading lady cannot speak lines and barges her way through this movie with the most bizarre display of exaggerated expressions and clumsy movements I've ever witnessed.The rest of the movie is worse. The locations and sets that are supposed to represent England presumably look like they came out of a Mongolian mail order 'sets for amdrams' catalogue. I won't even waste my time listing the faults.Do yourself a favour and watch any other movie ever made or failing that just stick needles in your eyeballs for a couple of hours  it would be a more pleasurable and valuable way to waste your life.".

A romantic relationship presumably develops between patron and client. But the dialogue seemed forced and artificial. And there weren't enough romantic sparks flying in the relationship of Nick and Kat.In a supporting role Amy Adams was a standout as Kat's sister. Whenever Amy came on screen she served as a spark plug and catalyst for the film's energy. Perhaps if Amy Adams had been cast in the role of Kat the film might have had more dynamism. But as it turned out instead of reaching for Kleenex I was looking for the Visine in attempt to at least pretend that this film had some genuine sentiment and romance.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the first few scenes onwards I got the impression that Al Pacino really wasn't enjoying his time in 'Revolution' and the aura of apathy which followed the thenrecent legend of 'Scarface' more or less destroyed one of the few potentially redeeming qualities of this film. There is a scene towards the end of the film in which the actor seems to muster up some enthusiasm for performance and reminds us that he was the face of Michael Corleone and Tony Montana and not just a lookalike. The scenes in which Pacino bonds with his onscreen son  Sid Owen and later Dexter Fletcher  are near insufferable and it becomes very easy throughout 'Revolution' to forget that these characters even know each other. The action in this film felt like a cheap series of reenactments common to but forgivable in dated documentaries. The first major confrontation between the Americans and the British was enjoyable in places however and the score enriched one or two haunting sequences of the irrepressible redcoats led by Donald Sutherland marching on the revolutionaries. The attempts to create a drama subplot of Nastassja Kinski's family tensions was not fun to watch and her proredcoat relatives were so quickly introduced and dismissed that they became instantly forgettable. Overall I do not recommend this film. However if you have an ironwilled enthusiasm for the American War of Independence you may derive some minor satisfaction from seeing a worldclass actor caught in the middle but just as Malcolm McDowell and Peter O'Toole could not redeem 'Caligula' for a less thanmaniacal fan of ancient history the chances are that you'll still come out unfulfilled.".

I might say that beside Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon and Tony Richardson's Tom Jones this is the most beautifully made period movie about the eighteenth century. Revolution is also an important film because there are only about a dozen films on the Revolutionary War and almost all of them are a matter of obscurity  at least for a Hungarian movie lover. The most popular is Roland Emmerich's The Patriot 2000. In my opinion that's a much worse film than Hudson's maligned film. When Revolution was released it was a critical and commercial disaster. I think it didn't fit in any of the movie trends of the 1980s. But in the future it might be regarded as a flawed but valuable movie. Its flaws are obvious and muchdiscussed so I don't want to speak about them. If you're interested in beautiful period pieces and the Revolutionary War you might like this movie.".

Al Pacino is a bornraised New Yorker and I believe captured the essence of his character very well. Pacino gave a solid portrayal of an 18th. century individual caught up in a violent period of American history. This movie has been unfairly criticized and overly maligned in my humble opinion.

	schema:reviewBody "I had wanted to see this movie for quite some time but for some strange reason it never appeared on television despite its cast. However I finally managed to find a copy of it at a specialized video store in my city. The version I found was the director's cut. So what did I think of it? Well I admit that the look of the movie is very convincing. The costumes props and set decoration look fantastic. It really seems that they captured what the colonies were like more than 200 years ago.However the story and characters are less convincing. For example the movie seems to suggest that most Americans were prorevolution. In actual fact a third were prorevolution another third were British loyalists and the remaining third either didn't care or were undecided. Another odd fact is that the movie portrays just about all of the pro revolutionists as despicable  odd because the filmmakers were trying to sell this movie to the American public! Actually most of the other characters in the movie like the British soldiers are also shown in a negative light. There are precious few characters in the movie to care about. The actors try but a lot of the roles are shallow. Donald Sutherland and Nastassja Kinski have little to do despite their billing.There are other problems in the movie I could go on for some time listing like Pacino's extensive yet completely unnecessary narration. Still I will admit that while I didn't like the movie I wasn't bored at any moment. There's plenty of eye candy and I confess a curiosity as to how Pacino's character would end up. The movie isn't as bad as some critics have claimed... though I won't hesitate to add that it wasn't worth the years I searched for a way to see it.".

Another odd fact is that the movie portrays just about all of the pro revolutionists as despicable  odd because the filmmakers were trying to sell this movie to the American public! Actually most of the other characters in the movie like the British soldiers are also shown in a negative light. There are precious few characters in the movie to care about. The actors try but a lot of the roles are shallow. Donald Sutherland and Nastassja Kinski have little to do despite their billing.There are other problems in the movie I could go on for some time listing like Pacino's extensive yet completely unnecessary narration. Still I will admit that while I didn't like the movie I wasn't bored at any moment. There's plenty of eye candy and I confess a curiosity as to how Pacino's character would end up. The movie isn't as bad as some critics have claimed... though I won't hesitate to add that it wasn't worth the years I searched for a way to see it.";

	schema:reviewBody "An incomparable historical epic about the American Revolutionary War Revolution brings Al Pacino to the fore as Dobbs the trapper swept up in the Continental Army and Kinski as Daisy the rebellious daughter of a cynically duplicit Tory merchant family. Set against the backdrop of the American Revolution Al Pacino plays Tom Dobbs a man swept up in Revolutionary upheaval fighting alongside his son. After the battle of Brooklyn Dobbs like most of the patriotic army melts away but enduring life in British occupied New York City proves too much. Dobbs and his son escape conscription into the enemy army by fleeing to American lines. They're out to teach a murderous redcoat Donald Sutherland a lesson. Daisy plays the part the Red Coats complained of and dreaded nurse at Brooklyn spy in Philadelphia and occasionally an irregular soldier with a loaded pistol for an unsuspecting enemy. The historical choreography was outstanding. Attention to detail is remarkable particularly in the period music. The uniforms and costuming are magnificent. If Donald Sutherland plays an ironwilled British SergeantMajor a realistically fiercesome antagonist the movie catches the principal grievances between the opposing forces. The deposing of the last Royal Governor and battle of Brooklyn are imaginatively and accurately staged. This is no small feat. Only one block of the original Hanseatic city is left in New York City and the entire battlefield of Brooklyn and Long Island lay under the nation's fourth largest city. And perhaps The World Didn't Turn Upside Down' when Lord Cornwallis wept in his tent and General O'Hara's Second Guards surrendered to the tune of Minstrel Boy. A Classic That Warrants A Second Look Revolution the movie was not well received in its time. Lost in the wilderness of the postVietnam malaise of antiheroism critics pinged Al Pacino's inescapable accent. How do you suppose men from the Hudson River Valley in 1775 spoke when English and Dutch were still interchangeable? Some reviewers did not like the battle scenes. The patriotic gore wasn't enough? Some didn't think the snow was deep enough at Valley Forge. Even in the North East's snowiest winters it doesn't snow every day. In consequence of the time in which the movie played to the film was a box office disaster grossing less than 200000. There maybe a time when motion pictures like books win a status long after release they did not enjoy immediately. Hopefully that time will come for Revolution a movie well worth revisiting.".

Here is a news flash Want to get prisoners to talk?

While he has no money no education and dresses like a caveman a very hot Natasha Kinski falls in love with him for no apparent reason since they have only two minutes of dialogue together.Quite frankly if Al Smith starred in this movie instead of Al Pacino it would have ruined their career. The script was horrible but Pacino's demotivated performance and obvious fake accent made it even worse. Donald Sutherland's role was laughable. I really can't describe it. Natasha Kinski is a main character but has like 5 lines in the movie. In fact nobody speaks much in this movie.One of the most laughable premise in the movie is how Al Pacino and Kinski have this uncanny knack to continually run into each other on the battlefield. Its like the entire Northeast is a Starbucks.

Much of the blame should be attributed to director Hugh Hudson yes the man who made Chariots Of Fire just a couple of years earlier  talk about a comedown!!. One of the many jobs of a director is to marshal the actors coaxing believable performances from them but in this case Hudson has allowed Pacino to run amok without asking for restraint of any kind. It's not just Al's careerlow performance that hinders the film though there are numerous other flaws with Revolution more of which will be said later.Illiterate trapper Tom Dobb Al Pacino lives in the northeastern region of America with his son Ned Sid OwenDexter Fletcher. He leads a simple life  living off the land raising his son surviving against the elements. The country is lorded over by the English colonialists but during an eight year period 177583 a revolution takes place which ends with the British being defeated and the independent American nation being born. Dobb gets caught up in the events when his boat and his son are conscripted by the Continental Army  swept away by events they can barely understand the Dobbs finds themselves fighting for their lives and freedom in one bloody engagement after another. Tom also falls in love with Daisy McConnahay Natassja Kinski a beautiful and fiery woman of British aristocratic ancestry. Their forbidden love is played out against the larger historical context of the fighting.Where to start with the film's flaws? Most key actors are miscast  Pacino has been criticised enough already but Kinski fares little better as the renegade aristocrat while Donald Sutherland is hopelessly lost as a ruthless English soldier with a wobbly Yorkshire accent. Robert Dillon's script is muddled in its attempts to bring massive historical events down to a personal level. At no point does anyone seem to have decided whether this is meant to be an intimate character study with the American Revolution as a backdrop or an epic war film with a handful of sharply drawn characters used to carry the story along. As a result the narrative falls into no man's land flitting from grand spectacle to small story indiscriminately and meaninglessly. John Corigliano's score is quite ghastly and is poured over the proceedings with neither thought nor subtlety. Hugh Hudson's direction is clumsy throughout both in his mismanagement of Pacino and the other key actors and in the decision to use irritatingly shaky camera work during the action sequences. The idea of the handheld camera is to create immediacy  that feeling of being there in the confusion of battle and musket fire. Like so many other things in the film it doesn't work. The one department where the film regains a modicum of respectability is the period detail with costumes sets and weaponry that look consistently accurate. But if it's period detail you're interested in a trip to the museum would be a better way to spend your time because as a rousing cinematic experience Revolution doesn't even begin to make the grade. Nothing more than a 18000000 megabomb that the ailing British film industry could ill afford in the mid1980s.".

	schema:headline " The most dodgy accents ever!";
	schema:reviewBody "A New York trapper and his son get caught upin the American battle of independence.Starring Al Pacino and Nastassja Kinski.Written by Robert Dillon.Directed by Hugh Hudson.This movie could have been great but instead it was a let down.On a positive note the cinematography period costumes and attention to detail was wonderful. And I found it quite educational and interesting from a historical point of view. Although I'm sure many experts would be able to find a few historical errors.What let this movie down was the quality of acting and the plot which didn't really go anywhere. Al Pacino and the two actors who played his son had bizarre accents which didn't help. I think he was supposed to be Scottish but it came out as rather a weird combination of Irish and some other made up mumble language. In fact I couldn't hear half of what he was saying which kind of ruined the big movie moments! And there were more bizarre accents amongst the many actors in this ensemble. Maybe Al Pacino was a victim of bad casting or bad directing or perhaps his heart wasn't in the movie.I didn't mind Nastassja Kinski's performance. It was probably the best of a dodgy bunch. And she was pretty good to look at too. But on the whole Revolution was a bit of a borefest. There is a big scene towards the end where the main character and another guy are chased by a pack of dogs. That's exactly how I'd describe the plot of this. Like a pack of dogs chasing something but never quite catching it.610".

	onyx:emotionText "A New York trapper and his son get caught upin the American battle of independence.Starring Al Pacino and Nastassja Kinski.Written by Robert Dillon.Directed by Hugh Hudson.This movie could have been great but instead it was a let down.On a positive note the cinematography period costumes and attention to detail was wonderful. And I found it quite educational and interesting from a historical point of view. Although I'm sure many experts would be able to find a few historical errors.What let this movie down was the quality of acting and the plot which didn't really go anywhere. Al Pacino and the two actors who played his son had bizarre accents which didn't help. I think he was supposed to be Scottish but it came out as rather a weird combination of Irish and some other made up mumble language. In fact I couldn't hear half of what he was saying which kind of ruined the big movie moments! And there were more bizarre accents amongst the many actors in this ensemble. Maybe Al Pacino was a victim of bad casting or bad directing or perhaps his heart wasn't in the movie.I didn't mind Nastassja Kinski's performance. It was probably the best of a dodgy bunch. And she was pretty good to look at too. But on the whole Revolution was a bit of a borefest. There is a big scene towards the end where the main character and another guy are chased by a pack of dogs. That's exactly how I'd describe the plot of this. Like a pack of dogs chasing something but never quite catching it.610";

So what if the accents of Pacino and Sutherland weren't good I don't remember them being bad. I thought the visual effects of the city looked great. It looked cold and dreary just how I always thought would be like. It showed how some of the colonialists were loyal to England which is accurate and the battle scenes looked realistic to me. It showed how ill equipped and trained the Americans were compared to the British and how easily the Americans retreated at the beginning of the war. I liked the movie.".

The revolutionaries confiscate his boat and they promise to pay him in gold in two weeks after the war is to end. His son Ned unwittingly signs up for the revolution and Tom is forced to join up to protect him. Daisy McConnahay Nastassja Kinski is the rebellious daughter of a rich New York family. She is drawn to the revolution and rebels against his war profiteering father. Sgt. Maj. Peasy Donald Sutherland is the ruthless English soldier who fights alongside his drummer boy son.The son is the brattiest of brats. Pacino is Italian to his core. There is no way to alleviate that and his natural accent doesn't help. Kinski is foreign in her accent and annoyingly arrogant in her rebellion. Of course her family is horribly selfish. The British are cartoonish. The revolutionaries don't start off well either. It's an ugly world overall. The only compelling work comes from Sutherland who knows how to play his uncomprising role without becoming a caricature. It is interesting to depict the rebellion start with such an ugly mob. Usually they're more noble than that. That has to be a part of the reason why this movie bombed so badly. There are also other pressing problems.It's notable that the black actors barely speak a word. I'm sure the movie is trying to say a little something about slavery. In Philadelphia the slaves are rising up as freedom rings out all around them but it's left confused. Obviously none of them are freed in reality but it's not clear from the movie. I think the blacks being march off in the opposite direction is suppose to be them being sent into slavery in the south. I also have a problem with Pacino fighting off the two Indian scouts. It's barely believable and it would be easily solved if the friendly Indians arrive a minute earlier. They could help him kill the two Indian scouts. In addition I don't understand why he doesn't go with his son at the end. He spends the entire movie rescuing his son but leaves him for the city life. That's stupid. I don't mind portraying the war as an ugly affair but this one is not that good.".

	schema:headline " It seems as if the filmmakers deliberately mad every illogical decision to make this movie suck as much as possible";
	schema:reviewBody "How they got Al Pacino to play in this movie is beyond me. This movie is absolutely terrible. I discovered after reading some of the other reviews that a couple of people actually enjoyed this film which deeply puzzles me because I do not see how anyone in their right mind could possibly enjoy a movie as awful as Revolution. It's not just that it's a bad movie with a lame plot and overall strangeness that is extremely unpleasant but it seems as if the filmmakers were either mentally retarded which is a very possible explanation as to why this movie sucks like it does though it probably still sucks even compared to other films made by retards or deliberately made every illogical decision to make this movie suck as much as possible. For example we see Donald Sutherland running around with a huge fat ugly mole on his face. He does not normally have a mole. The mole does not add to his character. It is extremely ugly and distracting. It's not like Robert De Niro's mole it's much worse. Why the hell has he got that mole? It's as if the filmmakers just said Let's see how could we make this movie even worse than it already is? I know let's give Mr. Sutherland a giant uglyass mole right on his face.Another example of the filmmakers' stupidity is the character Ned. We see for the first threequarters of the movie young Ned. At one point six months later appears on the screen. We see Ned again and it is of course the same actor playing the boy. Five minutes later three weeks later appears on the screen and all of a sudden we've got a different actor playing as the now older Ned. What do they think we're idiots? Good God! Again it's like the filmmakers are saying How can we possibly make it any worse? I don't think we can...Oh wait! I just had a terrible idea! I know a kid doesn't grow much in half a year which is fine but he at least grows more than he does in three weeks. Just don't get another actor to play Ned or at least get him to play the five minutes when he's three weeks younger. Furthermore the kid who plays the older Ned does not look any older than young Ned. As a matter of fact he just looks completely different much skinnier and no taller or older than the original actor which is very confusing as I like any rational human being thought at first that it was a new and different character.What did the first kid die while they were filming the movie? Because he was in it for the first hour and a half and then all of a sudden three weeks later the guy from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is playing Ned for the last five minutes of the movie. And even if the original actor did die the filmmakers should have at least gotten an actor who looks like him to play the remainder of his role and reshoot the measly five minutes of six months later scenes. Better yet just scrap the movie completely never finish it and never release never even tell anybody about it because by that point they should have realized that their movie sucks and in finishing it they would only waste more money and time and succeed in making one of the worst movies of all time.I'm not saying that this movie is so bad you shouldn't watch it it's so bad that you SHOULD watch it just to see how badly it sucks. It's terrible terrible.".

	onyx:emotionText "How they got Al Pacino to play in this movie is beyond me. This movie is absolutely terrible. I discovered after reading some of the other reviews that a couple of people actually enjoyed this film which deeply puzzles me because I do not see how anyone in their right mind could possibly enjoy a movie as awful as Revolution. It's not just that it's a bad movie with a lame plot and overall strangeness that is extremely unpleasant but it seems as if the filmmakers were either mentally retarded which is a very possible explanation as to why this movie sucks like it does though it probably still sucks even compared to other films made by retards or deliberately made every illogical decision to make this movie suck as much as possible. For example we see Donald Sutherland running around with a huge fat ugly mole on his face. He does not normally have a mole. The mole does not add to his character. It is extremely ugly and distracting. It's not like Robert De Niro's mole it's much worse. Why the hell has he got that mole?

This does give it a clearer narrative and might assist those who felt it lacked that before.I will say it is wonderfully shot with realistic scenes and fine battle footage but some of the performances are woeful I'm afraid. The worst by a country mile is Richard O'Brien as an odious British officerlord. This is pantomime acting and his character even utters the line American dream what! which I find impossible to believe would have been said in late 18th century America by an Englishman! Nastassja Kinski gorgeous as she is in this is not much better. She is all over the place and I find her character barely believable.Pacino is not that bad in comparison and is clearly trying very hard but why oh why did they allow him to wear that ridiculous headband thing?? This dates the film to 1985 not 1776. It detracts from his performance.Overall visually good apart from the headband but very disappointing.".

	schema:reviewBody "To say that this film is a filmmaking tour de force would be a great injustice.  It is far better than that.  Oliver Parker's revitalizing of Oscar Wilde's classic play is filmmaking at its finest.Every element of this film is superlative.  Wilde's story as adapted to the screen by Parker is witty intelligent and engaging from start to finish. Seldom can you find a story that attempts to be a romantic comedy a tale of duplicity blackmail and betrayal and a drama of political intrigue and succeeds so well on all counts.The intricate weave of deception manipulation and double entendre along with comic misperception irony and rapier witted dialogue are delicious and classic Wilde.  This is a film you will want to see again and again just to discover all the lines within the lines.I cannot say enough about the brilliance of Oliver Parker's direction in this film.  He has captured late 19th Century aristocratic England with vivid and rich images that put the viewer right into the period.  David Johnson's cinematography is fantastic with every scene working well as to lighting and color.  The beautiful blend of colors in the costumes and the set always looked like they belonged together.  Parker also provides numerous interesting camera angles that help dramatize the scenes.  It serves to remind us that glorious films can still be made relying on the creative eye of the director rather than special effects.The acting was delightful.  Rupert Everett as the self absorbed Lord Arthur Goring delivers an exquisite performance as the unscrupulous rogue upon whom the mantle of truth and honor is laid.Julianne Moore was delightful as the evil and cunning Mrs. Cheveley.  As cold manipulative and heartless as she is with Chiltern and Lady Chiltern she is that vulnerable and helpless with Lord Goring for whom she has long held a flame.  Moore handles this emotional juggling act with great skill and you find yourself simultaneously loving her ingeniousness and hating her treachery.Cate Blanchett turns in another wonderful performance as the ohsoperfect Lady Gertrud Chiltern.  Jeremy Northam is also excellent as Robert Chiltern the man of untouchable character with a scandalous secret in his past.  Even Minnie Driver is charming as Robert's sister.This is a terrific film for the refined viewer who appreciates all aspects of filmmaking.  Even for those not into the art of filmmaking it is simply great entertainment.  I can think of no negative criticism of it.  It is well written directed photographed and acted.  It is filmmaking the way it was meant to be.  A perfect 10.".

Rupert Everett as the self absorbed Lord Arthur Goring delivers an exquisite performance as the unscrupulous rogue upon whom the mantle of truth and honor is laid.Julianne Moore was delightful as the evil and cunning Mrs. Cheveley.  As cold manipulative and heartless as she is with Chiltern and Lady Chiltern she is that vulnerable and helpless with Lord Goring for whom she has long held a flame.  Moore handles this emotional juggling act with great skill and you find yourself simultaneously loving her ingeniousness and hating her treachery.Cate Blanchett turns in another wonderful performance as the ohsoperfect Lady Gertrud Chiltern.  Jeremy Northam is also excellent as Robert Chiltern the man of untouchable character with a scandalous secret in his past.  Even Minnie Driver is charming as Robert's sister.This is a terrific film for the refined viewer who appreciates all aspects of filmmaking.  Even for those not into the art of filmmaking it is simply great entertainment.  I can think of no negative criticism of it.  It is well written directed photographed and acted.  It is filmmaking the way it was meant to be.  A perfect 10.";

The one exception is her scene with Everett which has a real Will he sleep with the enemy? tension.  It may be that Moore was just outclassed by the Brits who are born to this stuff.Cate Blanchett whom I've seen in three movies two of which were British period pieces continues to amaze me with her range.The unsung hero of the movie is Jeremy Northam who takes a thankless role  the man in the play who isn't the Oscar Wilde figure  and makes it emotionally compelling.  He is responsible for the play's only real suspense and emotion since the rest is word games more or less.All of which leads me to blame the production's shortcomings on its writerdirector Oliver Parker.  He seems to have squandered an outstanding cast.  The play's final scene is played as a series of French scenes  a film term for a series of different scenes in the same location  and this kills any momentum that scene might have had.Three out of four stars I say which makes it better than 90 of the movies out there.".

	schema:reviewBody "An Ideal Husband  In 19th Century London Sir Robert Chiltern Jeremy Northam is a successful member of parliament married to the virtuous fabulously popular Lady Gertrud Chiltern Cate Blanchett.  Sir Robert's sister Mabel Minnie Driver is infatuated with Sir Robert's friend Lord Arthur Goring Rupert Everett.  The dashing Lord Goring the wealthy son of the Earl of Caversham is an inveterate bachelor who lives a life of leisure.  Into this already crowded picture drops Mrs. Laura Cheveley Julianne Moore an Austrian socialite with two exhusbands and a convoluted past.  Not only was she briefly engaged to Lord Goring but it seems that she possesses evidence that the noble Sir Robert once committed a terrible indiscretion.  Mrs. Cheveley uses this explosive evidence in her attempt to blackmail Sir Robert into voting against his conscience on the floor of Parliament.  What ensues is a fascinating examination of honor and idealism.  We learn that the noble Sir Robert is less than perfect while the rakish bachelor Lord Goring possesses a surprising level of honor and insight.If Shakespeare in Love deserved an Oscar this film deserves the Nobel Prize.  It is simply outstanding in every respect.  The first thing one notices is the dialogue.  It is a bit stiff and stilted as was the custom in London at the time but it also possesses a razor sharp wit and sly sense of humor.  Every last character speaks with intelligence and humor.  The verbal fireworks particularly as provided by Lord Goring illuminate character and motivation while simultaneously producing guffaws from the audience.  The plot structure is a marvel.   There are no explosions fireballs or car chases but the picture achieves a certain breathlessness simply through its intricate layering of multiple characters all with intertwining motivations interests and connections with one another.  A prime example of this is the scene in which poor Lord Goring receives multiple visitors at his home in a single night.  All of the visitors have conflicts with one another so Lord Goring must segregate them and move from room to room listening to their problems and providing insights.  The costumes and locations are all excellent.  I particularly liked the manner in which Sir Robert's bright home is contrasted with Lord Goring's dark and cavernous bachelor pad.  The one complaint I have is with the film's music it seemed too light and frivolous overplaying the madcap shenanigans element of the picture.  But this is a minor quibble indeed.The acting is first rate across the board.  Jeremy Northam yes he could play James Bond is well suited to the role of Sir Robert.  He exudes intelligence honor and duty.  Julianne Moore as Mrs. Cheveley seems to relish the conniving and scheming of her character.  Cate Blanchett and Minnie Driver capably bring depth and intelligence to their limited roles. But the true star of the film is Rupert Everett as Lord Arthur Goring. Mr. Everett has had a promising career to this point but An Ideal Husband is his breakout role.  In this film he is witty charming caring wise devilish and childish all at once.  Lord Goring is the kind of man that makes women swoon and men flock around to hear funny stories.  He reminded me of Cary Grant  only better.  Someone give that man an Academy Award.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the Oscar Wilde play of the same name An Ideal Husband scores as a moderately entertaining drawing room comedy thanks to the elegance of its design and the performances of its first rate cast.  Although it contains many elements of a classic Feydeau farce  comic misunderstandings delicately timed missteps hairbreadth missed encounters  the film lacks the kinetic energy necessary to allow these elements to completely shine through.  Instead we are treated to a more laid back more traditionally British interpretation of the events.  Indeed the real charm of the film lies in its sharp observation of British gentility thinly disguising the often honeytongued brutality lying just below the placid surface of this society.  No one smiles more sincerely or maintains such immense social poise while slicing one's opponents to shreds than the elite of England  and this quality director Oliver Parker captures in complete fidelity to Wilde's overall vision.Jeremy Northam portrays a highly respected and happily married member of the House of Commons who is suddenly confronted with a moral dilemma  should he allow a blackmailer to expose an egregiously immoral action in his past thereby ensuring the ruination of both his career and his marriage or should he go along with the blackmailer's demands and publicly support a cause he knows to be highly unethical and injurious to both his people and his nation?  Julianne Moore portrays the woman who waltzes suddenly into his life and attempts to threaten him into supporting a doomed canal project to protect her own financial investment.  Rupert Everett also stars as a confirmed bachelor who manages to become intricately involved in everyone's affairs.The film succeeds most when it concentrates on the stuffiness of the stiffupperlipped British tradition juxtaposed to the singleminded viciousness of the Moore character.  She delivers a delightful interpretation of an amoral woman utilizing cruelty to achieve her desired ends fitting perfectly into a morally topsyturvy world which feasts on scandal and the ruination of its own members yet where a mismatched tea set stands as the ultimate in moral turpitude.  Wilde on the other end of the morality spectrum also subtly jabs at the unrealistic obsession with virtue in the character of Northam's impossibly pure wife Cate Blanchett  she erects so high a moral pedestal for her husband to stand upon that it is only after she has been caught in a moral infraction herself that the world these characters inhabit can come back into any sort of balance.The film is probably least effective when trying to cope with the complex interweaving and overlapping of the characters and their situations. Packer simply does not provide the manic energy and chaotic pacing necessary to make such plot mechanics soar on screen.  As a result An Ideal Husband is more likable as a genteel British comedy of manners than the unbridled drawing room farce it seems so often to want to be.  Still this is a film to be savored and enjoyed on many levels.".

All this comes under threat when Mrs Cheveley arrives to blackmail him with a letter from his past unless he change his stance on a motion passing through parliament. Chiltern turns to his friend the idle and self obsessed Lord Goring for help drawing him into a game of deception and love.The audience for this film is pretty easy to define.  I quite often see Wilde's plays as matters of you either like them or you don't.  If you are looking for something with a very engaging plot deep characters and plenty of substance then this is not going to be the film to come to.  Instead the focus is on witty word play confused love interests in a battle of the sexes and deception that spins away from the truth.  This works well as long as you know what to expect.  The film opens out the play and includes a few injokes for Wilde fans and it is effective in making for a slick product even if it takes the edge of the actual characters.The witty dialogue is good and it won't disappoint fans of the play.  The direction uses the locations and sets really well giving the film a sense of period that it really needs.  I am a reverse snob I know I shouldn't be! and the spoilt romances of the well educated and privileged upper classes is of no interest to me  but in this setting it works!The cast is impressively heavy weight but the honours are stolen by two main actors.  Everett was born for this sort of whimsy and he does it exceedingly well making his character playful and fun.  Driver is also great as his love interest and her scenes with Everett are the best of the film.  The rest of the cast are all excellent even if they don't have quite as much fun as these two.  Moore does well while Blanchett and Northam are both good despite not having a fair share of the wit.  Wood and Vaughan both have small roles but get laughs every time!Overall this is a sparky little movie that will appeal to those who love the cut and thrust of well written witty dialogue and playful to's and fro's between the characters.  I need say no more  the audience for this film already know who they are and vice versa.".

Yet An ideal husband almost succeeds to be a boring film.It should be observed that An ideal husband is Wilde's fourth play not only chronologically but also with respect to the artistic level. In particular the dramatic turns of the plot and the design of the moral scruples of the characters are decidedly weak. Therefore to focus on these aspects of the play as the movie does is a major mistake. The Oliver Parker's script of the film presents several changes with respect to Wilde's original text. You easily recognize the added lines they are so flat compared with the true ones! One scene is so unWildean that it has to be remarked in the Turkish bath Lord Goring the author's alterego shows his gymbuilt muscles. Nothing could grate more with the spirit of Oscar Wilde who always addressed his most ferocious sarcasm against the fashionmania of sport gymnastics and physical shape.The acting is surprisingly flat save Peter Vaughan and John Wood in two minor roles. Actually Rupert Everett as lord Goring makes an adequate job nothing memorable though. To compare him with Cary Grant is sheer blasphemy. One can't believe how misfit Jeremy Northam is to play Robert Chiltern he really makes an awful performance. Minnie Driver as Mabel Chiltern is not much better with her perpetual halfstunned halfwhining expression. Moreover she is ugly sorry. Julianne Moore is generally considered a firstrate actress I don't know but here she certainly doesn't show her talent. Needless to say Moore is unattractive too. Now let me ask is there a LAW AGAINST BEAUTIFUL ACTRESSES in current movies? Is such a law some form of political correctness? Let some Foundation for Endangered Species preserve Catherine ZetaJones for all us... An ideal husband is a forgettable movie a routine work that produce poor results from Wilde's brilliant matter.".

I am HEDY Lamarr for what seemed like two minutes. Then I turned it off. I get that you want to play around with the documentary format. You want to create something different and new. Good for you. That's admirable. But when the vast majority of your movie is people talking on the phone and you're not sure who their talking to the effect is that you're stacking the deck and creating a narrative that didn't happen. It feels fake. It comes off like the records in the 50's and 70's where someone would ask a question and the response would be a line from a popular song. But it doesn't stop there. The focus doesn't seem to be on Lamarr but on her son the filmmaker. I wanted to be an actor but I couldn't make it pay. So...you decided to make money in another field and then make some weird incestuous film about your mom? You film yourself talking about how you want your movie to look...after you've played the sequence you've already made? What was the point of filming auditions for the role of your mother when most of them shouldn't have been there? There's one sequence where he's talking to an actress portraying an older version of his mom...and he's having a conversation with her as if she's actually his mom. You can do a lot of therapy that's more productive and cost effective than making a movie about how mommy didn't love you. Worst of all he just throws all of the information out there and does nothing to sort it all out. Apparently he interviewed people who knew her rather who tell radically different stories about who she was. No matter how horrible a mother she was he should be able to bring some kind of perspective to these differing opinions but instead he just lets them talk...on the phone...maybe to each other...or maybe he's on the other side of the phone. We don't know. We know there's a camera crew filming them but we have no idea where he as the filmmaker is. There are awkward passages of him talking on the phone obviously trying to act. Yes. Mr. Spielberg? No. You didn't get that call through. This is a desperate and desperately sad movie starring and I mean starring an unloved son who's trying to compete with his mom.".

The fights get increasingly intense as each opponent gets bigger and stronger than the last until the big showdown with a boyhood nemesis.Meanwhile as a subplot the upandcoming fighter tries to woo a club waitress by always turning up whenever she is around  alas I suppose stalking has the same effect as a bunch of roses to some people today.This was a poorly directed film and the characters were pretty wooden the story was very laboured and moved very slowly.The redeeming features were some of the fight scenes that were a bit on the brutal side and the comedy performance of the girlfriend's Mother that kept popping into the room on the most inappropriate of moments! Although the fight sequences may be of interest to some  I would say that many others would find these quite off putting.The film tries to save itself with some plot twists but unfortunately  you could see these punches coming from a long way off.Channing Tatum in the opening introduction before the film started described the plot line of the movie as being loosely based on Midnight Cowboy  but it is a very loose connection both in story acting ability or finished result  and this film definitely wasn't the winner.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dito Montiel's film has been advertised as the 'Rocky of our generation' however I do believe they were referring to the fifth film in the Rocky franchise. Predictable boring tedious lifeless are just a few words I could use to describe this film but I really only need to use one terrible.Shawn MacArthur Channing Tatum is your typical workingclass boy who is taken under the wing of an ageing conman named Harvey Terrence Howard and given the opportunity to make his American dream come true by participating in various backroom bareknuckle fights. Oh and the stereotypical loveinterest in the form Zulay Zulay Henao is also thrown into the mix. Now despite this description describing various films from the last few years never mind the last few decades it contains three huge jawshattering constraints 1 Despite being named Fighting the film ironically contains very little fighting or brawling in regards to its hundredminute running time. And when we do get to see some facebruising action the Director seems to get incredibly giddy with the camera and what we are left with is some Paul Greengrass jerkiness that allows you to observe very little especially when the camera is thrown into the heart of the action.2 Terrence Howard puts a little effort into his character and drags out a performance worthy of a film better than this however Channing Tatum does not follow his lead. His stony expression and Brandostyle mumbling is just plain annoying and unconvincing yet he is the lead protagonist at the forefront of the film and his performance drags the film down considerably.3 Finally Munic and Montiel's script has about as much weight as a feather and as punch as a fighter outcold on the mat. We learn little about the characters until late into the film when there life stories seem to just be thrown around quickly to fill various plotholes. While the majority of the dialogue is just clichd and cringeworthy most notably a scene at the end of the film that precedes the final fight sequence which can only be described as hilariously idiotic.Fighting is crime against cinema. It is a film which gives the audience absolutely nothing yet takes from them their hardearned cash in the form of their admittance fee. The only reason I can think why this film was distributed to theatres instead of being a straighttoDVD affair is down to the influence of having a star like Terrence Howard in the picture. Don't waste your time or money on this abomination.".

The acting is terrible despite Mr. Howard doing his best to try and act his way out of the script. The narrative is scattered and clich and has no original plot elements. You would figure a movie called Fighting would at least be saved by its fight sequences but its not there are some half decent moments but most of the time you can't really tell what's going on however the final fight wasn't to bad. There are some genuine attempts at emotion throughout but usually they fall flat. There were way to many moments where I laughed but wasn't supposed to especially the speech given right before the last fight. Overall it's a terribly acted movie with an even worst script.".

The dialog was very close to being on the nose allowing for the most predictable storyline and course of events. Best parts were the fighting which was filmed O.K. and the women a.k.a. sex. New York felt very real throughout this movie but with the American Gangster soundtrack being used repetitively it quickly lost it's realism. Acting was cool but then again the characters were unbelievable and boring.I say 4 out of 10. It could have been filmed like cloverfield and still received the same rating. If the story would have been more original then I would have said higher rating.Oh and the Antagonist throughout this storyline made me laugh. My 5 year old nephew could take him down let alone our main character.".

I don't think you can really compare this to Never Back Down which was like many beat em up movies more of a glossy cartoon with human actors.

Because of this I felt totally absorbed by the 'in the crowd' camera shots catching different angles. You really felt the fighting was more realistic as if you've ever been in a fight you'll know that technique can only take you so far Its really down to mind heart and of course luck.Nothing was overstated in this film and I think that might be the reason it has received such bad rating.

Who are these people? Its as if the writer never met any one from the South or Chicago or any other place and gave them hometowns based upon a whim.

And as he helps the downonhisluck fishoutofwater counterfeiter succeed in underground fighting initially swindling him then offering a place to stay it's difficult not to compare this film's plot to Midnight Cowboy with an antiRocky lead complete with a very brief training montage on a subway minus the aforementioned films' flawless execution.When Shawn is most in need of money he still insists upon his code of honor and refuses to throw a match. This is utterly ridiculous considering his reason for fighting and the fact that the fights themselves are anything goes. Where's the honor in that? Apparently the trophy for integrity outweighs the desire for food and shelter especially for someone content with living like a derelict.At least there's humor found in desperation and comic relief in the quagmire of hustling taking place. The laughably bad supporting villains and perfectly clich main rival don't help Fighting with the sense of distinction so desperately needed after swallowing the simplicity of the title. And when the first two fights establish that skills are pointless in the face of an unruly freeforall it's even more difficult to care whether or not Shawn sticks to his principles wins the girl gains respect amongst his friends or defeats his nemesis  all formulaically in that order.The Massie Twins".

And when the first two fights establish that skills are pointless in the face of an unruly freeforall it's even more difficult to care whether or not Shawn sticks to his principles wins the girl gains respect amongst his friends or defeats his nemesis  all formulaically in that order.The Massie Twins";

	schema:reviewBody "In the last several years Hollywood has screwed up in marketing films in such a way that cause their target audience to get angry and the resulting negative buzz kills the film. The people who watched this movie expected an action filled smash up with a clearly defined plot and evil villains and shining heroes. Nothing wrong with that but a movie like this one is bound to disappoint those folks and the people who would like it will never see it because they automatically pigeonhole it into the entire fight movie genre.Fighting reminds me of a typical good film from the early '70s where our attentions are drawn to the nuances of character motivation and the setting in which these people live. Plot is important but secondary to our exploration of a world where desperate people take desperate steps to survive.Our protagonist here is kid who is selling counterfeit junk in New York when he is discovered by street hustler after he beats up some of the hustler's minions. Offered a chance to fight in a winner takes all contest the kid wins and starts to gain a name and engage in fights with bigger and bigger purses. Over time he develops a relationship with the hustler a love interest with a girl who isn't what she appears to be and reacquaints himself with a rival from his past.The fight sequences are raw brutal and quickthe atmosphere and settings of the fights are examined as much as the fight itself. We get a look into the street culture that supports these contests as well as the shady characters behind all of the arrangements and wagering that goes on. The hustler who becomes the kid's de facto manager has a past as well and while down on his luck sees the kid as a chance to regain the respect and position within the underground community they inhabit.Even though the relationship has the absolute opportunity to be exploitativeparticularly when the hustler asks the kid to take a dive the mutual respect and genuine fondness that develops between the two is great to see.I am happy with the actingTerence Howard who plays the hustler always comes through and the kid played by Channing Tatum comes across as a young DeNiro understated but with a sort of longing that comes through particularly when he is pursuing his love interest played by Zulay Henao. It reminded me a little of DeNiro's pursuit of Cybill Shepard in Taxi Driver before she figured out how screwed up he wassome small charm and a lot of persistence. The relationship between the kid and the hustler echoed that of Ratso Rizzo and Joe Buck in Midnight Cowboy. Like Ratso Howard's character saw a degree of redemption.As for the remaining cast the supporters came across as real humans not street caricatures that we are so used to seeing. The heavies who were played by the ever reliable Luis Guzman and Roger Guenveur Smith were menacing enough but never let their performances go overboard.I have a feeling that this is one of those movies that has slipped under a lot people's radar but as word of mouth gets out about it amongst people who like this sort of movie the rating now abysmally low will creep up where it should be.".

	schema:reviewBody "The running joke about most movies made in New York City is that pennypinching producers usually shoot spectacular aerial long vistas of the Big Apple and then lens everything else either in Canada or Hollywood. If you're ever visited N.Y.C. you can spot the difference between the actual locale usually unkempt and teeming with humanity and the comparative tidiness of Toronto or an immaculate Hollywood soundstage. Award winning Sundance film director Dito Montiel of A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints shot his new movie Fighting with Channing Tatum on the mean streets of 'the city that never sleeps' where Montiel grew up. The terrific authenticity of Gotham however cannot compensate for Fighting's punchdrunk plot about illegal street fighting.If you've seen Hard Times 1975 with Charles Bronson Every Which Way But Loose 1978 with Clint Eastwood Lionheart 1990 with Jean Claude Van Damme Fight Club 1999 with Edward Norton or Snatch with Brad Pit about underground bare knuckles boxing you've caught the cream of the crop. Generic from the getgo Fighting amounts to little more than a sluggish knucklesandwich saga that telegraphs its every surprise far in advance.Shawn MacArthur Cullman Alabama native Channing Tatum of Step Up hasn't been in the Big Apple long. He earns his keep selling books on the sidewalk. The first time Shawn tries to pedal his product with other vendors on Broadway several street hoods attack him and steal his money. He swaps blows with one of them and puts the guy down for the count. Watching this fracas from the periphery eagleeyed Harvey Boarden Terence Howard of Iron Man admires Shawn's pugilistic skills. Not surprisingly Shawn's assailants work for Harvey who earns his money as a street hustlerfight promoter.Eventually Shawn and Harvey have a close encounter. Initially Shawn just wants the dough back that Harvey's henchmen stole. Harvey convinces Shawn that he can earn 5thousand and more in illegal street fights. Gradually Shawn and Harvey grow to trust each other but beneath the surface unresolved tension simmers between them. Basically Harvey sees Shawn as his ticket to prosperity. Harvey hails from Chicago. He came to N.Y.C. with the dream of opening an IHOP while Shawn is fresh out of Birmingham Alabama. Shawn parted company with his wrestling coach father after a family dispute. Shawn's past catches up with him in the character of arrogant Evan Hailey Brian J. White of 12 Rounds who was a member of Shawn's father's wrestling team. When Shawn and Evan tangled in a fight Shawn's father intervened and Shawn put the smack down on dad. Indeed trouble with fathers is a theme that Montiel explored in depth in his first feature A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints. Montiel choreographs each of Shawn's brawls with a sloppy improvised realism. Unfortunately these slugfests lack the ferocity of last year's bare knuckled high school drama Never Back Down. Instead Tatum and his opponents engage in freeforall bouts that resemble the fisticuffs from the secondrate survivalist saga The Condemned 2007 where the combatants pounded on each other but we never saw fists smash flesh. What stands out about these fights is the locales. Montiel stages this fights in Gotham's ethnic neighborhoods such as the Russian enclaves in Brooklyn and the Hispanic hang0uts in the Bronx.The villains are anemic. Martinez Luis Guzman of Carlito's Way and Jack Dancing Roger Guenveur Smith of American Gangster are Harvey's old friends but they show him no respect. They want to eliminate Harvey and take on Shawn as their own boxer. Meanwhile Shawn and Evan talk tough about old times in Dixie. Evan openly antagonizes Shawn. Nevertheless these villains prove too lightweight to be intimidating.Good fight movies make you want to shadow box but Fighting lacks muster. Sadly too we are deprived of the inevitable training sequence that is part and parcel of any good Palookaville potboiler. Here Shawn engages in a quick workout on a subway before a bout.Montiel penned the script with Robert Munic of TV's The Cleaner. Fighting qualifies as little more than an anthology of cauliflowered clichs and stereotypes from boxing movies. Harvey and Shawn's relationship grows complicated when Harvey arranges a 100thousand winner takeallpurse and tries to persuade Shawn to throw the fight. This is one of those boxing plots as old as either Golden Boy 1939 with William Holden and The SetUp 1949 with Robert Ryan or more recently Bruce Willis in Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction 1994. Naturally Montiel and Munic provide our hero with some time out for romance. He meets cute sexy Zulay Valdez Zulay Heano of Grizzly Park who makes ends meet as an underpaid overworked singlemom waitress at a private club with a young daughter and a stern drill sergeant of a mother.Tatum channels Marlon Brando mumbling his dialogue and behaving so casually that he doesn't appear to be acting. Clearly Tatum is an up and coming cinematic contender a handsome but hardbitten hero in the Vin Diesel mode. Terence Howard who is usually very good looks miscast. He doesn't look as desperate for success as his character complains about being. Zulay Henao doesn't garner enough screen time to make much of an impression despite her high wattage smile.Fighting spends too much time pulling its punches to carry any clout.".

The last fight was the best and had the most point and story.The best thing about the film is Tatum's interaction with Howard who offers a fullon layered performance that actually makes the whole film worth seeing. The heart of the film is the relationship between these two men but the script seems afraid to explore it in any real depth. Instead it tilts toward the unconvincing romance between Shawn and Zulay. As noted by others the acting is pretty bad and the dialogue doesn't help much either. The film was also very predictable through. Also the characters ween't very developed at all. We barely know anything about the main characters. For the majority of the film the only thing we know about Shawn's past is that he left Birmingham to escape Daddy issues but there's so little depth to the character otherwise. We learn the most about Shawn when he runs into Evan Bailey Brian White an arrogant acquaintance from his past and you can immediately figure out where things are going to go confirmed 45 minutes later after that initial meeting with the revelation that Evan is an extreme fighter. We also don't know much about Harvey. At first it seemed like he was a bad guy and wanting to scam Shawn but throughout the film he seems to be on his side.As a rewatch 062018' Fighting is a certain film with more depth as it grows. Upon initial watch opinions have changed over the years. The film is more so a slow based drama than a strictly fighting film which is a main reason for panning from critics and fans. Rating changed from 3 to 7. Recommend for fans willing to give the film another chance. Although with its flaws the film has a steady pace and grows upon several watches.".

The desperate young knocks several robbers when they attempt to rob him some goods. After that he comes into contact with streetfight promoter  a hustler named Harvey Terrence Howard. Shawn teams up with the organizer of noholdsbarred bareknuckle fights that secretly entertain the wealthy across the streets and slums of N.Y.C. and links Shawn up with Martinez Luis Guzman.

Shawn decides that he has something worth brawling for and sets everything on the line to vanquish . Although Shawn only wants to bash opponents long enough to gain enough money to assist his girlfriend he is reluctant to let tricks in combats on the fighting circuit .Every knockout brings him closer to the existence he's always wished  but also carries him in a deadly cobweb he can't getaway.The picture contains drama thrills  and lots of violent brawls plenty of punch  kicks and knockouts. Acceptable performance from Channing Tatum as impulsive young becoming a professional streetfighter and battling a variety of contenders  plus Zulay Enao gives a surprisingly good acting as his gorgeous love interest and special mention to Terrence Howard as the sharpster who arranges his bareknuckled bouts . The picture belongs to subgenre about street combats as Lionheart with Jean Claude Van Damme and whose maxim representation turns out to be the classic Hard times by Walter Hill with Charles Bronson and James Coburn . It's a colorful but violent entertainment that results to be the second film of his director Dito Montiel.

They are certainly not worth sitting through the terrible storyline if you can call it that in between each fight. This film is tedious badly acted and must have one of the worst scripts ever committed to screen.I have to single out Terrence Howard for a particularly wooden performance his acting was so bad it almost made the rest of the cast look like they could vaguely act.This film makes Sylvester Stalone's 2006 film Rocky Balboa look like a cinematic masterpiece. One of the worst fighting films I've ever seen not that one can really describe it as a fighting film due to the lack of fight action in it.Utter drivel. Who ever wrote the quote on the front of the DVD case 'A Total KnockoutBrilliant' from the magazine Nuts must have been off his rocker. It should have read 'A Total DonkeyTerrible'.Definitely one of the worst films of 2009.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am not reviewing this as an art student or someone who critiques films for its depth or artistic quality...anyone who reads my reviews will know I love mainstream films. A similar film from 2008 Never Back Down see my review was excellent and I thoroughly enjoy it. Fighting was high on my list of films to see because I thought it would just be entertaining and fun and I suppose I had decent expectations but ultimately the film might have only not met those expectations but in fact I literally couldn't even make it through this absolute stinker. It is an absolute rarity that I can't force myself through a movie in order to review it. Fighting lacks exactly that...there is virtually such a complete and utter lack of action that it is mind blowingly boring. The performances from otherwise decent actors is disgusting and downright awful. I don't know where they went wrong other than the fact that they should have edited out a huge chunk of this film to make it more about the fighting. They lead you to believe that this is a film about a rough around the edges fighter who is trained to be a better fighter when in fact the rough around the edges fighter is repeatedly thrown in a ring and ferociously beats people while his manager tries to make a quick buck.After roles in the hilarious comedy She's The Man GI Joe and Public Enemies I really thought and still think Channing Tatum could be on his way to stardom. He certainly looks the part of a star but this is a major huge stumble in his career because he is simply awful in his role. He has muscles but his acting in this part is atrocious and its hard to watch him mumble and stumble his way through the awful script. Terrence Howard who is truly an astounding actor also slumps to dirt level as a sleazy fight manager who is almost as terrible as Tatum. He is unwatchable and that is almost hard to believe given who he is. Zulay Henao might be one tiny little shining star in this disaster as Tatum's love interest Zulay Valez. She doesn't get a lot of screen time but she is perhaps one of the few interesting characters and more of a pleasure than any of the other so called stars. My guess would be that Dito Montiel who directed and wrote this story thought street fighting and the underground world of fighting was cool so he slapped together the poorest concoction excuse for a movie in a very long time. Something like this should at the very least be tolerable and even entertaining. The fact that there is fighting however little there may be should make any red blooded violence loving male at least enjoy the flick and yet I could barely keep my eyes open and as hard as I wanted to try to finish watching it I watched over an hour of the film I couldn't find an excuse big enough to waste the time. Honestly I barely remember anything from the film as it wasn't even worth filing to the memory backs. There is far better films in this genre such as Never Back Down or going back to the eighties with films like Rocky or Karate Kid which at least had heart. This doesn't have any major organs...heart brain...or anything else. 110".

Any movie where you can actually see the Mic can not be good. And to not even edit it out before releasing in theaters really makes me think the director wasn't even trying to make a good movie. He definitely succeeded in making me never want to see another Channing movie again. I definitely will never recommend this movie to anyone. The funny part is my girlfriends friends liked the movie... which caused me to question their intelligence. I will never listen to them anymore when it comes to movies. A good 20 wasted on a horrible movie. So bad it actually made me depressed.I do not care what anyone says. This movie wasn't worth 25 cents. Through the entire movie me and my girlfriend were like should we leave? but since we had paid we sat there and laughed through it all the sad and dramatic sequences were hilariously bad.".

The story is so overused that it no longer can maintain an audience's interest the outcome of the film is guessed within the first few minutes. Briefly Shawn MacArthur model and type cast actor Channing Tatum works the streets of New York around Radio Music Hall selling ripoff copies of books and gadgets to tourists. He is involved in a fight observed by the quiet scam artist Harvey Boarden a wasted role for Terrence Howard and by a young girl Zulay Zulay Henao and while Shawn's eye fixes on Zulay Harvey's eye is on Shawn's possibilities as a 'fight for money' partner. Shawn moves in with Harvey develops a relationship with Zulay and proceeds to win fights for money until he is asked to fix a fight  a bit of conscience blurring created by a clash with his own father and the proposed opponent Evan Hailey Brian White  and ends his 'career' in a way we can all imagine. One would suppose we should care about the relationship between Shawn and Harvey and how mutually saprophytic it becomes but the script get in the way of have us care about anyone in the film  with the possible exception of Zulay's abuela Altagracia Guzmn a little cameo that almost make the rest of the film worth watching.

The sign on the door that says rent due actually happens in the real world. But for those who look at an apartment building and say how can anyone live like that will hate this film. This film is not for those who wince at the sight of a panhandler or for those who believe poor people with dreams are losers.This film is like Rocky 2009. The lead actor has a kind of James Dean style He is befriended by a fellow who is always looking for a way out of the hard life and that is similar to Midnight Cowboy. This film is also like Paul Newman's The Hustler or Steve McQueen's Cincinatti Kid. The down and out female lead compares the young fighters name to that of a knight. Those who have lived and struggled in the real world would probably appreciate this film.The purpose of this film is not to show how much blood it takes to revolt the audience or to push the envelope by being weird. The recent film The Wrestler was also a good film but the graphic and overwhelming film shots hurt that film. This film is just good old fashioned film making with a modern script and well acted. This film The Fighter is not about violence. It is just a good story with some good fight scenes. It is also somewhat like Slumdog Millionaire in its overall point. This film could be watched by mature teens and mature kids. Charles Dickens might also appreciate this film. This film is highly recommended.".

Poor script poor acting and very predictable story. In my opinion it's a remake to the Jean Claude Van Damme movie A.W.O.L. Channing Tatum mostly mumbles his way through the movie. Channing Tatum is better than this as is Terence Howard who is a very good actor but he was just passable with his role. Luiz Guzman and Roger Guenver Smith were seriously underused and these are two actors I've enjoyed watching over the years. Brian J White was decent as the Apollo Creed type bad guy and did well with what he had. I thought the love interest was flimsy at best and the fight scenes though believable could've been a bit better. What Montiel does do well with this movie is capture New York. He does by showing us in a documentary type fashion that New York is still one of the greatest cities in the world and it will never lose it's identity. All in all I would save this movie for another rainy Saturday evening on DVD because it's barely worthy of a cinematic release.".

Also in one of the first scenes Terrance Howard has one of the kids get him an Orange soda... The in the next few scenes you see a Mt. Dew.... NO ORANGE SODA! Also Terrance Howards voice in the whole movie was just plain annoying. I didn't really understand why they made him talk like that but it was just hard to listen to for the hour and forty five minutes!

I liked it that the fight audiences are standing right next to the fighters crowding in and even touching them.Make no mistake this is a B movie. Standard acting. The bad guys all sneer outrageously. The fighters endure punishment no one really could. The love subplot is off the shelf. Luis Guzman scowls right up until the end when his big smile is even more disturbing than his scowl. A few implausibilities such as the two main fight rivals in NYC happening to also have been wrestling rivals at an Alabama high school.This movie unmistakeably borrows some elements from Midnight Cowboy.

	schema:reviewBody "Had You Light Up My Life been promoted for what it was a lowbudget growingup film with a quirky and effective performance by Didi Conn it would be better regarded today. Rather than the minimalist promotion and distribution this type of film normally receives for some reason the distributors decided that this little film had the potential to make big money. So they threw more money into marketing than had gone into production they presold the film with a hit recording of the title song sung by Debby Boone although Kacey Cisyk actually does the singing in the film released concurrently with the film and they utilized a saturation booking technique normally reserved for their weaker blockbusters. This technique involves a lot of prerelease publicity and then opening it simultaneously in many theatres with the goal of generating quick profits before bad reviews and word of mouth kill attendance although a common practice today this was done less often in the 1970's. The result was a lot of viewers who rightly felt that the film did not live up to its blockbuster billing and a failure to appreciate the good points of the film. And there are some good points. Conn's earnest portrayal of a reluctant juvenile comedienne and good daughter trying to work out her adult identity rings true. You feel a protectiveness toward her that makes you more tolerant of the cornball elements. The child star vs stagefather stuff with Joe Silver seems genuine and the surreal television commercial material has some good comic qualities. Kacey Cisyk a session singer who was opera trained recorded the song for the film but initially declined to record it for commercial release. She may have felt that it had no potential or maybe she just didn't wanted to be closely associated with a pop standard. So they recruited Debby Boone and her version went to the radio stations and record stores. Cisyk actually appears in the film as one of the bridesmaids. Ironically although the song works fine within the film it hurts the film's reputation. People incorrectly believe that the film was just a lame attempt to exploit a hit record and that Boone was unwilling to allow her own version to be used in the production.Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is of course the film version of Debby Boone's hit song and it comes across as a rather uninspired effort but two of the actors in it make it a watchable flawed film. Story is about an aspiring singersongwriter and actress who makes ends meet by being a standup comedian mainly for children. Didi Conn is Laurie Robinson and even she admits that she's not very good at comedy but her father Sy Joe Silver has other ideas about her career. Laurie is days away from being married to Ken Stephen Nathan but one night in a restaurant she meets Chris Michael Zaslow who is instantly attracted to her. He takes her to his home and they get intimate. The next morning she tells him it was just a one night stand and doesn't want to see him again and she leaves. A few days later she goes in for an audition because a film crew needs an actress to dub in the stars singing voice. She walks in and finds out that the director of the film is Chris! She auditions with her song You Light Up My Life and everyone is very impressed. In fact they want her to be the star of the film! A few days later Laurie thinks she is in love with Chris and she decides to tell Ken that she doesn't want to get married. But then the roof falls in and she discovers that she has not been cast in the film and she goes to confront Chris who is busy with other females! The main story and script are very familiar and corny and the film really has nothing to offer that we haven't seen already in other films. Aspiring singer that has to tell her father that she needs to go on her own and telling her boyfriend that she really doesn't love him. Its been done before but this is not a bad film and its because of Conn and Silver. I've always been a fan of Silver and his work with David Cronenberg springs to mind immediately. The core of the film is the performance of Didi Conn who always brings a fresh realistic quality to her roles. She's the girl that you instantly take a shine to. She has that innocent and vulnerable quality that makes you root for her no matter what film she's in. Its a very natural quality but she's also a very good actress and her scenes with Silver are the best in the film. These two genuinely care for each other and its reflected on screen. One thing I noticed during the film were the scenes of Conn driving that old car. I'm not sure if Conn can drive in real life but she looks kind of uncomfortable sitting behind the wheel. And of course the scenes of Conn singing are lipsynched. The singing voice bares no resemblance to Conn's voice at all. And Conn and Silver worked on another film together that same year. They both did voices in the animated Raggedy Ann  Andy so they had a busy year together. This is not a very good film but Conn brings an undeniable charm to every performance she gives.".

Not only was the movie badly acted badly written and badly filmed it also ended in the middle. This movie is a really profoundly bad movie and we're not talking cultmoviebad here.

	schema:reviewBody "Here is a comingofage film that embodies everything 70's. It especially appeals to me because I was born in 1960  was a teenager in the 1970's. If a teen watches this film today it would seem hokey the cloths especially odd  unattractive the music sappy  the storyline threadbare. But if you were there it has a special nostalgic quality that is undeniable. This is an interesting story about a young woman finding herself  her way through life. Instead of padding the story out with too many unnecessary shots of Conn driving her car they should have fleshed out the characters a little more. The storyline was also choppy. One minute she's told she has a major part in a film  the next minute a deadpan blonde is hired instead. This sudden shift in the story is too abrupt a transition. Also when she tells her dad about the offer from Columbia Records to record her songs it came out of left field. Perhaps this should have been something her character struggled with. Should she stay in California  contemplate making the film  starting a new a relationship or go to New York  record? DiDi Conn is very likable in the lead  the music adds just the right romantic touch.".

The dotted swiss maxidresses in the waffle ad alone are pure concentrated midcentury goodness. Despite the brouhaha about the movie's titular song my favorite one was actually Do You Have A Piano which is short endearing and peppy with great harmonies. Too bad they didn't use it for the opening credits instead of the momentumdraining California Daydreams.Didi Conn is fine in the role of the young Hollywood hopeful and easy to like with her wideeyed fresh faced earnestness though I think that Melanie Mayron who plays her bff Annie Gerard delivers a more subtle and natural performance than Conn who has a broader more musical theater or sitcom style. The girl's conflicts with her father are certainly valid but why would anyone think that the same few 20yearold jokes could be funny in a comedy act or that ventriloquism isn't annoying enough in itself? I did like the scene after her onstage meltdown when she says she just learned something very painful but important that you can only really depend on yourself and that it's no shame to be alone in fact it's a necessary part of growing up. I'm still struggling with that one myself! Odd that the title song which plays at the end as she embarks on her new life has the exact opposite meaning You give me strength to carry on ...right after she realizes that strength must come from within. The production values are what I think really crippled this movie. You can barely hear the actors' voices in crowd scenes actors are inexplicably shot in profile while speaking so you can't see their faces Conn looks oddly hunchbacked in her driving scenes and the exposition before the credits has the amaterurish feeling of a student project. I can see why audiences were disappointed after the huge media blitz it received. You would be if you expected a high budget blockbuster instead of a slightly awkward little coming of age story with a few catchy pop songs. Too bad the producers didn't have enough faith in the movie to let it stand on its own but that's Hollywood. Ironic that a running theme in this pic is the misguided fakeness of ad campaigns.Still I found it to be an enjoyable 2 hr time capsule with decent performances a plucky underdog lead character and a touching scene or two. I liked Conn's faint Brooklyn accent and the natural prettiness of the actresses at a time when young women were allowed to look like actual human beings on film and not perfect little plastic dolls. I'll take awkward but earnest over slick and shallow anytime!".

Didi Conn more famous for her role in Grease is sweet and vulnerable as Laurie a daughter of a Vaudeville comedian Joe Silver and they have been performing on stage since she was a kid. Laurie never enjoyed comedy and she is really not that good at it and somehow her father has never noticed that she lacks funny bones. Laurie does have a talent for singing and songwriting and decides to breakout on her own.She also realises that she may not love her boyfriend and then has a one night stand with a man who turns out to be a movie director who promises her a part in a film after she dubs the singing voice of the star. It turns out that the director was just using her and made empty promises.Its a corny independent film of 1970s cinema. Conn is sweet and she has a good rapport with Joe Silver who plays her father. She drives around in a beat up car. The title track is familiar because it was a big hit but the film has been largely forgotten.It has to be noted that director Joseph Brooks in later life was charged for casting couch rapes. I wonder if the shallow yet sleazy director was based on himself!".

It's a pity she's just so nice  if she were trashier and more traditionally attractive she could have a much bigger career. As some others have said the award winning title song is also good the first few times around but gets a little tiresome after a while. But the movie is one I can watch over and over well at least several times a year and still enjoy.For anyone who's also a romantic and prefers films with heart to those with an edge it's a must see.".

There is romance and the title song 'You Light Up My Life.' The song is a major plot device much like Bette Midler's 'Wings Beneath My Wings' is for BEACHES.  Debbie Boone's rendition of the song was second only to Bing Crosby's White Christmas as the most popular single in history due in part to listeners attaching a spiritual tone to the lyrics led by Christian radio stations and the fact that Debbie Boone was part of the Pat Boone family.  Debbie Boone was singing the song on every talk and variety show on TV she was very attractive very wholesome once again Pat Boone's daughter and TV loved her.  This helped bring people into the theaters to see the movie in fact was the only reason why people went to see the movie.  Debbie Boone was not in the film nor was her voice.  This was very disappointing to most people.  Didi Conn mostly known at the time for wacky characters on TV sitcoms not unlike her GREASE character didn't sing the song in the film though she sort of sang in GREASE.  If only they had cast Debbie Boone.  The song is a classic the film alas is not.

Yes I get it pump action as in shotguns which the video case shows on the back cover and heart beats  however anyone thinking it is going to be a comedy...i.e that they might laugh much is going to be very disappointed. Oh hold on perhaps it's a black comedy so we are not supposed to laugh?....hmmm....the back of the video case says hilarious storyFrankly I wonder if this film really needed to be made. and if it had been decided that it was integral to the plot that the two male leads of the racial and physical types depicted then the producers might have been better off with people more used to making comedies like Eddie Murphy and Danny De Vito.The only scene that was at all well done was near the start when Jack Mooney's superior officer was chewing out for using the Nword. I've seen a similar scene in another film with Nick Nolte I think and it was done better there. The plot had several glaring continuity errors some of which are already on this site. But here are some more all of which occur in the same 5 minute segment. When Jack Mooney nearly rejects Denzil Washinton's heart Denzil is on the bed and suggests that they could play video games together. But surely not as he would not be able to handle the controls as earlier on in the film Denzil revealed that he was unable to shut a door as he could only touch Jack Mooney. Then when Jack Mooney discharges himself from hospital he gets into a police car. Where on earth did the keys for that suddenly materialise from? And when the receptionist at the hospital makes a phone call ALL the heart monitors she is supposed to be watching are either switched off or are flat lining. Early on in the film Jack Mooney is swigging from a bottle which he has apparently just bought hence the bag it is in but one swig later the bottle is 34 empty. The 5 kilogram cat seemingly has what appears to be a lethal dose of whisk bourbon as well but apparently without any ill effect.The plot even once we accept the premise of a ghost coming back is frankly unbelievable. Early on in the film we learn that Napoleon Stone Denzil Washington's lawyer character has been killed just in case his hooker clients him told him anything  yet the hookers themselves are kept alive seemingly with attempts only being made to kill them many months later towards the end of the film. As for the final scene the gunfight has to be one of the most unbelievable ever seen. It is somewhat unbelievable that the bad guys didn't seem to have a look out watching for his arrival and gun him down from the front windows as he walked towards the building. However Jack manages to enter the building without any opposition. He then decides that the ideal strategy is to use the wizard's Eye strategy send the ghost on ahead to scout the place out. A good idea surely. The ghost does this and reports a bad guy with a big gun waiting in the next room. So without further ado avoids him and heads up the stairs....without getting the ghost to check the upstairs areas first. No matter as none of the bad guys seem to be waiting for that possibility. By contrast later on when a bad guy is coming cautiously up the stairs Jack blows him away in an instant.Later on in the same gunfight Jack is trying to escape with his girl who is severely drugged and thus unable to walk unassisted. This causes problems as Jack Mooney is barely able to stand himself. The ghost is unable to help her but it does not seem to occur to either him or Jack that the solution is for Jack to lean on the ghost and thus for the ghost to take the weight in that way. This solution had already been used when Jack discharged himself from the hospital and was leaning on the ghost.Anyway despite Jack Mooney still suffering from his heart condition being severely wounded in the chest during the early stages of the gunfight and barely able to stand he is revealed as a supreme gunfighter and marksman. It seems that even the tear gas canister that he threw himself and then ran straight into the area of effect of didn't have any adverse affect his stamina eyesight or lightening quick reflexes as he killed all 5 of the baddies with just 5 shots including shots as he dived to the floor span round to kill the guy behind him and fired one handed.Denzil Washington was right to fire his agent after this turkey.".

It's definitely the chemistry between two great actors  a great actress sorely very underused. Bigoted cop Hoskins playing the role to a nice tee suffers a major heart attack after years of eating those fast foods we so much love. He has a transplant from a dead guy Washington. Coincidentally it's the slick lawyer of a former girlfriendprostitute the versatile Webb he's been tailing. And guess what after surviving the heart attack he reappears only for Hoskins's eyes where he implores this cop now reassigned to desk duty and a strict diet to him find the killers he fell afoul of. Denzel is perfectly suited for his role where we are reminded of just how good an actor he is. Webb an actress I like is just as good looking beautiful as Hoskins's girl who has a secret of her own. The film doesn't work as a comedy despite some cute dialogue of Washington and some mad antics from Hoskins's parading as a nutso. Still as an entertaining crime adventure film it works mainly from it's contributing performances where as an end treat we have that great song by Bonnie Raitt It also again raises that issue of health where like me a too little number are adverse to eating the healthy stuff.".

Of course in the process he gets more than he bargained foror did he? Perhaps he was seeking an exciting and intriguing diversion from boredom all along.The story stretches the limits of believability throughout yet this is easy to forgive and forget in light of magnificent performances by Willem Dafoe Mickey Rourke and others which draw you deep enough into the action that you'll soon forget none of this could ever happen. Rourke is the definition of cool as Gorman Lennox a sleazy yet charismatic arms dealer. But it is Dafoe who turns in the best performance as an ordinary man who is compelled to put himself into an extraordinarily dangerous situation for reasons even he probably doesn't quite understand. I was thoroughly entertained just watching Dafoe's reaction every time circumstances threatened to blow his cover. All told Deputy Ray Dolezal Dafoe is one of the most genuinely likeable characters I've seen on film.With a clever script plenty of plot twists outstanding performances and marvelous desert cinematography White Sands is definitely a film worth watching.".

'It's a movie' so we cut it some slack and accept things that on the whole might be somewhat unlikely.Right at the outset White Sands demands a great deal from our reserves of suspended disbelief and this is because a small hick town sheriff who turns out to be a very thorough and exacting crime scene detective responds to the discovery in his jurisdiction of an apparent suicide victim who has a briefcase containing a huge amount of money by becoming the sole selfappointed investigator. Then he discovers a lead and with no backup whatsoever he decides to take the whole briefcase full of money and set out in a convertible '65 Corvette no less on a quest to find information about the deceased through pretending to be that person!As our good sheriff drives off and away from his beautiful wife in his oddly chosen very valuable classic convertible sports car all alone and with half a million bucks in unknown and unsecured evidence in a briefcase on the seat beside him we know that he has no idea whom he might meet. What will such people think of this moneystuffed briefcase packing shill of the victim whom for all our sheriff knows might know is in fact dead? We may well be excused for thinking 'That wouldn't happen that way in real life'. Do ya think?With a lesser actor in the lead role we might be inclined to see if it isn't too late to get out of our seats and go back to the ticket booth and make a scene about a refund or to make a phone call and see if the video store is still open but it's Willem Dafoe and he does pretty darned well with the material.If our next thought seeing this lone man set off on his quest with his unsecured briefcase of money is something along the lines of 'This can't be good...' then we are treated to the fulfilment of our forebodings. It does become much better though. If we forgive the movie's presumption to this point then we are treated to a somewhat less demanding remainder. To say any more would be to do a job of telling that the movie actually does much better than I can.There are several big names in the cast and they do a commendable job. The plot thickens the characters develop and the viewer is never required to strain credulity to the degree demanded by that setup scenario. It's a generally satisfactory movie and if not in the league of the giants you shouldn't regret viewing it.Present ratings are rather harsh for this drama but for my part I'd think it warrants a solid 7.".

	schema:reviewBody "White Sands is a stylish thriller with numerous twists and turns and a collection of characters who frequently aren't who they appear to be. It's also a great looking and atmospheric film with stunning scenery and marvellous cinematography by Peter Menzies Jnr. The story begins as an investigation into a mystery which could involve murder and then develops into the uncovering of a great deal of corruption and even a conspiracy which may be politically motivated.When a dead body's found in the desert and Deputy Sheriff Ray Dolezal Willem Dafoe goes out to investigate he isn't sure whether the dead man who had a gun in his hand and a suitcase with 500000 in it had committed suicide or been murdered. Dolezal discovers that the man's name was Bob Spenser and then decides to pose as Spenser in order to continue his investigations. Dolezal rings a telephone number found on a piece of paper in Spenser's stomach during the autopsy and this leads to him arranging a meeting at a motel where he gets attacked and robbed of the money in the suitcase. The two women who attacked him then give him instructions to get in touch with Gorman Lennox Mickey Rourke.Before he contacts Lennox Dolezal gets abducted by an FBI agent called Greg Meeker Samuel L Jackson who explains that Spenser was working for him and agrees that Dolezal should carry on posing as Spenser in order to try to recover the lost money.After meeting with Lennox and his associate Lane Bodine Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio Dolezal finds himself embroiled in a deal to buy some illegal weapons from a couple of dealers who unexpectedly demand a further 250000 to complete the sale. Meeker is unwilling to provide the extra money and so Dolezal gets romantically involved with the wealthy and well connected Bodine as a means of getting her to raise the extra money.Further complications arise when two FBI officers from Internal Affairs pursue Dolezal because they think that he killed Spenser and stole the money and also one of Spenser's girlfriends provides Dolezal with some potentially helpful information. Furthermore when he realises that he's become involved in an even wider conspiracy involving the CIA he then takes an unconventional course of action which leads to what he regards as a satisfactory conclusion.This movie features a cast of top quality actors whose excellent performances are vital to its success and the pace of the action is great especially considering the plot's many complications and unexpected developments. Ultimately it's an extremely enjoyable and absorbing tale of a man whose boredom with his mundane life leads him to take the opportunity for some excitement by taking on a case where he soon finds that he's completely out of his depth.".

	onyx:emotionText "White Sands is a stylish thriller with numerous twists and turns and a collection of characters who frequently aren't who they appear to be. It's also a great looking and atmospheric film with stunning scenery and marvellous cinematography by Peter Menzies Jnr. The story begins as an investigation into a mystery which could involve murder and then develops into the uncovering of a great deal of corruption and even a conspiracy which may be politically motivated.When a dead body's found in the desert and Deputy Sheriff Ray Dolezal Willem Dafoe goes out to investigate he isn't sure whether the dead man who had a gun in his hand and a suitcase with 500000 in it had committed suicide or been murdered. Dolezal discovers that the man's name was Bob Spenser and then decides to pose as Spenser in order to continue his investigations. Dolezal rings a telephone number found on a piece of paper in Spenser's stomach during the autopsy and this leads to him arranging a meeting at a motel where he gets attacked and robbed of the money in the suitcase. The two women who attacked him then give him instructions to get in touch with Gorman Lennox Mickey Rourke.Before he contacts Lennox Dolezal gets abducted by an FBI agent called Greg Meeker Samuel L Jackson who explains that Spenser was working for him and agrees that Dolezal should carry on posing as Spenser in order to try to recover the lost money.After meeting with Lennox and his associate Lane Bodine Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio Dolezal finds himself embroiled in a deal to buy some illegal weapons from a couple of dealers who unexpectedly demand a further 250000 to complete the sale. Meeker is unwilling to provide the extra money and so Dolezal gets romantically involved with the wealthy and well connected Bodine as a means of getting her to raise the extra money.Further complications arise when two FBI officers from Internal Affairs pursue Dolezal because they think that he killed Spenser and stole the money and also one of Spenser's girlfriends provides Dolezal with some potentially helpful information.

This overcomplicated movie challenges the viewer's understanding way too much and eventually you will lose interest. It really is a shame because the cast gives their best effort with what is a severely disjointed script. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and the blue Corvette are easy on the eyes but it's not enough to maintain momentum and the whole thing derails twenty minutes in and never recovers. True there are a few strong scenes but a plethora of dead material is unfortunately connecting them. Not recommended.  MERK".

	schema:reviewBody "Roger Donaldson's White Sands is a nice picturesque piece of early 90's noir escapism. It's set in the vast expanse of the white gypsum deserts of New Mexico where it gets its title from. The film makes use of numerous chopper shots to illustrate the landscape nicely set to an appropriately synthy ambient score. Willem Dafoe in a rare lead role is excellent as small town sheriff Ray Dolezal who stumbles upon a murdered FBI agent in the back end of nowhere impulsively propelling him down a well of black market intrigue and dangerous circumstances. He unwisely poses as the fed and gets himself way in over his head with the wrong kind of people. Mickey Rourke plays a high mannered low life arms dealer with his usual brand of slick Mach pizazz and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio uses her unmistakably sultry presence to great effect as a mysterious sexy financial backer to their operation. Samuel L. Jackson struts his stuff before big screen fame as a conniving FBI big cheese and the colourful supporting troupe include M. Emmett Walsh Mimi Rogers Maura Tierney James Rebhorn Miguel Sandoval Fred Dalton Thompson and John P. Ryan. When the slightly over convoluted plot threatens to mire us in bewilderment like the characters get mired in the white deserts of their own morally questionable actions the solid work from the actors brings us back on track. Even when we don't know exactly what is going on and it's over complicated for complexities sake we're still intrigued by the lone star almost Cormac McCarthy like nature of the story and the cast who are more than willing to commit. Dafoe soars when given the right material and he's on fire here giving Dolezal a borderline reckless personality and thirst for exodus from the mundane deputy's life that he sells just by being present in every scene. Rourke plays up his bad boy persona with spectacularly coiffed hair and a belligerent laid back violent streak. It's got a lonely desolate air to it perfect for a contemplative yet not too heavy thinking night of cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first time I saw this some years ago I thought it was a pretty good thriller but this time around I must have been more mature more demanding more suave and debonair. I thought it sucked.Not the opening which seems bursting with promise  a dead man and a satchel full of half a million dollars found in the arid wasteland of New Mexico the autopsy and the release of the intestinal gas. And not the cast either  I mean Mickey Rourke Willem DaFoe Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio Maura Tierney Samuel L. Jackson and M. Emmet Walsh? Not to mention the redoubtable Fred Dalton Thompson.But they didn't bring it home the films promise undercut by weaknesses in the script and the direction.The script. I was frankly confused. Oh I knew DaFoe was a rural police officer who was adopting the identity of the dead man and taking his half million bananas in order to find the killers. But then he is swept up in some insane gunrunning scheme in Santa Fe involving greedy and corrupt federal officers. Mastrantonio is there to provide a curiously attractive face with a smile that stretches from ear to ear. She is instantly attracted to DaFoe when she meets him and she tells him so. Ten minutes later she is assaulting him in the shower. After a night together she is deeply in love with him. Only in the movies. I would happily outline the story for you but I can't. If I got into it any more deeply than those few suggestions above you wouldn't follow it. Or maybe you would and it's my fault for suffering a few too many periods of microsleep during this viewing.The direction is pedestrian at best. Every other shot seems to be a close up as if the production were designed for the television screen. And with the exception of the final scene that has Jackson running madly across the rolling sugary dunes of White Sands National Monument with a suitcase full of sand no effective use is made of the locations. The exterior of the La Fonda Hotel is real enough though as is the hotel itself one of the earliest in North America. It was established by the Statler chain in AD 495. Santa Fe is an artsy city with its own opera and other civilized amenities and deserves better display. I live in the poorest county in the state but I can lie in the gutter and stare at the stars.It's too bad really because the performances are as good as they are. Rourke is the perfect slime ball. Mastrantonio signals emotion with barely perceptible winces  she's really okay. Samuel L. Jackson is full of indignation authority and irony.Yet here we are with more than a million dollars worth of stateoftheart arms destined for shipment to unidentified rebels and it shows up for five minutes then disappears from the plot and the movie.".

I thought it sucked.Not the opening which seems bursting with promise  a dead man and a satchel full of half a million dollars found in the arid wasteland of New Mexico the autopsy and the release of the intestinal gas. And not the cast either  I mean Mickey Rourke Willem DaFoe Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio Maura Tierney Samuel L. Jackson and M. Emmet Walsh? Not to mention the redoubtable Fred Dalton Thompson.But they didn't bring it home the films promise undercut by weaknesses in the script and the direction.The script. I was frankly confused.

Now most of this movies showed some great potential but yet somehow Donaldson manages to not let this movie pass the mark of average. I really liked his movie Thirteen Days though which was just great but this mostly was due to its compelling historic tense story. Even that movie shows great flaws in the directing. Even though he doesn't make that great movies he still makes well known wells which also really is an accomplishment I must admit.I'm afraid that this movie is also a typical example of a Roger Donaldson movie. The concept of the movie sounds just great and shows more than enough potential to create a tense and original thriller with with perhaps even noir elements in it. And also just look at the cast how could you go wrong with this? The movie is still a decent one but it leaves lots of potential unused. The movie is not really ever tense or mysterious mostly because of the reason that the story always stays way too vague and overcomplicated with twists that don't always seem to make credible sense. In the end you just simply stop caring about the story and its characters.It's an amazing cast if you look at it. It features stars such as Willem Dafoe Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio Mickey Rourke M. Emmet Walsh Miguel Sandoval James Rebhorn and also actors who weren't big stars yet at the time such as Samuel L. Jackson and Maura Tierney. The actors all do their very best but at times they're obviously struggling with the confusing script and formulaic dialog. See it or don't. It's not a bad movie but it ain't a recommendable one either.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

The plot contains several potential villains but their real identities and their various motivations are terribly confusing.

None of the characters are especially interesting.The story also suffers from various standard film clichs tough guys who talk tough characters who spend a lot of time pointing guns at each other the obligatory nude shower scene a gory autopsy and so on. Another big problem here is the casting of Willem Dafoe. With his heavyduty Northern accent he is not at all convincing as a redneck sheriff.Lacking thematic depth or significant originality White Sands is just another film about some cop who tries to solve a crime alone and in the process encounters assorted characters and risks.

Things take a dangerous turn for Dewley and Jerry Lee when Dewley's girlfriend Tracey played by Mel Harris is taken hostage by Lyman.

But they are not so dominant that the movie suffers. In fact they play well in this situation though it IS sad to watch a grown man who is romantically jealous of a dog.This fails any Oscar possibilities but I do not honestly believe that would surprise those involved with this work. The bottom line This is a fun movie. It fails to warm the heart as well as Turner and Hooch but does not make you feel sorry for the dog like some other movies have along this venue. It is entertaining and fun and rates a 6.610 from...the Fiend .".

So taken this into consideration it isn't that bad a film it is just very stereotyped and unimaginative.  The mismatched partner' clich is wheeled out yet again and it does feel a little forced.  It gives rise to the odd laugh but not very many nor does it manage to really get the heart racing as it has action but no real tension or excitement.The guns language and hints of violence make this unsuitable for kids but I don't know who else would happily watch this and accept it as entertainment? I watched it without any effort and found it ok' but not much more than that I wouldn't watch it again but it passed 90 minutes for me.  But if you're expecting to be able to get more than that from it then I'd give it a pass.Belushi is actually quite good in the lead when you consider that he has to carry the whole film himself.  He is mostly onscreen with the dog and he does well to hold the attention  he's not hilarious but he has enough energy to cover the gaps.  Of the support cast Tighe does OK as the baddie of the piece but other than that the only other person who really stood out was a prefame William Sadler as a car salesman although it was funny to see Mel Harris outside of her thirtysomething role!Overall this is OK as brain dead entertainment.  It sticks to clich all the way through and you can easily see the gags coming from a mile away even though they aren't that funny.  If you just want to waste 90 minutes like I did then this is OK for an undemanding audience however it isn't funny or exciting or involving enough to be considered worthwhile viewing in my opinion.".

Dubbed as the Dog comedy  other than Turner  Hooch that the dog doesn't die from the gun shot. For that reason K9 beats out Tom Hank's Doggy comedy for being the better family film of 1989!".

Trouble is is that Dooley has no idea how to treat a dog and Jerry Lee is more of a maverick cop than he is!Given its low rating it's hard to know what sort of film the critics and general movie watching public were expecting with this one. Since a buddy buddy cop movie staring James Belushi and a German Shepherd Dog doesn't say anything other than the film we actually get. By the time of K9's release it was evident what sort of film would be Belushi's staple money earner the kind that called for him to play the cocky quipper with a glint in his eye. Belushi would try to abandon his buffoonery roles post Curly Sue who could blame him after that mess really? and attempt to be a more dramatic action type actor. It wouldn't work his excellent performances in Oliver Stone's Salvador and The Principal the latter also criminally undervalued were long behind him. So you hear the name James Belushi in relation to films and you by and large think larking about action comedies. Coming a year after Red Heat it looks like Belushi is wearing the same suit from that film in this one! K9 delivers exactly what it screamed out it would from the off.Technically the film has very few things to recommend but as a family friendly action comedy it has much to laud. The interplay between man and dog is great fun they are both members of the animal kingdom they both got needs and they are both great cops. Yes we are never in any doubt that after a troubled start this pairing are going to become firm friends and that ultimately by hook crook and paw they will get the job done. Belushi has a nice line in facial comedy and he also never comes up short in delivering quips with panache and a confidence that often belies the trouble his characters are often in. The dog too is hilarious hats of to animal handler Robert Zides. Courtesy of writers Steven Siegel  Scott Myers this is a dog that eats chili and wants to vie with Dooley for Tracy's affections Mel Harris as Dooley's frustrated girlfriend. It makes for a number of funny setups that both man and beast revel at being involved in. Kevin Tighe as villain Lyman is a touch under written and the obligatory emotional heart tugger moment now looks like over egging the formula pudding. But this is harmless witty fun that gets in and does its job without proclaiming to be anything other than what it is. 710".

Not sure if there was a third movie to complete the set so that it would be like the trio set of films such as the underwater trio of The Abyss Leviathan and Deepstar Six. These two films basically had cops who were not dog lovers getting partnered up with a new canine pup. In the case of Tuner and Hooch it was a matter of Hanks character kind of inheriting the dog from the owner killed by some bad guys and Hanks thinks the dog can i.d. the killer. Here it is a bit more realistic as Jim Belushi needs a drug sniffing dog so he kind of gets stuck with one of the worst on the force. I enjoy this one better than the Hanks' one but both have some rather humorous moments and both did fairly well for movies back in the 80's as this one made 42 million and Hooch made 72 million. I see from the scores though that they are not highly revered movies but like I said I thought they both were good. This one just worked a bit better for me. I am not saying Belushi is a better actor than Hanks far from it but I liked his character a bit more than the one Hanks portrayed. I also think German Shepards are one of the best breed of big dog so that is probably why I am biased against the other one a bit. This one also had a much funnier ending than did that one.

	onyx:emotionText "Pursuing crime boss Lyman maverick cop Dooley is tipped over the edge when a false lead ends up with an attempt on his life. Determined to finally get his man Dooley enlists the help of a police dog called Jerry Lee The Killer to hopefully sniff out the drugs that he knows Lyman is involved in. Trouble is is that Dooley has no idea how to treat a dog and Jerry Lee is more of a maverick cop than he is!Given its low rating it's hard to know what sort of film the critics and general movie watching public were expecting with this one. Since a buddy buddy cop movie staring James Belushi and a German Shepherd Dog doesn't say anything other than the film we actually get. By the time of K9s release it was evident what sort of film would Belushi's staple money earner the kind that called for him to play the cocky quipper with a glint in his eye. Belushi would try to abandon his buffoonery roles post Curly Sue who could blame him after that mess really? and attempt to be a more dramatic action type actor. It wouldn't work his excellent performances in Oliver Stone's Salvador and The Principal the latter also criminally undervalued were long behind him. So you hear the name James Belushi in relation to films and you by and large think larking about action comedy. Coming a year after Red Heat it looks like Belushi is wearing the same suit from that film in this one! K9 delivers exactly what it screamed out it would from the off.Technically the film has very few things to recommend but as a family friendly action comedy it has much to laud. The interplay between man and dog is great fun they are both members of the animal kingdom they both got needs and they are both great cops. Yes we are never in any doubt that after a troubled start this pairing are going to become firm friends and that ultimately by hook crook and paw they will get the job done. Belushi has a nice line in facial comedy and he also never comes up short in delivering quips with panache and a confidence that often belies the trouble his characters are often in. The dog too is hilarious hats of to animal handler Robert Zides. Courtesy of writers Steven Siegel  Scott Myers this is a dog that eats chili and wants to vie with Dooley for Tracy's affections Mel Harris as Dooley's frustrated girlfriend. It makes for a number of funny setups that both man and beast revel at being involved in.

My favorite parts include Jerry Lee the dogs name sneaking into the bed while poor Jim Belushi is trying to get some and when he gets into the limo and screws the rich guys dog while lets get it on is being played because its like the dog is telling Jim I can do it but you can't nyah nyah But Jim gets even when he runs the dog through the car wash without the roof because he refused to take a bath. I also like what happens at the end where we see a sad moment where Jim thought the dog was dying in the vet office and he sadly tells him how he really feels about him being a good friend and what not. it turns out old jerry lee was playing possum. It just goes to show that you can take a sad moment and at the last minute make it a funny moment.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's been a number years since I watched this movie and like so many movies from this era I had anticipated that my fond memories of Jerry Lee and Dooley would be clouded by the rose coloured spectacles of nostalgia however I was wrong.Parts of this movie like so many others of it's ilk are locked in that eighties timeframe yet I enjoyed this movie more than when I first saw it. Yes it has its faults it is predictable and at times over simplistic yet it held my attention from beginning to end.This is one of those movies that exceeds the sum of it's parts. Although out shadowed by Turner and Hooch this movie delivers so much more in the way of laughs and down to earth fun. Unlike Tom Hanks's character Dooley is not perfect his faults are many yet he is a likable character. There's no blossoming love interest he's already happily married and he really isn't searching for anything within his life. Dooley is a man who knows where his life is and although this may not be where he wants to be he is happy.And Jerry Lee? Well anyone familiar with German Shepherd dogs will identify with this movie. Whether intentional or not this movie captures the fun loving and at times mischievous persona of these dogs which is in stark contrast to the role often found for German Shepherds on TV and in the movies. This is without a doubt my favourite doggy caper ever. It's not a perfect movie and most people will see it's many faults yet it is fun. And far from the usual scruffy mutt and lovable kid movie it's a kids movie made for adults and this is why it works. Some will love it others will hate it yet if you ignore the dated looks and predictability I'm sure enjoyment will ensue therefore just sit back with some friends and enjoy what is still a great movie.".

We thus forgo the thrill that an underground environment could provide. There's no feeling of amazement no claustrophobia from tight crawlways no real fear of any kind. The film's fast pace combined with characters we barely know and care nothing about thus dilutes the intended suspense.The cinematography is flashy and very technical. The lighting is appropriately subdued with interesting colors and unusual camera angles. The background music is somewhat intrusive. Dialogue is weak. And the actors who appear to be in their twenties are all photogenic straight out of central casting. The monsters what we see of them seem slightly hokey.Overall The Cave will appeal to viewers who like horror films set in unusual environments wherein the pace is super fast and there is a ton of action.

It's not the next best thing to Aliens but it's not the travesty most reviewers here are making it out to be either.The Cave is a fun popcorn flick. There's no really deep plot or amazing acting talent. What this movie does have is a few very intense suspenseful moments which is only aided by the very dark and claustrophobic atmosphere of the cave. It also has your average thriller twist at the end which I did not see coming.The cinematography and directing by firsttimer Bruce Hunt is surprisingly well done. His background as assistance director for the Matrix films and Dark City is apparent here. While he's no Spielberg or Cameron he keeps the camera angles interesting and there are scenes within vast tall rooms in the cave that are quite breathtaking. One complaint however is that he chose to follow other directors mistakes in jarring the camera in a very frenetic and sickening manner back and forth whenever one of the characters is being attacked by the creature. This is not only very annoying and disorienting but is IMO just a trick to cover up the poor creature fx.Speaking of the FX I have to say I'm 5050 here. Sometimes they looked good and sometimes they looked like they were from a SciFi Channel original movie. The creature effects that looked good were the closeups which utilized real models. These looked quite realistic. But far away shots of the CGI creatures are not so impressive.If you want to sit down on a Friday night and just have fun then pick up The Cave.".

These beasts are what makes the movie worth seeing. Sure there are some that look like rubber toys but some of the big guys look absolutely stunning. They are destined to become legends once the movie hits home video.I can see the toys now Should you see this? If you like great monsters yes you'll want to see this. If like horror movies you can give it a try but understand its just an okay horror movie not anything more. If you want a great movie find something else.".

Flash forward to present day where a geological expedition comes across the mouth of the cave. They call in an experienced group of cavers to map the place out but an underwater passage way collapses sealing them over a mile underground with no hope of being rescued. They begin searching for a way out only to come to the realization that they aren't alone not only are there bizarre undiscovered creatures but also the group of explorers from three decades ago who are no longer quite human I just got back from seeing this in a nearmidnight show. There were a total of 9 other people in the theatre not a good sign really and combined with the almost exclusively rotten IMDb reviews I wondered if I'd made a mistake. Deciding not to waste my eight bucks and ride the film out I actually enjoyed what this flick had to offer A claustrophobic atmosphere stunning photography plenty of action cool monsters and nifty special effects. This is the directional debut of Bruce Hunt a former secondunit director on the Matrix films and 1998's Dark City. While he handles some of the dialogue scenes awkwardly he certainly knows how to make the film LOOK good. Man this flick is GORGEOUS! Not only are the cave sets great fantastic production values on this one but their lit perfectly and surprisingly realistically. Kudos to cinematographer Ross Emery for giving this flick the visual kick it needed. As for the actors just about everyone here does well especially Cole Hauser and Morris Chestnut. The only weak actor here is Piper Perabo. Sure she's pretty but she really really needs to develop some ACTING skills. Then there are the creatures. We never get a lingering look at them but they are COOL. I'm glad the creatures were mostly created with puppets and prosthetic instead of CG what little CG there is was mostly limited to shots of the creatures flying it was a wise move by the filmmakers. Effects artist Patrick Tatopoulos who also handled the creatures in Independence Day Pitch Black and Underworld has done a great job as usual. Some people have called Tatopoulos the next Stan Winston and based on the work he's done so far in his career this very much might be true. Also worth noting is the score by Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek which though often lowkey is pulsepounding and exciting and keeps the action flowing nicely. The ending is your typical twisted horror ending but hey it works anyways.Is The Cave a masterpiece of modern filmmaking? No. Would it have been better if it had had an R rating and more gore? Most certainly. Still this summer creature feature is more entertaining than I expected it to be I came in praying I might get at least a LITTLE enjoyment out of it and in the end I got more than I expected to. Enjoy!6.510.".

It isn't original but it does nothing badly and is interesting enough to spend 1.5 hours with.Firstly why is it that the entire team consists of hunks and babes? Even the scientists are good looking chicks. Oh well we'll just have to suspend our thinking and just accept that actors have to be good looking these days even if their roles completely rule out looking like a supermodel.As for the movie itself the action plot if there is any to speak of effects and direction are OK as is the acting.. Once again nothing special novel or interesting but not bad either. The editing was decent except for the action shots. Why does every editor andor director think that they are doing an MTV clip these days? Keep the camera still! If you think I can see what's going on in random .3 second bursts of film you're wrong. So irritating.The effects are OK. Although at times the caves are lit in ways that are impossible for the little flashlights to accomplish the set is generally dark enough to be realistic. The caves look real. The monsters are not that good but they are almost never shown completely and in doing so they are acceptable. I do wish the movie had more gore though. Being as almost all horror movies these days PG13 to cash in on teenage kids' money it does not show any gore besides some scratches and some ugly but very brief ceature shots.Final comment I wish the movie had revolved around the first cave expedition that is shown during the introduction titles. They seemed a hell of a lot more interesting than that group of supermodels who came in later. Real men real people driven by greed. Oh well.Decent action decent thrills. Not bad to kill some time with.".

In the present days the expedition leaded by Dr. Nicolai Marcel Iures and his assistant Dr. Kathryn Lena Headey are exploring the place and they find the access through an underwater river requesting the experienced cave divers team leaded by Jack Cole Hauser. Dr. Nicolai discovers that in accordance with the local legend the church was built to seal the cave as a display of God's protective power and that Templar Knights entered the cave to fight winged demons. When the group reaches a cave though a tunnel one mile below and three miles in a creature attacks one of the members and his breathing apparatus explodes collapsing the tunnel and trapping the group in the cave. Sooner they realize that they are the rescue team and they have to find an exit to survive from the attack of the monsters.The Cave is a predictable ripoff of Alien. If the viewer sees the trailer as I did he knows the whole story and will only bet how many if any of the characters will survive in the end. This movie entertains because of the locations and the good cast. I am a fan of Lena Headey and her beauty is a good reason to see this film. The conclusion is a hook for a sequel as usual. My vote is six.Title Brazil A Caverna The Cave".

I was under the impression that this movie was about finding some kind of demon on Earth buried deep in a cave. This was far from the movie I saw. The beginning of the movie began in a church which implied biblical anomalies. I actually go caving and was impressed by the visual effects used to recreate the cave areas. The stalagmites and stalactites were impressive. The storyline was in my opinion lackluster. I felt like I was watching one of those movies made for people with less than a 10 minute attention span. The creature effects were decent. The creature design was semiunique with a basis of a bat gone wrong.My vote for this movie was a 5 out of 10. Worth renting but don't buy it.".

	schema:headline " Gore Mongral Movie Review The Cave";
	schema:reviewBody "We start off in Romania 30 years ago where a group of men have decided to go hunting for a Cave that is rumored to have been the place of a fight between demons and templar knights. When they try to crack open the entrance they find out that they may have used too much dynamite and are buried in the cave along with tons of rubble. We then go to the present as scientists are investigating the same location and trying to see if the cave is there. Well they find it and bring in some cave divers to help investigate.From there accidents occur and they end up being stuck in the cave also. The Cave is one of those monster movies that pisses me off. We get some rather cool looking monsters that pick off our cast one at a time but we rarely see them. I understand to build tension for the first several kills it is good not to show what the creature looks like only quick shots or images shadows even but when you are reduced to showing the creatures for about 15 minutes of running time that just sucks. Another complaint is the PG13 rating. Right there you have neutered the film. This means there will be no bloody decapitations no limbs being ripped off or severed or any squishy stuff unless it is from the monsters made famous by the lame duck Aliens vs Predator. This seemed to really hamper several of the death scenes as they could have been more menacing.So the 2 things about monster movies that is cool 1 The Monster Design and 2 The Gore are kept to a minimum so what do we get lots of exploring underwater caves.....yeah. Is it all boring? No they do a good job of handling this and the characters for the most part are not annoying but its the fact that this is a monster movie and not a cave diving National Geographic special that really will get to you.In the end this movie does some things right some things wrong. In the end its is just there and when its just there its average so I give The Cave 510 average monster flick with an R rating and more of the beasties on screen which did look cool when seen this coulda a been a contenda but falls flat.In conclusion If you are going to see one Cave Monster movie see The Descent.The Cave is out now on DVD.".

It will reaffirm even the most jaded movie goer's faith in the power of cinema and film schools all around the country will become overloaded with impressionable youth now newly inspired! At least that's what would be said if Screen Gems offered ten burlap sacks stuffed full of Ben Franklin's to any willing corrupt movie reviewer.Unfortunately the actual movie of The Cave is easily one of the worst of 2005 if not the sole possessor of such a coveted spot. Every single clich that can exist in the monster horror genre is exploited to no end and despite the lack of ambition the screenplay still manages to make very little sense.That's not to say screenwriter's Michael Steinberg and Tegan West are the only ones worthy of blame. The acting is especially caught redhanded showcasing amazing skills ranging from deadpan delivery to dulled empty gazes. Whenever a character dies the real laughs begin and lead actor Cole Hauser appears to be bored out of his mind.It's not a surprise though. Hauser already did Pitch Black another scifi creature feature very similar to this one except in the quality of the end product. Piper Perabo cannot be forgotten either. Playing Charlie she is a special standout because of the authenticity she lends to her character. Why aren't real genius scientists ever so hot and scantily clad? Or dumb? The real star of the show though is director Bruce Hunt who lavishes poorly lit sets and incomprehensible editing on his unsuspecting audience. Previously a second unit director it is clear Mr. Hunt isn't quite ready for the big leagues yet. Instilling no mood or sense into his feature debut The Cave stutters along painfully in search for cohesion or even a good scare.Its okay Bruce the University of Toledo has a nice film program. Maybe you should check it out.Sadly the rest of the movie isn't even worth talking about. The effects are pathetic and seldom used the plot twists are well nonexistent. The characters act in completely unreasonable ways and there are lapses of logic that require a bit too much suspension of disbelief even for a movie about a cave full of supernatural beasts.Best of all the action scenes appear to have been shot by a man with severe epilepsy and the editor was most likely eaten alive by a shark before finishing. Farfetched? Maybe but it would explain why The Cave is edited and paced the way it is.To be fair though it must be kept in mind that a movie such as The Cave isn't meant to be an award winner or a life changer. However when all is said and done there is still a difference between entertaining and just plain bad.Talent and more importantly passion can make even the driest overdone ideas interesting again and even the average Bmovie can have a certain magic to it. Sometimes a night at the movies is just meant to transport and entertain and there's nothing wrong with finding huge mutated cave dwelling creatures entertaining.However in the end there is quite a bit wrong with The Cave. For a movie so devoid of any desire to stand out it still stumbles at even the most basic levels. From the broadest elements right down to the littlest details nearly ever conceptual choice is flawed and underdeveloped.Remember a good creature feature probably won't be great art but at least it won't be The Cave.Critic's Conclusion The tagline proudly proclaims There are places man was never meant to go. Clearly any darkened movie theatre playing The Cave on end is one of them.".

It did have some nice scenery and photography but other than that it has little else going for it. The acting was rather lame as if all them just phoned there roles in.

The cast is assembled from actors you have seen in many other movies but never remember. The one that captures my attention is Lena Headey the woman scientist for no other reason than I know I'll meet her again when I watch The Brothers Grimm next week. But the sequence that is really worth mentioning is the other woman's Piper Perabo battle against one of the creatures which reminds me unmistakably of the scene in Crouching Tiger with the two women run HORIZONTALLY alone a VERTICAL wall.

We have a prologue from thirty year ago that is the key to today's mystery. We have personality conflicts. We have team members picked off one by one. And finally the evil is not buried in destruction but lurks around now in the civilized world threatening to strike any time a musthave device for a sequel. And those are just the few things I remember.It's standard entertainment and if that's what you're looking for it's not bad. The cast is assembled from actors you have seen in many other movies but never remember. The one that captures my attention is Lena Headey the woman scientist for no other reason than I know I'll meet her again when I watch The Brothers Grimm next week. But the sequence that is really worth mentioning is the other woman's Piper Perabo battle against one of the creatures which reminds me unmistakably of the scene in Crouching Tiger with the two women run HORIZONTALLY alone a VERTICAL wall. The heroine here has a little help from the rockclimbing rope.";

	schema:reviewBody "Like many folks I got this movie because Lauren Graham was in it my Wife's a huge fan of Gilmore Girlsbut this movie is terrible and Lauren must have been out to lunch when she decided to do it. First the lead characters are all supposed to be twenty somethings getting ready to leave the nestbut everybody in it is 35 or older and looks idiotic trying to play 21. The lead guy Brad Hunt is a total loser and you wonder why any woman much less Lauren Graham would want the guy. His partner who advises him on women is an even bigger loser than he is and is at least 40! I kept waiting for this movie to be funny or interesting but it was neither. The only positive thing to say for this film was the music. The songs were more interesting than the characters. Lauren Graham is in the movie maybe 15 min tops so don't waste your time if your looking for a good film she might have done between seasons of GG.".

	schema:reviewBody "Zach and Abbey have been neighbors forever. Almost as long Zach has been in love with Abbey at least since she asked him to join her on the seesaw long ago. Now they are 27 and Abbey is about to fly away from the roost. A gifted artist she is heading for NYC. Zach runs an auto mechanic shop and still lives at home with his folks. However he is stunned by Abbey's potential desertion and makes up his mind to marry her. After setting up a date at a nice restaurant Zach gets the idea that he may have better luck with his proposal if he asks former girlfriends what his faults are. As he goes from lady to lady he learns more than he wants to at times. But will his acquired knowledge help him make time with Abbey? This is a fun movie for most of the duration. Zach's former girls including a dominatrix babysitter and a spinthebottle alliance provide mirth in big doses. The actors are attractive and humorous and the production values quite welcoming. However viewers may be let down toward the end of the film. In romantic comedies this is a very serious offense. Do take time to find the film if you are a romcom nut. It has some good ideas and fun times even when it is veering off course.".

I particularly enjoyed the soundtrack which had a very eclectic mix of new and old school tunes ranging from The Nails 88 Lines About 44 Women to Badly Drawn Boy's The Shinning. Many of the actors although some only appearing for one scene were great especially Debra Jo Rupp That 70's Show who plays the leads's Mother. She is the most talented of the group here and portrays the dysfunctional mom so matteroffact it's sad and funny. Check this little gem out.".

The story is interesting but it's so badly directed that it becomes a huge nightmare! Sooo annoying! There are so many useless close ups! And nothing happens! It's all out of order the timeline is all screwed and sometimes it just doesn't make any sense at all!! And in the middle of nothing they still think they can find some space to insert some family problems.. it's got nothing to do with nothing! Also the actors exept for Lauren are all to old to be believable! Argh!!".

It's about a guy who finds out his best friend Abbey is leaving town and the her figures she is the great love of his life so in order to get her he goes after all his old girlfriends to ask them what was his problem so that he can fix and be a better man to sweep Abbey off her feet. The story is interesting but it's so badly directed that it becomes a huge nightmare! Sooo annoying! There are so many useless close ups! And nothing happens! It's all out of order the timeline is all screwed and sometimes it just doesn't make any sense at all!! And in the middle of nothing they still think they can find some space to insert some family problems.. it's got nothing to do with nothing! Also the actors exept for Lauren are all to old to be believable! Argh!!";

Okay so the guy at the counter suggested this new release. Bravo it was really quite funny much better than most comedies I have seen lately in the theaters. I was surprised at how many of the actoractresses I recognized from Film and TV. The mother who's from That 70's Show is hilarious. The music is a trip back to the 80's with some memorable tunes. Also there is a great song which I am not sure if it's from the 80's or current?So if you are looking for a little fun movie to watch with the boyfriend check this one out.".

	schema:headline " Real baseball players play themselves in a slice of life film thats a breath of fresh air in style";
	schema:reviewBody "Atypical Hong Kong film about a group of die hard baseball players in Hong Kong a city where no one really plays baseball. Based upon the players own stories the players effectively play themselves with none of their names changed and the various stories based on their lives. Its life and love in the big city as the group train for international play.I picked this up because I was interested in how a baseball movie might be filmed in a place without baseball. What became clear almost from the start even though this is a baseball movie its not about baseball. Yes we see the guys training but until the final 20 minutes or so we see no games and even then the games have no one in the standsclearly these guys are playing for the love of the game. And how we see the games are not even remotely like how we see them in an American movie its bits of the game with intertitles about what happened. Its a bit strange at least to my western eyes. Mostly the film is the stories of the guys of the women they meet are confused by the love they find and lose.and how they give everything else for the game.In its way its unlike almost any Chinese film I've ever seen and almost any Western film either. The first thing you'll notice is that the film loves the guys in a very erotic way. These are good looking hard bodied guys and they are in various states of undress frequently. There is full frontal male nudity which is is rare in western cinema and something I've never seen in Chinese. cinema at all. While there is no need for it they could have shot it to hide things its not whole gratuitous in that where we see it is where we'd see it ie. in the locker room. Is the film specifically homoerotic I don't think so but if you're bothered by naked men filmed as almost gods I'd stay away.There are quotes on screen from various sources and occasional narration well not so much narration but observation from one or more of the characters. The use at times seems random and at other times comments on whats going on. I found the choices always intriguing if not always relevant to what was going on and was always looking forward to the next piece.The film uses music to great advantage. Clearly the songs being played are of some importance to the story because of how the songs are used. As each song ends the person singing is identified on screen with their birthday and death identified. I wish that the lyrics had been subtitled since its clear that the music is importance. It should be pointed out that even though I can't understand the music the melody does create a mood.The performances by a cast of non actors are surprisingly good. Actually there isn't a bad one in the bunch and if there is any flaw its more in how the characters are drawn rather then how they are performed.I'm kind of at a loss about what to say about the film or how to describe it. I do like the film. Its a good little film but much of my admiration for the film comes from it being so completely different then anything that I've run across in a good long while. Here is a film that was made by some filmmakers who wanted to make a movie and make it their way and they have done so with style and originality. Yes of course the stories of the guys on the team are similar to things you've seen before but at the same time how it all come together isn't it doesn't do what you expect and thats both refreshing and infuriating. I'm sorry I'm being obtuse about the film but this is a film that really needs to be seen. If you see it I have a feeling you'll know why I'm not being more specificits a film that should be discovered on its own and not explained actually the trailer that was included on the DVD made the film seem completely different then what it was. Watching it after the film I was like that wasn't what I just saw.Is this a great film? No. But it is a unique one one that really should be seen by people who love movies with different points of view. Honestly I don't know why this isn't on the festival circuit since this is the sort of independent film that everyone clamors for. Its not a story we've seen before or if it is its different enough in the telling that it makes it worth sitting down again. If nothing else pieces of the film still haunt me the images of the empty fields the player standing in the middle of the crowded street some of the heart break the nonchalance aboutwhy are you late because one player threw his phone away.Is it a great film? No but it is a good one. Its film that boldly has its own point of view and as messy as it is at times still demands to be seen by anyone who wants to see something that is the cinematic equivalent of the FarSide cartoon where one indistinguishable penguin from all the rest steps up and sings I gotta be me.If you love films that are not completely run of the mill see this movie.7.5 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "I brought this movie out of curiosity because I had done a play that was also centered around baseball Take me Out and because I wanted to see Scud's first movie I have heard his second movie Permanent Residence is really good...I was expecting a homoerotic gaythemed film. It was not. This movie is more about life than baseball... It explores sexuality but does not judge it... It is about overcoming adversity and not surrendering to life's obstacles... The structure of the movie and the plot makes this a very original movie too... I think it's worth watching.The movie's plot feels like a series of vignettes except that they are connected to each other. The main plot has a gay undertone but I would say that after watching the movie I am not convinced that I would categorize this as a gay movie.The famous full frontal scenes are beautifully shot and the first shower sequence is gorgeous. I would not call this gratuitous nudity it is just a shower scene that feels real. The nudity is also not erotic for the most part. Actually I felt that the scenes with partial or no nudity were much more erotic than the locker room and shower scenes.When the main plot reaches it's climax so those the main character's subplots. Here there is a very tender scene featuring two of the main characters that I actually watched twice. The movie ends in what first seems as an unsatisfying ending but upon meditating about it I feel that the movie simply asks us to fill in the blanks.Is this a gay movie? No but you will appreciate it's gay undertones and reflect upon one or more?? character's sexuality. Is this a homoerotic movie? No but you will see brief artistically done nude scenes.In the end the movie achieves what it set to do in the first place... If I was in Hong Kong I would probably start watching more baseball games... The movie humanizes their struggles makes them appealing and makes the baseball players very likable characters....The fragmentation of the plot is the weakest point of this movie. The cinematography is its greatest strength. What makes it worth watching at least as a gay men is the one really tender scene towards the end.Like another reviewer said this is a good movie not a great one. It is very different from anything you probably have seen before...".

It was marketed as a gay film and surely people who watched it with this particular expectation would be disappointed. It would also be disappointing for sports fan as the film features little of baseball.The main problem is that the plot is unfocused and fragmented. As City Without Baseball is a dramatised documentary of actual events the events presented seem unconnected without preludes or follow ups. For example the romance between the coach and the waitress does not get a mention after they have sex. A subplot that gets no follow up should not be in the film at all but I guess it got retained in the final film to counterbalance the homosexual theme.Another problem is that the plot does not have a real climax. There is no feel good element such as solidarity of the team members. However such plot problems are offset by the great production. I am impressed by the choice of sets cinematography and lighting. Not many Hong Kong films can reach an artistic level like this.Another thing that surprises me is why the actual baseball team appears in the film as themselves given the central plot is not about their struggle to the top or promoting their beloved sport. As almost all of them appear completely naked they are very brave to be in the film.".

And there's a good reason for it obviously good enough reason to get the likes of Sean Connery Trevor Howard Lila Kedrova and John RhysDavies to take part in this admittedly cheesy production. The fact that this was a Golan Globus production should have been a clue to any movie fan.The ancient Celtic bards had to memorize some 100 major stories and 200 minor ones to entertain the folks during those long cold winter nights. While Tristan and Parcival belong to the former Gawain and Owain belong to the latter. These are ribald entertainments for light late night story telling entertainment much like a James Bond or a cheesy BMovie. In fact I have heard one professor of Medieval Studies refer to Owain as the James Bond of the Arthurian cycles. And the middle part of this film that deals with Lyonese captures the whole Bond formula or I should say formula which Fleming followed of impossible predicament ala Dr. Evil's No. Intend to set up an elaborate death and walk away assuming it happened. narrow escape beautiful damsel daring do hand to hand combat against impossible odds complete with tongue in cheek repart.I loved the movie for what it was from the moment I saw Trevor Howard's aging Arthur acting line the mean spirited cranky old fart the Welsh triads depict not the boyish one of the Gawain poem  through Lina Kedrova's scary horny old widow queen RhysDavis's Fontenbras playing with toy soldiers and of course Connery's transcendental Green Knight. Sure I missed some of the original story elements of both stories  the fountain and the ogre with the giant club  and I hated that cheesy last scene with Linet that they added on the end of the perfect ending scene with the Green Knight. But this one captured the spirit of the older tales of the Mabinogion from which we get the oldest Owain and the Lady of the Fountain much better than the SaxonNorman poetic retelling of the Gawain story. Ribald cheesy fun with a few moral lessons thrown in for redeeming social value. In this film's retelling one gets a much better feel for the kind of story the bards might have told the assembled drunken retainers in the King's Hall on a late midwinter night.I give it a 7 for capturing the spirit of the tradition that Monty Python Holy Grail feel that one detractors here noted as though it were a bad thing  great acting by the legendary actors in smaller parts noted above and the James Bond pulp fiction feel. I'm detracting points for the music skipping the fountainstorm and the ogregiant and that dumb ending scene.PS contrary to one reviewer's accusation that it looked like a back lot in Pasadena these were real Welsch castles including Cardiff and the former Palace of the Pope in Avignion.".

	schema:reviewBody "The old English tale of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is brought to the screen with a charming blend of action  imagination thrills  adventure  and tongueincheek humor . The medieval legend of a supernatural chivalrous young squire who challenges the king's men to kill him . Being middlingly starred Myles O'Keefe as Gawain  Sean Connery as the Green Knight and appealing Cyrielle Claire as Lynette The Lady of Lyonesse. In Camelot on New Year's Day King Arthur's court is waiting for the feasting to start when the king asks first to see or hear of an exciting adventure. At this a gigantic figure entirely green in appearance and riding a green horse rides unexpectedly into the hall. He wears no armour but bears an axe in one hand and a holly bough in the other . He insists he has come for a friendly Christmas game someone is to strike him once with his axe on condition that the Green Knight Sean Connery may return the blow in a year and a day . There appears Gaiwan a wooden Miles O'Keefe  a rookie knight in the court of King Arthur Trevor Howard who is sent out on a quest brought on by a challenge issue by the magical Green Knight . Gaiwan must solve a riddle in one year or die .This flabby fairy tale adventure contains witchery  fantasy  cheesy special affects stagy acting  surreal imagery and grimly marches . The picture has good settings  as thick rolling fog  deep forest  dark castles and rocky seacoast  this movie delivers on locations  however  it results to be mediocre and a little bit boring . Connery can only be onscreen for a few scenes but he adds zest to his character  he steals the show as an ironic Green Knight . Ronald Lacey who played the character Oswald also played the same character also called Oswald in Gawain and the Green Knight which was made in 1973 and basically it was the same movie same actor same role .This lumbering film version of one of the Arthurian legends is badly done  as the motion picture was regularly directed by Stephen Weeks . Filmmaker Weeks was one of two young British directors to emerge in the terror field in the late sixties  the other  Michael Reeves died at 25 . He began his professional film career at age 17 directing a series of short films . He made his film cinema short film 'Moods of a Victorian Church' 1967 at age 19 and his first cinema drama a film set in the First World War in France '1917' . Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde was Stephen's second picture at age of 22 and he realized other horror films such as Madhouse mansion or Ghost story1979 and adventure movie such as Gawain and the Green Knight 1973 also with Peter Cushing  Ronald Lacey  Murray Head as Sir Gawain and Nigel Green and its remake titled Sword of the valiant 1983 and not much of an improvement . Rating  510 . Well worth watching but only for Sean Connery fans .Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is a late 14thcentury Middle English chivalric romance. It is one of the best known Arthurian stories and is of a type known as the beheading game. The Green Knight is interpreted by some as a representation of the Green Man of folklore and by others as an allusion to Christ. Written in stanzas of alliterative verse each of which ends in a rhyming bob and wheel it draws on Welsh Irish and English stories as well as the French chivalric tradition. It is an important poem in the romance genre which typically involves a hero who goes on a quest which tests his prowess and it remains popular to this day in modern English renderings from J. R. R. Tolkien Simon Armitage and others as well as through film and stage adaptations. It describes how Sir Gawain a knight of King Arthur's Round Table accepts a challenge from a mysterious Green Knight who challenges any knight to strike him with his axe if he will take a return blow in a year and a day. Gawain accepts and beheads him with his blow at which the Green Knight stands up picks up his head and reminds Gawain of the appointed time. In his struggles to keep his bargain Gawain demonstrates chivalry and loyalty until his honour is called into question by a test involving Lady Bertilak the lady of the Green Knight's castle.The poem survives in a single manuscript the Cotton Nero A.x. which also includes three religious narrative poems .".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes this film has weaknesses notably Miles O'Keefe in the lead.  It doesn't really hurt the film being a hero type role but it doesn't help either.  The film is a collection of episodes in a year of Gawain's life which cycles through four seasons in the pattern of the Green Knight's life. The sense of time is rather peculiar and it's unclear how Gawain rejoins his squire after visiting Leonesse yet somehow it all fits.  The film builds its vignettes around the game of the Green Knight's four part riddle. The film seems to have been botched in the editing room a bit as the script is excellent though with a great deal of joke cracking notably one about a corkscrew that gets repeated an extra time although it's the only one of the jokes that could be considered camp.The film is sumptuously photographed and the cast and the sets are wonderful to look at.  Weeks planned to incorporate footage from Gawain and the Green Knight but everything that the producers took out of that film they destroyed this time hampered again by producers who denied him final cut and forced him to cast O'Keefe after Tarzan the Ape Man proved a box office success despite being universally loathed.The music score is rousing but it was done on a computer and so the timbres seem jarring.  The humor and makeup effects are obviously jarring to some.  Also jarring is the bright yellow bars letterboxing the credits of the video version.  While the film suffers from being preserved only in pan and scan I couldn't wait for the letterboxing to end since it makes the opening sequence more difficult to watch with the yellow glaring at you.Don't let the bad reviews of this film dissuade you.  This is a thoughtful film buggered in the production process but much of its glory still shines through.  Know going in its a semicomedy and that some of the cast including the aforementioned O'Keefe and Cyrielle who is lovely but had to have all her lines dubbed being a French speaker and the likelihood you'll appreciate this film will go up.  Most of the film works so well that I focused on that rather than its weaknesses.  I  also picked up Weeks's Madhouse Mansion in the same closeout sale Video Update went into Chapter 11 and is selling off the inventory from most of their stores in the area. That film has been equally poorly received by IMDb users yet I have read in Video Watchdog that it is his best work.  After having seen this I hope to list it among the greatest film ever made.  This is certainly one of the most entertaining fantasies I've seen in a long time.  The other reviews I see here sound like reviews for Wizards of the Lost Kingdom except that they mention Connery's Green Knight which is certainly impressive.  Other than that it seems like we saw different films.An entertaining film with weaknesses is still an entertaining film if it makes you think and rouses your spirits.  Could have been better but unquestionably worth seeing.".

Other than that it seems like we saw different films.An entertaining film with weaknesses is still an entertaining film if it makes you think and rouses your spirits.  Could have been better but unquestionably worth seeing.";

The result is a strictly onedimensional swords and sandal shambles which fatally chooses to take itself seriously. Miles O'Keefe is as bland as one can be in the role of Gawain whilst the action sequences are staged totally without panache or energy. The sole highlight for me anyway among the mess was Sean Connery's lively portrayal of the Green Knight yet its not enough to rescue the movie. Overall the whole thing is a sorry excuse for a film production and considering its release in an era where actionadventure was being taken to new heights through Star Wars and Indiana Jones one has to wonder what the filmmakers ever saw in it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Golan and Globus are known for lowbudget trying hard spectaculars out to make money not win awards so I was bit leery when I went to see this movie. To my surprise it turned out to be good. Some of my favorite British actors were in it like Trevor Howard Peter Cushing and of course Sean Connery. Golan and Globus were right when they insisted on Miles O'Keefe over Mark Hamill who was the choice of director Stephen Weeks. With Hamil people would have unjustly compared this movie with Star Wars. And as it turned out Hamill was a oneshot wonder three shots actually with the Star Wars Trilogy. I remember him starring in a cheap scifi flick the advertising for which was a Star Wars ripoff while the plot was a Terminator ripoff. It bombed of course. Miles O'Keefe did very well exuding youthful daring with selfdeprecating humor.In any case Arthurian legend purists need not grouse about the fact that Sword of the Valiant mixes the stories of Sir Gawain the Green Knight story is his Sir Owein the Lady of Lyonesse and Sir Percival the encounter with a knight in red armor. It's like shooting three birds with one stone and should motivate people to read up on Mallory et al. Besides the movie is really a merry mix of adventure action comedy and romance. In Filipino we call this halohalo literally mixmix used to describe an iced dessert with sweet beans custard gelatin roasted young rice tapioca coconut strands banana jackfruit and what have you. Gawain's relationship with Linet is suitably romantic and knightly that is chaste. The mysterious character Linet is aptly portrayed by Cyrielle Claire whose beauty is of fairy tale quality.Despite the daunting looks of the Dowager Lady of Lyonesse she has a rollicking sense of humor. When Gawain slew the Black Knight in fair duel he became the Lord Protector of Lyonesse. But that was not his only inherited duty as the Lady of Lyonesse coyly pointed out. You should hear the way she said it.Sean Connery is suitably menacing. Trevor Howard as the almost senile King Arthur didn't have much time to act likewise Peter Cushing but their presence lent weight to the film.".

Not really much to say about this movie only that Sean Connery is the only reason I gave this movie a two because he is a favorite actor of mine.

Second the hero of the story is none other than Miles O'Keefe himself wearing a big dopey blonde wig that makes him look more girlie than tough. Then to top it all off we have Sean Connery in a role he'd probably rather forget as the Green Knight but he looks more like a Christmas decoration then an actual magical knight. Not only is he covered from head to toe in green glitter but he has pieces of holly stuck to his head! Throw all these into a blender and you have a really horrible unintentionally funny film.The story revolves around Sean Connery challenging all the knights at a particularly wimpfilled castle to use his own axe to chop off his head. The deal is they get one blow to chop Sean's head off but if they don't succeed he in turn gets to take a chop at their head. At first none of the knights are willing to accept his challenge but then when the King gets so frustrated at his weak kingdom and offers to accept Sean's deal himself the brave Miles O'Keefe jumps in and accepts the challenge instead! The King is so proud he makes the young Miles O'Keefe an instant knight! What happens next is ridiculous. O'Keefe takes his swing and chops Sean's head clean off...but then a really fake Sean head laying on the floor is then seen telling his body to come and pick up his head. The headless body walks over to the head picks it up and puts it back on his neck. Miles O'Keefe realizing that he's just been fooled by a magical knight into giving up his own life prepares to have his own head chopped off in return. However Sean Connery decides that he will grant the young O'Keefe one more year to live his life before he will chop off his head. He also gives O'Keefe a really boring riddle that if he solves in that year his life will be spared.The rest of the movie revolves around Miles O'Keefe in a fake crappy stiff armor outfit traveling around the countryside trying to solve the riddle fighting danger every step of the way. There are not only tons of cheesy battles but movie mistakes galore and plot holes aplenty. If you're a bad movie fan then definitely check this one out. You'll be happy you did.".

	schema:headline " Cheap market competitor to Excalibur";
	schema:reviewBody "What can you say about a film that tries to emulate another film for the sole purpose of capitalizing on its runoff?Not a whole lot.Sword of the Valiant feels like Excalibur's evil twin brother. Boorman used green gels on his lights in his Arthurian film to accentuate the green in the wilderness of the dark ages and to underscore another theme. Sword of the Valiant also lights its characters with green gels clipped over the lights but probably only because Boorman did it in his film because there's no real purpose for it here.  Boorman's Excalibur had fog effects Maximillian like armor for the knights pitched fights on a variety of terrains and bases its tale on the King Arthur legends.  Sword of the Valiant does this but with a cheapbudgeted feel.The acting for what it is is hit or miss depending on the actor andor scene.  There's little in the way of high drama here but the performances are certainly above Bmovie quality.  Yet even here it depends on the character.  A couple of the female supporting cast notably the antagonists are horribly directed as is the case with much of the film's performances. Miles O'Keffe does a pretty good job of portraying a young knight in search of adventure but his character never really does anything beyond going through the motions of the plot.  Sean Connery does a good job as usual though the glitter and mini antlers on his head were just too much.  I don't know who decided to go with that scheme but it's pretty silly. Fortunately we know it's Connery underneath all that and his performance helps to take away the two rediculous facets of his costume.  The stunning Cyrielle Claire gives a performance that is much like that of everyone else in this film good but somewhat flat due to lack of direction.  Everyone gets the job done in the end but no Oscars will be found here.And as has been mentioned the musical score is one of the worst ever married to a film.  It almost sounds like some public domain music I've heard pasted onto cheap 16mm documentaries.  It's that bad.But the worst thing about this movie is the cinematography.  It's cheap bland uninspired and just plain worthless.  A lot of zooms are used as are a lot of cheap edits from equally cheap angles.  I might blame the cinematographer but somehow I get the feel he was just doing this gig to get a paycheque.  There's no real heart to the look of the film and that's the real killer for this movie.  For if it had been better shot then some of the other negative qualities might've been mitigated.The art direction is probably the one real plus for this film.

	onyx:emotionText "What can you say about a film that tries to emulate another film for the sole purpose of capitalizing on its runoff?Not a whole lot.Sword of the Valiant feels like Excalibur's evil twin brother. Boorman used green gels on his lights in his Arthurian film to accentuate the green in the wilderness of the dark ages and to underscore another theme. Sword of the Valiant also lights its characters with green gels clipped over the lights but probably only because Boorman did it in his film because there's no real purpose for it here.  Boorman's Excalibur had fog effects Maximillian like armor for the knights pitched fights on a variety of terrains and bases its tale on the King Arthur legends.  Sword of the Valiant does this but with a cheapbudgeted feel.The acting for what it is is hit or miss depending on the actor andor scene.  There's little in the way of high drama here but the performances are certainly above Bmovie quality.  Yet even here it depends on the character.  A couple of the female supporting cast notably the antagonists are horribly directed as is the case with much of the film's performances. Miles O'Keffe does a pretty good job of portraying a young knight in search of adventure but his character never really does anything beyond going through the motions of the plot.  Sean Connery does a good job as usual though the glitter and mini antlers on his head were just too much.  I don't know who decided to go with that scheme but it's pretty silly. Fortunately we know it's Connery underneath all that and his performance helps to take away the two rediculous facets of his costume.  The stunning Cyrielle Claire gives a performance that is much like that of everyone else in this film good but somewhat flat due to lack of direction.  Everyone gets the job done in the end but no Oscars will be found here.And as has been mentioned the musical score is one of the worst ever married to a film.  It almost sounds like some public domain music I've heard pasted onto cheap 16mm documentaries.  It's that bad.But the worst thing about this movie is the cinematography.  It's cheap bland uninspired and just plain worthless.  A lot of zooms are used as are a lot of cheap edits from equally cheap angles.  I might blame the cinematographer but somehow I get the feel he was just doing this gig to get a paycheque.  There's no real heart to the look of the film and that's the real killer for this movie.  For if it had been better shot then some of the other negative qualities might've been mitigated.The art direction is probably the one real plus for this film.  Connery's antlers and glitter aside the costuming is fairly good and the locations though not very well shot are likeable and also fit the overall feel of the film.And for those of you laughing at Mile's O'Keefe's page boy haircut you should know that a pageboy was squire in training in a medieval court.

This is proof that the music industry is failing on the surface and is desperate to put any notalent jockey on the music scene.Look I'm not all for critics or casual onlookers but there was no need to green light this crap. The Jonas Brothers can prove to us that we can make it big by putting on a pretty face and getting your popularity based on your image. The sad truth is that they didn't have to work that hard to make it to the top so they steal elements based on other music artists and they try to regurgitate them into something new. They do so with flying colors that is with failure. Their music sounds so horrible I can make better sounds on my computer. That's really not saying much. Their poor guitar play horrible singing and a stale drummer add up to the realization that they possess no talent. Certainly nothing that would make a music critic go crazy about.A sign of decline in this day and age is there are people dumb enough to compare the Jonas Brothers to great bands and artists of the past. Don't even try to compare them with Elvis Presley the Beatles the Ramones ACDC Aerosmith or the other great music artists who helped make a difference in the music scene. They set the stage for what was to come and were music artists that were actually liked for their musical influence and talent. The Jonas Brothers on the other hand seem more fit to be a quick fad that will fade out by the year's end.The worst and perhaps the most shocking aspect of the movie is Disney's involvement with the Jonas Brothers. Just seeing the Disney logo slapped on the front is enough to make any classic Disney fan cry in terror. Who is running this show? Why should Disney be involved in any of this? What is the purpose of putting on a terrible concert show in theaters? This is simply a message that Disney does not care anymore. Back in the day Disney was something that every child and parent looked forward to. From Snow White to the Lion King Disney entertained audiences for generations and set the bar for creating animated masterpieces and original shows. Walt Disney was a highly respectable man and was simply ahead of his time. Jonas Brothers The 3D Concert Experience has none of the magic or innovation of the old Disney. It is simply a title of greed and misconception.The Jonas Brothers need to leave our general conscious. If any idiot would stump so low to actually waste a hard day's paycheck to see this flying piece of crap then that person should seek a mental hospital. The Jonas Brothers The 3D Concert Experience is nothing redeeming nothing new nothing special and nothing exciting. I'm very upset that Disney was involved in any of it and the fact that idiots out there don't realize how bad this is makes me very frustrated. People out there need to seek talent that is higher than the average person. All this is is a publicity stunt that can show us that any moron can go crazy over a band that was stale from the beginning.This is why much of mainstream entertainment is failing to put out something of influence. Instead they are promoting crap like Jonas Brothers The 3D Concert Experience in order to have the mindcontrolled sheep buy more fluff. The people behind the box office should be ashamed of this title. Don't believe the hype just ignore the title and hope that the Jonas Brothers won't come back for a sequel. Critics should know what passes for a movie and this doesn't qualify.A title that holds nothing to the Disney name.One out of Ten.".

And couldn't be any less suited were they also blind in one eye and thus unable to get anything out of the 3D experience. Not to belabor the point but in the Jonas Brothers management boardroom there's a flip chart sporting this reviewer's photo and the word 'No' underlined three times in thick black marker pen. This will probably more than satisfy the audience it's aimed at. But for the rest of us a tour called 'Burning Up' suggests only one thing. We are in Hell.".

And couldn't be any less suited were they also blind in one eye and thus unable to get anything out of the 3D experience. Not to belabor the point but in the Jonas Brothers management boardroom there's a flip chart sporting this reviewer's photo and the word 'No' underlined three times in thick black marker pen. This will probably more than satisfy the audience it's aimed at. But for the rest of us a tour called 'Burning Up' suggests only one thing. We are in Hell.";

	schema:reviewBody "I have no problem with concert movies. I love music and try to embrace all genres I love film and I admire anybody who comes out and gives it a go. However Jonas BrothersThe 3D Concert Experience is a dud in my view I actually saw this out of curiosity being somewhat indifferent to them and seeing this film has done very little to change that.A major problem is the music. I like poprock didn't used to but it's growing on me but the poprock tunes are completely forgettable as are a vast majority of the renditions. The melodies are rather unmemorable and the lyrics are on the whole uninspired. Even worse are the 3D effects. Like the Jonas Brothers I am actually indifferent to 3D there have been times when it's worked but I have seen too many films where it doesn't. The 3D here does not work. It is very lazy and unimaginativewater bouncing off a drum kit is the most imaginative it gets and distracts rather than enhances.Then there is the voice over comparison to the Beatles and David Cassidy. The voice over was unnecessary and irrelevant and Cassidy also doesn't really add anything to the proceedings. The cinematography is odd sometimes and shoddy while the lighting gets too much. I also hated the audience I know it's for the atmosphere but seriously this audience is annoying and sometimes the screaming gets so loud in places the lyrics singing and melodies are indecipherable.The singing and performances don't do much to improve either. The Jonas Brothers actually sound bored not only with their music but with themselves too and each other. Demi Levato's rendition of This is Me also has little effect Levato is talented and she sings it nicely but the song itself is rather forgettable and slows the film down in my opinion. In fact Taylor Swift actually outshines them all and she does do a decent job actually.All in all very poor and not really worth the watch or wait. 110 Bethany Cox".

	onyx:emotionText "I have no problem with concert movies. I love music and try to embrace all genres I love film and I admire anybody who comes out and gives it a go. However Jonas BrothersThe 3D Concert Experience is a dud in my view I actually saw this out of curiosity being somewhat indifferent to them and seeing this film has done very little to change that.A major problem is the music. I like poprock didn't used to but it's growing on me but the poprock tunes are completely forgettable as are a vast majority of the renditions. The melodies are rather unmemorable and the lyrics are on the whole uninspired. Even worse are the 3D effects. Like the Jonas Brothers I am actually indifferent to 3D there have been times when it's worked but I have seen too many films where it doesn't. The 3D here does not work. It is very lazy and unimaginativewater bouncing off a drum kit is the most imaginative it gets and distracts rather than enhances.Then there is the voice over comparison to the Beatles and David Cassidy. The voice over was unnecessary and irrelevant and Cassidy also doesn't really add anything to the proceedings. The cinematography is odd sometimes and shoddy while the lighting gets too much. I also hated the audience I know it's for the atmosphere but seriously this audience is annoying and sometimes the screaming gets so loud in places the lyrics singing and melodies are indecipherable.The singing and performances don't do much to improve either. The Jonas Brothers actually sound bored not only with their music but with themselves too and each other. Demi Levato's rendition of This is Me also has little effect Levato is talented and she sings it nicely but the song itself is rather forgettable and slows the film down in my opinion. In fact Taylor Swift actually outshines them all and she does do a decent job actually.All in all very poor and not really worth the watch or wait. 110 Bethany Cox";

Even they didn't seem as enthused as when they first entered the theatre. They've seen some 3D shows before and the drive back was well  quiet.The biggest concern a niece beside me was that a pair of adults stood and variably sat behind us. As they let three kids run around they recorded the Jonas 3D movie on their cameras. After letting an attendant know we saw them talked to and then they stayed to the end to finish taking their photos and whatnot.There really isn't any need for Spoiler Alerts. Seriously. It's that bad. If you were to think about all your definitions of a bad movie theatre experience it'd be an alternate description of this movie.These are not spoilers to say the shots were heavily edited to the point of blandness. The scenarios were boring it did not resemble anything interesting at all. It was a montage of uninspired ROTE that went nowhere. Besides there are so many internet reviews that people have read already there is nothing left to say. As for the promotion of the movie being a chance for the poor kid fans to see more of the band nah. It's not worth the charge above what you pay for your internet connection to the same thing.Disney did quite possibly the worst investment of monies in current 3D technology that is available to date. The 3D shots weren't that great. They were sparse in my opinion and repetitive as far as having no imagination in this product. There was no premise. Anything this movie claimed to be is not true. The Directing was terrible and the Editing was all that Times Infinity.Greed. Greedy greedy greedy. The Disney money train is being redirected to the next big thing they contract some teens to do. Next year's ten year olds may now join the lineup.".

The music in the movie is most definitely live and the songs are actually quite catchy. No one is claiming the musical and lyrical brilliance of the music by the Brothers Jonas it is pure catchy power pop and taken as such it is really good. It is also interesting that one reviewer who criticized the music of the Jonas Brothers claimed that during the opening sequence where the brothers were being chased a Beatles song played in the background. This was not however a Beatles song but rather one crafted by the three brothers themselves.

This film set in imperial China is all over the place almost out of breath at times but always fun. It was a big hit the best grossing film in ChinaHong Kong in 1992 due mostly to the chemistry between Chow and Mui. Of course Sung unretires and things get a little more hyperkinetic.

	schema:reviewBody "I am a fan of Stephen Chow as plenty of Asians are. However I think it's important that even as a fan we remain honest especially with ourselves. Stephen Chow have starred plenty of good comedic movies but Justice My Foot isn't one of them. Understandably Justice My Foot is a farce in the same vein as Spaceballs Airplane! and Naked Gun. While these kinds of comedy have their niche market it doesn't take away their transparently obvious stupidity. Parody doesn't mean you act stupid to make people laugh parodies make you laugh because sometimes people are stupid and knowing this distinction is crucial. In the scene we see the crowd laughing at Chow for being bullied by thigs and then rescued by his kung fu wife but it's not funny. Why? Because we know that the couples like these don't exist and if they do the wife would beat up the husband anyway after rescuing him and she certainly wouldn't treat him like a damsel. You can only subvert people's expectations as long as it's still within reason and believability or otherwise it won't make any sense. It's not funny to have a judge openly farts every time he has a scene in the movie. Why? Because a normal reaction would be disgust without putting up with such behavior. In fact it would be funnier if people reacted enraged of the constant farting that would be a normal reaction. Anita Mui in my opinion has never been a good actress not in same class as Maggie Cheung or Michelle Yeoh. Anita Mui is a singer in Cantonese Pop and people are simply attracted to her while blindly disregarding her obviously nontalent for acting. Other than that the story is boring the dialogue is cringy the production is poor the acting is selfdeprecating and humorless. There much better Stephen Chow movies than this.".

The role feels much like a dry run for her turn in DRUNKEN MASTER II.Chow is one of those actors I find a bit hit and miss. I loved him in his big hits like SHAOLIN SOCCER and KUNG FU HUSTLE but in this film his overacting leaves me cold. The plot's okay and very fastpaced but the humour is quite infantile in places and more often than not the writer resorts to silly fart jokes which I never find particularly funny just tiresome.

Filmed in the late 1970s with classic bell bottoms old cars big hairdos and hip music this movie is a tastefully done comedy with witty humor slapstick fun and wild misadventures. From ShihChieh's magic shows to ChihWen's daring escape from a henchman while in drag you'll get pure fun and excitement while following the captivating plot of ChihWen trying to steal the contract while avoiding his ruthless manager. The opening scene starts with a beautiful song sung by Sam Hui although an extra is performing and lipsyncing the song which quickly grabs your attention. This is followed by a pretty fastmoving plot and unforgettable characters. Overall it's a mustsee HK comedy.Grade A".

This more or less describes the silliness of the film and unlike other Huipenned comedies The Contract relies too much on slapstick and not enough on clever lines. Hui also relies on gadgetry  while this plays tiny parts in other films it's written in here more.For once Ricky Hui doesn't play the sympathetic loser but a technical inventor and genius with aspirations to become the next Thomas Edison Sam is the usual mid1970s stud who's also an aspiring magician Michael begins the film as an unbelievably poor dancer and extra at a television studio.There are some high points Michael and Ricky attempt to get the contract back from the studio's safe but in all many scenes are milked way beyond what the script allowed through Hui's own direction.

Michael stars as a lazy orderly whilst Samuel costars as a medical assistant. One day a big burly man with crude mannerism Roy Chiao is admitted into the hospital. He's always clutching a small white canvas bag to his chest. Inside it are pieces of rubbish but a couple of fragments of fine China dating back to the Ming Dynasty are amongst the trash. This peaks the interest of Michael who's always swiping gold crowns caps and bridges from dead patients. So one day he convinces Sam to help him find out where Roy got the vase fragments. Who knows they could find a fortune. Will Sam and Michael make it big from antiques? Check out The Last Message!The second film from the highly successful Hui Brothers. Ricky has a small part as a roller skating waiter Dean Shek cameos as a hotel desk clerk and James Tien has a bit part as a traffic cop. The movie is highly entertaining and loads of fun. If you liked the first film then you'll get more than a few chucks from this one. Highly recommended!".

This peaks the interest of Michael who's always swiping gold crowns caps and bridges from dead patients. So one day he convinces Sam to help him find out where Roy got the vase fragments. Who knows they could find a fortune. Will Sam and Michael make it big from antiques? Check out The Last Message!The second film from the highly successful Hui Brothers. Ricky has a small part as a roller skating waiter Dean Shek cameos as a hotel desk clerk and James Tien has a bit part as a traffic cop. The movie is highly entertaining and loads of fun. If you liked the first film then you'll get more than a few chucks from this one. Highly recommended!";

Interesting plot combined with comedy set in modern Hong Kong that didn't involve love romance was a fresh new approach for Hong Kong cinema of its day. If we look at the proliferation of this type of movies in the '80s in Hong Kong it's clear that Hui brothers were way ahead of the game.Sam Hui also wrote the music for this movie.

I hadn't really begun to appreciate foreign film yet so I had no idea what to expect. What I saw was an angel beyond description giving one of the greatest acting performances I had EVER seen still to this day. This film is heartwrenching in it's beauty and romantic tragedy. In fact it makes art of it. I went back to the theater to watch it six times I even dragged friends along. Yes the film was brilliant but what I went back to see was perhaps the most beautiful woman I've ever seen on the big screen. Isabelle Adjani's beauty in this film is breathtaking and her performance is one of the most intense and deeply moving in history. I have this film on VHS and DVD. I still love to watch it.".

	schema:reviewBody "An exhibit of Rodin's sculptures was circling the Western United States a few years back.  In any gallery in which they were exhibited they snapped heads there are few figures that speak with such authority or superiority mute testimony like the Easter Island figures to as much effort and skill.  And so the movie Camille Claudel' in like fashion snaps heads in its understated power and commitment to craft.   Like Ansel Adams Rodin stretched nature beyond what was possible  they both showed us something that was not there and in the rendering made representations so striking they had no precedent and thus set the bar higher for subsequent generations of artists.  As history played out the far less well known sculptor Camille Claudel made substantial contributions but her tie to Rodin and eventually her personal decline for a period in the late nineteenth century is the focus in this instance.  In truth her story demanded to be filmed she stands a remarkable artist and most importantly the passion talent and influence inarguably on Rodin she possessed went well beyond the colorful' label oft attached to the gifted. Historically this film is probably not a bad representation of how events turned in her life.  There are many issues and turns and years for that matter the details of which remain unclear to this day.  But in its entirety this is a marvelous interpretation of the record.  And without doubt Isabelle Adjani was the right actor for the job. Stunningly beautiful there are few women in history as arresting as Isabelle is certainly Camille was not as lovely but the resemblance is darned good as compared to actors chosen to portray historical figures in most movies based on true events and the people that were part of them. That Adjani brings some of the passion is certain.  After all bizarre or at least socially unacceptable behavior resulted in her eventual incarceration so we know she was a handful.Many of the key points of her upbringing are addressed her father's stern and inconsistent yet lovingly supportive position in her life this is more forcefully impressed on us as the years progress her mother's complete nonsupport and dismissal of all that Camille does her relationship with her less understanding and conflicted brother.  But it is the period when she meets and falls for Rodin and he with her and their consequent tumultuous affair runs its course that is actually the focus of the film.Grard Depardieu's contribution as Rodin is probably the best work he has done.  He looks Rodin was 40 when he met the 21 year old Camille very much as Rodin did in this period of his life.  His love for his work Camille and promoting his own career are his passions.  We are lead through the minefield of his own making his inability to get off a dime and marry Camille is their eventual downfall and we are not totally sympathetic to his behavior.  But this is the stuff of real life as Seneca said all art is but imitation of nature and both his and her own work convey their conflicted convictions.          The musical score haunts us as it should right from the opening of the film.  Almost never detracting it instead correctly underscores certain points in the narrative but it is the opening where we see Camille scooping clay from beneath a Parisian street and this is a wellcrafted sequence where we feel the upsurge of powerful currents operating.  The music heightens our interest as we determine exactly what we are seeing.Other nice touches in the film include an occasion where Camille and Rodin together study a model on a turntable spinning the model about as metaphor for the emotional maelstrom gathering momentum.  We also see a great moment when Rodin is caressing Camille's face intercut with shots of him working clay into an as yet unidentifiable sculpture.What follows the breakup of Camille and Rodin is essentially a retrospective of the downslide of a remarkable talent.  The story of Claudel's own diminishing output of work and the steady erosion of her inability to cope with reality is frightening in its telling.  At a meeting with Rodin some time after they have parted company she remarks that she has changed and offers that Nothing that's monstrous is foreign to me'.  And so she truly and sadly withdraws into a world of her own making.Rating Four Stars.".

This is crucial for two reasons it displays that the actors here are working as an ensemble and that the steeling and always thoughtfully underplayed tension between father and son cuttingly explain Laurent Grevill's portrait of Paul Claudel as a believer's thrust undercut by a profoundly melancholic repression and the guilt of the witness who spills into being an onlooker. This is perhaps the grimmest intuition the film offers us in terms of the artist's relation to his place in society.All this is brought to sublime heights when Alain Cuny recites some verses of Paul Claudel not one of the film's tensions is left out and yet the instance breaks out of its context.

	schema:reviewBody "You might want to ask yourself what is wrong with a particular society. There are several ways to approach that question one of which is observing scars society together with culture inflicts on you and other people. One major difficulty with that approach is distinguishing between ones' emotional problems and real cultural problems. That difficulty is what we are faced with when watching Camille Claudel.A brilliant young sculptress starts going mad after going through a tragic romantic experience. We see so many talent and potential wasted at such an early age in such a sad way. Immediately we question is there always a simple and reliable explanation for such a tragic failure. Her behavior inflicts her family and almost everybody around her. She becomes obsessed with sculpting what has now become her religion. She's tormented by hypocrisy of French bourgeois. We see many factors being taken into account in retelling her story  something we see very rarely in American cinematography.Back to the question. She undoubtedly is going mad but the reason behind it stays mystery for us. Not only for us but her family as well. Camille doesn't even realize how mistaken she is and she is eventually hospitalized for the rest of her life. That's the genius behind this biographical drama nobody knows what is happening inside Camille's heart. Her genius and fragility cannot be analyzed she's taken them into her grave. Nevertheless we may conjecture about it and at best learn a thing or two.It's obvious that playing this role is delicate. Isabelle Adjani is absolutely gorgeous here one of the most beautiful female characters ever  that is until she goes demented. She was able to appear as an undivided personality in a sense that her happiness and failures are not disconnected from each other but form an unanimous whole. Only Ellen Burstyn's role in Requiem for a Dream is this impressive although she takes much less screen time. Other members of the cast have been very successful in communicating complex emotions too.I've always held that atmosphere and spirit is what makes a movie memorable and convincing. Seeing this drama was for me more than a movie experience  it gave me a deeper insight about French esprit libre. I strongly recommend this movie to all of you who are looking for a movie not made for pure fun but for reflection.".

She was able to appear as an undivided personality in a sense that her happiness and failures are not disconnected from each other but form an unanimous whole. Only Ellen Burstyn's role in Requiem for a Dream is this impressive although she takes much less screen time. Other members of the cast have been very successful in communicating complex emotions too.I've always held that atmosphere and spirit is what makes a movie memorable and convincing. Seeing this drama was for me more than a movie experience  it gave me a deeper insight about French esprit libre. I strongly recommend this movie to all of you who are looking for a movie not made for pure fun but for reflection.";

Too much style ... not enough substance. Make no mistake folks ... this is a very lavish read expensive production. Perhaps that is the problem. Too much time and money spent on production design and cinematography and not enough time on script development. This is supposed to be a character driven piece yet somehow the 'story' just gets lost in all that grandeur. It's only during the last 3rd of the film do we we actually get to see any sort of 'performance' from Isabelle Adjani. For the rest both her and Depardieu are minnows lost at sea in a maze of bloated film sets awash with moody lighting.Yes .. the cinematography IS breathtaking so kudos to Pierre Lhomme. I beg to differ with other reviewers about the musical score tho. It's one of the worst i have endured in recent times. More often than not it seems to be totally out of place and out of context to the scene we are witnessing ... almost as if it had been scored without actually seeing the film.I cant help but feel how this story would have been handled by a director with some understanding of the nature of art but more importantly ... the ARTIST. Those having seen Jacques Rivette's 'La Belle Noiseuse' will understand. And for those interested in Depardieu driven historical pieces seek out the hard to find Le Colonel Chabert. He's performance in that film is exquisite.This is an overly melodramatic film and a sad waste of money. They could have made 3 films for what this one must have cost. Not recommended.".

While it is obvious from the movie that Rodin was a slug and mistreated her because he was a narcissistic beyond sleeping with her and casting her aside there was no plot by him to ruin her career. But unfortunately Camille created an involved delusion that this was soblaming her failures on him and not the fact that she was erratic and acted crazy living in filth having the entire first floor of her home flooded and doing nothing about it etc.. I liked how Adjani handled this but I was especially impressed by the makeup people who made her look very haggard and oldshe looked the part.This is NOT a feel good movie by any stretch of the imagination. However it is wellmade and compelling and well worth seeing and a good study of mental illness.NOTE TO PARENTSthe film has quite a bit of nudity. While it is NOT gratuitous at all after all sculpting often requires nude models this film would probably be best seen by adults.".

	schema:reviewBody "The year is 2017 Camille Claudel is back in town and she seems to go through a revival and reevaluation of her work and short artistic career. A museum dedicated to her life and art opened in March in the small French town of NogentsurSeine and the museum includes many of the works that survived the agitated 20th century and the destruction by the artist's own hands. Books are being written about her and art history starts to take her seriously into account. Before this however there were the films and especially this one Camille Claudel from 1988. It is not exaggerated to say I believe that the film prepared her comeback to the world of arts.Camille Claudel deals more with the character of Camille Claudel her love story with Auguste Rodin her relationship with her brother Paul one of the important French poets of the first half of the 20th century than with her art. Actually one of the few critical observations one may have about the visual part of the film is that there is so little art in it and from the film we cannot make to ourselves an idea about how good she was. We see an artist fighting with her material we see a woman fighting prejudice in a world and at a time when women were far from being recognized as equal professionally to men even less in arts. We see the young woman and artist falling under the fascination of her master and being torn between love and admiration for him and the need to express herself to be herself. We see her falling down the spiral of vanity and then madness and it's up to us to judge whether the roots of her fall are in the social environment in the attitude of her lover who may be a great artist but is also a womanizer and small human being in terms of relations or in her own vanity and narcissism. Add to this the ambiguity of the relationship to her brother and we can now understand the willingly or not the focus of the script and director Bruno Nuytten was on her personal path rather than on her art.For Bruno Nuytten this was the first film as director but he already had in 1988 a long career as cinematographer including a few superb films by Claude Berri. Not everything works or better said not everything stood the almost 30 years since the film was made. Isabelle Adjani is superb beautiful and ambitious a fighter but fragile at the same time turn between love and vanity. This is one of her best roles. Grard Depardieu is very fit to Rodin's role at that time his physical qualities were also perfect and added to his huge talent. The cinematography of the film signed by Pierre Lhomme  is excellent and there are many scenes to remember  in the studio where Rodin and Claudel are shown fighting with the material from which they extracted their works and out in the nature with clear allusions to the period of the Impressionists when this film is set. On the other hand the soundtrack is horrible. The use of violin music which would have been exaggerated even for a melodrama made in 1938 it's simply a disaster for this film about art and artists made in 1988. Add to this the poor quality of the sound at least in the copy screened by ARTE TV which makes half of the dialog incomprehensible even when it is not covered by violins. Maybe digital sound reworking will sometimes in the future save this film. It is highly deserved.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the world premiere of Bernie last night at the Los Angeles Film Festival. I must confess after Jack Black's run of Year One Gulliver's Travels and Kung Fu Panda I was starting to lose hope of ever seeing the School of Rock guy I fell in love with. When I heard Richard Linklater School of Rock and Jack Black were teaming up again I felt a glimmer of hope. I am happy to report I was not disappointed last night! Jack Black gives one of the best performances of his career in Bernie. Shirley MacLaine was the icing on the cake and Matthew McConaughey was the cherry on top. I loved this movie! Bernie is based on the true story of Bernie Tiede an assistant funeral director and general dogooder who confessed to killing Marjorie Nugent a very rich and mean old lady. Bernie was a bit eccentric but beloved by his entire community of Carthage Texas. Jack Black nails this performance. He really shows us what he is capable of as an actor. It was such a pleasure to watch him transform into Bernie Tiede. Great moments of physical comedy and also some twisted dark moments of catching a glimpse into Bernie's spiraling psyche. Shirley MacLaine was Marjorie Nugent who was known as a mean bitter lady with no friends and a family who tried to sue her for her money. You can't go wrong with Shirley MacLaine  she's just brilliant. The chemistry between MacLaine and Black was fantastic. I truly enjoyed watching them on the screen together. Even at the world premiere last night they had great chemistry in person. It seems like they truly loved working together on this film. Matthew McConaughey was great as the D.A. Danny Buck Davidson the character didn't seem to be a huge stretch for him but who cares  he was great! I'm not sure when it is due to be released but I will be recommending it to my friends when it hits theatres.".

	schema:headline " Morbidly Seriocomic TrueCrime Story Gives Black an Ideal Role for His Quirky Persona";
	schema:reviewBody "Casting Jack Black in the title role of this 2012 dark comedy turns out to be a masterstroke on the part of director and coscreenwriter Richard Linklater because the reallife character of Bernie Tiede is a comically ambiguous figure not only sexually but more to the point as a jovial childman personality beloved by his small Texas town of Carthage while at the same time strangely insistent in his constant presence in their lives. His pointed need for universal acceptance and unconditional love is what makes Bernie unique as a screen creation. It takes Black's oddly discomfiting screen persona to make the character work as a protagonist of closeted complexity and in turn he delivers his most accomplished screen work to date. No stranger to Texassize guffaws intermingled with wry observations about human nature the versatile Linklater Before SunriseSunset tells this hardtobelieve truecrime story with both morbid humor and surprising conviction.Based on a seriocomic 1998 Texas Monthly article by coscreenwriter Skip Hollandsworth the plot revolves around the unlikely relationship between Bernie a relentlessly thoughtful assistant funeral director and Marjorie Nugent recently widowed and one of the richest women in Carthage. As Bernie becomes indispensable to the fabric of the community with his acts of charitable kindness his Broadwaystyle choir solos and his gentlemanly way of comforting widows in the throes of their grief the everscowling Marjorie is always ready for battle with not only the townsfolk who impede on her life but even her immediate family who can't stand her. Bernie however is able to breakthrough her icy veneer with his cheery persistence and their relationship evolves into an unhealthy codependence to put it mildly. As Marjorie lavishes Bernie with expensive gifts and luxurious vacations she grows increasingly manipulative in her need to control his every move to meet her every need.Even Bernie has his limits about what he is willing to do under her iron fist and needless to say consequences ensue. For all the dire consequences Linklater keeps the mood buoyant with the insertion of intertitles to signal what question the movie will address next and with the brief interviews he includes with both actors and true residents of Carthage all showing their unqualified support of Bernie through his burgeoning troubles. Much like Warren Beatty did in Reds Linklater uses them as a cumulative Greek chorus who on one hand provide some of the film's biggest laughs and on the other illustrate just how myopic and oppressive a small town can be in its rumor mongering ways so much so that Bernie's trial has to be moved fifty miles away in order to allow the light of objectivity to filter into the proceedings. As Bernie Black finally has a multidimensional role that fits him perfectly and I would be hard pressed to identify anyone else who could have played the character to the seriocomic depths he achieves here.Well into her seventh decade of movie stardom Shirley MacLaine is not particularly challenged in portraying Marjorie's sourpuss nature since she's been playing variations on the same role since her turn as the ornery Ouisa in Steel Magnolias. However in one key scene she lets loose all her insecurities that exposes the impenetrable cage in which she has put the increasingly desperate Bernie. Linklater favorite Matthew McConnaughey Dazed and Confused plays the showboating district attorney Danny Buck with gusto although I wish he was reined in a bit more to provide more of a contrast to the other two principal actors. The movie is a fascinating meld of the Coen Brothers' Fargo and Hal Ashby's Harold and Maude with an unexpected dose of Christopher Guest's mockumentaries. While Linklater does not completely avoid making Carthage the object of ridicule he has made a black comedy with surprising resonance when all is said and done especially when you see the real Tiede in an archival video clip at the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bernie 2011Don't you hate it when you see a funny movie and think at the end wow that could have been so much funnier? This movie really is funny and Jack Black is kind of brilliant at being this man who has incredible generosity and a quirky kind of social skill to be everyone's favorite. And who ends up taking care of the richest woman in town getting his name on her will and so on as you can guess.To get the gags and to give a sense of documentary reality clips of interviews with colorful townsfolk of all types are shown and they are some of the funniest moments. When these same people are shown again and again there is a sense of welcome familiarityan update on things from a known facebut also a sameness to the movie. It falls into a pattern. And it's a major part of the movie with thirty of these talking heads so naturally the momentum of the main plot is slowed down often. As the events become more extreme the movie does not. It plods along relying on some great idiosyncratic acting and the weird and exaggerated? East Texas culture.But Black inhabits his character so well it's scary. The other big name the biggest name is Shirley MacLaine who doesn't actually have that much to do most of the time she is silent just ominous or dour. And she of course doesn't make it through the whole film the trailer and teaser give away too much on that score. The third name is Matthew McConaughey and he's predictably fun and funny though he blends in with lots of other unknown characters who are also fun and funny.So it's the scenario and some funny writing that carries the day. Well done stuff. Director and writer Richard Linklater is a curious talent a little all over the map but good at several things including just being offbeat enough to seem like the Indie director he once was. His pair of movies Before Sunrise and Before Sunset are growing into unlikely classics I like them both a lot and yet he is also known for lesser comedies like Dazed and Confused and now this one. Yeah see this for some good laughs. The beginning will seem a little like a lame Six Feet Under episode but stick with it. Black's character is utterly convincing and funny. A good time.".

	schema:reviewBody "One could technically label Bernie a docudrama as it is definitely more than meets the eye in terms of bringing facts to the table. The film is intercut with segments featuring the townspeople of Carthage Texas discussing their relationship with the real Bernie Tiede and how his cheery eccentricities rubbed off on the town. Some of them are clearly actors one of them being Matthew McConaughey's mother but many are authentic folk off the street. Linklater very early on breeds variety into a film with so many unique and cute subtleties that after a while you contemplate what you may have missed. EnthusiasticallyTiede is an assistant funeral director in Carthage and can't be more proud of what he does. He's the man who fixes up the dead to make them look sometimes better than they did alive. Bernie is notorious for connecting deeply with his customers who have come to him after the death of a loved one and even manages to stay in contact with many of them long after the funeral dropping by and even bringing them flowers occasionally. He's a genial kind soul and effortlessly brightens everyone's day. Almost like that guy on the street at the office on the bus or in the neighborhood you don't know personally don't know their history or quite possibly even know their name but you make the humane nuance to wave or say hello to them frequently. Tiede is an ode to that person in your life.Bernie becomes friends with Marjorie Nugent MacLaine a wealthy old widow who is meanspirited and after occupying a certain disdain for him gives into his cheeriness and they begin hanging out with each other. It isn't long before Bernie grows weary of Mrs. Nugent's browbeating comments and shoots her four times in the back. Devastated at what he has done out of pure anger he manages to conceal the body for months before the district attorney Danny Buck played extremely well by McConaughey whose character somewhat resembles Woody Harrelson's coldblooded cop from Rampart a cowboyhatted tall and thin man always dapper becomes suspicious of Bernie. He believes his nice appearance is just a puton for the heartless deviant he really is.The character of Bernie is played by Jack Black in a role that is beyond any description I can helpfully provide. His character needs to be seen. Black takes a character whose story and personality is likely unknown to many people in 2012 and invents this kind charismatic person in the blink of an eye. Bernie is perhaps the nicest movie character I have been greeted with this year and even after he kills an old woman it's hard to even have harsh feelings for the sap. What he did was wrong but it has become apparent that when a film features a coldblooded killer we are robbed of backstory and reason as to why he is doing this or how he got here. We learn so much about Bernie and his life before the inevitable murder that we almost can't hate the man despite his unforgivable actions.Richard Linklater who previously worked with Black in the impressive School of Rock directs this black comedy with a serene bite providing it with a rich script and three lovable performances by three fine actors. Its deep south cinematography reminds me of the kind used in the drama Seven Days in Utopia only more expressively used and healthier for the tone of the picture not to mention the involving narrative carried throughout the excursion truly compliments the quiet rural nature of its setting. Bernie is one of the most enthusiastically quirky pictures of the year.Starring Jack Black Shirley MacLaine and Matthew McConaughey. Directed by Richard Linklater.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bernie is a nice surprise by Richard Linklater and Jack Black  the same team that brought you 2003's comedy hit The School of Rock now they have reunited for a different type of comedy  a dark one.Black acts differently in this movie  more restraint more focused and at times more intense than in any other film he's done before. His humor here is lowkey and not physical a feat done with his absorbing performance. Here is a guy who is loved by everyone  who must be loved by everyone and who can never say no. It is both an interesting and challenging role for him but he pulls it off in a great way  perhaps paving the way to more challenging and dramatic roles in the future. Compared to other comedy film actors who tried more serious turns he's not yet as terrific as say Jim Carrey in The Truman Show or Adam Sandler in PunchDrunk Love  but he's on the right track.Shirley MacLaine is also very different here  she has a sweet somewhat cheeky personality in many of her previous films of late but for this movie there's a cold demeaning aura around her and her steely eyes sell it. Matthew McConaughey as the ruthless district attorney has certainly improved in his acting range  just check out the courtroom scenes.I really appreciate the smalltown setting of the film. The film is told by ''interviews'' with the friendly smalltown folk giving a quirky and homely feel to the film while at the same time Linklater smoothly meshes narrative flashbacks into it  which brings me to the editing. The film moves at a strong clip and never feels rushed nor draggy. The aboveaverage screenplay has balances just the right amount of screen time to establish the story and characters notably Bernie. Just when you think the film is about to end  there's always another interesting thing happening that keeps the audience glued.Black and Linklater make a good promising actordirector team. Perhaps Linklater will be the key to unlock Black's potential in acting. Of course this is still a ''little'' movie  a low budget and scarcely any promotion at all... so hopefully word of mouth spreads just how very good this dark comedy is.P.S. I was not aware that the film is based on a true story. That made the film even more dark and quirky than it was supposed to be.Overall rating 77".

If you live or have lived in a small town anywhere in America you'll 'get' this movie and you won't be able to stop laughing. If you're in Texas or you hate Texas it'll be just that much better. The characters are real the acting is superb. Jack is at the top of his game and Mathew did an outstanding job. He played his role right on the edge always close to going over the top but never getting there. Shirley is a gem and acted like I've never seen her before. Thank you Richard for your film and your efforts in Bastrop. My farm survived but too many friends lost everything. Oh and thanks for letting me be in this film. Woohoo that's me at the end Ma!!".

And soon my wife joined me and she too stayed up WAY later than she planned. Why? Because this film is fascinating from start to finish and is truly unique. It's the true story of Bernie Tiede and his BIZARRE and eventually fatal relationship with Marjorie Nugenta woman hated by just about everyoneand eventually by Bernie as well. Now here's the rubdespite Bernie having killed Marjorie no one in the town seemed to really think this was a bad thing. After all the folk thought that she WAS a horrible person and if Bernie did do it it couldn't have been THAT bad! After all they reasoned he's such a wonderful and nice guy.Had this been all there was to the story it really wouldn't have been that entertaining though it would have been pretty bizarre. However the filmmaker Richard Linklater constructed the film in such a wonderful way that the film cannot help but hook you. In a WEIRD move he has many of the actual townsfolk interviewed and inserted throughout the film. A few were actually actorsmost were just folks who loved Bernie and couldn't stand Marjorie and wanted to talk about it! And so the film consists of these interviews as well as actors playing out the storymaking it a documentary...of sorts. It also helped Linklater and the movie that the actors particularly Jack Black did a wonderful job. And is helped that the writers one of which was Linklater himself did such a dandy job. In particular I loved how the film got the sound of the Southern Bible Belt folks. I am VERY familiar with this region and the conversations they had made me laugh because they sounded so truesuch as the women in the Bible study who were debating if Jesus turned the water into REAL ALCOHOLIC wine! I also adored the guy who described the various regions at the beginning of the filmpriceless and VERY funnyespecially when he was describing Austin! So how truthful is the film? Well according to an article that my wife and I read by one of Marjorie's relatives VERY true and very realistic. I was surprised that they didn't complain about how horrible she and the other family members seemed in the film! And they too thought Bernie was a nice guy despite his having murdered Marjorie! By the way if you get a chance you can read through Bernie Tiede's web blogall the way from his prison cell! Surprisingly it seems according to the web pages that he has a LOT of support for his releaseincluding from Black and Linklater. Weird.Overall a brilliantly made and highly original film. I have no idea if the film will be nominated for any awards but it should. Linklater and Black deserve some recognition for this movie.".

	schema:headline " There is an indispensable subtext regarding the enclosing nature of religious communities that belies the film's quirkiness and peculiarity";
	schema:reviewBody "This is based on the true story of Bernie Tiede Jack Black who is the nicest man in the town of Carthage Texas. He is an assistant funeral director attending to widows and speaking and singing at funerals too. The townsfolk of Carthage lavish praise on Bernie for his unconditional kindness. Yet for all of his goodness there is equally as much innuendo surrounding Bernie's private life. Some people question whether he is gay but others believe that he is romantically involved with Marjorie Nugent Shirley MacLaine a cranky widow who is disliked immeasurably by the entire town. She takes full advantage of Bernie's generosity gradually enslaving him with his own generosity. The town is shocked when Bernie discouraged by Marjorie's lack of empathy shoots the woman in the back repeatedly and is imprisoned. The town remains in full support of Bernie but district attorney Danny Buck Matthew McConaughey who doesn't care how nice Bernie is and is determined to have him sentenced for murder. Following School of Rock 2006 Richard Linklater's second film starring Jack Black is a black comedy wellacted unusual and uproariously funny. There's no irreverence here in turning a true murder into a comedic tale either because there's great intent and purpose to how the humour is used. Linklater who wrote the screenplay with Skip Hollandsworth uses the comedic element to bridge the distance between the audience and what is a closed remote community. Real East Texan citizens are used as extras in the film which means that the film could not be accused of forgetting their humanity even when they throw their judgement down on the rest of Texas which they believe to be divided into discrete parts. More tattoos than teeth is how one man describes the jury that Bernie faces in another part of the state. Through the use of comedy the film amounts to is a story about segregation and the way that people use their personal bonds like religion to protect the members of their own private community. Engaging with mockumentary features including interviews with the Texans the film is fascinating in its own impartiality and moral ambiguity. Marjorie is characterised as a truly horrible person played with unrelenting coldness by MacLaine and seems overtly willing to torment Bernie using even the slightest mannerisms to antagonise him. But the film never glosses over the fact that he did shoot her repeatedly in the back with a rifle left her body in a freezer for months and spent her money on the town. The reaction of the community in defending Bernie is a more significant subject for the film than taking either side of the law. One of the most darkly funny moments is when a woman states He only shot her four times not five. The ironic tone of the dialogue reveals the arguably elitist nature of the community and it is their acceptance of Bernie and not Marjorie which in their eyes elevates him above any wrongdoings. One of the other fascinating moral questions of the film stems from the monetary aspect of the crime. Bernie did spend Marjorie's money after her death not for himself but to help to develop the town. He gave money to people so that they could buy children's play equipment and also develop a Sunday school at the Methodist church. This asks us whether destruction can ever be a form of creation and arguably the town's support for this notion appeals to their interpretation and response to the Bible itself. The film's moral ambiguity and interest is further balanced by Jack Black's amusing and surprising performance. It did take a while for me to warm to him because he's flamboyant as I have never seen him like that before and I wasn't sure at times whether I was meant to be laughing especially when he is singing. Progressively though Black shows depth in ways that I would describe as delicate and subtle words not often associated with the big man. The strength of his increasingly watchable performance coincides with the transformation of his character. In selective closeup shots Black reveals his gradual intolerance for Marjorie as she takes total advantage of him followed by the disillusionment with his own reckless actions. His lack of self understanding and disbelief in himself characterises him tragically but we still remember that he is responsible and holds little explanation. At the other end of spectrum is Matthew McConaughey who is very funny as a toothpick chewing district attorney. When asked to comment on Bernie he says He's angel alright! An angel of death! That line brought some big laughs at the screening. Watching him dismantle Bernie during the trial proves as tense as any scene from a summer blockbuster. As a moderately scaled film this is as dramatic or as emotionally involving as the narrative becomes. But unlike a lot of contemporary comedies there is an indispensable subtext regarding the enclosing nature of religious communities that belies the film's quirkiness and peculiarity.".

Engaging with mockumentary features including interviews with the Texans the film is fascinating in its own impartiality and moral ambiguity. Marjorie is characterised as a truly horrible person played with unrelenting coldness by MacLaine and seems overtly willing to torment Bernie using even the slightest mannerisms to antagonise him. But the film never glosses over the fact that he did shoot her repeatedly in the back with a rifle left her body in a freezer for months and spent her money on the town. The reaction of the community in defending Bernie is a more significant subject for the film than taking either side of the law. One of the most darkly funny moments is when a woman states He only shot her four times not five. The ironic tone of the dialogue reveals the arguably elitist nature of the community and it is their acceptance of Bernie and not Marjorie which in their eyes elevates him above any wrongdoings. One of the other fascinating moral questions of the film stems from the monetary aspect of the crime. Bernie did spend Marjorie's money after her death not for himself but to help to develop the town. He gave money to people so that they could buy children's play equipment and also develop a Sunday school at the Methodist church. This asks us whether destruction can ever be a form of creation and arguably the town's support for this notion appeals to their interpretation and response to the Bible itself. The film's moral ambiguity and interest is further balanced by Jack Black's amusing and surprising performance. It did take a while for me to warm to him because he's flamboyant as I have never seen him like that before and I wasn't sure at times whether I was meant to be laughing especially when he is singing. Progressively though Black shows depth in ways that I would describe as delicate and subtle words not often associated with the big man. The strength of his increasingly watchable performance coincides with the transformation of his character. In selective closeup shots Black reveals his gradual intolerance for Marjorie as she takes total advantage of him followed by the disillusionment with his own reckless actions. His lack of self understanding and disbelief in himself characterises him tragically but we still remember that he is responsible and holds little explanation. At the other end of spectrum is Matthew McConaughey who is very funny as a toothpick chewing district attorney. When asked to comment on Bernie he says He's angel alright! An angel of death! That line brought some big laughs at the screening. Watching him dismantle Bernie during the trial proves as tense as any scene from a summer blockbuster. As a moderately scaled film this is as dramatic or as emotionally involving as the narrative becomes. But unlike a lot of contemporary comedies there is an indispensable subtext regarding the enclosing nature of religious communities that belies the film's quirkiness and peculiarity.";

Linklater plays it more or less straight essentially saying Here's your man here's what others think of him what do you think? And indeed what are we to think? There are some headscratching questions by the end. Here's a nonspoiler one Why was Bernie even in that town? Did he choose it randomly? Did he premeditate the events that unfolded?

There's nary any effort to depict how Bernie and Majorie bonded. Comic opportunities with their road trips are wasted. In short BERNIE should have been seen as a great opportunity to entertain us with good writing acting and movie making.

The townspeople are shocked after hearing about Bernie being arrested.Jack Black gives his best performance in years. He was magnificent as Bernie and although he gave up a creepy vibe at times he truly flourished as Bernie. He did a good job in turning into a man who doesn't seem to realize the grave consequences of his actions. Shirley MacLaine does a great job as the elderly Marjorie and did I ever hate her character! Matthew McConaughey does a good job as the prosecutor who is coming under fire for convicting Bernie.Overall Bernie is a wacky crime film but it's entertaining. It's also funny but not in the riotous kind of way. More of an amusing chuckle kind of way.....which is a great thing. I liked the style of the film and how it was filmed mockumentarystyle. The real townspeople being interviewed was a good heads up on Linklater's part. Another reason why he is such a magnificent filmmaker. A very good unique film. I rate this film 910.".

	schema:headline " Highly entertaining tale of townspeople losing moral compass after seduction by charming assistant funeral director";
	schema:reviewBody "'Bernie' is based on a true story about Bernie Tiede an assistant funeral director who comes to the small town of Carthage Texas and endears himself to its residents. Ironically there's a scene later in the film where Bernie becomes involved in a local community production of 'The Music Man' playing the beloved con man Harold Hill. Bernie essentially becomes a modern day con man and just as the residents of the fictional town of River City fell for the sweet charms of the smoothtalking Hill and later forgave him for his transgressions the same happened with Bernie Tiede in Carthage. But while Hill was guilty of larceny and impersonation Bernie ended up guilty of much more!'Bernie' is shot in the style of a pseudodocumentary with some of the actual townspeople in Carthage periodically recounting both their impressions of their former neighbor as well as the events that led to his downfall. The odd thing is that they never had a bad word to say about him. Quite the contrary the community seems to have regarded Bernie as the nicest guy that ever came to their small town.Bernie's strategy for endearing himself with the community is to go the extra mile in his position as assistant funeral director. Even after the funerals are over he'll go over to the widow's homes and bring them flowers. He also ingratiates himself with the men of Cartharge by helping them with tax advice. Before you know it just about everybody in Cartharge knows who Bernie is and loves him to the hilt.Bernie has a penchant for spending a great deal of money on credit and develops a habit of giving out presents to various townspeople. His ship comes in when he meets Marjorie Nugent an extremely wealthy widow who is hated by just about everyone in town due to a bad case of unrelenting meanness.

	onyx:emotionText "'Bernie' is based on a true story about Bernie Tiede an assistant funeral director who comes to the small town of Carthage Texas and endears himself to its residents. Ironically there's a scene later in the film where Bernie becomes involved in a local community production of 'The Music Man' playing the beloved con man Harold Hill. Bernie essentially becomes a modern day con man and just as the residents of the fictional town of River City fell for the sweet charms of the smoothtalking Hill and later forgave him for his transgressions the same happened with Bernie Tiede in Carthage. But while Hill was guilty of larceny and impersonation Bernie ended up guilty of much more!'Bernie' is shot in the style of a pseudodocumentary with some of the actual townspeople in Carthage periodically recounting both their impressions of their former neighbor as well as the events that led to his downfall. The odd thing is that they never had a bad word to say about him. Quite the contrary the community seems to have regarded Bernie as the nicest guy that ever came to their small town.Bernie's strategy for endearing himself with the community is to go the extra mile in his position as assistant funeral director. Even after the funerals are over he'll go over to the widow's homes and bring them flowers. He also ingratiates himself with the men of Cartharge by helping them with tax advice. Before you know it just about everybody in Cartharge knows who Bernie is and loves him to the hilt.Bernie has a penchant for spending a great deal of money on credit and develops a habit of giving out presents to various townspeople. His ship comes in when he meets Marjorie Nugent an extremely wealthy widow who is hated by just about everyone in town due to a bad case of unrelenting meanness. Nugent makes Bernie her personal assistant and eventually drives him crazy with her need for constant attention. SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. She berates him and nags him to the point where he impulsively shoots her in the back four times with one of her own rifles. Bernie stuffs the body in a freezer and pretends she's still alive.

The fact that this is based on a true story actually helps make this even better to think someone like Bernie really existed just helps draw you into his complex and quirky world. Jack Black is simply amazing in this role that's a statement I never thought I'd make but in truth he is suburb and possibly Oscar mention worthy.

	schema:reviewBody "There are movies that come along that fall in the comedy category but are based on series material so take a big risk at trying to make it work. Richard Linklater and Jack Black have reteamed up for Bernie bringing along Matthew McConaughey and Shirley MacLaine with them. This film is based on true events that are based on an unfunny concept but is striving to deliver just that. Is it possible to have this cast and director together and not deliver a good movie or is there a reason it didn't get a wider release? Bernie follows the story of a beloved funeral director who befriended a widow known for being just the opposite with a sour attitude on life. After slowly taking over her affairs she becomes fully dependent on him increasing her demands to almost unbelievable proportions. After the towns people do not see her for months her body is discovered and none other than Bernie is charged with the murder. This movie is crafted in a genius way that tells this unique dark funny tale as well as makes it feel almost like a documentary. Throughout the film there are testimonials with various townspeople that are really entertaining and become the center piece to making this film work. Jack Black brings the strange yet likable aspect to this weird little man to brilliant life with one of his best performances to date. Working side by side with Shirley MacLaine he held his own like a champ with both of them having some strange chemistry that just worked really well. McConaughey brought another lovable quirkiness to his character that worked so well. This is an interesting film that is really funny and so over the top that it sucks you in that this really happened.Bernie is one of those unique movies that just work on every level. It seemingly does what they are trying to do both funny and dark without ever getting too deep into either aspect. Full of great characters brilliant dialogue and a story like no other Bernie is a must see film for not only fans of the actors involved but for everyone.httpwww.examiner.commovieindallasbobbyblakey".

	schema:reviewBody "Jack Black comes roaring back with a tour de force and it's not coincidental it occurs with Richard Linklater. This movie is almost so perfect for Jack Black it as if it is a vehicle for him but and here's the really compelling part it is based on the true story of Bernie Tiedum. Fact many times is superior to fiction and this is a raging case in point.Small town Missouri Carthage to be exact widow has more money than the town itself but is harrowingly mean. Enter one man an anomaly if you will an assistant funeral director with an ambiguous sexual orientation and a lot of humanity. That's Bernie Tiedum. He probably wouldn't fit in any world but he fits like hand in glove in the small town of Carthage. He is beyond reproach in his day job of handling funerals of the locals with sincere attention to detail. His other activities center on making Carthage a richer town such as his creating a playhouse where the locals can enjoy culture otherwise only available in the metropolitan cities. He's active in not just the lives of senior citizens but the families of the town. He's an odd duck to be sure but he is genuinely wellliked and seen as a upright man full of civic pride. In his desire to be these things he happens to befriend a widow who most folks shun due to her decidedly dour demeanor. It is probably fair to say that due her wealth as well as his disposition a working relationship evolves whereby Bernie echews his other jobs to a degree and becomes her paid manservant and confidant. Stranger things have happened but not perhaps in Carthage.This is the jumping off point of the movie Bernie. Bernie is like the title character himself and oddduck of a movie. It's done in docudrama style and I must say the format is done justice. The pairing of Linklater and Black makes for a sum possibly bigger than the parts. While most have never heard of this strange saga in the movie it is treated as if viewer is is privy to one of the eras great mysterious happenings. First I credit Jack Black. Black is at his best in the role of Bernie. He truly brings onscreen life to a character that is rich and colorful...and very human if odd. Linklater's deft touch in the script and direction is perfect for Black's performance as it takes what could be a very dark story and breathes tremendous light and balance to exactly the way the town felt about the whole affair. If it were up to this reviewer Black has a Academy Award nomination for best actor in the bag with Linklater being perhaps also nominated for direction. The whole story could have fell apart as dreck but much the opposite occurs as it is interesting endearing and entertaining.Truth is that justice was served in the final chapter. Matthew McConaughey's district attorney is the only part that seems to be pandering...But I imagine the real life person this was based on couldn't help but use this as his own personal springboard so even in this performance there is still good merit McConaughey's role as supporting star works versus his usual miss starring roles. See this film. It's an Americana slice of rural life presented in a unique way which informs but ultimately is great entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Scarrier than many horror films I've ever seen the real life tragedies and dramas viewed in Children of Darkness are a depressive tourdeforce into the corridors of psychiatric institutions dedicated to young patients children and teenagers who early in life are put up against the most difficult of problems the loss of their minds with mental disorders schizophrenia autism and other emotional issues. And as if wasn't enough to deal with prejudice from society living far from their families  who most of the time can't raise them properly or sometimes those kids are left behind in those places  they have to face poor treatments on the hands of disastrous and unprofessional doctors. The movie enters three different institutions the first one is an almost adequate facility overcrowded with patients and with a small staff that can't help those kids properly. There isn't a psychiatrist there to listen to their problems there's a bunch of workers who manage in doing the best they can while dealing with paranoid schizophrenics and their constant attacks on themselves and other people. Here we follow some of the kids and their truly hopeless stories. Of the group this institution is the least problematic. Now the second place seems a little misplaced from the movie but it's not and the director proves his point. It's a place called ELAN a sort of shock treatment for fortunate rebellious teenagers who are sent there by their parents before they cause more trouble or end up in jail or dead. The kids there are shoplifters drug users violent individuals and there's some suffering with depression or other emotional problems  and those last ones shouldn't be there at all. What ELAN does is more harmful unethical and insane than real mental institutions. Their treatment consists of veteran guests harassing and yelling at the newcomers until they expose their wrongdoings severe punishments to those who attempt to escape such as beatings not shown in the movie but mentioned put those fugitives to stay on a dumpster for hours under surveillance of a veteran and if this one allows them to escape he's punished as well. The place is an awful business that exploits desperate rich parents who don't know how to deal with their sons. ELAN's director appears fully confident that his institution is excellent and helps kids and a simple jump into the future to see that it's not the case one of the residents featured here was Amy Sedaris' sister who years later committed suicide. For the record ELAN has closed down a few years ago after many controversies involving their treatments.And we close with the third facility a mental hospital in New York whose staff under the name of a prominent and still active doctor were accused of murdering several kids. The movie follows three cases all similar in the way that procedures weren't followed the staff ignored the patients and they died suffocated in their straightjackets. Too bad the movie only mentioned future investigations on those and other cases and I couldn't find much of what happened if someone got blamed for the murders  all I know is Dr. Jonathan Katz is still practicing.Children of Darkness remains in the dark almost unseen and little known yet it shines a powerful light on an overlooked issue. It's cute and good to see when Girl Interrupted or AHS presents those themes but reality doesn't get near the horror the suffering and the desolation of every single kid presented here young and full of life but already with shattered minds and with no cure in sight to many of their problems neglected by almost everyone around there. Extremely hard to watch the beginning mostly but it's important that you do. We need to be aware of those people their difficulties and learn about places who offer their best care and treatment to the ones we know and love in this situation. 1010".

	onyx:emotionText "Scarrier than many horror films I've ever seen the real life tragedies and dramas viewed in Children of Darkness are a depressive tourdeforce into the corridors of psychiatric institutions dedicated to young patients children and teenagers who early in life are put up against the most difficult of problems the loss of their minds with mental disorders schizophrenia autism and other emotional issues. And as if wasn't enough to deal with prejudice from society living far from their families  who most of the time can't raise them properly or sometimes those kids are left behind in those places  they have to face poor treatments on the hands of disastrous and unprofessional doctors. The movie enters three different institutions the first one is an almost adequate facility overcrowded with patients and with a small staff that can't help those kids properly. There isn't a psychiatrist there to listen to their problems there's a bunch of workers who manage in doing the best they can while dealing with paranoid schizophrenics and their constant attacks on themselves and other people. Here we follow some of the kids and their truly hopeless stories. Of the group this institution is the least problematic. Now the second place seems a little misplaced from the movie but it's not and the director proves his point. It's a place called ELAN a sort of shock treatment for fortunate rebellious teenagers who are sent there by their parents before they cause more trouble or end up in jail or dead. The kids there are shoplifters drug users violent individuals and there's some suffering with depression or other emotional problems  and those last ones shouldn't be there at all.

	schema:reviewBody "This was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature losing to He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin'. There will be spoilers aheadThis documentary focuses on mental illness and behavioral disorders in children and four different and specific institutions. The documentary shows four institutions which handle different types of problems and have differing approaches to their patients.The documentary starts with the least disturbing situations and facility Eastern State School and Hospital in Pennsylvania. The children there deal with mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression among others. The only treatment seems to be medication and the staff seems to be called upon to be custodial carers as opposed to trying to find ways to bring about an improvement in their illness. Just keep the kids from hurting themselves and others give them some small comfort but not much else. Three of the children are interviewedprofiledDenise Jerry and Brian. Jerry's story hurts me personally the most as he has muscular dystrophy and undisclosed emotional problems and was abandoned by his parents at the facility. Brian's mother wants nothing to do with him but his father is regularly around takes him home every week and obviously loves his son. Denise is the saddest case as she's given to cutting herself and has thoughts of suicide. That this segment about Eastern State is actually the most hopeful one of the four is depressing.The next facility Elan School which specialized in treating children with drug alcohol and behavioral problems whose parents can afford the tab is more like a prisonreform school than a treatment facility. The methods used to treat their clients raise eyebrows to say the least. As an aside the facility was closed some years ago for various reasons.The third facility Sagamore Children's Center is a New York state longterm care facility for autistic children. It isn't a treatment facility so much as it is a warehouse even though there are attempts to teach the children there. A counselor there is interviewed and he tries to sound hopeful and as optimistic as he can but when you first see a child at 12 and seven years later at 19 there's little to no discernible progress there isn't much which can be done.The fourth and final institution is South Beach and it makes the other three look positively wonderful by comparison. The focus is on three of four patients who died under unexplained or questionable circumstances. Frankly this last one disturbed and disgusted me so much that I can't really say any more here or I'll cry scream and throw things remembering what I saw.There's an epilogue detailing what happened to Denise Jerry and Brian after filming presumably up to the date of completion of the documentary. Given that they'd all be in their 40s or possibly even 50 now I can't say if they're even still alive at this point though I'd be curious to find out if they even remotely had halfway decent lives though in at least one case the chance of that is almost nonexistent.I saw this on Youtube and it's well worth watching. Most recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "RinTinTin and Tom Mix were two of the biggest boxoffice draws of the twenties while working for major studios. Both faded with age and the coming of sound. Both ended their careers with comeback performances in Mascot serials and both serials are very good.THE LIGHTNING WARRIOR is as creaky as they come with no musical score and one of those hissing early thirties soundtracks. It is nevertheless entertaining. A mystery villain known as the Wolfman is inciting an Indian uprising to drive the settlers out of the valley. It is up to the heroic Rinty and his human allies to bring this fiend to justice.This is the first time I have seen the original RinTinTin and he and his stuntdog doubles do not disappoint with wild leaps and chases vicious fights and narrow escapes. Rinty also thinks his way out of several jams. One forgets while watching the show that no dog could be quite this smart. The human cast also does well. Young Frankie Darro was a talented child actor. A slim George Brent is far more winning here as an action hero than he would later be as a lounge lizard. Former Chaplin costar Georgia Hale is animated and appealing though she has little to do. Ugly Bob Kortman as an evil henchman and old codger Lafe McKee as a crusty rancher stand out in the supporting cast.Yakima Canutt's name appears in the credits so it is not surprising that the action is well handled and the stunt work often striking. The serial also gets a lift from a strong air of mystery. The Wolfman is dressed in full phantom regalia with a slouched hat and cape pulled over his face. He communicates with his underlings via weird howls while tomtoms beat ominously on the soundtrack and lurking henchman silently pick off their victims with arrows.It is all nonsense and all fun. The mystery of who is the Wolfman is sustained well with plenty of red herrings. Several twists in the last chapter are satisfying and clear up a lot of apparent inconsistencies.All in all if you are a fan of vintage serials this is one to seek out.".

	schema:headline " Rinty Yakima Canutt and Frankie Darro";
	schema:reviewBody "This was RinTinTin's last film and i believe that he was about 13 years old at the time. He is not an expressive dog actor like Higgins Benji or Skippy Asta in The Thin Man and yet there is something rather grand about him even in old age with a grizzled grey muzzle that no one bothered to dye the way they would have had he been a human actor. In one of the early scenes a cowboy bystander calls him Old Timer with no attempt to hide his age and indeed there is a kind of elegiac quality to his work like the latter day James Garner whom he much resembles in a spiritual sense. Rinty is a superlative schutzhund trained attack dog and many of his best scenes feature him jumping and wrestling humans to the ground or running after horses at the gallop. At least one and maybe two younger darkerpelted stunt doubles are used for some of the long running scenes but Rinty takes all the closeups. He always did suffer from trainer eye looking for cues from his offcamera trainer but not being foodmotivated he never blew a scene by nuzzling for his hidden treat the way Skippy did. I actually teared up a little at seeing the old guy put through the rigour of being trapped in a mine shaft when the door gets blown off by dynamite. The human actors were expecting the loud pyrotechnics but Rinty was not and he was obviously on a hard stay so when the blast went off he jumped and turned in place torn between fear and the stay command. He looked terrified and i think he was actually tied down with an offcamera leash to restrain him from bolting. Sweetly his essential good nature and willingness to please asserts itself at the conclusion of every fight scene when after apparently halfkilling his human sparring partner he is called off by Frankie Darro or George Brent then breaks character to stand around with a big smile on his face wagwagwagging his tail Was i good? Did i do that right? Am i a good dog? What a trooper! Yakima Canutt is the unspoken 2nd star of this feature of course. He plays a minor character but also supplies the remuda and doubles for almost every actor in the film who does a horse transfer bucking bronc stunt or  Yak's specialty  the stagecoach stunt. This film presents a variation on the latter with an open buckboard and six horses instead of the usual four. Strangely the rear pair are white the only time i've seen Yak use white horses in this stunt the front four are his usual browns. In addition to the stage coach team the horse i call Yak's Big White the stunt double for Gene Autry's Champion a cute fat brown pony for Frankie Darro to use in a flying mount a half dozen randomly great cow ponies and a trained bucking bronc there are four or five fine Indian Paint ponies including the one with a white neck and brown head. If you watch Yak's stunts you'll know which horse i mean  he was in many dozens of movies and Yak always made sure he turned his right side to the camera his good side  very beautifully marked during Indian attack scenes.Frankie Darro was a fine kid actor. Like other reviewers i also love his young adult films costarring with Mantan Moreland  but here we see him in top gymnastic form carrying a reasonable amount of his own weight in stunt work. His greatest drawback at this age is a certain staginess in closeups but since the film is a Western we don't see much of that mush. I really dug the scene of Frankie making a getaway on a chubby brown pony  the scene is played straight and Frankie is in top form but i laughed to see the pony scramble to keep up with the larger horses.Georgia Hale the romantic interest deserves a quick mention too  her splitskirt culotte riding garb with matching vest and silk bandanna is extremely cute. Both she and Theordore Lorch who plays her father carry the baggage of silent film mannerisms but she is an appealing and spunky actress and looks more than right in the part of the Sheriff's adopted daughter.The Alpha Video print has better sound than other versions but there are a number of annoyingly chopped up bits including some mangled chapter endings dropped words and overlydark scenes  which as far as a i know are found in every version currently on the market. Still i'm glad i saw this film and i recommend it without reservation to anyone who likes animal actors and stunt work.".

RinTinTin in his last film is in a lot of cool action sequences and stunts including a ridiculous 50 foot vertical leap and gives a good performance. A ridiculous resolution hurts this one a little.

RinTinTin in his last film is in a lot of cool action sequences and stunts including a ridiculous 50 foot vertical leap and gives a good performance. A ridiculous resolution hurts this one a little. Rating based on serials 6.";

	schema:headline " An OK serial with great Rin Tin Tin action";
	schema:reviewBody "As serials go this is pretty typical of what you would see in theaters back in the 1930's  a story presented as weekly serials roughly 15 minutes in length. The action all revolves around a mysterious cloaked figure that has convinced the Indians to attack the settlers in the valley if they don't vacate their settlement by the new moon. At stake are a number of rich mines that the settlers have been working. The brother of a murdered federal agent a local orphaned boy and Rinty are working together to discover the identity of the cloaked figure before the Indians attack. The only big name in this film besides Rin Tin Tin himself is George Brent as the brother of the murdered federal agent giving a somewhat wooden performance compared to his later work for Warner Brothers.The story is fairly pedestrian but if you love watching the original Rin Tin Tin in action this is only one of a few films I know of on DVD where you can still see the great German Shepherd star. Another is the 1925 silent film Clash of the Wolves that is on the DVD set More Treasures from the American Film Archives. Grapevine Video has Where the North Begins 1923 The Night Cry 1926 Tracked by the Police 1927 and The Lone Defender 1930 all available on DVDR. Unfortunately the Mill Creek edition of this 1931 film has not been restored at all. The video is in bad shape in spots and there is considerable hissing in the audio. However I would say it is nothing worse than what you see on those public domain 50 Movie Packs.Even as a teenager Rinty still had it. The dog actually did seem to get the concept of acting. In a couple of scenes I really thought I saw him do a doubletake! Plus there are quite a few good action scenes involving Rinty. If you are a Rin Tin Tin fan I recommend this DVD in spite of its technical flaws due to the film's age and neglect.".

	schema:headline " Do You Like To Watch Men Riding Horses?";
	schema:reviewBody "Do you like to watch men riding horses? If so this Mascot serial has a lot of it but not much else. Mostly filmed outdoors it is a Western 'mystery man' serial in which the hero Alan Scott George Brent is among those trying to discover the identity of 'The Wolfman' who is leading a band of Indians attempting to drive all the settlers out of a mining town. The 'mystery man' theme was used countless times in serials from the twenties to the late thirties and was often found in occasional B westerns such as the wonderful Ken Maynard's 'Tombstone Canyon' 1932.The high points include seeing George Brent as a young thin virile Western hero. He should have done more Westerns instead of being packaged and sold the way he was throughout the rest of his career. You can see him in '42nd Street' 1933 and as the Professor in 'The Spiral Staircase' 1945 Lafe McKee veteran character actor in over 400 films has what must have been his biggest role ever since he's in all 12 chapters Georgia Hale as 'The Girl' feisty against the villains when she appears was Chaplin's dance hall love in 'The Gold Rush' 1925 and had the lead in the silent 'The Great Gatsby' 1926. Since she was deemed 'unsuitable for talkies' this was her last movie.More high points Theodore Lorch as Pierre LaFarge best remembered as the High Priest in 'Flash Gordon' 1936 appears in almost all the chapters Frankie Darro as Jimmy shows off his great teenage physical versatility and fine acting ability though he isn't featured nearly enough. Frankie is at his best after the great 'The Phantom Empire' 1935 in the many 'buddy' flicks he made with Mantan Moreland see for example 'Up In The Air' 1940. Then there's RinTinTin the putative star of the serial who shows a broader acting range than in his previous Mascot serial 'The Lone Defender' 1930 though here much of the stunt work must be his double. He died the next year.Over all it's a much better serial than 'The Lone Defender' because of so many outdoor action sequences. There's a fine cliffhanger with Frankie and 'Rinty' hanging from a bucket suspended over a canyon. There are also lots of good shots from inside the Bronson Caves. We get the sure hand of Wyndham Gittens as the supervising editor and one of the writers. He was responsible for many of the better 1930s serials including 'Tim Tyler's Luck' 1937 and 'Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars' 1938 as well as the dozen or so he did for Mascot. He gives us lots of red herrings regarding the identity of the 'mystery man' finally revealed with all details explained in the final chapter which includes the not surprising revelation that the warpath Indians were really white men a clich since 'The Iron Horse' 1925 and hey! ever since the Boston Tea Party! Unfortunately there's so much chasing around on horse back to fill in the chapters that not much really happens. Better would be to have condensed it into an exciting feature the way that Gitten's 'The Lost Jungle' 1934 was converted into a feature that was better and amazingly more interesting than the serial it came from! Note The 'Mill Creek Entertainment' DVD is awful  booming hissing sounds and blurred visuals. Much better quality are its 'The Law of the Wild' 1934 and 'The Adventures of Rex and Rinty' 1935 both with RinTinTin Jr. and Rex 'The Wonder Horse.'Of the four RinTinTin sound serials the others being 'The Lone Defender' 1930 'The Law of the Wild' 1934 and 'The Adventures of Rex and Rinty' 1935 this is the best one. It has the most interesting group of characters a 'mystery man' guessing game story and the best cliff hangers. Still there's too much riding around so I'll only give it a four and half.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've shown my daughter a few silent RinTinTin films recently so we were both taken aback somewhat at how clunky and awkward this film often is compared to Rinty's silent work but then earlysound films are often this way. Still like most any Mascot serial this is a fun film with a lot of action. Walter Miller featured in a number of silent and sound serials is a charismatic leading man although at first he certainly does not seem to be the protagonist!! even if his attempt at a Mexican accent sounds more like the bad pseudoFrench accents one hears in pirate and Mountie films. Fortunately June Marlowe bestknown for playing Miss Crabtree in the classic early 30's Our Gang shortsby the way I'd LOVE to see the two films Ms. Marlowe made in Germany in the late silent era. Are they around today?? doesn't even attempt a Hispanic accent as Dolores Valdez female lead in the serial but she is attractive and charming and wears those jungle pants well. The cliffhangers are often impressive although the resolutions of them aren't! and in one chapter ending there are actually FOUR cliffhangers delivered at once which is a wonderful touch! Rinty made one more serial for Mascot THE LIGHTNING WARRIOR with Frankie Darro which is also recommended. Like a number of 193031 serials that come to mind there's a lot of mysterious eyes looking through secret panels and from behind corners and lots of shadowy presences in the corners of the frame which no doubt looked eerie up on the big screen at the theaters of the day. The Grapevine print is good quality but is taken from a 1950's TV copy which has new credits. Also I'm guessing that the first chapter was cut by a few minutes to fit into a thirtyminute TV slot because there are a few continuity gaps and scenes shown at the beginning of chapter 2 as recaps that WERE NOT seen in chapter 1! that we didn't see in any of the later chapters. Every Mascot serial is worth watching and this is no exception. Although hampered by the awkward earlysound technology THE LONE DEFENDER should appeal to any Mascot serial fan...and any Rin Tin Tin fan or dog lover.".

The cliffhangers are often impressive although the resolutions of them aren't! and in one chapter ending there are actually FOUR cliffhangers delivered at once which is a wonderful touch! Rinty made one more serial for Mascot THE LIGHTNING WARRIOR with Frankie Darro which is also recommended. Like a number of 193031 serials that come to mind there's a lot of mysterious eyes looking through secret panels and from behind corners and lots of shadowy presences in the corners of the frame which no doubt looked eerie up on the big screen at the theaters of the day. The Grapevine print is good quality but is taken from a 1950's TV copy which has new credits. Also I'm guessing that the first chapter was cut by a few minutes to fit into a thirtyminute TV slot because there are a few continuity gaps and scenes shown at the beginning of chapter 2 as recaps that WERE NOT seen in chapter 1! that we didn't see in any of the later chapters. Every Mascot serial is worth watching and this is no exception. Although hampered by the awkward earlysound technology THE LONE DEFENDER should appeal to any Mascot serial fan...and any Rin Tin Tin fan or dog lover.";

	schema:reviewBody "Here we get to see a 1930 Mascot sound serial. Mascot made better ones before and after this one. It's the story of the mysterious 'Ramon' played by Walter Miller suspected of being 'The Cactus Kid' who helps and protects the heroine Dolores Valdez June Marlowe from having her gold mine being taken over by the evil Amos Harkey Lee Shumway.Oh by the way the real star of the film is RinTinTin who gets top billing and was the most popular film star of 1926. The story goes that a string quartet would play while he ate so that he'd enjoy a stress free meal. This was his next to last serial. He died in 1932. He does better 'acting' in 'The Lightning Warrior' 1931 where he sympathetically gets to play off a very young Frankie Darro. Here he is mostly all action jumping running at high speed pulling at ropes and digging. He is clearly the focus of many of the chapters with the humans in the background.The story is too back and forth and little really happens. We do get to see lots of mysterious hands shadows and eyes popping out at various times to add the scent of mystery that they gave to so many silent and early sound films and serials. Only a couple of the cliff hangers are exciting such as when Rinty rescues Ramon from a cliff bound runaway wagon. The gold mine is in the Bronson Caves which we see briefly in two chapters.Although Lee Shumway appeared in bit parts in 431 movies he is little remembered. Walter Miller veteran of 251 films mostly as a guard a henchman or a gangster can be seen in one of the major roles in Mascot's much better 'The Last of the Mohicans' 1932 noteworthy for the fact that many of the chapters end with up to four different leads in separate cliff hanger endings.Finally what really keeps us watching each chapter is to see June Marlowe with her natural hair color who played Miss June Crabtree in six 'Our Gang' Little Rascal shorts. Here we never get any tight close ups but even in the poor TV print mine was from Mill Creek Video we can glimpse some of the characteristic visual and vocal expressions she displayed with Chubby Jackie Cooper and Stymie and the rest of her 'class.' As I've said 'The Lightining Warrior'1931 is a better RinTinTin serial as are any of the others written by Wyndham Gittens who wrote so many Mascot Republic and Universal good ones.For Rinty and Miss Crabtree 'The Lone Defender' unfortunately merits only a 3.".

This is a very serious movie and although it's been done before there is still enough tension to keep focus most of the way through. When a parent loses their child in most cases it will drive them crazy especially if they never find the body alive or dead. And you can sort of feel that emotion in this movie a bit even if your not a parent. But one thing that got to me was the use of the police in this let's just say the timing is terrible to the point it's not all that believable sometimes.

	schema:headline " About Kamen Rider Hibiki and the Seven Senki";
	schema:reviewBody "Well I freaking loved this movie I knew it was thematically like Seven Samurai and well I really enjoy that story and I enjoy Hibiki so I definitely felt that I was going to enjoy this movie. First off the characters were so much fun I loved the past Ibuki he was great being bored of being a Daimyou and wanting to do more. Todoroki was pretty solid more confidence and I loved when he gave Hibiki back his Oni tools. Kabuki was amazing going into the movie I knew one of them was going to betray them but I didn't think it was going to be him. I was so convinced he was good that his betrayal was shocking to me. which also sucked because he had one of the best designs Though at the end I liked that he had some heart left in him. Kirameki was interesting that he was a coward in the beginning but gained courage by the end and helped kick Makamou butt. Nishiki was hilarious and I enjoy a good thief also that his weapon was a threesection staff that turns into a Triangle was one of the greatest things ever. Touki was interesting anyone played by Kenji Matsuda is being a Buddhist monk and a guy with a gong as his weapon was totally awesome. Habataki I loved from the beginning being a family man whose wife wants him to fight and live to return home also being a flying Oni with a flute weapon made him totally amazing. Overall the designs of the new Oni were simply amazing and I am kind of sad they didn't bring them into the show I mean Kabuto handled about 7 riders or so I'm sure that Hibiki could have done some of that in the show too. Then again I am saddened a lot of Movie Riders aren't used in the series. Still the whole origin of Takeshi is really interesting and feels really connected to the show. Honestly I like both origins of the Armed Saber and this was really cool here but I think that they should have shown us how the 7 Onis in the past should have defeated Orochi but that it connected the past to the present was a nice nod too. Overall probably one of my favorite of the Heisei Era movies up their with the Agito Faiz and Kabuto ones. Well after the Hyper Battle DVD I am finished with Hibiki.".

Car lost in the woods Babysitter home alone and stalked by crazy guy old abandoned hotel with crazy people in it... you've seen it all before and it isn't even bound together by a clever script. Far from that... Chicks get abducted by some crazy guy then some strange interrogation in a FBI Cell takes place ... I guess just because they needed some reason for the flashback sequences. Beside that the whole part is idiotic... how could a psychologist fall for a crazy guy in FBI dress with an interrogation room in an old flooded cellar??Amusement is basically just a collection of ideas stuffed into a messy script... Let's make a horror movie with beautiful chicks and a crazy guy! OK but I want a clown in there and Joyride was fun so let's also put that in and have some people being stabbed in the eye. If we make the crazy guy an inventor with killer gimmicks and some Dr. Giggles laughter I am in! OK deal... but we need a psychologist in there plus some unexpected twist and a moral ending to at least make it look smart on first sight.Phew...things build up the whole reason for the movie title is unfolded and pretty meaningless the characters get killed in most uninspired ways possible the flashbacks are clumsy and don't explain much and we never learn why people are sown into mattresses or crazy guy has a fetish for pulling living things open. It just happens.. random shreds of stolen ideas like in a cheesy clip show. THIS IS A MESS!! For the few scenes that work its 90 Minute too much wasted and the ending should make anybody angry.

The plot is similar to Valentine 2001 but the movie was weighed measured and found wanting.For starters the editing could have been a lot better. The movie starts off with the Shelby story when it could have been much better placed when the psychiatrist questions Tabitha about Shelby. Another scene in which Lisa tries to enter the hotel and accidentally breaks a bottle when the psycho steps out the bottle is still on the steps untouched and in one piece.The story was not impressive at all. The whole Tabitha portion of the story of her babysitting her cousins and being attacked by the clown was very similar to Halloween 1978. The backstory which told why the psycho had such an animosity towards the girls in the first place should have been well explained.The characters where not plausible at all. For instance when Lisa sends her boyfriend to check on her friend at the hotel and when he doesn't come out she doesn't call the cops she goes in herself. I mean how stupid can you get. The movie is nothing more than a compilation of several slasher movies made in the past all jumbled up into one movie. No wonder why this movie never made it to the big screen. If you want to watch a good horror movie rent out Halloween1978 Psycho1960 or The Changeling1980because this movie is nothing more than another futile attempt by Hollywood to create a decent original horror movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I thought this movie might be something but even from the beginning not only was it bad it had so many plot holes! I don't think this will spoil anything for anyone because it wouldn't make any sense anyways so there's no way to guess any of it. in the first scene when the amusement guy is sneaking up on the bad man talking in the house why would the truck driver the one on the phone be inside the house because for one thing it's not his. And two later on we find out it's the amusement guys house i'm sorry if i'm not making sense with the amusementbad guy titles but the movie wasn't significant enough for me to remember their names. Also wrong with this scene is because it relies on the crazy girl throwing herself out of the truck how would anybody have known that she was going to do that? There is no logical reason the amusement guy could have known she was going to throw herself out. Later on there's a therapist who's interviewing the blonde girl and in the middle of the interview she discovers the therapist that shes in the trap of one of her old patients the amusement guy she tries to escape but is killed but how could she not know that she wasn't in an FBI station when there's a maze of pathways to get out some of which lead to dangerous situations. She would have to be a complete dolt not to recognize it as a trap. I've tried to give her the benefit of the doubt. I tried to say she thought it was a crime scene but then why would they give the blonde girl trauma therapy on site? Why was the amusement guy so stupid?

	onyx:emotionText "I thought this movie might be something but even from the beginning not only was it bad it had so many plot holes! I don't think this will spoil anything for anyone because it wouldn't make any sense anyways so there's no way to guess any of it. in the first scene when the amusement guy is sneaking up on the bad man talking in the house why would the truck driver the one on the phone be inside the house because for one thing it's not his. And two later on we find out it's the amusement guys house i'm sorry if i'm not making sense with the amusementbad guy titles but the movie wasn't significant enough for me to remember their names. Also wrong with this scene is because it relies on the crazy girl throwing herself out of the truck how would anybody have known that she was going to do that? There is no logical reason the amusement guy could have known she was going to throw herself out. Later on there's a therapist who's interviewing the blonde girl and in the middle of the interview she discovers the therapist that shes in the trap of one of her old patients the amusement guy she tries to escape but is killed but how could she not know that she wasn't in an FBI station when there's a maze of pathways to get out some of which lead to dangerous situations. She would have to be a complete dolt not to recognize it as a trap. I've tried to give her the benefit of the doubt. I tried to say she thought it was a crime scene but then why would they give the blonde girl trauma therapy on site? Why was the amusement guy so stupid? Why does he leave his weapons lying around where his subjects can easily get them? It was stupid boring confused and a complete waste of time. I'm glad I only rented it. I could keep going about plot holes but I won't because i'd be here all day.";

Tabitha Katheryn Winnick is kidnapped from her uncle's house by a man dressed of clown. Lisa Jessica Lucas is caught in an old pension by a twisted man. The three women are former school friends from Briar Hills and sooner they find themselves in an underground prison further they discover that the abductor is a former school mate that had psychological problems and is seeking revenge against them.The plot of Amusement is so unreasonable actually absurd that irritates. The first segment Shelby is dumb with unexplained attitudes that do not make sense.

Who would chase a truck with a dangerous kidnapper in the middle of nowhere leaving the girlfriend and a wounded girl behind on the secondary road? Why the truck driver runs over Rob? Why did he stop in a creepy house if he was close to the gas station? Tabitha's segment is the best and slightly inspired in the 1979 When a Stranger Calls but uses the bad clichs with the woman running from a backyard to a closed space and finding the body of the babysitter. Lisa's segment is also terrible and who would sneak in a frightening place after the disappearance of her best friend Cat and her boyfriend Dan inside the house? The annoying and insane criminal is not developed and the viewer never knows how he got the isolated underground facility and why the psychiatrist of Briar Hills would visit a patient in a visibly abandoned spot. Last but not the least the recreation of the art boxes by the maniac is simply ridiculous. The good points of this flick are the cinematography and the acting but that is not enough to save the story. My vote is four.Title Brazil Diverso Macabra Macabre Diversion".

It starts of pretty well but you will have your question marks in the first 15 minutes of the film nothing is logic it just doesn't work. Maybe I am stupid by not getting the point of the truck scene. Anyway you think okay the bad guy is out there but he isn't frightening. The mask he is wearing is creepy but doesn't appear enough in the film. When it appears in the bedroom well that's the best part for me. Clowns always have some weird thing surrounding them. You never see their real face and they are always laughing even when they failed in doing a thing. It just doesn't work they could have made him freakier remember Sid Haig in House of a 1000 Corpses. It's a fact that they were going for PG13. There isn't almost no blood running and there is no gore except for the last 5 minutes but that isn't enough for the real creeps and freaks. In the house of The Laugh they even tried to get the SAW atmosphere by having self made torture devices. I don't know what it is but nothing works I wouldn't say avoid it but only see it when there is nothing else to do maybe you will be amused a little bit.".

	schema:reviewBody "What's this you say? An anthologystyle horror involving a killer clown and Katheryn Winnick? I'm in. Unfortunately by the third segment I had stopped caring. By the end I was just disappointed and not even remotely amused. So we have an anthology of sorts revolving around three girls who were best friends during elementary school.Originally I thought the first entry was the weakest and most ridiculous. Now I've realised that the final act is tied for the 'prize'. Anyway we meet the first girl named Shelby who is driving longdistance with her speed enthusiast boyfriend. They join a convoy and a whackedout passenger in the van driving in front hurls herself out of the window and onto their windscreen. The trucker zooms off leaving Shelby and another driver to tend to the death wish chick...whilst Shelby's beau follows the trucker to take down his plates.Here is where it gets nonsensical. The trucker appears to attempt to run pretty boy over who swerves his car and gets his wheels jammed momentarily. Trucker guy races back to the scene followed by pretty boy about five seconds later. He manages to crash into some discarded tractor leaves the wreckage and finds the good Samaritan driver lying on the road looking a bit worse for wear. Pretty boy asks good Samaritan where his girlfriend is good Samaritan replies He took them! He took your girl and that lady! Pretty boy responds with a very halfhearted What? Meanwhile my brain is telling me that this is quite frankly bullsht.Okay let's back it up here a little Mr. Director. You expect me to believe that this truck driver drove about 20 seconds back down the road to the scene Somehow knocked out two perfectly ablebodied adults threw Shelby and windshield diver in his van and took off...all in a time span of about 30 seconds before pretty boy returned? But that's not all you want me to believe is it? Because dear readers as we soon discover the girls are actually gagged and bound in good Samaritan's car. That's right. There's your little twist about 20 minutes in. Ugh enough of this. Next tale please.The second segment is thankfully an improvement and the strongest all round. The luscious Katheryn Winnick stars as Tabitha who winds up babysitting her relatives. She visits her aunt's house to find that the babysitter has apparently gone. Tabitha also hears someone walking around upstairs but this is nothing to be concerned about of course. Eh later. The guest room where she will be spending the night is literally stacked with clowns. The main fixture being a lifesized very realistic looking clown sitting in a rocking chair. I was glad to see the obvious influence the wellknown urban legend had on this scene. This is a nice creepy short. I'm not a really a fan of clowns and the one featured here is very evil looking. My only complaints about this Katheryn Winnick was teasing us all in 'Satan's Little Helper' with those wondrous bosoms of hers. She begins undressing in Amusement but gets freaked out by rocking chair clown and doesn't unleash her racktasms. Not good. Lastly She was obviously really unsettled by the clown so I wondered why the hell she just didn't go sleep on the couch. I know I would've. Anyway this is fairly good and engaging except for the lame cutaway at the end. Some violence please? Now we come to the final act. Here it all gets jumbled up. A couple go looking for their friend in a really massive old hotel. The setting is pretty impressive I'd love to visit this hotel. They find Tabitha sewn into a bed Yep there's some flashbacks to their childhood and we see that the three girls didn't like this weird kid's cruel project and this causes him to get sent away. Well now he's real mad but yet very amused. He's also a skilled imitator as he plays a geeky driver a psycho clown an FBI agent He's real good at this one he manages to fool his own doctor. and a mute retard.Back to the present and he has his three enemies in some underground lair aka the set from Saw III. There aren't really any traps unless you count a few fences moving walls and sliding doors as traps. There was one cool scene where I thought we'd FINALLY see some good ol' gore. But like Kath's undressing it was not to be. It was all a masquerade. You'll know it when you see it.The ending happens too quickly for it to make any impact but sweet kill. BLOOD! If you can ignore the fact that a door from his underground lair leads into his van then maybe you'll be satisfied. In conclusion Amusement falls flat I'm afraid. The flashback scenes aren't fleshed out properly and the whole interrogation scene is pretty much pointless. I'm giving it a 5 for the clown sequence beyond that there's honestly nothing else to see.".

There aren't really any traps unless you count a few fences moving walls and sliding doors as traps. There was one cool scene where I thought we'd FINALLY see some good ol' gore. But like Kath's undressing it was not to be. It was all a masquerade. You'll know it when you see it.The ending happens too quickly for it to make any impact but sweet kill. BLOOD! If you can ignore the fact that a door from his underground lair leads into his van then maybe you'll be satisfied. In conclusion Amusement falls flat I'm afraid. The flashback scenes aren't fleshed out properly and the whole interrogation scene is pretty much pointless. I'm giving it a 5 for the clown sequence beyond that there's honestly nothing else to see.";

	schema:reviewBody "A vicious psycho called the Laugh badly overplayed with supremely annoying hamminess by the pitifully unconvincing Keir O'Donnell exacts a harsh and complex revenge on three women who mocked him when he was a little boy. Director John Simpson and screenwriter John Wade Wall really fumble the ball with this grindingly predictable uninspired and grossly implausible outing by splitting up the narrative into several extremely disjointed and meandering separate segments thus robbing the film of any necessary tension and momentum it crucially needs in order to work. Worse yet the characters are all onedimensional and underdeveloped you never get to know the main female characters well enough to care about what happens to them. There are precious few jolts to speak of with only a bit involving an ugly lifesize clown in the Tabitha episode providing the sole decent creepy moment in the picture. The low body count and moderate gore don't help matters much as well. The lovely Kareryn Winnick as Tabitha the fetching Laura Breckenridge as Shelby and the attractive Jessica Lucas as Lisa do their best with the subpar material but their characters are too slightly drawn to engender any sympathy from the viewer. The severely miscast O'Donnell as the wacko is another major problem With his irritating loony cackle pudgy face and short dumpy build this guy quite simply comes across as very laughable and unfrightening instead of scary and threatening. The story boasts more holes in it than Swiss cheese. For example the sequence with the psychiatrist makes no sense whatsoever. The ending with a massive house which turns out somehow to be a truck trailer is likewise utterly ludicrous. Both Mark Garret's slick cinematography and Marco Beltrami's rattling score are better than this tripe deserves. A totally bythenumbers stalk'n'slash clunker that's well worth missing.".

Strangely enough the movie actually had some decent filmmaking. It seemed professionally made or I should say shot. From the completely unoriginal and predictable plot to the sad case of acting ooooh I'm crazy so I'll laugh and be scaaaary to the utterly mess of scenes spliced together 'Amusement' is just plain a mess. I can't give away the premise without spoilers but think of it as a gift so you can stay away. A boy with an animal cruelty fetish gets mocked by 3 classmate girls. So when he gets older he seeks revenge. Wow this has never ever been explored in any horror film before. I think I've spent too much time on this mess. No ambition was shown no attempts at scares as all scenesideas are dozens of years old. This makes me miss the greats such as the original 'Halloween' where they had an even lower budget and still succeeded in scaring audiences. I would say this jumped on the tortureporn bandwagon but this was released in 2009 and that trend happened years ago. In fact it's all but fading if not for 'Saw XVIII' coming soon.

None of it ties together. I still can't figure out what the first episode about the truck convoy had to do with anything that follows. Is it creepy yeah. Is it scary slightly. Does it make one iota of sense not in the slightest. Okay somewhere in the middle of the sticks this laughing hyena has built an underground fortress full of cogs and sliding glass doors so that he can kidnap some girls he remembers from his past to torture them. Why? At least Silence of the Lambs just had a hole in the ground which was much more plausible and thus much more frightening. Apparenlty our villain spent the majority of his life in an insane asylum but still had the engineering capabilities to construct a complicated fun house full of elevators and chain link fence mazes.

	schema:reviewBody "Amusement is a movie that I've had on my list for quite some time mostly because of the scary ass clown on the cover. Like 99.9 of the cover art done for modern day movies it's greatly misleading. There is one semiintense scene that will provoke your coulrophobia and it was only included I suspect as an excuse to create an enticing DVD spread for horror fans.Starting off with the plot this movie doesn't have one at least not a coherent one or one that makes an iota of sense.

Like 99.9 of the cover art done for modern day movies it's greatly misleading. There is one semiintense scene that will provoke your coulrophobia and it was only included I suspect as an excuse to create an enticing DVD spread for horror fans.Starting off with the plot this movie doesn't have one at least not a coherent one or one that makes an iota of sense.

Not super good compared to old classics like Halloween Friday the 13th or the contemporary classics Scream and Boogey man. But it definitely doesn't suck.

There still is no DVD of it at least in Region I and that's frustrating. There's something intriguing about this story that drives me back to it.Perhaps that is so because it's about a photographer something I did too while being in the newspaper business for years and an art form I've always enjoyed. The story also takes place in the 1940s and I love the style and atmosphere of that era which is beautifully shown here. Joe Pesci is Leon Bernzini or The Great Bernzini a newspaper photographer and Barbara Hershey is a mysterious woman who Pesci has the hots for. There is a lot of mystery in here with Hershey's character. Pesci takes gruesome photos doesn't get involved with anyone but he's willing to make an exception with Kay Levitz Hershey..... but is she good or bad for him?Sad to say the filmmakers kind of make a hero out of basically a sleazy guy who has few if any morals. Bernzy was paparazzi before they invented the word!. The movie also has an unsatisfying ending particularly with Hershey's character.However I keep getting drawn back into multiple viewings of this and I'd sure like to see what it looks like with a good DVD transfer.".

Joe Pesci is Leon Bernzini or The Great Bernzini a newspaper photographer and Barbara Hershey is a mysterious woman who Pesci has the hots for. There is a lot of mystery in here with Hershey's character. Pesci takes gruesome photos doesn't get involved with anyone but he's willing to make an exception with Kay Levitz Hershey..... but is she good or bad for him?Sad to say the filmmakers kind of make a hero out of basically a sleazy guy who has few if any morals. Bernzy was paparazzi before they invented the word!. The movie also has an unsatisfying ending particularly with Hershey's character.However I keep getting drawn back into multiple viewings of this and I'd sure like to see what it looks like with a good DVD transfer.";

He nails it a terrific performance even down to handling the cameras well.Too bad the rest of the film is hit or miss. Maybe on the hit good side is the general set design and atmosphere. It feels like a slightly simplified and cleaned up 1942 Manhattan where most or all of this occurs. And Barbara Hershey as the leading woman not quite a femme fatale it seems but she has that look is solid especially with her hair up. You'll see a good strong look. And the cameras are pretty right on I'm a photographer and I shoot with one of these 4x5 Graflex press cameras all the time though at a glance it seemed that at least one of his Graflexes was a postwar model. We'll let that slip. And on the plus side it has to be said that Mark Isham's last minute hiring for the score was inspired because it gives the movie the depth it needs.The misses on the film are deeply integral to enjoying it all the waythe plot the secondary actors the direction. The latter is hard to pin down within the obvious and almost purposely clichd plot but you feel all along that the movie is put together functionally as if the director knows most of all that these pieces have to go in order. But giving it flow elegance power and even a convincing miseenscene is not just a matter of logic. It feels off as it out of tune. It's especially noticeable because so much of the film is going right including Pesci.There is the question of why did they take Weegee a.k.a. Arthur Fellig and turn him into Bernzini a.k.a. Leon Bernsteinapparently it was a rights issue with the original story but certainly the new story could have still been based on Weegee. The images in the film look like pseudoWeegee moments as much as Pesci looks like Weegee and Wikipedia says that some of these are actual Weegees. I have my doubts but who knows? Both men had outrageous rubber stamps for the back of their prints that are almost identicalWeegee's said Weegee the Great. The car is identical for sure and even the pace and the world are Weegee's.Beyond all of this the movie is entertaining if never commanding and quite beautifully photographedI'm talking the cinematography now. My copy was VHS and it doesn't sound like the DVD service through Amazon called the Universal Vault Series has very high standards one user said it looked like VHS quality. I would think a full widescreen version would be worth the troublemaybe try an Amazon instant play for 3. This says specifically that it is widescreen.".

	schema:reviewBody "This criminally underrated movie features a fascinating central character an outstanding performance by Joe Pesci and a dark moody recreation of 1940s New York that's absolutely stunning. Its story about the circumstances that lead to a man abandoning one of his most important principles and the high cost that he has to pay as a consequence of doing so is full of danger deceit and disappointment and contains many moments of humour and pathos that add immeasurably to the enjoyment of watching this totally gripping film.Leon Bernzy Bernstein Joe Pesci is a freelance photographer who inhabits the city's streets and clubs late at night in order to capture sensational pictures which he sells to the tabloid newspapers. Photos of gangsters victims of violent crime and celebrities behaving badly are his speciality but much of his success is also attributable to his amazing ability to arrive at the scene of a crime a suicide or a huge fire before anyone else and it's this talent that led to him becoming generally known as The Great Bernzini.Despite Bernzy being uncouth and preoccupied with sleaze he also has aspirations to achieve recognition for his work which he considers to be worthy of being published in book form. Unfortunately the publishers he approaches don't see any merit in his material which they simply regard as being vulgar and distasteful. Bernzy's lifestyle and dedication to his work resulted in him living a very lonely life and on certain occasions he wistfully watches happy couples together showing their affection for each other.When Bernzy's work brings him into contact with a beautiful wealthy widow called Kay Levitz Barbara Hershey who shows him some warmth and understanding and also seems to appreciate his work he becomes putty in her hands and has no hesitation in agreeing to her request to investigate a gangster who approached her shortly after her husband's death and claimed that he owned part of her business. Bernzy's decision quickly leads to him becoming a murder suspect and confronting further dangers when he gets too closely involved in a gang war that's linked to a conspiracy which involves mobsters politicians and a black market in gas rationing coupons.Joe Pesci is exceptionally good in showing the dedication and determination of his character as well as his desperate need for love and recognition. Bernzy had achieved great success in his career through being absolutely professional and enjoying good relations with both the police and the gangsters because he made a point of never taking sides but his deal with Kay changed things and suddenly put him in great danger.The Public Eye is beautifully photographed skilfully directed and features some great dialogue as well as a strong supporting performance by Barbara Hershey but it's ultimately Bernzy's character and Pesci's performance that make this film so memorable.".

Though Pesci did give a great performance in the film the public was not prepared to buy him as leading man status.The film is really Pesci's show in that there are no really developed characters outside of his in the film. However Robert Zemeckis really did a bang up job in creating the mood and atmosphere of the early 1940s with America just going into World War II.With the USA engaged in the 'war on terror' and no demands being made for civilian sacrifice it is probably somewhat vague for people who are not our most senior citizens to realize what was being attempted. And curiously enough though the racket that is being investigated is gasoline rationing.Joe Pesci is an independent photo journalist who with police scanner always on is first on the scene for every event in town. He gets asked by this glamorous socialite Barbara Hershey who normally wouldn't go near someone like him to check out an acquaintance. The acquaintance is found dead by Pesci and that leads him into a racket involving collusion between gangsters and government employees of the Office of Price Administration to control gasoline with stolen ration cards.Back in that war food and other commodities like gasoline were rationed to the civilian public and the price strictly controlled. This was serious business indeed for those times.Pesci also fancies himself an artist not just a paparazzi he sees himself as a Matthew Brady or an Ansel Adams a recorder of his times and his city. That vain but artistic streak leads him to take some real chances.The Public Eye is a good throwback film to the forties.

	schema:reviewBody "The Public Eye is one of many movies advertised with it's poster up yet avoided a cinema release. It's one film you don't want to avoid. Pesci plays an avid cameraman Bernzy who's always first on the scene to flash his camera yet plays a very lonely type who on his latest shoot gets involved with a woman Hershey who implores him to find out who killed her husband where soon he's in over his head with some high up corrupt and powerful dudes coming after him. After all it is 1940 and the backdrops are awesome where this little gem of a drama offers a lot of color and taste and it's great to see Pesci a so underused actor nothing can top his performance in Goodfellas steer this one. Is he doing it all for her cause he's smitten by her? Probably. Is she using him? Probably. But it is a cute little partnership amidst some actions yet again those 1940 backdrops are awesome. Sadly this movie is of course one of those that deserves much more recognition. If still able to spot it now in the world of DVDS or if by such a slight chance you happen to spot it on sale on VHS. Buy it. I guarantee you'll be glad you did. Watch for Australia's Nick Tate in a cameo.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of my new favorite film noirs. Its nice to see Pesci play a sleaze ball who still has some redeeming qualities. In true noir fashion the woman is not to be trusted and love goes unrequited. I'm fascinated by this era the cars the clothesthe lingo the general attitudes of the time. I almost would have liked to see this done in BW although the cinematography is excellent. The basic themes of world weary cynicism and loneliness that Bernzini exhibits are feelings I can relate to personally. He roams through the streets of new york during WWII as a shutterbug taking gorgeous photos of tragic people and homicides. His work is art yet he is seen as nothing more than an opportunistic dirtbag by most people. The femme fatale comes across as a woman doing what she must to survive in a cut throat business. She is drawn to Bernzini out of a mixture of respect for his art and pity for his sad existence. Great movie!".

This film is the best example i can ever give anyone when talking about film as art.I cannot believe how underrated it isnot only as a forgotten film from the early 90's but just how forgotten it is as a film starring Joe Pesci. Just today i was in a Staples and i found a DVD set that contained both The Super and With Honorsand while both of those are just dandy if you like Pescii just can't for the life of me understand how both of those are widely available and this jewel is somehow lost. C'Mon UniversalI know you're not the best at getting your back catalog to DVD but this should be a no brainerits from the 90's for god's sakes. How is something like Splitting Heirs or Pure Luck available from your backlog and this isn't?!?!?!? If you need a synopsisPesci is a very omnipresent shutter bughe prowls the night taking with his camera and his police scanner frequently crashing crime scenes just to be the first one to get a photograph of the leftover carnage. He lives through his camera if you will. He's forever dreaming of getting a coffee table book published of his crime scene photosand one day he gets a phone call from night club owner and very high on the social ladder Barbra Hershey who wants Pesci to investigate the shady circumstances of her dead husband etc etc. The plot is pure noir of coursei hate to say given how much i love it but the plot is actually kind of irrelevantthe whole point of this gorgeous movie is just to bask in the wonderful atmosphere the movie provides. I mean the plot is finePesci soon finds himself over his head in corruption and feuding gangsters and etcand there are a lot of wonderful moments throughout that come from Pesci's character reacting to the latest obstacles that the film's plot is throwing in his pathLOVE that one quick scene of him squirming on the floor while the gangster interrogating him is calling him a cockroach and Pesci lifts his fingers to simulate a cockroach....there are just too many quick visual scenes like that throughout. but again the whole beauty of the movie is just the wonderful wonderful atmosphere.This is a film where truly everything comes together just perfectly to form a glorious movie experience. i know that sounds dumb to saybut its truly one of the best films i can recommend to anyone interested in just observing how a film can function as both a movie and as art. It helps of course if you're a fan of black and white photography and classic film noirbut you don't really have to be to just sit back and enjoy this one either. The end shootout in particular is so beautifully shotand so stylistically originalI can't for the life of me think of one other film that has even tried to rip it off over the years. Howard Franklin who directed this as well as my own personal favorite film Bill Murray's Quick Change sadly never got to make another serious film along the lines of this oneand that i think is a real shame because judging just from this one filmhe could've been one of the best today instead of just a one off director. I'm sure it didn't help that this prob cost Universal a pretty penny to make and only eked out about 3 mil in totaland i remember being in 5th grade when this came outthis had a pretty substantial campaign behind it because i clearly remember seeing the ads for it when it came out so right there i know universal must've been expecting something to happen from this I can't implore all of you hard enough to check this one outeven if it means watching it on a plain ol' VHS tape altho i believe there are torrents of it available to download Good Lord if there's one movieif there's ONE film that i wish would see the light of DVD right now it would be this one.This Thing Never Shuts Off.

The ex Indian Captain has now come back in the avatar of the Coach of the Indian Women's National Hockey team. A team that exists more on paper and less in reality. The team is a ragtag bunch of girls with their own agenda. A bunch of girls who have forgotten what it is like to play for the love of the game. Of playing because you want glory for your country. Not because you want a pensioned job or a government flat. They have all forgotten the sharp thrill of just holding the hockey stick keeping their eyes on the ball and playing for all they are worth. They have played every game but hockey to make sure they get selected every year in the Indian National team. But what does it really mean to play for the Indian National team? To play for India? The girls have never known the thrilling energy of being Team India. Of giving their all to see their country's name on a trophy. But Kabir Khan once a captain ...";

This movie is about a man trying to prove his dedication and love for his sport his people and his country. This is about a man scorned by the nation shunned by his close ones and his redemption in the way he knows best. Its this main underlying theme that makes CDI special. This theme is so universal and so identifiable that your heart connects instantly.CDI is about Indian sportswomen coming to the forefront about the stark and grim realities staring at our national sport and the reasons behind that. It is about unity in diversity strength in weakness and putting the team above oneself. Its about the sacrifices one has to make in order to achieve his goals. Its about the success of true sporting spirit! Its real yet entertaining. Its patriotic without being jingoistic. Its international yet soaked in Indianness. Its a collage of the different states of India and the difficult but fruitful formation of this collage.I have never played or watched or been interested in hockey! But this movie does not need that to touch your heart. All it needs is some patriotism humility and goodness in your heart. If thats in abundance I am sure you will love it.As for the performances I would just say the entire team rocks. the keyword here is TEAM as thats what this film is all about! Enjoy !".

	schema:reviewBody "What's in a name? Although initially this movie drew some amount of controversy outside India among viewers of nonIndian origin the final movie just falsifies all those who advocated that the title Chak De! India was nonrepresentative and was supposed to mean to only a niche of moviegoers. This movie would've been just what it is no matter what is was called or which country made it. Director Shimit Amin's entry in YRF simply transforms the entire perspective of moviemaking and movie watching both for the production house and the viewers.Generally you enter the theatre for a Yashraj movie expecting foreign locales lots of song and dance impossible and unbelievable characters poor storyline bad performances and a helluva investment but this movie delivers what no other Yashraj film ever did. Initially a sports movie Chak De is rather a story of hope courage unity integrity and the dreams. This film finally proves that you don't need Preity or Rani opposite SRK and he all by himself with a great screenwriter great director and a good cast of the hockey team can make a great movie. There are lots of heroes in the movie  the women's team and these ladies simply steal the show. Mainly Bindiya Balbir Priya the hot chic and Komal.See it gets very hard when there is an incredible amount of character development to do. There is a ghost that follows Kabir throughout the film and writer Jaideep Sahani makes a very good use of it. I do admit the fact that he's watched an incredible amount of Hollywood sports flick to develop this script but he adds his very homely formulas and successfully manages to retain this film as an original Indian movie. Some parts of the film are directly lifted like the part of Kabir's ghost and few of the women but all in all I refuse to say this is a Hollywood copy.All in all this is the best summer Hindi movie I've watched so far not because it's got SRK but I love the script the witty oneliners where sometimes with double meanings every girl with her story but I feel at most points the characters don't fully grow well coordinated game sequences though the practise scenes may bore you because there are a LOT and above all the message the film delivers  when united there's nothing you can't win over. The message is pretty well conveyed. You feel the adrenaline rush through the World Cup matches a lot of goosebumps thanks to the great scoring by the Salim Sulaiman duo well crafted script and good direction. Shimit's work is original contrary to the reservations I carried for him being a product of Ram Gopal Verma's school of direction.SRK as usual is great with his acting and beard Vidya Malvade is the overly publicised captain but unfortunately other girls outdo her the Jharkhand girls provide a dimension against contrasting Bindya and her queen bees. Segarika Ghatge's character Priya Saberwal is most memorable for her looks style and for being hot and everything. The North East girls do answer some of vital questions of the North East Indians about their existence in their country as foreigners. The class conflict egoistic chicks and their attitude problem and stuffs are absolutely well portrayed in the film.All in all a well worth. Requires basic knowledge and enthusiasm in hockey. But avoid if you're looking for SRK as the loverboy  he's the tough coach.".

I found it beautiful as always but also realized it never makes me want to cry. Chak De! on the other hand is relatively plain to look at and understated at least for Bollywood and I felt that wonderful emotional brimmingupbutnotquiteover time and again throughout the story.The whole thing about this team of girls from all over India who have to be made into a team really works  you get to know enough about several girls to have a secure sense of the essence of each  the one with the bad temper the one whose husband wants her to come home and cook the senior player who resents the new coach's control the ones who are out for themselves  and the problem each presents in relation to SRK's task of making a team out of a collection of individuals Of course this is any coach's job but I like the moral resonance with the sad backstory of Shah Rukh Khan's character. Kabir Khan like the real Indian player on whom the story is based is an Indian Muslim. He was unjustly accused of throwing a match to Pakistan and lost his career. A team where all have the identity India is an actual team implicitly I think a country with the identity India doesn't engage in persecutory projection and hatred toward a member perceived as other.A note about the photography I like the use of a dusty tone for the first half of the movie and then a much brighter color skin for the second half when we leave India and practice fields and go to Australia. The girls' exposure to the bigness and luxury of the west was handled so nicely  we're given their pleasure in all that's new to their eyesgiant swimming pools exercise machinery lavish hotel buffets  but in passing the Bollywood Visual Excess machine is not in operation and the shed has several locks on the door. At some official function we get to see them all in saris and a bit of makeup but here too it's all under control they're all dressed alike and half of them hate it.Shah Rukh is great. There is no sentimentality in the movie and his character is restrained. The music  no songs  is varied and good  if I could do without the rap music for life!! I loved the Sufi refrain that turns up over and over that seems to express SRK's character's anguish in separation longing for reunion with God.I've always felt that sadness was quite nearby for Shah Rukh  here he neither conceals nor dramatizes it he just lets us feel it. On a more mundane note though I love Shah Rukh in all his KaranJoharselected beautiful clothes I found it relaxing to see him in a small number of normal coach's costumes shirts khakis and blazers that appropriately looked bought off the racks in Macy's.The movie really never hits a wrong note. It's also just wonderful in its feminist position. Generally speaking I feel just boredom and agitation at movie violence in this one when the girls beat up boys who'd been harassing them I felt joy.".

I loved the wonderful cast of unknown girls who make up the Indian national women's hockey team. All of them had a part to play and they played them beautifully while executing some rigorous hockey action. They were excellent and gave wonderfully natural performances that should shame some of the already established actresses. Special mention should be given to the actress playing Bindya Naik. My favourite was the actress who played the spirited but pint sized forward from Haryana she was really cute and funny in a tomboyish sort of way.Shahrukh Khan was excellent in this movie..... his best performance since Swades in my opinion as he played against type. Had some wonderful moments with the girls and drew lots of cheers and laughs from the audience. If the movie succeeds then a lot of the credit has to go the King khan's crowd pulling power.If this film succeeds and I sincerely hope it does I think Amin director and Yashraj films are going to start a whole new trend a la DDLJ with a whole slew of sports related movies coming from Bollywood. I am sure cricket will be next on the agenda.A thoroughly enjoyable ride....go watch it.P.S.  some interesting trailers shown as well Laga Chunari Main Daag Aaja Nachle and Goal the Indian bend it like beckham maybe?".

After seven years he returns to coach a hopeless Women hockey team. The rest of the movie deals with his journey to glory of the National team..The things that stands out for me are.. the Team. Talented actresses gathered from all over the country have done a wonderful job. Acting was top class. Shahrukh Khan have played a character that suits his age and does seriously well. Hockey sequences are great and do give a feel of an international tournament. A nice blend of funny and amazingly inspiring dialogs adds to the brilliance.However the movie has its share of shortcomings. Most of the times movie successfully manages to overshadow the predictable nature of the story but the ending sequence was absolutely the same what i thought of before the movie started. We all knew what would happen in the end but a bit of fine tuning would have made this film a masterpiece.Anyways 'Chak de India' is not just a brave attempt. It goes beyond that tag. It's a wonderful and a courageous attempt. A movie that manages to match the brilliance of Jo Jeeta Wahi Sikander.".

	schema:reviewBody "Chak De India is without a doubt a oneofakind Hindi film one that you'd hardly ever expect to see in Indian cinema and one that is at par with any great foreign production. It is an exceptional sports film more because there's much more to it than just a series of games and you never care about the fact that the ending is easy to predict. Shimit Amin who previously directed Ab Tak Chapphan directs the film with great skill care and feeling for the subject. Jaideep Sahni is responsible for the fantastic script and that's where we get an original example of expert storytelling.This is the story of Kabir Khan once a hockey star and a captain of the Indian team. Seven years ago he was accused of treason in favour of Pakistan because he missed a crucial penalty against them. Being a Muslim and being good sport about it did the job and branded a traitor Kabir left his ancestral home in shame. We know nothing about what he's been through in these seven years but we do know that he's got a new chance to prove his innocence when he comes back as the coach of the Indian woman's field hockey team. A chance as crucial as this damned penalty stroke.The second half is much stronger than the first not that this one's bad but that's the case with most sports films as the most enjoyable sequences are often in later portions when the matches finally take place. And well it is just full of suspense tension and even though I could easily predict the ending the script and direction were good enough to keep me on the edge of my seat and give me quite a few goosebumps throughout it. In fact several moments throughout the matches were so exhilarating and overwhelming that I found myself jumping up off my seat with sheer joy.Technically the film is superb. The cinematography is amazing with the camera moving intelligently to focus the viewer's attention on the proceedings. The film is efficiently edited and the background score more than contributes to the film building tension where necessary and making everything so much more captivating. The title track Chak De India is really a treat. It is patriotic joyful and very well used in the film. That the film's songs atypically play only over montage sequences as opposed to the traditional style of song and dance is certainly a great plus.Shahrukh Khan is tremendous. This is one of his most restrained performances yet his charismatic presence is as evident as ever. He is perfectly natural and controlled in a most nuanced portrayal that never fails to convey the inner pain the frustration the hope and the quiet determination to clear his name and finally make a place in the sun. The supporting cast is roundly good and the girls are great as a group. Shilpa Shukla enjoys the meatiest part an assertive girl driven by ego and jealousy and she is excellent. Sagarika Ghatge and Vidya Malvade are pretty and convincing.Chak De India can be described as patriotic feminist but for me it's more than anything about willpower and the importance of hard and collaborative work. It teaches and reaffirms that what really makes such games workand for that matter many other things in lifeis lots of training patience and team work without which nothing would quite click. According to me the best Hindi film of 2007 a thrilling and inspiring cinematic experience which is worth many a repeat viewing for more than one reason. Take a bow Mr. Amin Mr. Sahni Mr. Khan and all of you twelve brave cuties.".

	schema:reviewBody "Making a sports based movie in my opinion is a very tricky affair because of two things.Firsty99 of the sports based films have the same conclusioni.e David winning over a Goliath which the audience knows from the very beginning and Secondly no matter how much tipsy topsy turvy the screenplay isthe climax scene is where the minnows and the audience rejoice exception being Rocky I which is one of the best motion pictures ever produced in my opinion.Be it The Longest YardBend It Like BeckahmMajor LeagueAngels in the Outfield or our very own Lagaan Iqbal they all have the same thing. A bunch of not so good teammates end up winning the world.So in shortwhen it comes to sporty flicks we all know everythingyet we watch it and enjoy the every bit of it.Chak De India  is good but not great.Yet I believe it couldn't have been better.Confused?So am I.The theme is good the performances are good the direction is goodbut you know what the sport called Hockey looks dull which in reality it isn't.The movie starts of wellbut one doesn't feel the excitementin the matches which one noticed when say Kachra of Lagaan got a Hattrick or when Charlie Sheen did it for The Indians in Major League.Hockey doesn't look good on the big screen but Shah Rukh Khan and Bindya Naikdunno her name make this movie work. I think the coach and the rebellion plot and then the Mcdonald scenes were terrific. Shah Rukh as Kabir Khan is solid and the girls give him ample support.Dialogues are very good but I wish this movie was 15 mins shorter.And they could have used the title track more often.Don't expect it to be another Mughal E Azambut it ain't gonna be a dud either because those who were coming out of theatre looked positive.United they stoodand they won the matchbut sadly we are a nation which still believes in a Bhuvan hitting a six off the last ball and not a chick goalie saving a scorching shot so may be that's y I still consider Aamir Khan's Awwal Number as a fantastic movie.7 OUT OF 10Go enjoy Chak de India and Fcuk de boxoffice".

	onyx:emotionText "Making a sports based movie in my opinion is a very tricky affair because of two things.Firsty99 of the sports based films have the same conclusioni.e David winning over a Goliath which the audience knows from the very beginning and Secondly no matter how much tipsy topsy turvy the screenplay isthe climax scene is where the minnows and the audience rejoice exception being Rocky I which is one of the best motion pictures ever produced in my opinion.Be it The Longest YardBend It Like BeckahmMajor LeagueAngels in the Outfield or our very own Lagaan Iqbal they all have the same thing. A bunch of not so good teammates end up winning the world.So in shortwhen it comes to sporty flicks we all know everythingyet we watch it and enjoy the every bit of it.Chak De India  is good but not great.Yet I believe it couldn't have been better.Confused?So am I.The theme is good the performances are good the direction is goodbut you know what the sport called Hockey looks dull which in reality it isn't.The movie starts of wellbut one doesn't feel the excitementin the matches which one noticed when say Kachra of Lagaan got a Hattrick or when Charlie Sheen did it for The Indians in Major League.Hockey doesn't look good on the big screen but Shah Rukh Khan and Bindya Naikdunno her name make this movie work. I think the coach and the rebellion plot and then the Mcdonald scenes were terrific. Shah Rukh as Kabir Khan is solid and the girls give him ample support.Dialogues are very good but I wish this movie was 15 mins shorter.And they could have used the title track more often.Don't expect it to be another Mughal E Azambut it ain't gonna be a dud either because those who were coming out of theatre looked positive.United they stoodand they won the matchbut sadly we are a nation which still believes in a Bhuvan hitting a six off the last ball and not a chick goalie saving a scorching shot so may be that's y I still consider Aamir Khan's Awwal Number as a fantastic movie.7 OUT OF 10Go enjoy Chak de India and Fcuk de boxoffice";

I loved the fact there was no need to add a romantic subplot involving SRK since a typical Hindi movie is considered incomplete without the lead actor falling in love.It is a simple story told skillfully by Shimit Amin and Jaideep Saini with SRK's one of the most memorable performances. Among the girls 34 girls get most of the attention. I wish we had been told more about the other girls like Gul Iqbal but then such compromises have to be made to keep the film's length in check. The hockey matches are filmed very well without any sensationalisation. There is no hate or jingoism. At the end you walk home with a feeling of triumph the triumph of an underdog.".

	schema:reviewBody "How often do we get a very simple story that makes the biggest impact possible? How often does a dull colorless looking film put a huge smile on your face by the end of the screening? You don't see much of that in Hindi cinema. Chak De does not preach it does not bore in fact it's just telling you a story with one sequence or another the viewer can relate to.Kabir Khan once a caption of the Indian hockey team is accused of match fixing due to a leaked picture of a casual handshake between him and the Pakistani Captain. One circumstance leads to another having Kabir fired and out of the team. Not only is Kabir fired but also heavily criticized and labeled as a traitor.Years later Kabir returns to hockey. Not to play but to coach a group of young girls from various states. Then starts Kabir's journey to lead his team to victory and regain his lost respect. As they say the journey is more important than reaching the destination. Chak De is one tough journey of a coach and his group of girls who don't even know how to play as a team.Chak De talks about a good number of issues that we all see in our everyday lives. However it's not the talk of the issues that win you over but it's how subtly the writer points it all out.Let's analyze Chak De talks about India's national sport  No not cricket. Very few know that field hockey was known as India's national sport in which we have received Olympic honors decades ago. Since the cricket wave hit Indians forgot about their national sport.Chak De talks about the role of women in our country. Normally seen as housewives Indian woman in sports is frowned upon. Chak De mentions that in scenes when a player talks to Kabir about her husband. Or when the girls are rejected permission to go to the tournament.Finally Chak De is basically about playing for your country over anything else. Whether your Punjabi Gujrati Tamil Bengali or Bihari  It's about INDIA. As mentioned in a striking scene in the initial reels.there are so many remarkable scenes in the movie. To name a couple the McDonalds scene is genius. Of Course the climax is electrifying.The writing is flawless. Screenplay glues you. The dialogues are touching fresh and not a tad bit cheesy. Bravo Jaideep Sahni! SalimSuleman's music is underrated. The title song and Maula mere are bout gems. Background score is amazing.Shimmit Amin's direction is top notch. It was his second film after a thrilling Ab Tak Chappan. Hard to believe? All girls are natural. Some are hockey players in real life and some are in reel life. They all play their parts flawlessly. Especially the one's that play Balbir Komal Vidiya Alia and Preeti respectively.Shah Rukh Khan is the heart and soul of Chak De India. Every expression dialogue mannerism smile cry it's flawless. He carries Chak De all the way. A subtle act that speaks so loudly about the man's talent. One of his best performances. Says a lot since he's got a great resume of performances Aplaudworthy! Overall  Chak De is poetic controversial and nothing short of a classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Great Movie......I can say that simply go and watch it specially girls.....The story of the film is about a typical underdog winning the game. The aspect of coach seeking redemption by making his team win added lot of grip to the story. What makes this film different is extraordinary script writing and superb direction. Screenplay is just perfect. The entire film is realistic barring certain episodes demanding creative freedom. The writer avoided the board's politics aspect in the storyline in order to focus on establishing each and every character of player well and then show how they change their attitude to become team players. The following scenes are defining moments of the film Shahrukh Khan did the role of a brilliant coach whose respect is battered by the misconception and the media. He is exceptional as an inspiring and tough coach. The actor in Shahrukh dominates the star in this film. It is nice to see Shahrukh Khan doing purposeful films like Swadesh and Chak De India once in a while. The girls who played the women hockey team are exceptionally good. The girls who did the roles of Preeti Balbir and Komal dominate the scene.Cinematography is amazing. Music is good. The background music is peppy and suits the theme. Dialogues are very good. Editing is nice. It is nice to see Yashraj Films producing a purposeful film like this instead of boxoffice winning inspired popcorn entertainers.The entire first half is concentrated on establishing all the characters in Hockey team and then inculcating the sense of belongingness among the team members. The second half is more entertaining with nice twists and engaging games. The plus points of the film are writing Jaideep Sahni performances Shahrukh Khan direction Shimit Amin and Cinematography Sudeep Chatarjee. It is a sensible and a brilliant film with soul. On a whole Chak De India along with Lagaan and Iqbal is one the best sports based films ever made in India. A must watch for everybody!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes I went to see the film because I saw Shahrukh looking super good in the promos what can I say  I am a shallow person!. But what kept me glued to the seat with my eyes fixed on the screen was a motley crew of ordinary girls with extraordinary attitude. AND I like hockey wish the glory days were back.Chak de India is an out and out sports film there is a disgraced coach there is a team that is fragmented and needs team spirit and there are matches to be won and glory to reap. The film follows a rather linear path and does not dish out any surprises except one  it is unpredictably wonderful! My football and basketball fanatic little nephew was shouting goal at every score and the audience was as mesmerized at this tournament being played out on celluloid as they would have been at the live event. There were cheers and claps at every win. Why? Because this team was real we watched them turn into a team and we yearned for their day in the lights as much as they did. Of course it was a Cinderella story  but what made the story poignant was the fact that all this happened for real that there was indeed an extraordinary player who was disgraced and redeemed himself in exactly this fashion. The script was taut the editing was superb there were no unnecessary moments in the film. There were no cringe inducing dialogs no useless song and dance routines no romance backdrop of the coach falling for the star a la Bend it Like Beckham. The music was uplifting and extremely well integrated into the narrative  Kuch Kariye was inspirational Maula mere haunting Badal Pe Paon a most exuberant transition from stuck in the back waters to out in the happening place of the World Cup! The girls were superbly cast  they represented the true face of India with all its diversity and its problems that relate to this diversity. Their bickering their in fights quest for personal glory and how this slowly changed into a camaraderie was extremely well done. Komal Chautala Chitrashi Rawat was CUTE Bindiya Nayak Shilpa Shukla was awesome as the bad girl of the team Preeti Sabharwal Segarika Ghatge was hot Tanya Abrol was awesome as the Hockey Doongi Balbir Vidya Sharma Vidya Malvade was good as the conflicted housewife turned goaliecaptain but my personal favorite was SoiMoi Nisha Nair the girl from Jharkhand. Every one was given their moments to tell us why we should care about them. The other supporting cast of the assistant coach and the federation people did their job well. Of course I had gone in expecting to see SRK in a hot new incarnation. What I saw was a man who was a coach a haunted man with agony in his eyes a fire in his belly and a desire to redeem himself at all costs. After about the first 10 minutes I did not even care that Mr. Khan was looking the best he has done in years  he was coach Kabir Khan the tarter the disciplinarian the psychologist the motivator and above all the man who was in for the long haul and was going to make a miracle happen.Shimit's direction was superb Jaideep Sahni wrote a stirring tale and together with the actors they made sure that this was not just another sports Cinderella story. This was a tale about the empowerment of women and showcased their ability to triumph in the face of innumerable hurdles both in the home and outside. Chak De!!".

	onyx:emotionText "Yes I went to see the film because I saw Shahrukh looking super good in the promos what can I say  I am a shallow person!. But what kept me glued to the seat with my eyes fixed on the screen was a motley crew of ordinary girls with extraordinary attitude. AND I like hockey wish the glory days were back.Chak de India is an out and out sports film there is a disgraced coach there is a team that is fragmented and needs team spirit and there are matches to be won and glory to reap. The film follows a rather linear path and does not dish out any surprises except one  it is unpredictably wonderful! My football and basketball fanatic little nephew was shouting goal at every score and the audience was as mesmerized at this tournament being played out on celluloid as they would have been at the live event. There were cheers and claps at every win. Why? Because this team was real we watched them turn into a team and we yearned for their day in the lights as much as they did. Of course it was a Cinderella story  but what made the story poignant was the fact that all this happened for real that there was indeed an extraordinary player who was disgraced and redeemed himself in exactly this fashion. The script was taut the editing was superb there were no unnecessary moments in the film. There were no cringe inducing dialogs no useless song and dance routines no romance backdrop of the coach falling for the star a la Bend it Like Beckham. The music was uplifting and extremely well integrated into the narrative  Kuch Kariye was inspirational Maula mere haunting Badal Pe Paon a most exuberant transition from stuck in the back waters to out in the happening place of the World Cup! The girls were superbly cast  they represented the true face of India with all its diversity and its problems that relate to this diversity. Their bickering their in fights quest for personal glory and how this slowly changed into a camaraderie was extremely well done. Komal Chautala Chitrashi Rawat was CUTE Bindiya Nayak Shilpa Shukla was awesome as the bad girl of the team Preeti Sabharwal Segarika Ghatge was hot Tanya Abrol was awesome as the Hockey Doongi Balbir Vidya Sharma Vidya Malvade was good as the conflicted housewife turned goaliecaptain but my personal favorite was SoiMoi Nisha Nair the girl from Jharkhand.

	schema:reviewBody "Chak De! India is a sports film made by Indians for Indians well not necessarily! and is one of the better films of 2007 so far. I was reluctant to see the movie because of hype and criticism but upon seeing it I have realised that this movie is fantastic  and nothing can take that away.Shah Rukh Khan  how can I describe this wonderful actor? His role was about undying love for the sport and undying love for your country  something inspirational beautiful and so universal. It is so easy to relate to his character heck the guy had been despised shunned and loathed by his whole country forced to leave his home hated by one and all. He should have been scarred for life! But no Chak De! India shows that with a little faith your whole life will come spinning back to you.It was clever to choose hockey being our national sport  even though majorly overshadowed by cricket  it worked wonders. There were also no songdance sequences in this movie something I thought interesting and expertly handled. It takes skill to take the song and dance out of a Hindi movie and still have it being a hit but Shimit Amin has handled this with great finesse. The hockey scenes were handled with such amazing expertise and knowhow it is close to Hollywood standards. Note I said close The real tone and plot of CDI is about proving that women are just as capable as men. However CDI is not a feminist film. There is talent brain beauty and practicality available in a woman she should not be taken for granted. And I am glad to say that after seeing this film she probably won't be! Shimit Amin has made an amazing film. I am very proud to call myself an Indian this movie is excellent. The ending is extremely predictable but it was handled very well  there is so much tension building up to it and each minute you clench your fists and lean forward in your chair waiting for that goal to be scored.My favourite part the 16 girls. Each one uniquely has their say in the movie though the few from further regions of India etc had lesser to do. Yet they all played their parts and added the one thing CDI needed  grace. The focus was mainly on a few girls for example Vidya Malvade Sagarika Ghatge. But I liked the way all the girls worked so well together  they became a real TEAM which is what CDI is all about. I also admired the way each girl in a way had her own personal storyline behind her which all added to the tension of winning the World Cup! My personal favourite would be the little one Chitrashi Rawat as Komal I thought she showed fabulous potential and her gutsy little performance had me grinning.So move over guys the girls are here!".

	schema:headline " Indian stereotypes  dozens of American sports movies  Chak De India";
	schema:reviewBody "Indian movies are exploring new grounds and the talent is surely getting noticed in the new corporate Bollywood world which is trying to implement the Hollywood studio system in this country. Director ShamitAb Tak 56 surely was the most talented from the Ram Gopal Verma lot and writer Jaideep Sahni also showed his intelligence in Khosla ka Ghosla hence this movie sure was going to be properly executed product. And with corporate Bollywood's best production company Yashraj studios behind them they were in good hands. But with the implementation of Hollywood style film making system we also implement the Hollywood clichs rather than the bollywood one.Chak De India has explored new grounds for Indian cinema that is of the full blooded contemporary sports movie which is completely new thing for Indian audiences so surprises for them were stored in abundance. With the present patriotic flavor added in full jingoism chakde surely was a good business and the creative team of the writer and director has taken its complete advantage. With a dash of many American sports movies for a start like ' miracle'  ' a league of their own' and ' remember the titans' to name a few the duo added a good mix of Indian stereotypes over the American stereotypes used in those movies. So in Indian version we have the Punjabi power girl a short stature foul mouthed village girl the arrogant senior players mix of Jharkhand village girls and northeast girls and my favorite for a bit sexed image a fair skinned financially stable Punjabi girl always looking hot for thirsty male eyes from Chandigarh university with a ignorant cricket star boyfriend to put into the mle. With them is the patriotic to the hilt coach Shahrukh 'Kabir khan'  who is the usual sports movie coach a 'baazigar'  'haar kar jitney wale ko baazigar kehte hai'  who has to give loads of morality speeches to the girls like in jerry McGuire. This mixture surely creates a highly charged up drama which is well directed by shamit along with the CGI generated atmospheric hockey matches. Shahrukh and the 'all girls gang' have also delivered well to suit the flow of the story. And just like Hollywood to give credibility to the contemporary storyline the writer has based the story on the real events of Indian women's hockey commonwealth gold winning triumph in 2002 whose coach was a explayer apparently a Muslim with a tarnished image due to a blundered goalkeeping performance against Pakistan twenty years ago which led to match fixing speculations against him. While this real story was used to market the film the storyline of the movie is completely different and has no apparent connections to the real issues affecting Indian hockey.With the studio generously deciding not to give much pressure to the patrons mind the movie ends up being a polished entertaining stereotyped product summed with jingoism aplenty with no room for real women's hockey players who have went into the dark quickly after their commonwealth triumph. Go enjoy.".
