Watch closely as each Vietnam veteran is recruited and introduced and learn. Then enjoy what you will of the characters and the actors who bring them to life.

The team includes memoryplagued Wilkes Fred Ward young hotshot Blaster Reb Brown STRIKE COMMANDO rough'ntumble Sailor Randal Tex Cobb THE DIRTY DOZEN DEADLY MISSION decent guy Johnson Harold Sylvester and aging Charts Tim Thomerson ZONE TROOPERS. Joining up at the last minute is new recruit Scott Patrick Swayze RED DAWNThe film is pretty wellpaced dedicating the first 30 minutes to the recruitment of the men. Each on establishes their unique character as Hackman recruits them. Some jump on immediately others don't want to return to Vietnam because of haunting memories but do the decent thing in the end. There are some pretty efficient training scenes and then it's off to Laos for the explosive finale.The high point of the film is the climactic POW rescue which involves a wellplanned raid on a huge prisoner compound. Complete with lots of gunfire explosions shouting and one especially good bridge destruction shot this tense scene will keep you on the edge of your seat. Instead of completely relying on guys getting shot for impact though there's also a few men who sacrifice themselves for their fellow soldiers  even though it's no longer their duty. There's plenty of comedy supplied by Tex Cobb as a slowwitted incredibly strong oaf who participates in some good sight gags. I also liked the part in which the men get their weapons confiscated so they must purchase a crate of dusty WWIIera weapons to use. The most powerful scene is when Hackman heads to recruit Fred Ward who is at first unwilling to go back to Vietnam. His wife looks and acts the part of a troubled veteran's spouse perfectly as she tells of how she had to live through hell as her husband suffered nightmares and the like. Ward makes an impact throughout as he sleeps outside rather than in the barracks with the men. Why? It turns out he was trapped inside an NVA tunnel in the dark. He felt two bodies and knifed them. It turned out they were a mother and child. And even after he realized it his men couldn't pull him out for hours because they were under fire. The way Reb Brown recounts the story made my jaw drop.Hackman also delivers the good. I forgot to mention that he is so passionate about the mission because his son is one of the POWs. The grief is evident on his face as he runs throughout the burning camp finding other POWs  but not his son  as time runs out. This film made me realize just how tough it was on families and comrades in arms to lose a son father or husand in action.Overall a solid welldirected excellently acted and plenty entertaining helping of action and drama.".

Hackman plays a retired army officer  a veteran of the Korean War  who desperately seeks closure on the matter of his son's disappearance in Vietnam.

He assembles a team of exVietnam vets trains them for a return to combat and heads off with them to Laos on a clandestine rescue mission. This film seems to have been the starting point for Chuck Norris's 1984 offering Missing In Action and Sylvester Stallone's 1985 hit Rambo First Blood Part II. However Uncommon Valor is much better than both of those overblown comicstrip follies. Although the action in this movie takes liberties with credibility the character development is at least quite decent and the mental impact of fighting and losing friends in a war is explored. The cast give good performances Swayze in particular still a relative unknown here gives the best performance of his career to this day. Ted Kotcheff directs well conveying disparate moods  angst humour horror excitement  very nicely in a variety of scenes. Uncommon Valor is hard to swallow in terms of believability but it is a wellmade wellacted and entertaining jungle rescue film.".

	schema:headline " The best underrated Vietnam flick and the best early work from my favorite young Patrick Swayze his best film";
	schema:reviewBody "Uncommon Valor 1983 is a underrated Vietnam war flick that I have grown up with it it is one of the best classic Vietnam films from Patrick Swayze alongside with Gene Hackman! I really love this film to death. I grew up watching this movie it was all time my favorite war film. This movie was made before Missing in Action and Rambo First Blood Part II was released. This film shows a great courage and heroism to US soldiers who served in Vietnam who were missing in action and were held captive in Vietnam camps. This movie is about a U.S. Marine officer who puts together a team of Vietnam vets who served in Vietnam and he try's to rescue his son who he believes is among those still held in Laos after the Vietnam War. Directed by Ted Kotcheff who previously directed First Blood 1982. I used to had this movie on VHS but I don't have it anymore and I can't get the Bluray because it is not released yet. This is my first number 1 Patrick Swayze movie he ever made. It is his best work from the 80's even tough he had a small role. I really had a blast and fun watching him in this movie playing a Marine Kevin Scott.Boy you just bought the whole can of whupass! Boy you usin' that oriental martial bullst on me's gonna get real expensive. Plot Ten years after his son went MIA in Vietnam U.S.Marine retired Colonel Jason Rhodes assembles a private rescue team to find Americans held in POW camps in Laos.What I love about this movie is you have a solid excellent cast Gene Hackman Patrick Swayze Fred Ward Reb Brown Randall Tex Cobb Harold Sylvester Tim Thomerson and Robert Stack. This is a fantastic war movie it has drama action and humor. This film has it all and it done so well with it is heart sleeve. I don't understand why this movie is so underrated and forgotten like no one mentions this movie today. This was Randall Tex Cobb's second film later he played another Vietnam vet in MacGyver 1985 Season 3 Episode 16 1987 I love the fight scene between Sailor Randall Tex Cobb and Kevin Scott Patrick Swayze Swayze using his martial arts on Sailor was epic fantastic. This is my favorite best scene in the film ever and I love Sailor's dialogue I absolutely love everything about this movie!You have a training sequences you have a real mission with a real Viet Congs. You have a beautiful music theme song from James Horner which I love it and I love the song Brothers in the Night by Ray Kennedy. This film was filmed and released in the year 1983 that year when I was born. This film is the first and the best 'Vietnam rescue mission' movie. I have the film in my top list for a long time. Sad that out of the cast the youngest Patrick Sawyze is the only one of the team who is dead in real life. Its a great movie good script well directed action and nicely rounded characters that live with you well after the movie is over.I really love Patrick Swayze who was US marine in this movie and he was kicked out of the unit for striking a radio operator who fall a sleep. I love Patrick's character Kevin Scott I love Reb Brown in this movie as Blaster. But I love to death Randall Tex Cobb as Sailor I love this character to death! I love Fred Ward as Wilkes he was a Tunnel rat he doesn't like close spaces after the fight with Kevin and Sailor we found Kevin's story why he want's to be In this mission it is because his father was shot down in Vietnam and he is missing in action. I love how Patrick kills one of the Viet Congs he saves on the end Charts Tim Thomerson. He cared about Sailor when he was killed.In this movie we also have Kwan Hi Lim from Magnum P.I. who played Lieutenant Yoshi Tanaka the actor is also dead from this movie who sadly passed away in 2008. This movie has beautiful acting it is more smarter Vietnam war film. I think it is very underrated and unappreciated.Again it is my favorite fourth Vietnam film the first three will always be Platoon Full Metal Jacket and we Were Soldiers. Uncommon Valor is my fourth favorite Vietnam War film. R.I.P.  Patrick Swayze 1952  2009 I really miss you so much and I wish you could do more bad ass action movies I am your biggest fan and so was my mom we all miss you and we all love you I love you to death! Uncommon Valor why doesn't THAT film get the cultappreciationnotice of this POS Steel Dawn underrated Road House and Black Dog are my top 4 favorite Patrick Swayze movies he ever did! This movie get's 10 out 10 the best underrated Vietnam movie ever made! Uncommon Valor is a 1983 war film written by Joe Gayton and directed by Ted Kotcheff about a U.S. Marine officer who puts together a team to try to rescue his son who he believes is among those still held in Laos after the Vietnam War.1010 Score Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio Paramount Pictures Starring Gene Hackman Patrick Swayze Fred Ward Reb Brown Randall Tex Cobb Harold Sylvester Tim Thomerson Robert Stack Kwan Hi Lim Lau Nga Lai Director Ted Kotcheff Producers David Brown Michael Tolkin Nick Wechsler Buzz Feitshans John Milius Screenplay Joe Gayton Story by Wings Hauser Rated R Running Time 1 Hr. 45 Mins.

This is my first number 1 Patrick Swayze movie he ever made. It is his best work from the 80's even tough he had a small role. I really had a blast and fun watching him in this movie playing a Marine Kevin Scott.Boy you just bought the whole can of whupass! Boy you usin' that oriental martial bullst on me's gonna get real expensive. Plot Ten years after his son went MIA in Vietnam U.S.Marine retired Colonel Jason Rhodes assembles a private rescue team to find Americans held in POW camps in Laos.What I love about this movie is you have a solid excellent cast Gene Hackman Patrick Swayze Fred Ward Reb Brown Randall Tex Cobb Harold Sylvester Tim Thomerson and Robert Stack. This is a fantastic war movie it has drama action and humor. This film has it all and it done so well with it is heart sleeve. I don't understand why this movie is so underrated and forgotten like no one mentions this movie today. This was Randall Tex Cobb's second film later he played another Vietnam vet in MacGyver 1985 Season 3 Episode 16 1987 I love the fight scene between Sailor Randall Tex Cobb and Kevin Scott Patrick Swayze Swayze using his martial arts on Sailor was epic fantastic. This is my favorite best scene in the film ever and I love Sailor's dialogue I absolutely love everything about this movie!You have a training sequences you have a real mission with a real Viet Congs. You have a beautiful music theme song from James Horner which I love it and I love the song Brothers in the Night by Ray Kennedy. This film was filmed and released in the year 1983 that year when I was born. This film is the first and the best 'Vietnam rescue mission' movie. I have the film in my top list for a long time. Sad that out of the cast the youngest Patrick Sawyze is the only one of the team who is dead in real life. Its a great movie good script well directed action and nicely rounded characters that live with you well after the movie is over.I really love Patrick Swayze who was US marine in this movie and he was kicked out of the unit for striking a radio operator who fall a sleep. I love Patrick's character Kevin Scott I love Reb Brown in this movie as Blaster. But I love to death Randall Tex Cobb as Sailor I love this character to death! I love Fred Ward as Wilkes he was a Tunnel rat he doesn't like close spaces after the fight with Kevin and Sailor we found Kevin's story why he want's to be In this mission it is because his father was shot down in Vietnam and he is missing in action. I love how Patrick kills one of the Viet Congs he saves on the end Charts Tim Thomerson. He cared about Sailor when he was killed.In this movie we also have Kwan Hi Lim from Magnum P.I. who played Lieutenant Yoshi Tanaka the actor is also dead from this movie who sadly passed away in 2008. This movie has beautiful acting it is more smarter Vietnam war film. I think it is very underrated and unappreciated.Again it is my favorite fourth Vietnam film the first three will always be Platoon Full Metal Jacket and we Were Soldiers. Uncommon Valor is my fourth favorite Vietnam War film. R.I.P.  Patrick Swayze 1952  2009 I really miss you so much and I wish you could do more bad ass action movies I am your biggest fan and so was my mom we all miss you and we all love you I love you to death! Uncommon Valor why doesn't THAT film get the cultappreciationnotice of this POS Steel Dawn underrated Road House and Black Dog are my top 4 favorite Patrick Swayze movies he ever did! This movie get's 10 out 10 the best underrated Vietnam movie ever made! Uncommon Valor is a 1983 war film written by Joe Gayton and directed by Ted Kotcheff about a U.S. Marine officer who puts together a team to try to rescue his son who he believes is among those still held in Laos after the Vietnam War.1010 Score Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio Paramount Pictures Starring Gene Hackman Patrick Swayze Fred Ward Reb Brown Randall Tex Cobb Harold Sylvester Tim Thomerson Robert Stack Kwan Hi Lim Lau Nga Lai Director Ted Kotcheff Producers David Brown Michael Tolkin Nick Wechsler Buzz Feitshans John Milius Screenplay Joe Gayton Story by Wings Hauser Rated R Running Time 1 Hr. 45 Mins.

Even to the point of the senator not wanting to see that old MIA colonel again. From what I have read on the issue over the last 20 years the film to me at least hits it right on the nail. And who can forget French restaurant owner with his parrot. The directors made it look to seem that he has been around since the French were in Vietnam and who managed to crave a little business for himself gun dealing. And the introduction! Awesome! Awesome! Marines under fire dashing across the field being pursued by NVA as choppers hover overhead all in slow motion with haunting music. It's a great movie.None of that nonsense like what was featured in Missing in Action and Rambo II now those are bad comedies. They are just an example of a good story that's mishandled to turn into complete garbage.My thanks to all who were involved in the research and making of the film.

A group of Vietnam vets are drafted to go on a nearsuicide mission and to rescue one of their own left behind and taken prisoner by the Vietnamese . Uncommon valor is an entertaining film with Gene Hackman who aware his son can still be alive and decides to go in after him . As Hackman is a tough officer along with the ordinary and troublesome team of unadapted exsoldiers of Vietnam . The retired military man himself training a group of rebel and misfit soldiers for a dangerous assault on Laos. In the hands of hardboiled director Ted Kotcheff and a toughasleather cast headed by Hackman  that's all the plot that's needed to make one riproaring wartime flick . Supported by a rich businessman Robert Stack  whose son was also a POW the bunch engages in a perilous and violent adventure attempting to rescue the POWs and at the same time redirect their lives . Hackman's mission is twofold and in violent style  first turn his soldiers into a hard fighting unit and later on they go to invade Laos in search of prisoners  still Missing in Action . The unit formed by diverse characters include a cocky hunk as Reb Brown  Harold Sylvester as a chronic malcontent  Randal Tex Cobb as a readytoblow nutty  Fred Ward as a lamebrained soldier  Tim Thomerson as old veteran and a beginner Patrick Swayze . The first half of the film allows the colorful cast of character actors to have their fun as they get their tails whipped into shape and develop shaky relationship with their leader . The final part is all action as the commando wreck havoc and then run for their lives. The relentless assignment is set against strong training risked adventures and hazardous feats . The dangerous mission includes a twofisted group formed by a motley and diverse squadron played by allstar cast of the 80s . This is a rugged actioner concerning about an experienced officer  Col. Rhodes  he undertakes training the valiant unit of soldiers that get a chance to redeem themselves . At the end they must participate in the suicidal mission behind the enemy lines  to wipe enemies and rescue prisoners by means of a violent assault over a strongly protected camp.Gene Hackman as Colonel Rhodes who gathers a motley crew assumes the character of the leader in this thrilling war movie stunningly directed by Ted Kotcheff  being well scripted by Joe Gayton and uncredited by also actor Wing Hauser. This is a routine Actioner with prestigious star Gene Hackman as the Vietnam veteran resulting to be one of the best roles he'd made in the 80s  as he's fine as tough  cold  obstinate Colonel . This formula actionwarthriller packs frantic movement  perilous adventures  relentless feats  and buckloads of explosive action and violence . The noisy action is uniformly wellmade especially deserving of mention the riproaring final scenes on the concentration camp  including some spectacular shootouts and bombing . Apart from the values of team spirit  cudgeled by Gene Hackman into his rebel group  the film is full of feats  suspense  and thrills . Rough Hackman is good as leader of the motley pack together to thwart enemy camp  as well as the largely secondary cast with special mention to Randall Tex Cobb and Patrick Swayze . Atmospheric and exciting musical score by James Horner and appropriate cinematography filmed by cameraman Stephen Burum in several locations from Bangkok Thailand  Hanalei Kaua'i Hawaii USA Vietnam rice paddyIndian Dunes California USA Texas training camp Lumahai Valley Kaua'i Hawaii USA Laotian POW camp. This is is a wartime typical vehicle and into the  Vietnam war genre and regarding rescue commandos which also belong  Rambo II  and Colonel Braddock trilogy with Chuck Norris  all of them dealing with relentless soldiers attempting to free some American people still held prisoners in a far prison camp into Vietnam . Although the movie has some aspects a little tough to take  this moving film still has its fine moments getting an adequate atmosphere with agreeable results  furthermore grossed lot of money at the box office .".

	schema:reviewBody "Gene Hackman is a former Marine Corps colonel who musters a handful of private Vietnam vets to go back to Laos and rescue some Americans who have been listed as missing in action. Hackman suspects that in actuality the halfdozen or so MIAs are secretly being held in a remote camp by Laotians to be tormented and to provide more hard labor. Hackman is being paid by the wealthy Robert Stack whose son like Hackman's son is thought to be among the MIAs. But the circumstances are such that Hackman can only manage to buy old and outdated weapons though he manages to pick up the help of a fervid anticommunist Loatian and his two daughters along the way.I don't think the movie was deliberately concocted to endorse the myth of the Vietnames still holding our MIAs for propaganda purposes. The myth was real enough. If anyone remembers there were many bumper stickers in 1982 and 1983 BRING BACK THE MIAs. I think instead that the film was made partly in order to cash in on the myth. It was absurd on the face of it. Why would our former enemy refuse to return MIAs? Propaganda? Where is the propaganda value in something that's kept secret? To add the labor supply? They need a hundred extra laborers in Vietnam and Laos? The motives behind this movie  with its triumphant music and high body count  were scurrilous.But how about the movie itself? Stripped of its theme of rescuing mythical mistreated MIAs it's a routine paramilitary actioner no better and no worse than dozens of others that appeared in the 1980s. Gene Hackman's performance is the only one that manages to keep its head above water. He's just about always reliable.Of the others this being a formulaic plot derived from The Dirty Dozen among others I kept trying to guess which of the gang would sacrifice themselves for the mission. Of the three anticommunist Asians I figured one or more were dead meat. That's why Asian helpers appear in movies like this. I was right two times out of three. I also figured Patrick Swayzie as the rookie exofficer the youngest of the group who'd never earned the respect of the others because he'd never seen combat would also have to go in some heroic mode. Wrong. He becomes a hero true but survives intact. I thought there was a fiftyfifty chance that Hackman would have to go too but he makes it out okay. The formula doesn't really stretch for originality either. Charles Bronson's claustrophobic POW escapee from The Great Escape is here in Fred Ward's ex tunnel rat a claustrophobe who is forced to crawl through a drainage pipe with a snake inside it so that he can do a recon on the Laotian POW camp.The title Uncommon Valor is from a tribute that Admiral Nimitz made to the men on Iwo Jima  Uncommon valor was common that day. Nimitz was certainly right about that. Whether or not the men who fought in Vietnam were all equally valorous is remote from the point. Anyone who saw combat or even came near it putting their lives on the line for the guys in the line next to them were heroic enough. This movie and the way it exploits our bitterness about the Vietnam war doesn't really do them justice.".

Wrong. He becomes a hero true but survives intact. I thought there was a fiftyfifty chance that Hackman would have to go too but he makes it out okay. The formula doesn't really stretch for originality either. Charles Bronson's claustrophobic POW escapee from The Great Escape is here in Fred Ward's ex tunnel rat a claustrophobe who is forced to crawl through a drainage pipe with a snake inside it so that he can do a recon on the Laotian POW camp.The title Uncommon Valor is from a tribute that Admiral Nimitz made to the men on Iwo Jima  Uncommon valor was common that day. Nimitz was certainly right about that. Whether or not the men who fought in Vietnam were all equally valorous is remote from the point. Anyone who saw combat or even came near it putting their lives on the line for the guys in the line next to them were heroic enough. This movie and the way it exploits our bitterness about the Vietnam war doesn't really do them justice.";

Even though this film was fictitious this sort of thing happened many times some stories have been told more often then others etc.The idea is definitely plausible. Young guys just barely out of High School join The Army and get shipped off to Vietnam only to get captured and then shipped off to prison camps. This couldn't have possibly been cast any better. The late and great Robert Stack R.I.P. and Gene Hackman were particularly well suited for their roles. Randall Tex Cobb is fun to watch for the entire time he's on camera and spoiler alert it's especially sad when he dies.The training scenes were extremely well thought out and executed. The mockup prison camp in Texas and the morning wake up rituals that Gene Hackman puts them through are fun to watch. The fight scene between Tex Cobb and Patrick Swayze is definitely worth a few laughs.Two thumbs up definitely worth watching a few times.".

He plays Colonel Rhodes a career military man as his only son is a POW in Vietnam. Despite the government and everybody else saying to him that he needs to give up. Still any and all hindrances won't deter him. As he rounds up a group of men from his son's team in the Vietnam War. That have gone onto other things meaning other jobs in hopes of saving his son and others left by the war as POWs. And with financial backing from a billionaire played by Robert Stack also having a son that is a POW. As the camp is built like a POW camp in order to prepare them for the worse. There they meet young rookie Marine reject Patrick Swayze. The first part deals with their training as the other five vets that aren't sure about Swayze and after not taking lightly being bossed by a rookie young Marine. They mutiny and Sailor who steals the movie played brilliantly by Randall Tex Cobb teaches the rookie a lesson in a fistfight. As it is revealed by Rhodes he has a father that's MIA shot down in Vietnam. There the young Marine is taken in by the vets and also learns to work as a team member rather than a leader. He learns that he needed to be a team member not a team leader all along. Second despite a few obstacles and more government bureaucracy Hackman's character and the now organized six men won't stop until they rescue the POWs. Won't give away how they do it or the end but it is pretty bittersweet. But all in all it goes to show us that we shouldn't leave out the POWs. Don't know why Cobb could had been a bigger name and given bigger roles after this. I admit the Swayze character was kind of jerk but then mellowed out a bit.

Its also extremely dumb in places where Hackmans character manages to get some acid head biker out of prison just like that or where characters survive spectacular copter crashes I gave UNCOMMON VALOR five out of ten and if it wasnt for the moving opening ten minutes it would probably have got a lot less".

When the government tries to stop them their weapons are confiscated. So they have to find other weapons......Hilarious from beginning to end for all the wrong reasons Uncommon Valor beat Rambo 2 by nearly two years for being one of the most overblown pieces of propaganda bigging up the vets in the eighties.The first act and a half are pure filler Hackman getting angry sad and other emotions before recruiting his rag tag team of people with wonderful names.But the real reason to watch this is because the moment we see the most fake looking bones ever committed to celluloidthe film goes bonkers and it's really worth seeing for the last half an hour.It might have been myself but it appears that Hackman spouts only one line from this part of the film Swayze gets really I mean really emotional when he kills someone or sees someone die the camera literally stays on him for the best part of ten seconds each time to show his sadness.But when Tim Thomerson survives a helicopter explosion he loses it runs really fast to the river and stops.Randall 'Tex' Cobb is the comedy value here and when he realises it he uses his necklace to help his friends.No prizes for guessing how a character called Blaster buys it and all the POW's look like Klaus Kinski.It's not a bad film by any means it's just daft propaganda telling the USA that it was okay that we didn't win because Gene Hackman can still get out there and kick butt.".

So they have to find other weapons......Hilarious from beginning to end for all the wrong reasons Uncommon Valor beat Rambo 2 by nearly two years for being one of the most overblown pieces of propaganda bigging up the vets in the eighties.The first act and a half are pure filler Hackman getting angry sad and other emotions before recruiting his rag tag team of people with wonderful names.But the real reason to watch this is because the moment we see the most fake looking bones ever committed to celluloidthe film goes bonkers and it's really worth seeing for the last half an hour.It might have been myself but it appears that Hackman spouts only one line from this part of the film Swayze gets really I mean really emotional when he kills someone or sees someone die the camera literally stays on him for the best part of ten seconds each time to show his sadness.But when Tim Thomerson survives a helicopter explosion he loses it runs really fast to the river and stops.Randall 'Tex' Cobb is the comedy value here and when he realises it he uses his necklace to help his friends.No prizes for guessing how a character called Blaster buys it and all the POW's look like Klaus Kinski.It's not a bad film by any means it's just daft propaganda telling the USA that it was okay that we didn't win because Gene Hackman can still get out there and kick butt.";

The Skeleton of Mrs. Morales is an interesting tale because it's one of the few older films I've seen that would seem to endorse murder! Like the wonderful Hollywood film The Suspect with Charles Laughton the story is about a nice man who is married to a truly horrible woman. However Mrs. Morales is unusual in her awfulness because she is twofaced. To her many friends in the local church and her extended family she is a virtual saint who is forced to live with a terrible husband who drinks too much abuses her and is irreverent. However this is all part of Mrs. Morales' sick personality disorder. He is actually a very good husband and tries to love her but she is both frigid and very cruel towards himand being married to her is impossible. She wants others to think she's a martyr for staying with such a monster and he just wants a wife who will love him and so he puts up with a lot during their long and very unhappy marriage. All the while most audience members are hoping that Dr. Morales will either leave this woman or kill her. I was rooting for him to kill herespecially after she smashes the camera he saved up to buy for two years and then convinced her friends that HE beat her! What's next? Well the word 'skeleton' is in the title...so you might be able to guess SOME of what will happen. However like all wonderful dark comedies guessing exactly what will happen is just about impossible! And it features a wonderful twist ending that made me smile.The bottom line is that while most people are much more likely to watch a recent Hollywood movie there are wonderful films waiting to be discovered from all over the world. And in the case of The Skeleton of Mrs. Morales you don't have to travel that far from Hollywood to find a classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although there is no doubt that El esqueleto de la seora Morales is a cult film it caused no big impression in 1960. The style was too conventional but there is a playful fluctuation between extremes that moves the story and makes the film an attractive enjoyable and enduring production. It is above anything else the work of Spanish scriptwriter Luis Alcoriza who wrote without his usual collaborators his Austrian wife Janet Riesenfeld or Spanish Luis Buuel in a more direct relation with Mexicanity in contrast to Buuel who favored everything French although a few of his best works were about the Mexican cultural being from Alcoriza's scripts as Los olvidados and l. However there is nothing in Alcoriza's filmography as The Skeleton of Mrs. Morales. The source is an attractive tale told in first person by Welsh author Arthur Machen who introduced the search of the Holy Grail in contemporary British literature and influenced the works of Lovecraft and other authors of the macabre. The Islington Mystery 1927 is not a horror tale. It is a direct narration about imperfect crimes a duel between certainty and probability with a few characters in which the protagonist Harold Boale does get away with murder as he sails to the New World and finds a young Swedish wife after killing his detestable wife a Mrs. Boale who is hardly alive for more than two sentences giving way to her sister as the leading feminine character Mary Aspinall a nurse who is suspicious of the reasons Harold gives to explain why his wife is missing. There is also a medicine student in the plot who buys a skeleton with a deformed leg and presents it as evidence to the police which leads to Boale's trial the part of the tale I enjoyed the most led by a brilliant defense attorney. In Alcoriza's adaptation more sardonic and moralizing than Machen's tale Pablo Morales Arturo de Crdova exhibits his wife's skeleton in his shop window goes through a similar trial as Boale but has a different ending. The atmosphere of I World War which in Machen's tale distracts from clumsy crimes and unresolved disappearances is turned into the fears of Mexican middle class and the repression of the Catholic church. Morales enjoys a few little pleasures in life a photographic camera occasional talks with his friends at the local bar and first of all his work as taxidermist. His wife a good looking woman with a deformed leg and lameness is his enemy rejects his sexual advances and is allied to the local priest. Morales tries to deal with his sexual urges because as a rare bird inside the Catholic universe and unfortunately for him he is faithful. In spite of his skillful tasks and a few defensible titles especially comedies the filmography of director Rogelio A. Gonzlez has nothing comparable to El esqueleto de la seora Morales. On the other hand the film triggered Alcoriza's career perhaps because he could have made a better job. The following year he directed his first film followed by remarkable titles as Tlayucn Tiburoneros and Tarahumara.".

The source is an attractive tale told in first person by Welsh author Arthur Machen who introduced the search of the Holy Grail in contemporary British literature and influenced the works of Lovecraft and other authors of the macabre. The Islington Mystery 1927 is not a horror tale. It is a direct narration about imperfect crimes a duel between certainty and probability with a few characters in which the protagonist Harold Boale does get away with murder as he sails to the New World and finds a young Swedish wife after killing his detestable wife a Mrs. Boale who is hardly alive for more than two sentences giving way to her sister as the leading feminine character Mary Aspinall a nurse who is suspicious of the reasons Harold gives to explain why his wife is missing. There is also a medicine student in the plot who buys a skeleton with a deformed leg and presents it as evidence to the police which leads to Boale's trial the part of the tale I enjoyed the most led by a brilliant defense attorney. In Alcoriza's adaptation more sardonic and moralizing than Machen's tale Pablo Morales Arturo de Crdova exhibits his wife's skeleton in his shop window goes through a similar trial as Boale but has a different ending. The atmosphere of I World War which in Machen's tale distracts from clumsy crimes and unresolved disappearances is turned into the fears of Mexican middle class and the repression of the Catholic church. Morales enjoys a few little pleasures in life a photographic camera occasional talks with his friends at the local bar and first of all his work as taxidermist. His wife a good looking woman with a deformed leg and lameness is his enemy rejects his sexual advances and is allied to the local priest. Morales tries to deal with his sexual urges because as a rare bird inside the Catholic universe and unfortunately for him he is faithful. In spite of his skillful tasks and a few defensible titles especially comedies the filmography of director Rogelio A. Gonzlez has nothing comparable to El esqueleto de la seora Morales. On the other hand the film triggered Alcoriza's career perhaps because he could have made a better job. The following year he directed his first film followed by remarkable titles as Tlayucn Tiburoneros and Tarahumara.";

Wenders tries his best to convince us that the designer is a great Artist by covering the creative process the little changes in the cut of the cloth to achieve what is the perfect shirt or dress. The closeknit coterie of disciples eager to translate the Artist's vision to the cloth. It's almost convincing but the film fails to persuade me that fashion industry is anything more than superficial. By implying that fashion design is potentially as profound and mysterious as other arguably more 'worthy' artforms such as cinema the documentary teeters on pretension.However the film is certainly worth watching. There are some interesting meditations on the nature of cities and identity it's filmed in both Tokyo and Paris. It's most impressive aspect is the exploration of digital video technology quite appropriate given the documentary subject matter. When filmed 1989 this would have been cutting edge and it's likely that Wenders experiments here benefited subsequent films most notably the dream sequences in Until The End of the World. The pixelated texture and more lurid colour palette of video contrast nicely with the celluloid sequences and there are some effective albeit now primitive sequences with talkingheads video playback against celluloid footage in the background. The overall effect is meditative and otherworldly.In summary a flawed dated but still interesting film.".

	schema:reviewBody "What distinguishes stage from screen?  If a viewer had only Brian Friel's play Dancing at Lughnasa' and its cinematic adaptation to judge from he or she might be tempted to answer that while stage is highly engaging and meaningful screen is superficial insulting and thin in content.  Friel's play is structured in such a way that a film version necessarily provides a fascinating comparison of the two mediums.   However director Pat O'Connor's efforts tend to demonstrate the weaknesses of cinema rather than the strengths.  Adapting a play to the screen has often proved to be a tricky business it involves some pitfalls which this film does not manage to avoid.Screen is extremely literal.  It allows forin fact often demands a sense of realism seldom conveyed on stage.  The makers of Dancing at Lughnasa' are clearly appreciative of this fact and have made valiant if not always successful allowances for it.  The primary result of their efforts is a heightened sense of setting.  The world these characters inhabit feels real.  We get shot after shot of Irish countryside set and costume design seem perfect for Ireland in the 1930s.  Mark Geraghty's production design is one of the best things about this film.  Additionally excellent accent work by all the actors proves perfectly convincing and adds depth to the setting.However such a literal medium has its drawbacks.  In particular young Michael's narration which was used to achieve a specific effect in the play seems unnecessary here.  The play's Michael is fullgrown and speaks young Michael's lines as his memories' take place in the action on stage. The film makers did well to recognize that there was no cinematic equivalent for this having the adult narrator speak the child's lines would have seemed ridiculous.  However in removing that aspect of the narrator's role they stripped away most of his significance as well.  The film's narrator seems like an afterthought occasionally intruding into the action to tell us that what we are seeing is a memory.  We could easily forget that the events are in fact happening in flashback.While some of the abstract elements of Friel's original play do not translate well onto the screen individual performances are only aided by the medium.  Since film is not hindered by the simple vocal requirements of stage the actors are able to convey much more subtlety of meaning.  The players in this film version are without exception excellent.  Meryl Streep stands out as the proper reserved Kate.  Her manner is nervous and slightly shrill but conveys genuine concern for her sisters.  When Kate opens up and allows herself to dance Streep shows a joyful abandon which is believable and pleasant to see.  Another standout performance is delivered by Michael Gambon in the role of Father Jack.  His lines are spoken with calm assurance betraying Jack's senility only by their complete lack of relevance.  Gambon's distant eyes and quiet detachment reinforce the feeling that he exists in a world entirely different from the rest of the family a point which is absolutely crucial to his character.  Supporting characters are also portrayed deadon.  This film has some of the best acting that could have been hoped for.Despite these considerable advantages the movie runs into trouble when it tries to adapt Friel's plot to the screen.  Film is so much more visual than theater that it demands a great deal of variation in order to keep the viewer interested.  Since we do not have the benefit of the actors' physical presence we need other things to hold our attention.  In attempting to add variety to the play's structure screenwriter Frank McGuinness breaks up Friel's original dialogue into smaller scenes most of which involve household chores.  McGuinness also tries to represent some events which the play's dialogue only alludes to.  The result is a film which is so fragmented that we lose sight its content.  Friel's dialogue is integrally important to his play and the same is true for the film.  However the way that the film breaks up this dialogue among tiny scenes is extremely distracting.  We lose sight not only of the dialogue's meaning but of the relationships between characters.  Since the adapted structure requires that the five sisters rarely appear in the same scene together it is very difficult to get any sense of the dynamic in the household.  Ultimately so much time is spent with action rather than dialogue that the characters lose a great deal of their depth.  Perhaps film makers did not trust their audience to be as interested in the characters as in the events.It is somewhat unjust to evaluate an adapted play simply in light of the original.  However this cinematic version fails to hold up even on its own terms.  It is difficult to conceive what value those who have not been exposed to the original play could see in this adaptation.  What we get is a goodlooking but ultimately insubstantial portrait of five women who could all stand to let their hair down a little bit more than they do.  I can't help but think that Friel had more in mind than demonstrating the value of letting one's hair down.".

	onyx:emotionText "What distinguishes stage from screen?  If a viewer had only Brian Friel's play Dancing at Lughnasa' and its cinematic adaptation to judge from he or she might be tempted to answer that while stage is highly engaging and meaningful screen is superficial insulting and thin in content.  Friel's play is structured in such a way that a film version necessarily provides a fascinating comparison of the two mediums.   However director Pat O'Connor's efforts tend to demonstrate the weaknesses of cinema rather than the strengths.  Adapting a play to the screen has often proved to be a tricky business it involves some pitfalls which this film does not manage to avoid.Screen is extremely literal.  It allows forin fact often demands a sense of realism seldom conveyed on stage.  The makers of Dancing at Lughnasa' are clearly appreciative of this fact and have made valiant if not always successful allowances for it.  The primary result of their efforts is a heightened sense of setting.  The world these characters inhabit feels real.  We get shot after shot of Irish countryside set and costume design seem perfect for Ireland in the 1930s.  Mark Geraghty's production design is one of the best things about this film.  Additionally excellent accent work by all the actors proves perfectly convincing and adds depth to the setting.However such a literal medium has its drawbacks.  In particular young Michael's narration which was used to achieve a specific effect in the play seems unnecessary here.

	schema:reviewBody "Given the luxury of owning films via DVD collections offers the opportunity to revisit at will the works the viewer found worthy of purchase. Such is the case with the luminous 'Dancing at Lughnasa' a 1998 release by director Pat O'Connor to the tunes of a lilting screenplay by Frank McGuinness based on Brian Friel's 1990 play of the same name. Though low key and not a popular hit at the box office this is one of those rare films that combines a very simple tale about common folks brought to life by a cast of extraordinary actors.The story is set in Donnegal Ireland in 1936 just before WW IIchoked the world and simply relates the life of a family of five single sisters and the love child of one of them. The action is spare centering on the visit of their brother home from the missionary work in Uganda inalterably changed from the experience on the loss of job of the supporting eldest sister and the return of the errant father of the love child for the summer and other daily challenges. The stresses and strains these small events play on the sisters is eventually climaxed in the dancing festival that marks the Feast of Lughnasa a persistent pagan celebration that challenges the very Catholic foundation of the Irish community a compelling event that parallels the returned priest brother from the mission fields where he has gained insight into the desperate need for community happiness dancing and celebration as the essential needs of humankind.The cast is flawless Meryl Streep is superb as the elder sister bitterly bound to holding the family together at all costs Catherine McCormack as the mother of the lovechild Kathy Burke Sophie Thompson and Brid Brennan Michael Gambon as the deranged returned brother and Rhys Ifans as the errant father of the child. They interact and play like fine chamber music. The brilliantly green and gorgeous countryside is captured eloquently by Kenneth MacMillan. In every aspect of production the film fits like a tightly intertwined puzzle. It simply glows. Revisiting 'Dancing at Lughnasa' is an even finer trip than the first exposure. Highly Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watchable but instantly forgettable film of Brian Friel's awardwinning play which provides its greatest pleasures through the strong performances of its ensemble cast. Five independentminded sisters living in Donegal in the mid 1930s face the possibility of change when economic and emotional circumstances conspire against them. The return of their brother from religious missions in Africa signals the beginning and as the pagan festival of Lughnasa which celebrates the harvest and forebodes the coming of winter is celebrated around them they must come to terms with changes in their own relatively comfortable middle class world. The ten year old son of one of them views events with a nostalgic eye which nonetheless sees the hardship and heartbreak which occurs around him.Despite director Pat O'Connor's valiant attempts to open out' the play the film is still extremely theatrical. The inclusion of landscape shots and the restaging of certain scenes in outdoor locations unavailable in the theatre does not really make the film cinematic. It merely adds visuals to what is still a complex series of linguistic exchanges which delineate and explore character. Authentic production design and costuming and the persistent presence of a traditionalthemed score by Bill Whelan contribute to the feeling of the film and with the help of good accent work by the cast it manages to successfully evoke a feeling of time and place. However it remains an extremely well produced stage play on film and is still bound by blocking and staging conventions which allow the actors to meet and greet one another to exchange their thoughts and feelings. The closest the film comes to a visual symbolic system is the use of dance and ritual to underscore the social and emotional tensions. The undercurrent of paganism which defines the relationships between people and their sense of the cosmos is constantly evoked as it was in the play and the film begins with a credit sequence featuring images of African tribes people in traditional costumes. But other than the climactic dance scene where the sisters celebrate their sisterhood to the strains of ceili music the film rarely manages to escape the enclosed and cerebral world of the stage version.But paradoxically the reliance on actors plying their trade on well written words rather than visuals is the thing which saves the film from itself. Meryl Streep gives a convincing performance and manages a creditable accent as the repressed authoritarian schoolteacher who heads the female clan and she is more than matched by Michael Gambon's endearing performance as the slightly baffled priest whose exposure to the customs and rituals of Africa have coloured his perceptions of home. The rest of the cast the nonstars so to speak are equally good particularly Sophie Thompson as the simple minded Rose and Kathy Burke as the chain smoking Maggie. Catherine McCormack and Brid Brennan the latter a veteran of the Abbey Theatre production have less showy roles but work distinctive characterisations in with those of the others with ease and skill. Supporting male performances from Rhys Ifans and young Darrell Johnston are also good and the film also comes with a rich voice over provided by Gerard McSorley who played the part of the the child at an adult remembering in the stage version.This aspect of the film alone is probably worth the time and attention required to view it but on the whole it is a less rewarding experience than the play itself. While an unfair basis upon which to criticise a work of adaptation the material was perhaps fundamentally unsuited to cinematic treatment. Though Frank McGuinness has done his best to translate the themes and character issues and has successfully done so insofar as it applies to theme and character this is not so much a film version as a film of the play with some additional settings and scenes which prevent it from becoming completely unwatchable. What power it has comes from the power of the play and it is mostly evinced at the level of verbal discourse. Theatrical adaptation is a minefield for film makers and has produced varying results in the past. Dancing at Lughnasa does not distinguish itself in the annals of this subsection of film history but for those patient enough with its lack of genuine cinematic interest it offers certain pleasures which should pass the time painlessly enough.".

That doesn't take away from the story  what there is of it but it does speak to the lower technical quality of the film. The country shots do seem patched to the set scenes. I would like to have seen the stage play.The acting is quite good all around. No role was exceptional but all were very good. I've enjoyed reading the different comments of reviewers especially where some see the family as ordinary while others see it as exceptional. My take is that this is an ordinary family in the sense of relationships but a somewhat eccentric family in their circumstances. For instance all of the girls are unmarried and living together. And a much older brother priest returns from the missions to retire at home but with dementia setting in and some sort of mixed bag of spirituality that we can't quite grasp or figure out. Did he have a reverse conversion? Did he become pagan instead of converting Africans to Christianity? Whether in the movie in the original play or in both this point weakens the story. Unanswered questions like this distract the viewer. So we miss the flow of the movie which centers around the five sisters. Another nagging distraction is a question of the parents. What happened to them? How long have then been dead? What about them  they are never mentioned that I can recall. Kate Meryl Streep seems to be no older than 40 with the youngest girl Rose mot much older than 20. But Father Jack is clearly well over 60. If they all had the same parents their mother would have borne children for 40 years. Not impossible but certainly exceptional. At one point the narrator Michael Mundy grown makes a comment about this but it's another piece that leaves viewers with a question  and another distraction.Finally this is a family of girls who are very closeknit. They are different individuals and they have quarrels and disagreements. But we see nothing so deep that it would rend this family apart. They care deeply for one another. When they dance together spontaneously they share a common moment of joy and fun. The story ends on a sad note which is OK for a good movie or story. But in this case we don't know why Agnes and Rose just sneaked off together one night never more to be seen or heard from. There was no apparent rift or irreparable rending of the family. The grown Michael expresses the surprise of all the rest of them. Two sisters just flee a family circle of siblings they have been so close with all their lives? It's another question that leaves the film wanting.".

For instance anyone who has gone to see or was involved in the stage production of Rent will tell you that the movie pales in comparison. The same is true of Dancing At Lughnasa though the play is not nearly so wellknown.My fellow cast members and I were all collectively unimpressed with the movie and our initial response was What?. We were already wrapped up in the Dancing At Lughnasa play experience so perhaps it was different for us than it would be for someone unfamiliar with the play. We just were not drawn in by the movie.It was interesting to see one person's adaptation of the script and to see the play performed by ageappropriate cast members instead of high school students but over all it was ultimately forgettable. Meryl Streep excels as usual and the acting is alright for the most part though Michael Gambon is woefully miscast. However not even Meryl Streep can redeem this movie.The movie's downfall is that it lacks the warmth intimacy and heart of the play and I honestly did not like the movie at all for just that reason. The play is set solely in the Mundy household while the movie ventures into the town of Ballybeg up to Lough Anna and into the Back Hills in an effort to show us a more complete picture. Perhaps the filmmakers believed the audience would be bored or wearied by the little change in scenery and lots of description of outside events through dialog that the play features. However the changes disrupt the heartbeat of the story and cause it to appear disjointed and clunky and suddenly the center of the play which is the closeness of the five sisters is lost.The other major problem is that the play is a memory play. That is it takes place entirely within the memory of one character in this case the young man Michael. That sense of a young man looking back on one intense memorable summer is lost in the movie because instead of having the narrator Michael speak the lines for the boy Michael there is a young actor who plays the role of the boy. Because I was so familiar and involved with the stage script in which the boy Michael never appears in physical form and instead is spoken for by the young man Michael as he remembers I was disoriented by that great difference.Perhaps others who have never read or performed in the play of Dancing At Lughnasa would enjoy it much more than I did. However I cannot be objective about the film because I love the play so much. My opinion remains.I would highly recommend reading the script or better yet going to see a production of the play instead of watching the movie.The play is a masterpiece of theater.The film is merely mediocre by comparison.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Iraq the marine Sergeant Logan Zac Efron finds the photo of a young woman with the message Keep Safe X on the back in the debris of a construction and he keeps it in his pocket. His action saves his life from a mortar fire and he believes that the girl is his guard angel that protects him.When he returns to Colorado he has difficulties to adjust to the civilian life with his sister's family and he decides to seek out the woman. Logan researches the landscape and finds that the place is Hamden in Louisiana and he walks with his dog Zeus to Hamden. He discovers that the woman is Beth Green Taylor Schilling who is the owner of the Green Kennels with her grandmother Ellie Blythe Danner. When Logan meets Beth he is unable to tell the reason why he had traveled to Hamden. She assumes that he wants a job that she had advertised and Ellis gives the job to Logan. Soon Logan befriends Beth's son Ben Riley Thomas Stewart and becomes close to the family. But her former husband Sheriff Keith Clayton Jay R. Ferguson does not want to make Logan's life easy.The Lucky One is a sweet and dramatic romance with pleasant characters. The director Scott Hicks explores the beautiful landscapes with a wonderful cinematography. The plot is very simple and predictable but the chemistry among Zac Efron Taylor Schilling Blythe Danner and the boy Riley Thomas Stewart makes the film worth. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Um Homem de Sorte A Lucky Man".

For some reason they changed a lot of basic info. Like location. Why change the state? Any way the love making scenes were very good so if you are just going for the romance you won't be disappointed. I think that Zack played Logan well. He had a depth that I didn't expect as an actor even though he didn't have much to work with. It wasn't my favorite movie but it wasn't that bad either.

So if you are a past or present member of any branch of the US Armed Forces or if your loved one has paid the ultimate sacrifice with their life fighting for our freedom please accept my heartfelt thanks.I LOVED this movie. Everyone did an excellent job with their character  especially with Logan. So much feeling and emotion in his expression and actions even when no words were needed. I felt like I could see into his very soul. I saw a young man who still can hardly grasp the fact that he has survived 3 tours of war in the middle east when many of his comrades didn't come home. You can sense the depth of emotion and turmoil and can easily understand why it was often hard to just find words to express himself. You can see the military training and discipline the steel resolve to control his reactions even when harassed by the town bullyexhusband. There's also loyalty concern for others tenderness selflessness willingness to work hard  he's the man of every woman's dream! It's easy to see that Beth is a survivor of an extremely abusive marriage. Even though she's now divorced she's still not free from the abusive and controlling exhusband. She's very careful in how she responds or endures his abusive threats in order to keep him from going into a greater rage and I cheered for her when she finally found the courage to speak up and take control of her own destiny. Keith the exhusband is easy to despise for his hateful snarly manipulating character and yet in the end we saw a little glimpse of good in his soul as well a little glimpse of what he might have been if he'd only been willing to humble himself and get help much earlier. I loved the happy ending I loved the story and I very much appreciated that the producers kept it clean. I can't wait for the DVD  this is a keeper!!".

	schema:headline " Middle of the road romantic weepie fare";
	schema:reviewBody "As romantic dramas go The Lucky One is pretty thin stuff. It has a workable premise and everything but the movie can't think of anything to do with itself so it pads out its running time with one musical montage after another. You know a director has run out of ideas when he puts two different montages in about a span of two minutes apart from each other. The film is based on a book by Nicholas Sparks who has done much better and worse than this. This falls somewhere in the middle.Our hero is Logan a Marine fighting overseas as the film begins and played with wooden indifference by Zac Efron. There's nothing particularly interesting about Logan to begin with. He's handsome he's noble he works hard and that's about it when it comes to his personality. Despite this Efron could have shown a bit more life in his performance. After a particularly intense battle Logan spots a photo of a woman lying in the rubble of the battlefield. Lucky thing he found and walked over to that photo as moments later a bomb drops where he was standing just seconds ago killing his comrades. Logan finishes his tour but is obsessed with discovering who the woman in the picture is and who it belongs or belonged to. He returns home briefly to Colorado to live with family for a while but when he can't readjust to civilian life he packs his bags and with his faithful dog Zeus by his side decides to walk cross country to search out who the mysterious woman in the photo is.His travels take him all the way to North Carolina which is quite an amazing feat to walk all that distance. What's even more amazing is how Logan managed not to get dirty or even mess up or grow out his hair during those many long months of walking. He arrives at a farmhousedog kennel where it just so happens that the woman in the photo lives and works there. She's Beth Taylor Schilling who works at the kennel is a single mother to her sevenyearold son Ben Riley Thomas Stewart and shares the home with her mother Blythe Danner who gives the most interesting performance in the film. Logan means to tell Beth about the photo he found that day but he just can't bring himself to mention it. Part of this is because of Logan having issues with his own past as a soldier and part of this is for plot convenience so that the movie can drag out his secret as long as it can until it is dramatically appropriate. He takes a job at the kennel and becomes a natural taking care of the many dogs.He also starts building a bond with both Beth and her young son. She starts sharing her private hopes and dreams with him and little Ben starts taking him to the old tree house where he hangs out which is accessible only by crossing a rickety old bridge over a raging river. As soon as I saw that broken down old bridge I knew it would collapse at one point  most likely during the intense climax and during a storm. Sure enough as the climax approached those storm clouds started rolling in and all the central characters started heading for that bridge. Logan also gets to meet Beth's exhusband Keith Jay R. Ferguson who serves as the town Sheriff as well as the town bully. He's a one dimensional villain who exists solely to push Logan and Beth around and threaten to take Ben away from them. As a villain he couldn't be any less subtle if he was wearing a Tshirt at all times that had the words HI! I'M A SLIMEBALL! written on it.The Lucky One is pretty standard stuff as these kind of films go  The central romance between Logan and Beth is nice and all but the characters don't really have a lot of personality to go with their physical attractiveness. You get the feeling that these two don't have a lot to talk about when they're alone. The movie also has its share of corny romantic lines such as when Logan tells her You deserve to be kissed every hour every minute every second of every day or when he says Finding that picture of you on the battlefield was like finding an angel in Hell. Yes the movie is gooey in its sentimentality but it never offends. I also enjoyed Blythe Danner's performance. She seems to know what kind of a movie she's stuck in and has a little fun with it delivering some much needed sarcasm and wit in her performance. It's no wonder I found her the most interesting character she's the only one who gets to act like a real person.The movie was directed by Scott Hicks No Reservations who's done some films I've admired but seems to be cashing a paycheck here. I don't blame him for wanting to take it easy once in a while but I wish he had picked a more interesting script. I can't really picture The Lucky One being a very memorable romantic weepie but hey I said the same thing about The Vow so what do I know?".

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't read the source novel but I also hadn't read the Notebook either. And I really think the latter is one of the best romantic movies that are out there. Considering the novel at hand here the source so to speak comes from the same man as the Notebook you'd be forgiven to expect something similar.While I think Zac Efron might be underrated by many as an actor although he still has to prove himself he doesn't help his case in this one. Puppy eyes and a character that is thinner than a piece of paper do not bode him well. Although according to the female fans attending at the cinema they wouldn't want him any other way. Which brings me to the one point this movie really excels. It's the reactions you get from the crowd. Believe me if you didn't watch it at a cinema you lost quite an experience! It was a hoot. I wouldn't be surprised if they got the title wrong and refer to the female lead as the Lucky One. Just saying.Apart from those hilarious moments most of this is longing looks desires held back and other stuff that will either excite you or leave you cold. Predictable and boring to the point where even a sudden change of character why? towards the end of the movie does not help at all".

The Lucky One is quite different to other Sparks movies I found the storyline to be a lot more serious and mature than normal and the story being told from the male perspective is also a nice change.The acting from Zac Efron is top form as he gets older his roles get better and his acting improves with each movie Taylor Schilling is also nice if not being a little too old for Efron but she brings some niceness to the character and Blythe Danner is a bit of a scene stealer in her small role.Yes parts of this film are a little clich particularly towards the end but it's no biggie the lack of chemistry between the two leads is a bit annoying at first but soon it changes and gets better even though Taylor Schilling is nice in the role I do think that she is miscast I think Abbie Cornish may have suited the role a little more. But even still the few flaws that this movie does have doesn't distract from the overall niceness of the film.Zefron is all man now and he is definitely an actor to watch. Fans of the book will love it Zac fans will love it too generally a nice romance to enjoy with friends.".

	schema:reviewBody "When you walk into a Nicolas Sparks movie you expect certain things. The Lucky One follows a storyline similar to most of Nicolas Sparks' other adapted novels. This is neither a good nor a bad thing. So long as the movie can stand on its own feet it deserves recognition. On that ground The Lucky One does hold its own. The acting is great and the story held my interest. In the end specific problems make this movie much worse than it should have been.The main fallback of the story is the characters. Stereotypes are abound. The mayortobe is the same as any story that tries to cover a trappedinasmalltown feel. The father is an incredibly flat character that is in no way believable. Even Zac Efron's character is too mysterious for his own good. Although Efron pulled off the role quite well it was the way the character is presented that is the problem.The other problem with the film is its climax. I won't give it away but I have seen the same climax more than once. It was an unfortunate low point in a movie that was incredibly well acted. The rest of the storyline was quite unique and enjoyable. Even the modern setting of PTSD and soldiers who have served too many tours was a fascinating setting for the movie. Unfortunately the amateur screenwriter dropped the ball.I must point out an unfortunate fact of this movie. It's only 101 minutes. Since it is so short for a complex drama it drops the ball on many occasions. In the beginning of the film Zac Efron's character walks from Colorado to Missouri. This fact is almost addressed at one point but then dropped and never brought back. Things like this happen throughout the film. These holes could have been filled with 15 to 20 minutes more screen time. Unfortunately the push to keep films shorter made The Lucky One significantly worse.If you are a Nicolas Sparks fan this movie is worth seeing. If you enjoy romantic dramas I would recommend renting The Notebook A Walk to Remember or Dear John. If you don't like romantic dramas there is no reason for you to see this movie. Nicolas Sparks is one of the few authors who deliver consistently good plots. Unfortunately his last two films have fallen flat. Maybe it's time for him to stop using the same formula again and again.reillyreviews.wordpress.com".

In addition to not buying into the whole storyline this film moved incredibly slow. Long views of Zac walking or looking at her or of her thinking. Maybe if the acting had been better it might have been OK but Zac Efron had one look on his face the entire show.

	schema:reviewBody "Faithful readers will know that film adaptations of Nicholas Sparks novels aren't exactly my cup of tea. I enjoy a good romance as much as the next person but I've found his particular style to be predictable soppy and emotionally manipulative. With that in mind I find myself in the position of reviewing his newest adaptation The Lucky One. While hardly recommendable it is admittedly better than I thought it was going to be. It has all the reliable hallmarks of a Nicholas Sparks story  a Southern setting a sudden love between perfect strangers characters with troubled histories outside forces that threaten the blossoming relationship a sentimental conclusion  and yet it worked just a little harder at allowing me to see past its contrivances. It wasn't hard enough but progress is progress.It begins in Iraq where a U.S. marine named Logan Thibault Zac Efron is on his third tour of duty. The night after an ambush he spots something gleaming in a pile of rubble. It's a photo of a young woman. When it's determined that it belongs to none of the surviving soldiers Logan claims it as his own carrying it around with him for the next seven months. He has no idea who the woman is but it seems she's keeping him alive while others around him die. In a sudden flash we see him back at home in Colorado where it's clear he has a touch of PTSD. He reunites with his sister and nephews finds he can relate to none of them and decides to track down the woman in the photo so that he can thank her. A distinct lighthouse in the background is just enough for him to discover that she lives in Louisiana.And so with his dog by his side he journeys from one state to the other. The astounding thing is that he walks the entire way. At no point does the film make clear how long the journey takes and it never explains how he had the means to rest at night and feed both himself and his dog. Never mind his travelling is conveniently summed up with a few simple shots edited together in a brief montage. His destination in Louisiana is a familyrun dog kenneltraining school. It's here that he finally meets the woman in the photo. Her name is Beth Taylor Schilling a former fulltime elementary school teacher and a single mom. She lives with her grandmother Blythe Danner who despite having suffered a minor stroke can always be counted on to educate young people with her years of wisdom.Through a series of verbal misunderstandings Logan doesn't get the chance to tell Beth why he's really there. She believes he's responding to her want ad for help. She initially doesn't trust him and indeed how can you trust a man that walked all the way from Colorado to Louisiana? Her grandmother on the other hand is far more accommodating and hires him on the spot. He proves himself to be an incredibly diligent worker. Does he have an off button? Beth asks disapprovingly. I hope not her grandmother responds playfully. In due time Logan befriends Beth's son Ben Riley Thomas Stewart and makes an enemy out of Beth's exhusband a cop named Keith Jay R. Ferguson. Hotheaded jealous controlling and possessive Keith might as well have been named Rick with a silent P.I'm aware that movies like this exist primarily for entertainment so I won't bother pointing out how unlikely it is that Logan and Beth could fall in love under these particular set of circumstances  or at all for that matter. But inevitably they fall head over heels for each other. This is despite the fact Logan has yet to spill the beans about the photo which we eventually learn belonged to Beth's brother a marine who died a year earlier while serving in Iraq. Apart from the fact that the two were close growing up due to the untimely deaths of their parents what really tortures Beth is the fact that her brother might have died as the result of friendly fire. The investigation is ongoing. Is it possible that Logan knows what really happened?A few incidental subplots work their way into the story including Ben's reluctance to play the violin Keith's wealthy father running for mayor and Beth's grandmother being a part of a gospel choir. We also see Ben trying to please his father who's such a manly man that he actively discourages weak activities like music and birthday parties. I'll never understand how it is Ben can feel anything for his father at all but I guess that's just another one of those contrivances I'll have to tolerate. All leads to a rather mechanical yet somehow appropriate confrontation that involves a sudden rainstorm a raging river a rickety wooden bridge and a shaky tree house jutting perilously from a limb. Although The Lucky One is not edifying I recognize that it fills a need. Believe you me it will fill it nicely. Chris Pandolfi www.atatheaternearyou.net".

I feel like he had a blank stare full of no emotion throughout the movie. I feel someone with his circumstances would have emotion having lost people close to him having gone through a war... Emotion of pain or anger at least but I did not feel it and I have seen so many military movies where the soldiers were pleasant to watch because of their raw emotions makes for a really emotional wonderful movie experience.I also didn't sense the emotions of passion in the love scene between him and Beth I felt they showed the physical aspect of their love but didn't feel the emotions once again I just saw blank stares at one another. To show emotions I think is what distinguishes an OK actor from and amazing actor and I would not call Zac Efron's acting in this movie amazing. He also did not give off the tough guy feel even though he had a straight face the entire movie but I definitely think there is a difference between having a straight face and being tough. The supporting actors were good I really love Blythe Danner playing the role of Ellie she definitely pulls it off which is not surprising because most of her movie roles are very similar characters. Taylor Schilling as Beth was okay but the bad acting on Zac Efron's part and the lack of an interesting unpredictable plot made it hard for me to enjoy her part in the movie. Overall the movie was okay I will not watch it again. It will most likely only be liked by the younger population rather than older under 18 Oh and I am 21 by the way. X Peace X".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly good romantic drama";
	schema:reviewBody "I normally do not like sappy romantic movies. I typically don't really enjoy Nicholas Sparks movies in particular with one or two exceptions. Guess I'll have to add another exception now. While there was nothing particularly groundbreaking about this movie and there were a few clichs I spent the first 10 minutes counting every time a character was portrayed backlit by the sun. I lost count! I ended up being surprised with the subtlety of the story telling. Every time I expected for instance the smalltown cop abusive ex to arrest Logan for a trumped up charge beat him when everyone was looking and then deny it beat up his exwife when she defiedchallenged him or any number of movie tropes the story took a more subtle route. He is portrayed as the bad guy so to speak but not in a onedimensional manner. And every time I expected the love interests to rip each other's clothes off at the first opportunity fall head over heels for each other in a melodramatic saccharine fashion and overexplain every scene at every given opportunity they surprisingly didn't. Instead the love interests are portrayed as gradually falling for each other over a period of time in a regular reasonable manner. I especially appreciated that dialogue was used sparingly and everything wasn't talked to death like a lot of movies these days. If you're looking for a witty fastpaced sexfilled movie with lots of dialogue and plenty of action this definitely isn't the movie for you. But I thoroughly enjoyed the refreshing change of pace the sweet gentle love story as well as a surprisingly decent performance by Zac Efron. My main gripe is that there were entirely too many backlit scenes. I wish I could have the sun following me around all the time back lighting my profile. Overall though I recommend it. Will probably watch again.".

I don't like how they changed the plot of how Beth finds out about the photo it was a lot better and would've added more substance to the movie when he gives it to Ben and it keeps him safe. I also think they should've had Zues be more prevalent in the movie like in the book. Zues saves Ben pretty much in the book and although it might be hard to train a dog to do that it would've been pretty cool but also the beginning story about him training Zues on the way would've added to it as well. There is just a lot more substance missing from the movie that I saw a lot of other reviews saying they didn't seem to see the character development. I understand a lot of the time books are edited to be turned into movies but in this case it was changed for the worse not the better unfortunately. Getting a few more actors to be the girls on the beach would've cost some extra money and training a dog to do the rescue scene would've cost a lot so I guess they were kinda worried about the costs more than quality. The best part is that Zac Efron is amazing in this and although for me his character was already well developed from the book I think he did a good job in the movie as well!".

The movie drags at times but if you get board you can always watch the rear view mirror on the truck appear and disappear from scene to scene.It kinda has the feel of a 60's movie with the folk singer telling the story as it happens.

But where Godard's characters have a playful sense of humor trying to act their gangster fantasies wearing fedoras and poorly executing nonthought out crimes to the tune of a swinging soundtrack and beautiful woman Love Is Colder than Death does all with a fridgid robotic sense of cool. Every shot is like a black and white photo where the acting is like posing in front of mirror before the action or one of the charactersgets executed. The film is pretty avantegarde in using mostly completely static shots and the characters pretty much act too cool. They just stare at you as you're supposed to react then when there's an action you get surprised and realise it's still in the movie. Forget that the plot is simple threadbare even this is an atmosphere piece.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is not for every one. If you are mostly familiar with American Fim Noir or Gangster movies... Don't Go Here! This is one dark moody cynical and depressing film. Yet that being said every lingering shot and silent moment has more layers in it then most entire movies do today. The story here is very simple two criminals meet when they are recruited by a crime syndicate. They become friends we find out one is a pimp and the other is a killer for hire. Later needing a place to stay the killer falls in love with the pimp's girlfriend also a prostitute. The three begin to work as a crime trio with the killer doing most of the dirty work. But the focus here is not the story. Fassbinder subtly allows the three character's relations towards each other become the real story. The people in this film have sold their souls to criminal life a long time ago. Yet like everyone else in the world they still struggle for there inner desires and the need to feel something real. This movie quite obviously had a very low budget. As a person is shot we rarely see an exploding squib or even a blank cartridge being fired. The prime focus is the actor facial expressions and reactions. Equally as powerful yet more creative then seeing blood The camera work is extremely minimal yet far more revealing of the characters subconscious as they walk down a park or into a supermarket. This is not your modern day first time film maker or film school graduate. Don't expect a Chris Nolan or a Quinten Tarentino. LOVE IS COLDER THAN DEATH does borrow from certain film genres but it is so uniquely its own film and creates such a beautiful sense of detachment that has rarely been attempted in film.".

	schema:reviewBody "R.W. Fassbinder's debut feature Love is Colder Than Death was shot on a very limited budget and it shows. For the most part Fassbinder seems to have made the lack of budget work for him rather than against him however. Faced with a lack of funds Fassbinder apparently decided to make this film as austere as possible. The film is shot in black and white but it uses less blacks and greys than any other film I can think of the use of white especially in backgrounds adds to the film's stark tone as does the lack of camera movement. I've never seen a film in the crime genre that utilizes long takes and the stationary camera the way this one does.In general I don't like crime movies that focus solely on the criminals but I found this one fascinating because these people didn't seem to be acting out of the usual petty motivations rather each of the three main characters seemed to be harboring a hatred for mankind. This is expressed in the contempt they show when they steal some trivial items in a store rather than quietly pocket these things they choose to go to elaborate means to distract the shopkeepers and steal things right in front of them. It's not enough to take something from someone else they also have to prove their superiority while making their victim into a fool. I found their misanthropy horrifyingly fascinating and that alone sets this film apart from other similar films.This film has been compared to the work of Jean Luc Godard and with good reason these characters reminded me of the ones in films like Breathless and Pierrot Le Fou. Still the characters in Love is Colder than Death are fundamentally different from the ones in those films because Godard's characters come across as lazy and selfish people who can't fit in while Fassbinder's characters come across as more ideologically motivated nihilist misanthropes.The film's Spartan aesthetic is used to accentuate the characters' cynical attitudes in at least a couple of ways. The characters are often seen in front of structures so white they resemble the void thus the exterior of the places they inhabit reflects the emptiness felt by these people who have no purpose or emotion. Another nice touch is the lack of visual representation of the gunshot wounds. At first it seemed like this lack could be entirely explained by budgetary concerns but on further reflection that's just silly Fassbinder didn't have to show the bodies after they were shot but he usually did because he had a purpose in doing so. The gunshots seem to have had no effect because the shooters have no empathy for their victims they care so little about them that the wounds don't even register with them.".

I had saw the film the first time over a year ago and thought it was OK. I decided to rewatch it last night and walked away with completely a different opinion than before. Fassbinder knew the importance of the nondialogue scenes and how to make them stand out with expressionistic photography and stark settings. The music used here in the film is also first rate in adding to the mood. Ulli Lommel Hanna Schygulla and Katrin Shaake sp? are all wonderful here.

Of course this is something sad then again it also is something beautiful.Rainer Werner Fassbinder translated.'Liebe ist klter als der Tod' is about criminal rebels who don't want to conform and who regard freedom as their highest good that is worth protecting at all costs. This is unmistakably shown in the beginning when a syndicate wants to recruit Franz and Bruno but they refuse to join despite much pressure being put on them.They live the image of rebellious Hollywood icons from James Cagney to James Dean. Apart from their freedom appearances are important. Suits hats sunglasses guns and gangsterish behavior they can not live without.Franz killed a Turk and now he has problems with the police and the Turk's brother. He gets those problems out of the way by killing more people. A great many of them. Bruno helps him. Bruno became Franz' best friend. Franz kills the Turk's brother. Bruno kills a witness of Franz' murder. They don't bother to do things subtly. When they get guns but can't pay for them they just kill the dealer no big deal. Another obstacle out of the way. When they are stopped by a police man they could have easily lied their way out of it. But nah BANG.Gunshots although numerous seem very little present. Either they are made offscreen or the film cuts to the next scene before the shot. Impacts from gunshots are not visible the victims just break down and the film immediately moves on.This makes us think of the main characters as the cool rebels that they see themselves as rather than as criminals which is how the people around them see those characters. The style of the film very much supports the characters' selfimage. It makes us see the things the way they see it. They think they are in a gangster movie so the film is a gangster movie. It's very much French New Wave  the culture is that of American movies and myth  but the setting is Germany and the values are of the German student movement aka the 68erBewegung or more precisely Fassbinder's view of it. Apart from their acts of rebellion their lives are pretty empty and they clearly have nothing to live for making them rebels without a cause.Overall the film plays a lot like Godard's 'Bande  part' just more serious in tone and more mundane. There is no lofty dialogue.The film is made to look plot less. Stuff happens but connections between scenes are left unpronounced. It feels like a film of plotfragments. The Turks plot doesn't seem to be of major importance. The first time it was referred to almost in passing and the second time when Franz is interrogated about it by the police the focus seems to be a different one. Even when they kill the Turk's brother it is far from obvious who that man is. It's only in retrospect that all this comes together to form a plot.By the end we find out that Bruno was sent by the syndicate to make friends with Franz and to make him join the syndicate and that this is what the absurd plot was about. Fact is that there is a plot but the film is very concerned with being ambiguous about it. Even in the last ten minutes when the film finally starts to uncover things one crucial dialogue is almost unintelligible because the music plays over it too loudly. And then the scene of the attempted bank robbery which is the most crucial moment in the plot is edited frantically making it difficult to see what exactly is going on.To make sense of it you have to put together the puzzle after the movie is over. I consider this a weak move as it makes the first time viewing unnecessarily little enjoyable. Gladly RWF didn't repeat this approach in any of the many other films that I have seen of his.As for the meaning of the title love is colder than death. It is Johanna Franz' girlfriend who looks through Bruno and his plan to get Franz to become a part of the syndicate. What binds Johanna and Franz is love Bruno and Franz are bound by death  Bruno who murders for Franz. The coldness of the title refers to the ability to see things as they are to look through deceptions. Johanna with her love for Franz is less deceived by Bruno than Franz is. Love is colder than death. Not even by the end of the movie Franz knows what's going on. The film closes with him calling Johanna a whore probably assuming that she betrayed Bruno out of jealousy for the close friendship between Franz and Bruno.".

	schema:headline " like early Godard without the interesting parts  for Fassbinder completitsts only";
	schema:reviewBody "In this first feature from RW Fassbinder which is among the movie titles that should be preserved in a National or World Archive of the movie titles that should be remembered a thousand years from now if such a thing could be done it's like he decided as the Godardphile that he was to take Bande a Part and emphasize most of the parts where the characters do nothing and make it look cool all of his early features until he discovered Sirk at a festival when he was about 26  I didn't know this until recently but it explains why there isn't much by way of melodrama until Merchant of Four Seasons. The only problem is Fassbinder is also working here without a firm script  or as he told Uli Lommel according to 'Fassbinder in Hollywood' the script was all in his head as it were  and it shows.This is also kind of like what one might see as what the kids were doing about fiveten years ago when the mumblecore movies were coming out though with a crime movie twist Lommel even has the Alain Delon look down from Le Samourai with the trenchcoat and hat which means Fassbinder is actually homaging the homager three aimless young people one of who gets kicked out or has some kind of problem with a gangster syndicate as it's mostly called decide to try some crime and eventually rob a bank or something.I say 'something' not to sound flippant but because Love is Colder Than Death doesn't give much to the audience aside from total disaffection  there are so many cigarettes here Better Davis at the time probably would've said to them to calm it down a little  and this cool attitude which also includes the distance at least for the most part. Actually the most interesting actor here is Fassbinder something about his face and eyes seems to convey things about his uncertainly and yet dedication to a life of crime andor not doing much at all it's certainly more than Lommel does who has one mode the entire film even when he has a gun to someone in an wreckage field out in the middle of nowhere ready to kill for... a reason I guess you could've fooled me!

I'm fine with minutiae but you got to try something  and to say Godard didn't work with a script isn't entirely accurate as a comparison basis.Surprisingly to me Fassbinder started and ended his career on his least impressive efforts I couldn't watch it all in one sitting came back to the last 40 minutes a week after starting as I felt so dulled away by Fassbinder's anticinema which I'm sure was the intentional coming from his theater background.

	onyx:emotionText "In this first feature from RW Fassbinder which is among the movie titles that should be preserved in a National or World Archive of the movie titles that should be remembered a thousand years from now if such a thing could be done it's like he decided as the Godardphile that he was to take Bande a Part and emphasize most of the parts where the characters do nothing and make it look cool all of his early features until he discovered Sirk at a festival when he was about 26  I didn't know this until recently but it explains why there isn't much by way of melodrama until Merchant of Four Seasons. The only problem is Fassbinder is also working here without a firm script  or as he told Uli Lommel according to 'Fassbinder in Hollywood' the script was all in his head as it were  and it shows.This is also kind of like what one might see as what the kids were doing about fiveten years ago when the mumblecore movies were coming out though with a crime movie twist Lommel even has the Alain Delon look down from Le Samourai with the trenchcoat and hat which means Fassbinder is actually homaging the homager three aimless young people one of who gets kicked out or has some kind of problem with a gangster syndicate as it's mostly called decide to try some crime and eventually rob a bank or something.I say 'something' not to sound flippant but because Love is Colder Than Death doesn't give much to the audience aside from total disaffection  there are so many cigarettes here Better Davis at the time probably would've said to them to calm it down a little  and this cool attitude which also includes the distance at least for the most part. Actually the most interesting actor here is Fassbinder something about his face and eyes seems to convey things about his uncertainly and yet dedication to a life of crime andor not doing much at all it's certainly more than Lommel does who has one mode the entire film even when he has a gun to someone in an wreckage field out in the middle of nowhere ready to kill for... a reason I guess you could've fooled me!

	schema:reviewBody "Liebe ist klter als der Tod is a West German movie from 1969 and writer and director Rainer Werner Fassbinder was in his early 20s still when he shot this movie. It is from extremely early in his career and just like Katzelmacher in blackandwhite a trademark of his early films. And another trademark is that the director appears also as an actor in there something not too common anymore when Fassbinder moved on or at least not in the sense that he played crucial characters as he does here. And also just like Katzelmacher this film here is fairly short only 90 minutes and Fassbinder has many longer films in his body of work. The title translated means Love is Colder than death which is admittedly a bit pretentious. It is about a triangle relationship. And struggles arise quickly as the two men are also very close friends and their relationship is really much more in the focus than the relationship with the female played by Hanna Schygulla who worked a lot with Fassbinder. There are other cast members here who also appeared in more Fassbinder films. Fassbinder's films are always more about attraction and about arranging yourself with your feelings not really about love and this description also fits nicely in here. Because of the small core cast it is probably also a good choice to play in a theater group or so. Nonetheless despite the film's success with awards bodies too I must say that I prefer some of Fassbinder's later works over this one here. But this is entirely subjective of course. It looks to me as if he is still looking for his style and needs refinement. He found it. But not yet in this one. Not recommended.".

Yes it's the same old story with a different setting but Wes Craven gave it a good pace. At least not another Scream with the usual college killer. It's nice when you can see a clean coherent thriller even when originality doesn't stand out as its main character. Particularly from a filmmaker like Craven that has brought so many innovative ideas to the thriller and horror genre in the past and that now just lends himself to bringing home what could have been a good TV movie had it not been released theatrically. Good job!".

Cillian Murphy is creepier than he was in Batman Begins. In the old days there were guys who always played the bad guy. We don't see much of that these days because I suspect the Hollywood agents consider it a bad career move but Cillian Murphy is really good at being bad.The directing is surprising stylish. The story is good but the dialog could have used some sprucing up.Red Eye is a really fun film and people were applauding when the closing credits started rolling.

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen thousands of movies and have never written a review but the Red Eye I witnessed is so at odds with the glowing tributes posted here that I'm compelled to offer my two cents in protest and vote the lowest score possible just to bring the average closer to reality. This is a dull boring stinker of a film that is memorable only for its apologist depictions of the terrorists' target a John Boltonesquire bully diplomat who's really a great guy don't you know and of the ohsohandsome and popular Dr. Phil whose bestselling book one learns is read by frequent fliers worldwide. The only real Red Eye I experienced was from rubbing my eyes in disbelief.Before you fork out 10 or so dollars for this B movie read the selected 'Quotes from trailer' above and ask yourself if you'll really enjoy a movie in which these were the cleverest lines to be found. Unfortunately nothing else in this film is any better. The basic premise is goofy as hell the acting is bland and uninspired completely lacking in proantagonist chemistry the potential for suspense is thwarted at every turn except during the last five minutes by poor directing and anticipatory editing the script is riddled with incongruities like early reveals of the heroine as a university lacrosse star are called into question when she later battles the antagonist with a field hockey stick and the plot holes are wider than First Class while character development is strictly Coach.And then there are the moments of extreme ridiculousness like when the daughter of a high level public servant does NOT head straight for airport security at her first opportunity to warn them of an assassination plot against the both the head of Homeland Security and her father. Or when that same woman runs hellbentforleather along slick airport linoleum arms pistoning and veins in her neck bulging while wearing 4 inch stiletto heels. Or when her pursuer chases likewise with a sucking wound in his trachea. Or when terrorists use a fishing pole to bring up their weapon from the freaking harbor bottom. I'm always willing to suspend disbelief but I'm not going to leap from 3000 feet without a parachute.The one good thing I can say of this movie is that it portrays women who are capable even in bimbo form of handling the most extreme emergencies the kind of gender imaging sorely lacking in American movies. Other than that this movie never really takes off and is no more thrilling than the red eye flight from Boston to NY. Remember the last time you got suckered by deceptive trailers and glowing tributes in this forum or elsewhere? This is one of those times. Wait for the Red Eye video and don't watch it then either.".

In fact it's the perfect kind of movie to show as inflight entertainment attentionholding without putting any intellectual or emotional challenges on the viewer.Overall there is a cheesy feeling to the plot vague terrorist subplot motivation and the supporting characters and the main section has a TV movie feel. However there are definite elements of Hitchcockian suspense and echoes of Schumacher's Phone Booth which ultimately is a more sophisticated and pretentious play on the same idea of emotional crisis being played out suppressed in public.For a film that focuses mainly on two people sitting in airline seats it lives or dies on the characters and script. Cillian's icy but eloquent Jackson Rippner and Rachel MacAdams resourceful Lisa are the main reasons the film gets carried off. Not only making the dialogue zing but also giving some sort of Adam's Rib type dimension to their battle of 'male logic' against feminine 'sensitivity'.In the final portion of the film Craven indulges himself a little Scream style as manchasesgirlwithknife. The most surprising revelation here is what Brian Cox looks like after the 'Just for Men' treatment his ubiqutous appearance in films as diverse as Super Troopers The Ring and this making him the sexegenarian version of Jude Law.Short haul fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am surprised that everyone even the critics seems to think this was a good movie. It was the most clichd thriller ever made that I have seen. We have the 'bad guy' who wants to force the 'good guy' or girls in this case to do something or face the consequence. The 'good girl' in this movie must use her smarts and skills to defeat the 'bad guy' and save the day and her loved ones. Using charisma bravery and even luck to save the day. Where to begin? Well a young woman by the name of Lisa Reisert meets a young man by the name of Jackson Rippner nice name at an airport. One coincidence leads to another and soon it seems as if fate is bringing these two together. Sharing drinks sitting next to each other seemingly getting along in every way... Is there more to this strangeness? Could these two be meant for each other? Does 'fate' have a reason for their strange and random encounter? Well as it turns out unfortunately yes. Jackson needs to Lisa to help him assassinate the Director of Homeland Security by moving him from one room to another so that his men can launch an attack on him. Oh if she doesn't do this then her father is dead. Though we never learn the exact reasons why and who is really behind this madness Jackson more then explains how this is going to happen and why its in Lisa's best interest to help him.Of course Lisa defeats his evil plans with her smarts and in the process stabs him in the neck makes him trip over chairs and hitting him with a field hockey stick. Oh and before that she leads him on wild chase through Miami airport where she gets passed post 9 11 security and steals a car that she later uses to run over the man who was ordered to kill her father. Yeah right.First of all I find it strange that a man like Jackson who can get his hands on high tech weaponry needs the help of a hotel manager. Couldn't he just sneak a bomb into the building? Wouldn't that make it safer for him and his team by leaving out any third parties? And why do characters like Jackson also explain everything they are going to do to someone they are threatening? Doesn't that make it easier to stop them by the same people? The actors did their best considering the movie they were given. Racheal McAdams and Cillian Murphy are still actors to look out for. Also I believe that Jayma Mays who played the 'loveable' Cynthia will be someone we will see more of. It's just too bad they all were stuck with this.2 out of 10".

We are confronted by a guy who has apparently spent 8 weeks watching a girl who then turns up at an airport behind her flirts and chats her up successfully somehow wangles a seat next to her in a two seat space not trapped in the middle of a five seat row contacts at checkin? and is cheezily nice during a painfully slooooow build up. Then once up in the air in a confined space surrounded by strangers he immediately starts threatening the vacuous if superefficient Rachel McAdams and saying tosh like 'we got ya daddy do what I say or poppa gets it'. Well forgive me but didn't they already have her daddy ready for slaughtersoyoubetteroughta long before she stepped on the plane and therefore wouldn't it have been oh sooooooo much simpler to simply snatch the gal off the street and terrorise her in a room somewhere forgetting the complicated and insecure dad plot pulling her nails out or whatever until she made the all important 'call' required? Or even  cos this is the movies and we need a few unreal twists  keep the dumb dadindistress thing intact if you must but dress it up better so that holding him in harms way until the convoluted plot had been concluded made some sense without the plane dumbdown? Alternatively without wanting to sound like an actual thinking terroristassassin  couldn't the massive bazookamissile thang employed have been far more easily used on say a car driving down the highway with the politician inside rather than the 50th story of a Miami seafront hotel from a fishing boat mind you as we already know security in Miami is lax so they'll speed away? I know I know far more fun to go through watching a pretty girl for 8 weeks burgle her dads house to steal his wallet that somehow  star trek style  gets transported from Miami to Texas instantly in order to  perhaps  get her to arrange for a politician to change hotel room and and and... Well a thousand things could go wrong here each one entirely destroying the Big Plan so why not slim the elements down to a sensible handful such as  1. bazooka. 2. car. 3. boom! My 50 minute drive home from the cinema was spent highlighting the abundance of flaws and stupid codHitchcockian twists which sadly was the best fun of the whole sorry experience. And as for security back at Miami Airport... we have an apparently crazy and violent girl running off a plane chased by cops who during the chase sits down to have a coffee moves elsewhere to read a magazine at a bar then runs again like crazy up and down the whole terminal... by now also chased by crazed Cillian Murphy no CCTV then?  I had guns pulled on me for parking in the wrong place for 10 seconds at Miami Airport a couple of years back. So instead of speaking to the cops  her allies  or getting on the blower at a callbox direct to her dad to warn him his life is in danger McAdams prefers instead to steal a People Carrier off a family in the Airport forecourt call the damned security... and drives home to daddy mowing down the assassin with the vehicle in the front garden of the house in a rich neighbourhoodwatch district crushing the front porch in the process  an act which actually slightly wakes dad up from an afternoon snooze after about a minute yet which somehow fails to register with neighbours who aren't even mildly curious thus ensuring 15 more minutes of hide and seek shenanigans as the duo run around the vast Hollodeck type house... Dohhh it actually hurts to keep thinking about it all  Cillian surely renamed Silly 'un for doing this one? preposterously turns from ice assassin to comically unhinged and inept lunatic killer at the end this theoretically ruthless despatcher of human life now allowing the dad to live so that he can watch his daughter getting her goose cooked. I'd better stop because the stream of drivel I'm writing here must sound as uncoordinated as the Red Eye script. If Ms McAdams hadn't been allowed to get on the plane in the first place the title could have been altered from 'Red Eye' to 'No Eye Dear'. RR".

My 50 minute drive home from the cinema was spent highlighting the abundance of flaws and stupid codHitchcockian twists which sadly was the best fun of the whole sorry experience. And as for security back at Miami Airport... we have an apparently crazy and violent girl running off a plane chased by cops who during the chase sits down to have a coffee moves elsewhere to read a magazine at a bar then runs again like crazy up and down the whole terminal... by now also chased by crazed Cillian Murphy no CCTV then?  I had guns pulled on me for parking in the wrong place for 10 seconds at Miami Airport a couple of years back. So instead of speaking to the cops  her allies  or getting on the blower at a callbox direct to her dad to warn him his life is in danger McAdams prefers instead to steal a People Carrier off a family in the Airport forecourt call the damned security... and drives home to daddy mowing down the assassin with the vehicle in the front garden of the house in a rich neighbourhoodwatch district crushing the front porch in the process  an act which actually slightly wakes dad up from an afternoon snooze after about a minute yet which somehow fails to register with neighbours who aren't even mildly curious thus ensuring 15 more minutes of hide and seek shenanigans as the duo run around the vast Hollodeck type house... Dohhh it actually hurts to keep thinking about it all  Cillian surely renamed Silly 'un for doing this one? preposterously turns from ice assassin to comically unhinged and inept lunatic killer at the end this theoretically ruthless despatcher of human life now allowing the dad to live so that he can watch his daughter getting her goose cooked. I'd better stop because the stream of drivel I'm writing here must sound as uncoordinated as the Red Eye script. If Ms McAdams hadn't been allowed to get on the plane in the first place the title could have been altered from 'Red Eye' to 'No Eye Dear'. RR";

	schema:reviewBody "Scream was Wes Craven's last decent thriller. Since then there has been nothing but an unbearable streak of Hollywood trash barely good enough for a blockbuster night including the disappointment of the Scream sequels. Perhaps the genius and the craftsmanship devoted to the movie drained all the energy and creativity out of him so that when it came time for supper he had nothing to serve us but his own doo doo. Finally after who knows how many bad movies later he gives us a delicious ruthless gripping chilling suspense thriller with Red Eye.Rachel McAdams once again delivers an enjoyable performance as she plays a hotel manager who has the unfortunate connection with an important political figure and regular at her hotel. Then she meets Jackson Ripner Cillian Murphy Batman Beyond at the airport who she gets to know a little better after a delayed flight and a bay breeze. What she doesn't know is he already knows her. And he also knows her father who she will never see again if she fails to cooperate and meet Jackson's demands to use her connections to set up her hotel regular for assassination.You're probably thinking this is nothing but your everyday thriller complete with predictability and chase scenes. Although this is a good old fashioned thriller that's the beauty of it. No special effects. No cheap make up. Just classic suspense. You feel the desperation and regret with every decision McAdams is forced to make and you actually care for her as you cheer her on every move she makes to find an escape from her claustrophobic position.As always she delivers an entertaining and convincing performance. It's either her sweet face or her uncanny ability to sincerely cry but you always seem to sympathize with her if her role demands it. Cillian Murphy on the other hand is naturally creepy looking so even if the trailer didn't reveal it his ultimate transition from charming stranger to merciless jackass isn't so surprising. Perhaps it would have been more trippy to see a nice guy persona like Toby Maguire transforming into evil relentless madman. Nevertheless Cillian Murphy after his true identity is established played the role so solidly you'd really want him to die or at least get his ass kicked.Don't overlook this feature. There are plenty of chalkboard screeching moments and heart jumpers that will keep your eyes on the screen instead of your watch like you would at Craven's recent pictures. If not for the you do it for all the times you'll see your girlfriend or boyfriend or someone with popcorn jump and cling on to you. Wes finally gets it right. Aside from his trademark mastery in suspense Red Eye is not without its humor as McAdams' replacement Cynthia at the front desk fumbles to keep the hotel in order. It was a relief that Red Eye wasn't a disappointment. Instead you'll get the pleasure of seeing McAdams deliver another incredibly talented performance Murphy look creepier by the minute and Craven craft a classic traditional thriller. A flight that was delayed and would have been the beginning of Craven's renaissance had it arrived right after Scream.".

I can't believe this brain dead movie was made by Wes Craven. I'm guessing he needed a little money to pay the mortgage so he made this piece of dung. It is the sort of production that makes anyone who watches movies regularly believe they could do as good or better than such an experienced director.Ya see a bad guy wants a sweet girl who loves her daddy to do a wittle IL' bad thing or he's gonna hurt her daddy. But being Ms. AllAmerican girl next door we know she's gonna save the day and beat the bad guys...the end. Girl power ROCKS.C'mon now only an idiot would find this entertaining...a roller coaster ride let alone something fresh or new. All those superduper reviews you see on this site are from industry hacks who are either making money off this flick paying back a favor or they have sold their souls to the devil.Rachael McAdams is beautiful....yup that's it. Not a good performance not a horrible one...she's just cute. She would have had to show a whole lot of skin to save this movie. She isn't tough enough to be a good female action lead.Cillian Murphy was at least passable in 28 Days. But here he plays a dumb villain pretending to be a smart one. He gets his ass kicked to and fro by the 5'5'' McAdams because after all she was a cheerleader...and a field hockey player...and I'm sure she owns all the Tae Bo tapes...so she should be able to kick the crap out of an international terrorist for hire. I wouldn't trust him to steal a pack of gum from 711.Ya see this movie was done before except before they did it well. Go rerent any of the Die Hard movies. You have loved ones in danger international terrorists except the characters are more likable and believable and the bad guys are WAY more competent and interesting. I simply don't understand how Hollywood can continue to make such crap as if they were oblivious to the proper models they can readily copy.

The premise is similar to Cellular and Phone Booth but Red Eye is better than both of those films. Almost everything about Red Eye is above average including the suspense the acting and the direction. Most of the film does take place on a plane but that doesn't slow down the movie. The film is very fast pace and exciting with no slow or boring spots. Wes Craven does a really good job behind the camera. Instead of focusing on the thrills he focuses on the story and the characters. The movie does have its share of suspenseful moments but that's not what the film is really about. I also like the way Wes Craven focuses on the other passengers and the small details that become important later on. Red Eye really shows his skills at storytelling.Red Eye also works well because of its young and talented cast. Rachel McAdams gives a very engaging performance and her character is hard to hate. You may even end up cheering for her out loud. Cillian Murphy gives a very creepy and effective performance as the villain. The way he acts charming at first but then turns psycho is especially impressive. The supporting actors are also pretty good which include Brain Cox and Jayma Mays.The movie is also very stylish and it has this overall creepy vibe to it. The setting works well since there is an obvious fear of isolation and no escape. Overall the tone of the film is consistently creepy. The screenplay isn't as strong as everything else though. There are a few unrealistic moments that may distract the viewer. Most of them didn't bother me but there were of few that left me shaking my head. Also the ending is disappointing. It isn't a bad ending just a very simple one and a different approach would have been better. Since the movie focuses on the characters there is really no scream moments maybe just a few jumps. If you expect a horror movie then you will end up disappointed. In the end Red Eye is an engaging thriller and it's one of the best movies of the summer. Rating 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. What a relief ... a thriller that actually is thrilling! New IT girl Rachel McAdams Wedding Crashers and The Notebook dominates screen time in this nice little classic suspense thriller from famed horror film director Wes Craven Scream movies and A Nightmare on Elm Street. Craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers on the plane.What makes this one work is the realism of the first 1520 minutes as we see McAdams interact with 4 or 5 people either in person or on the phone. She is a natural. When she meets Cillian Murphy the Scarecrow in Batman Begins in what appears to be happenstance the film really takes flight. Watching the two yuppietypes flirt while the audience knows something evil is brewing is bewitching filmmaking! The plane boarding sequence is mesmerizing and the 30 plus minutes onboard is excruciatingly claustrophobic. Craven keeps us guessing as to the involvement of others and if anyone will come to her rescue.As with many thrillers the only letdown occurs during the climax when the lamb turns into a superhero. An interesting plot device leads us to believe little Rachel has the necessary pent up frustration to see this through but we can't help but cringe a bit. The most overdone scenes involve irate hotel guests an annoying airline passenger Cillian's injury and the FX at the hotel. The strength of the film is in the character development and psychological games between the leads. Sadly the fine screen veteran Brian Cox is underutilized but overall this is an aboveaverage suspense thriller worth seeing for all but the finale.".

Craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers on the plane.What makes this one work is the realism of the first 1520 minutes as we see McAdams interact with 4 or 5 people either in person or on the phone. She is a natural. When she meets Cillian Murphy the Scarecrow in Batman Begins in what appears to be happenstance the film really takes flight. Watching the two yuppietypes flirt while the audience knows something evil is brewing is bewitching filmmaking! The plane boarding sequence is mesmerizing and the 30 plus minutes onboard is excruciatingly claustrophobic. Craven keeps us guessing as to the involvement of others and if anyone will come to her rescue.As with many thrillers the only letdown occurs during the climax when the lamb turns into a superhero. An interesting plot device leads us to believe little Rachel has the necessary pent up frustration to see this through but we can't help but cringe a bit. The most overdone scenes involve irate hotel guests an annoying airline passenger Cillian's injury and the FX at the hotel. The strength of the film is in the character development and psychological games between the leads. Sadly the fine screen veteran Brian Cox is underutilized but overall this is an aboveaverage suspense thriller worth seeing for all but the finale.";

He brings us an amazing end of summer thriller I was so desperately craving. This is THE thriller of the year..no doubt. All the actors are amazing and the action is realistic and fun. The FX were great. It steadily built suspense. I was on the edge of my seat most of the movie. It's been a while since I heard an audience cheer and clap and get excited in a theater. If your looking for thrillsaction and a GOOD plot this summer REDEYE delivers. Go see it!".

	schema:reviewBody "The main reasons to see Red Eye are Rachel McAdams who delivers a stellar performance and Jayma Mays who is wonderful as the Assistant Hotel Manager. On the other hand Cillian Murphy overacts so badly that he becomes cartoonish. The rest of the movie is riddled with plot holes on which I will elaborate.Please do not read further if you don't want to know what happens!Here is a synopsis of the plot. Rachel McAdams's character Lisa manages a hotel where the new hardnosed Homeland Security Director plans to stay that night. Rachel is returning to Miami from a funeral but fielding calls from her assistant up until the plane leaves. In the meantime someone is stationed outside the house of her father Joe played by Brian Cox ready to kill him if Cillian Murphy Jackson calls. All Lisa has to do is phone the hotel and move the Director's suite to one where Jackson's cohorts are planning to fire a guided missile from a fishing boat to kill the Director and his family.So here are some of the plot holes or absurd coincidences1. Jackson finally convinces Lisa to make the call and in the middle the phones in the plane lose their connection. Lisa tries to fake that she is making the call but coincidentally a guy across the aisle from Jackson is also making a call and starts banging his phone to indicate it is dead. Jackson catches on and grabs the phone from Lisa.2. At one point Jackson headbutts Lisa and she of course gets knocked out...but only for 30 minutes.3. Jackson catches Lisa writing a note on the mirror in the extraordinarily large lavatory and he bangs her around a bit. Miraculously the only one who hears anything is an 11yearold girl whose word of course is discounted.4. Lisa stabs Jackson with a pen in the throat as the plane is landing steals his cell phone and makes a mad dash for the exit fitting down the aisle between the seats and 18 rows of standing passengers. Despite knowing there is a passenger with a pen stuck in his throat the flight attendants oblige Lisa by opening the door to the jetway.5. OK all those are reasonable if not highly unlikely. But here's where it gets really stupid. Lisa gets into the terminal at Miami Airport and there is no cell phone signal every major airport in America has great cell phone reception.6. She runs through the airport with Jackson in hot pursuit and no security officers even delay them.7. Jackson who lost Lisa in the Airport while the train from the gates pulled away to the terminal has lost some of his voice from the pen in his throat but he can still be somewhat understood. However he doesn't bother to call his man outside of Joe's house. PS There is no train at Miami Airport but the one they showed looked an awful lot like the Orlando Airport.8. Lisa steals a car and rides away. Of course this time when she goes to make a call the cell phone says low battery and soon shuts off when will they stop using this inane plot device?.9. While the phone still said low battery Lisa had reached her assistant just in time to save the Director and his family from the guided missile launched by the fishing boat to the window of the room on the 40th floor to which the Director had been moved. Of course they expect us not to notice that the hotel is surrounded on 3 sides by ocean so the missile could have probably been launched at the first suite thereby negating the need for the whole LisaJackson plot. What's the story here? Was the Director's original room on the 38th floor one of the only rooms in the hotel with a lousy view? Nevertheless everyone gets out just before the missile hits.10. Lisa drives to Joe's house to save her father only to see the killer outside. Although she runs him over as he is shooting at her by crashing her Jeep into the house no one in the neighborhood seems to notice or bother to stop by.11. Jackson arrives at Joe's house and knocks him out we don't see how...maybe another head butt. He then explains to Lisa that he didn't kill dad yet because he wanted dad to see Lisa die first Give me a break. What is this? Saturday morning cartoons?.12. For the rest of the movie about 20 minutes Jackson chases Lisa around the house and she resourcefully fights him off. Of course a real killer i.e. one maybe played by Jason Statham would have done away with Lisa or for that matter anyone who is not a trained killer in the first 30 seconds. During the course of this chase Jackson steps over Joe at least once without bothering to kill him.13. Finally Jackson prevails and he is about to kill Lisa when you guessed it he is shot by Joe.So here's my suggestion...tell Wes Craven to stick to horror. Or maybe he should get together with Michael Bay who directed the equally stupid The Island and make Red Island.".

Hitchcock in his day understood that 1000 failings of the script andor direction could be forgiven if the audience was able to connect early with the characters. And that's exactly what happened here. Murphy  remember this is the guy who is considered to have delivered the best Elvis impersonation of all time  happily and zestfully digs deep into the role of psycho killer. But make no mistake this film owes everything to McAdams. She is the chewy chocolate centre of this piece the audience connects with her early on develops empathy and spends the rest of the film watching her facial expressions  just as you would a close friend  to see how she is doing. McAdams is one of the handful of stars to have aced the transition from teen wonder to adult star and as this review is penned 2013 she shows no sign of slowing down. Other critics have noticed something especially interesting about her performances. No I am not making this up. She glows. She shines. The more important the scene the more she seems to light it up  internally. Very few actors have ever been credited with this talent but I suspect in her case the gift is real. This film would have been a halfbaked wonder but for the presence of Rachel McAdams. It will I believe over time elevate it to classic status.".

This is sure a different mood for Craven and you probably wouldn't know it was he behind it. Being short and sweet makes the flying time go by in no time. Quantity seems to be replaced with quality but still this is a streamlined lightweight commercial flight for audiences. The taut premise builds up nicely because of an always engagingly sharp and sly script. However it does seem to get quite silly and overstated towards the spontaneous closing. Even the whole setup is very wishywashy. One of its driving factors were the profound lead performances. The lovely Rachael McAdams gives a dedicated headstrong performance. Opposite of her is a sensationally suave but sinisterly steely Cillian Murphy. The two gelled very well and their backandforth banter was expertly delivered. Veteran actor Brian Cox provides some solidarity and pleasant support. The cracking music score by Marco Beltrami demonstrates slick panache and welltimed cues.

And she makes sure that some real import VIP gets another room because some real tough Russian mob guys who would love to lob a rocket into the room of this VIP. So all goes to plan for mister bad guy. Until she decides she had her fill and sticks a pen into Ripner throat. So next she sprints through the Plane and mister bad chases her. Further she does some more sprinting in the airport. With battalions of security guys doing some sprinting also. So next she steals a car does some mad driving. And meanwhile calls the hotel to warn them about the evil plans and she saves the day. Although partly that is. Because next she drives to her dads house and sees the killer standing outside and she calmly drives that one over. So she saves another day here. But then really abrupt the Jackson appears again on the scene and they decide they should do some more running through the house. While Jackson is swinging his 10 inch Rambo knife and the girl swings a bit with a hockeystick. But then the climax comes and baddie almost has her but now the father who was knocked out by the badass appears and does some final saving the day. So in short yes this movie got some clichs in it. But well I can live with that to some degree but besides that... The storyline just sucks. She could just have yelled out that next to her is a killer seated. He would have been overpowered. Next some swatguys would have been sent to dads house to take out that killer. And maybe some swaties to the hotel to round the Russian mob guys up. Well OK it had a bit too much clichs in it and yes the storyline sucked completely but how about the acting? Well here some light is shining trough because I really liked the performance of Cillian Murphy as the evil psycho. So I really would have like him to butcher the rest of the cast plus the director. Save the cameramen as last and this film would have been a lot better. So in short no I don't recommend this film".

	schema:reviewBody "How much one likes The Nutty Professor II The Klumps' depends on how much Eddie Murphy you can stand.  After grossing more than 125 million at the box office I would have to conclude that moviegoers couldn't get enough. This sequel is a oneman show built around a character skit from the first movie.  Murphy plays eight different roles and gives a tour de force performance without the benefit of any story whatever.  I got the impression that the writers were superfluous anyway since Murphy was obviously ad libbing about 90 of the time.The humor is lowbrow and delivers a good deal of physical comedy laced with sexual innuendo.  Though Murphy's caricatures are consistently droll they rely too much on unflattering stereotypes of blacks.  The first dinner scene is a rehash of the dinner scene from the first film.  After that scene most of the film is a repetition of the same tired sight gags.  Though Murphy's amusing electricity runs through every character once the novelty wears off the film's appeal wears thin.Kudos to the makeup department for an outstanding job on Murphy's various alter egos.  Otherwise the production of this film was nothing out of the ordinary.  Larry Miller also gets a very honorable mention as the obnoxious Dean Richmond getting his just deserts at the hands of a giant hamster.This film has some laughs but not enough substance for a feature length movie.  I rated it a 610.  Add two or three points if you are an Eddie Murphy fan.".

WAW yet needless to worn you that too far can be too wrong sometimes. In this manner they went so far with the filthy material to an extent turns the movie into a docudrama about the human body's middle and its various secretions or simply one of the most emetic movies ever made ! Mainly the idea is good The Fountain of Youth however the script just wanted to play dirty with nothing but nauseating sex and endless farts in its mind. Movies such as John Waters's since the start of the 1970s used to be described as transgressing with historically awful scenes frankly nasty elements done in mostly independent production. Mainstream Hollywood comedies since the end of the 1990s seem to be feeding on none other than Waters's inspirations. For instance the sexual humor that this movie savors excessively is beyond horrible. Just remember an anal sex between a man and a huge hamster and an oral sex between 80 year old granny and her grandson's alter ego. So the historically awful scenes the frankly nasty elements.. are now being done with big budgets famous stars and sold as lovable time. See how we live an age where the major studios transgress us !This movie is actually a milestone in the fart comedy the Hollywood comedy once !. Among the many similar comedies nowadays this one is a godfather and a record. Makes you think deeply had decency become so oldfashioned? Or had Hollywood become really bankrupt and incredibly dirty in the same time?Look how many family movies Murphy had to make right after it  Shrek 2001 Dr. Dolittle 2 2001 Daddy Day Care 2003 The Haunted Mansion 2003 Shrek 2 2004 and Imagine That 2009. I can't precisely decide was that a purgation? Or was it a way to woo his raising kids trying to persuade them that he's a good movie star or nice person? The thing that I know for sure is that  unfortunately  old habits die hard because in no time he went or went back to make Norbit 2007 !!Still there is a rare angle in it. Remember the scene in which the hamster excretes rather explodes with excrements in the face of many dressy people at the press conference? While being one of the top nightmarish moments I have experienced with movies not believing till now that it had been verily made I see that it seduces brilliantly a dark place in every one of us and even satisfies it. Sometimes we hate our world so much hypocrisy stupidity corruption.. whatever the reason why at that point we want to do what the hamster did everyone with their hated persons who deserve such a fate best a machine gun full of you know what !. Ahhh how fair am I to admit that this movie had something that could sound like good after all !At any rate I detest Nutty Professor II The Klumps. It's poor unfunny and too smelly to stand. It has a talent only in bringing up a shockingly ugly thing every minute to top it by yet another one in the next minute which is not my thing at all ! My theory is that you have to be hating the world so much to love this movie altogether. Otherwise you might hate its makers wishing them the fate of the dressy people in the press conference moment ! P.S  I loved Hollywood's sneering at this piece of work in Tropic Thunder 2008. Parodying it as The Fatties Fart Two made me feel that lastly I'm not alone in this universe and that Hollywood does have a conscience well.. some sort of it anyway !".

Anyway while the movie still focuses on Sherman and his quest for love and scientific goals this time making people younger the rest of the family gets involved in the story lines. And I thought that took away from the heart of the film. While it was fun to see all the Murphy characters there needed to be a better story line for them rather than a bad marriage. Although I will admit the horny Grandmother Klump story line was very funny. They should make a movie just about her next time. But I regress. The story line with Sherman and Buddy about how Buddy was still inside Sherman and Sherman managed to get him out only to have Buddy come to life and then Sherman is becoming more stupid by the minute and will go into a vegetable state unless he eats Buddy. It's all very cheesy. I mean come on one tear from Janet near the end manages to bring Sherman back to life? It was all very corny.This is not to say that there aren't funny scenes in the movie. Again I thought the best scene was the entire Klump family going out to dinner and all the hijinks that ensue. And there were other funny moments scattered throughout the film but not enough for me to really get into the movie and enjoy it. Basically it was a moment to moment film not an overall enjoyment film. Eddie Murphy is amazing and Martin Lawrence has got nothing on dressing up as a fat woman but it's just not enough. The Klumps is something you can rent for a quiet evening at home.".

In the first movie Buddy Love was funny if cruel and his observations were right on target. In The Klumps Love is like a grown version of that Home Alone kid when he grabs his face and just yells at the camera. Uh if you are done shouting now can we move on?Janet Jackson was fluff. And I don't know what she has done with her chest but it seems unusually huge here.I suppose it would be appropriate to say how well done the make up is as Murphy plays his halfdozen or so characters. Yes he makes them seem like different people at least superficially. But none of the characters are really there you know? They each have little tag lines and maybe a quirk and those lines and that quirk are used to death. Take the granny. Yep she likes sex. She is a sex machine. She wants every man. OK uh so? We've seen that 20 times. Can we get to something new?Overall I feel sad to see the level Murphy's wit has been reduced to. He used to be more biting more insightful and more well funny. Now he is a human cartoon. I gave this movie a 4.".

	schema:reviewBody "Title Nutty Professor II The The KlumpsRating 12 out of 4Review  I've never been a diehard Eddie Murphy fan but that's  of course not to say that he isn't funny or endearing either.  TRADING PLACES has always been my favorite Murphy movie with the original BEVERLY HILLS COP a close second.  He's a funny guy and he has come further than he ever has had before with NUTTY II.  The original 1996 film was both funny and enjoyable if having the distinction of having occasional unnecessary bathroom humor.  NUTTY II however is taken to extremes with the bathroom humor everywhere from Grandma Klump giving Buddy Love oral sex in a hot tub to a hamster growing to epic proportions giving anal sex to Klump's boss this film revels in bad taste way too much.  Is the film funny?  Sure it is and it would have been a lot funnier if not for all the sickenening humor that we've seen dozens of times before I don't blame Murphy particularly for this considering the script was cowritten by the guys who wrote AMERICAN PIE and directed by Peter Segal who has had his fair share of films with the same type of humor.  They don't make the sick humor at least clever which is the problem.  THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and BASEKETBALL made their bathroom humor clever but  NUTTY II doesn't.Murphy fans are sure to love this though because I was telling the truth before about him coming further than he ever has before.  Playing no less than 8 roles this might be some kind of record his main character is Sherman Klump a charmingly overweight professor who in the original wanted to get rid of all the weight and became a stud in Buddy Love to make a beautiful coed Jada Pinkett whose missing prescence in the sequel is annoyingly unexplained and eventually learns in the end that you should be yourself and that personality is way more important about looks.  In the sequel he can't shake off the DNA that Buddy has left inside of him so he decides to attempt to get rid of it but Buddy eventually and predictably regenerates himself with a new thing on his mind.  Sherman apparantly has discovered the fountain of youth and now Buddy is going to stop him and take the invention to his own credit. This film apart from the original focuses more on Sherman's family right down to their gluttonous eating habits to their sexual fantasies. That's basically the whole plot in a nutshell.  As I've said before Murphy is terrific and he's well worth watching in his eight roles but this film will turn off a lot of viewers because all the sick humor which I must say is more silly than funny yet you find yourself for some reason still laughing to it or rather at it.  Janet Jackson as Eddie's love interest here is OK but she seems to be more important to the audience any audience not just the AfricanAmerican audience as a male fantasy figure than an actress.  Overall I'm looking at this film as another one to add to Murphy's list of commercial successes that is funny enough to make him a respectable comedian but for once I want him to go more towards not grossing us out and finding a concept to appeal to anyone and everyone.".

I either leave the theater or turn the channel but here I cannot just dismiss this. 4! screenwriters 9!!! producers and all they could turn out is this junk. OBVIOUSLY taking advantage of part 1's success they churned out something I could see them saying Ah it'll be good enough to make an easy 100 mil before bad word of mouth kills it about. A blatant rehashing of the first film with endless farts stupid sex talk and a plot that actually takes itself seriously. It seems at times that they are really concerned with the story as there are no jokes just drama dealing with Murphy's the Sherman version discovery.

That is what sunk Cop II him thinking that blasting his voice would get a laugh it didn't there and brought back annoying memories here. Maybe the worst element are the long utterly humorless stretches where the family banter with each other. Nothing remotely funny to say and others have wisely pointed out how inaudible the dialogue is sometimes. Murphy either slurs the words or adds some voice affectation this is totally indecipherable. Gets irritating real quick as does seeing the same actor clutter the screen scene after scene. Yeah the makeup is great but it's the same stuff we saw in part 1 and all the praise for a swiveling camera capturing one actor playing multiple characters was acheived 11 years ago in Back to the Future Part II yes I am partial to that series. As far as the other content it SO points out how very very much this is strictly aimed at kids as they should enjoy countless farts the word titties mentioned a bunch of times and moronic moments such as a giant hamster shooting its fesces across a room. I didn't really enjoy the first film that much but I'd take it any day over this. I haven't added to my worst of all time list in a while but now behind Three Ninjas Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and Fierce Creatures comes the new number four da da da daaaa Nutty Professor II! Ick get it away from me.".

I either leave the theater or turn the channel but here I cannot just dismiss this. 4! screenwriters 9!!! producers and all they could turn out is this junk. OBVIOUSLY taking advantage of part 1's success they churned out something I could see them saying Ah it'll be good enough to make an easy 100 mil before bad word of mouth kills it about. A blatant rehashing of the first film with endless farts stupid sex talk and a plot that actually takes itself seriously.

His portrayals are warm real appropriate and moving.The humor is grand raunchy and slapstick. The plot is inconsequential. Oh and Michael Jackson has never looked better. His skin has returned to a nice healthy beautiful brown and he has discarded that hideous wig. In this movie he also appears a bit more masculine that usual for him but I liked the change!Anyway go see the movie is great and you'll like it.

And on top of that the jokes were not funny they were just gross. Do I really want to hear about how long it takes for a 90 year old man to get an erection? NO!I like Eddie Murphy and this movie shows off that he definatly has talent. The scenes where he plays just about everyone are very believable you'll even forget that he's playing them all at times except for the similar voices. Unfortunatly the jokes weren't any good so his talent in playing multiple charactors didn't really matter.Despite Eddie Murphy's fine acting skills I really disliked this movie. I thought the humor was crude rude and even insulting at times. The whole thing was just one sickining toilet joke after another. A word of warning to parents who want to control what their children watch this movie should be rated R. There is no doubt in my mind that the only reason it wasn't rated R was because of Eddie Murphy's name on it. There isn't much swearing or anything like that but the humor is very inappropriate for younger children. It got so racy at times that even I was embarresed. So unless you're extremely immature and feel like spending an hour and a half hearing about the details of extremely old people having sex than avoid this movie at all costs. I give Nutty Professor 2 3 stars out of 10 because I thought it was better than What Lies Beneath which I gave 2 stars.".

One aspect of the movie I enjoyed was that Eddie Murphy broadened his portrayal of the Klump family Which if you're not aware every family member except the boy are Murphy. His talent is unbelievable. and gave them larger roles in the sequel. It's a lot dirtier than the first film. We learn a heck of a lot more about Granny. The nudity scene was hilarious. The plot is about the professor who is about to get married but his bad self Buddy Love is acting up. When Buddy escapes there are two professors running lose and the professor's got himself a problem. It has many hilarious moments but is different than the original as it's unrated and has some naughty but absolutely hilarious moments.However the movie isn't 100 perfect. Where it faulters is in terms of a decent storyline. It felt like a bit of a retrip to the first movie with a similar plot. The film though is hilarious and will have you repeating lines for days after it but my only recommendation is that you see it twice. The first time round you are getting to grips with the storyline and I have to admit because I didn't catch all the jokes I didn't find it that funny. But when you go back a second time as you know the basic storyline which is there  despite what I said earlier you can listen in for the jokes as they are quite hard to catch sometimes. Altogether Nutty Professor 2 The Klumps is very good  in fact it is one of the best sequels that I have seen.Overall rating 7 out of 10.".

Standing out of Eddie's way to let him do his thing she provides the movie much of it's charm and virtue as Eddie provides the laughs and the imagination.

What's really surprising is that even Buddy Love also Eddie Murphy of course appears so little and has a different less interesting personality before he was a mean dangerous egotist now he's a silly prankish egotist.  There's one element about Buddy regarding a dog that's actually quite funny and semioriginal.As Sherman Klump Murphy is occasionally quite moving but this is rare here instead most of the time this sequel robs him of the most surprising and worthwhile aspect of the Nutty Professor the first Murphy time around his dignity.

In fact outside of David Lean's Oliver Twist  this may be the bestlooking blackandwhite film I've seen. A good part of the visual treat is viewing the fantastic Victorian house where most of the action takes place. The lead character played beautifully by Dorothy McGuire is one the viewer cares about which helps get one involved in the story. All the other characters are fun to watch and are detailed here in other reviews. I go along with most in saying Ethel Barrymore was the most likable.There are a few holes in the storyline to be sure but one doesn't care since the film movies rapidly the story keeps you so involved and the visuals and audio are so interesting.

	schema:reviewBody "I caught The Spiral Staircase on the Turner Classic Movies Channel yes surprisingly enough I do watch that channel and I had heard about this film before and decided to see what it was all about. I'm glad that I did because it was a very rewarding experience. This film centers around Helen Dorothy McGuire a mute housemaid who works for an eccentric woman Mrs. Warren Ethel Barrymore who lives in an old New England mansion with her two grown sons in the early 1900s. In the area where Mrs. Warren lives a serial killer has begun targeting women with afflictions or disabilities strangling them all to death. Helen begins to fear that the killer may target her and her fears become a reality one stormy night as the murderer stalks her within Mrs. Warren's darkened mansion waiting to strike.I've always enjoyed older black and white movies and I think it's important to take a look at early cinema to compare it with what modern cinema has evolved to so I had some sufficient interest in this film. I also love Gothic stories similar to this  so this film was the perfect type for me. The story is apparently a hybrid of two novels that were fused together and made up the plot line for this film and the story in and of itself is very creepy and very unique. This is a heavily Gothic film it's up to the brim with about every Gothic element that you can think of  it's a classic horror story and I loved that about it. Some splendidly chilling sequences among them being the very eerie scenes where Helen is spied on by the serial killer in the house and very eerie moments add to the overall foreboding atmosphere that this film gives off.Atmosphere is also very heavy in this film and many of the story's elements make it so strong. The dark mansion is an eerie and classic setting for a horror story of this type and the backdrop is used quite effectively. The house is lit only by candlelight and there are shadows bouncing off the walls everywhere the characters go. The cast is very good and all of the performances were welldone. Dorothy McGuire plays the silent heroine excellently and the professor and his mother are also both played very well. Most of the cast aren't extremely wellknown besides the legendary Elsa Lanchester who played the infamous role of the monster's mate in Bride of Frankenstein but that really doesn't matter much because they all are quite good in their roles. The film's conclusion is satisfying and the film keeps you guessing up until the final revelation which was a great way to conclude the spooky little story.All in all The Spiral Staircase is a classic Gothic horror story. It won't scare today's audiences and most modern moviegoers will find little interest here but if you give it a chance it is quite an excellent little thriller especially for it's time and it has plenty to offer. Wonderful horror classic I'm surprised that there aren't more people aware of this film. 910.".

The house alone is as much a part of the plot as the actorsbut everything clicks...the acting the script the story the direction and the brooding atmosphere that lets you know you're in for an intense and absorbingly suspenseful story. All of the suspense is relieved occasionally with just the right amount of humor. Particularly by Elsa Lanchester as the housekeeper who uses trickery to steal an extra bottle of liquor from the wine cellar. While thunder and lightning storms outside the mansion we know that a serial killer is lurking on or near the premises one who specializes in murdering women with physical afflictions. At the center of the story is Dorothy McGuire's character a mute girl who lost her voice years ago during a traumatic experience. Around her are a number of people all of whom become suspicious as the plot thickensKent Smith Rhonda Fleming George Brent Ethel Barrymore and Gordon Oliver. Ethel Barrymore is especially good as a frightened old woman bedridden and suspicious enough of everyone. For comparison view the recent color TV adaptation bland in overall effect. It will make you appreciate this black and white classic more than ever. As with most remakes it doesn't stand a chance against the original.My only complaint is that DOROTHY McGUIRE does not have much range in her expressions. Wideeyed but seldom wild her restraint limits the amount of fear her character can express without using her voice. A more overthetop performance might have been more useful given the Gothic mood created so well by director Robert Siodmak. She is overshadowed by Ethel Barrymore as a bedridden invalid urging her to leave the house and Gordon Oliver as the playboy stepbrother who plays his role to the hilt. GEORGE BRENT does nicely for the most part but seems too laid back in the final scenes to be as menacing as he is meant to be.Still well worth watching for its shadowy Victorian atmosphere alone.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Spiral Staircase is one of the most eerie and atmospheric films that I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. The entire movie gives off a sense of malice throughout and the use of music here is some of the best I've ever seen in a movie. The film's plot follows a series of murders of which all the victims are people with imperfections. Our hero is Helen a young mute girl that works as a nurse for Mrs Warren an old lady that lives in a big house. Aside from the old lady also living in the house are her two sons Albert and Steven along with a few other people such as the maid. As the murders are being committed on imperfect women the old lady becomes concerned for her mute nurse and begs her to leave. When another murder is committed in the house the danger that the young girl is in becomes more apparent.The first thing you will notice about this hidden gem is it's striking cinematography and lush settings. The film is very Gothic and that gives it a very foreboding atmosphere. This is without doubt the best things about the film in a dark thriller such as this the atmosphere is always important and as I said this film has plenty. The film also features a lot of intrigue. As it has many characters that could be suspects it leaves you guessing. Playing it's cards very close to it's chest we don't find out who is the murderer until the very last minute. The cast of The Spiral Staircase don't excel individually but they come together very well as an ensemble. Most of them would never make another notable movie although the majority have rather large filmographies. Robert Siodmak takes the directors chair and he should be commended for his work. His use of the camera is excellent the film features numerous closeups and when coupled with the haunting music it makes for a great eeriness. There is one sequence in particular where the killer is watching his wouldbe victim from some bushes in the rain and that with the haunting music in the background is altogether one of the most frightening sequences ever filmed. Cinematic perfection.".

Hint this pays off later in the movie. When it's made known that a killer is making his rounds murdering afflicted women the owner of the mansion fears for the mute woman's life  and after a string of more murders occur they realize she's next.RKO's picture was far ahead of its time. Someone on here said it's not a film noir and commanded that people stop calling it one. I'll disagree. I think it IS film noir in the sense that it's a personal struggle for one person who's surrounded by death and murder. I don't think it should be left up to one person to decide what film noir really means. I do think there are limits of course Batman Returns is NOT film noir it just tries to come across as one but no one should say This isn't a film noir because it's a thriller. So what? Loads of film noirs are thrillers.I personally feel the stylings the themes and the motif of the movie could be classified as film noir. It's a beautiful movie to look at very well filmed and the ending is probably one of the best I can remember ever seeing.It's had a few remakes over the years but the first remains the best  by a long shot.Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "This stylish thriller was based on Ethel Lina White's novel Some Must Watch and features a very strong cast an excellent script by Mel Dinelli and some stunning work by director Robert Siodmak and cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca. Its German expressionist style fluid camera movements and slanted camera angles create an ominous atmosphere which becomes even more threatening in the sequences which are either shot from the murderer's point of view or where closeups of the killer's eye are seen and the whole effect is then strengthened further by a creepy score in which the eerie sound of the theremin is prominent.The Spiral Staircase is set in a small New England town in the early part of the 20th century. A serial killer is on the loose and the victims to date have all been women with disabilities. Helen Capel Dorothy McGuire is a beautiful young woman who's employed as a servant by a wealthy invalid called Mrs Warren Ethel Barrymore. Helen lost her ability to speak following a traumatic event in her childhood and is now seen as being in considerable danger of being the killer's next victim.Mrs Warren lives in an old mansion with her stepson Albert who's an urbane professor her son Steve who's a widely travelled womaniser and her employees who in addition to Helen include a housekeeper a handyman a secretary and a nurse. There are a number of strained relationships in the Warren residence as the two brothers don't see eye to eye Mrs Warren has a low opinion of both brothers who she regards as being weak and Nurse Barker Sara Allgood is consistently humiliated by the insulting way that she's treated by her employer.Mrs Warren likes Helen and is very concerned about her safety. She warns her that she's in imminent danger and pleads with her to leave without delay. Dr Parry Kent Smith is a newcomer to the town and a man who's taken a romantic interest in Helen. On one occasion when he attends Mrs Warren she begs him to take Helen away with him but an emergency call for him to visit another patient prevents him from doing so. This unfortunately leaves Helen unprotected when the serial killer eventually reveals himself and makes it clear that he's determined to kill her.As previously mentioned the movie's visual style is particularly strong but the whole story is also compelling to watch from start to finish partly because of the marvellous bunch of characters featured but also because the action is so well paced. A number of sequences such as the first murder are especially well staged and the carefully created suspense never lets up.The acting is good throughout and Dorothy McGuire deserves special praise for the realistic way in which she expresses her feelings and reactions to situations without any dialogue. Ethel Barrymore was nominated for an Academy Award Best Actress in a Supporting Role in recognition of the strength of her portrayal of the cranky Mrs Warren and Elsa Lanchester brings some humour to her role as Mrs Oates the housekeeper.".

It's as if this murderer like mimicking the actions a wolf pack is attempting to cull out the sick and the weak reindeer or caribou to keep the rest of the herd strong and healthy for future breeding.

	schema:reviewBody "I find it surprising that there are almost 50 user comments on this '40's melodrama and even more surprising that by far the greater number of them are so favourable. Not that I would disagree. It is simply that I had mistakenly imagined that as I had recommended it to one of my sons when he was in his twenties with the comment They no longer make them like this and received the reply Thank God! attitudes might be even more dismissive now so that a strong defence would be the order of the day. Pleasing to find that this is no longer necessary and that practically everything I would have written has already been said. For us oldies for whom The Spiral Staircase was a formative part of our childhood the film still evokes enormous pleasure. It is after all the definitive Old Dark House  Lady In Distress movie with all the trappings of Hollywood Gothic flashes of lightning bursts of thunder and an old Victorian country mansion full of shadows and terror that might erupt any minute. As a child I loved experiencing those frissons of fear when a live eye might stare out from a portrait on a wall. The malevolent eye that stares out from behind a rack of clothes hanging in a cupboard during the first murder scene in The Spiral Staircase is possibly the most chilling of them all. Indeed everything about the first ten minutes of the film is masterly the evocation of a small New England town on a sultry afternoon before the gathering storm the hotel with the silent film show downstairs and the murder of the crippled girl in a room upstairs the dumb girl's apprehensive journey home to the creepy house where she works as a domestic taking in a wood with eerie sounds en route. The dramatic tension of the film is greatly enhanced by seeming to take place in real time a late afternoon and a long long evening. If the male characters are on the surface a rather uninteresting lot there is enormous compensation on the female side with a trio of middleaged to elderly biddies hamming it up for all they are worth Elsa Lanchester as the cook whose fondness for a drop almost knocks another nail in the heroine's coffin Sara Allgood the irascible nurse driven by pique to depart from the house thus further endangering Dorothy Maguire and most impressive of all Ethel Barrymore as the invalid confined to her bed who senses the evil all around but is powerless to help until the end. Two odd points worth noting. I would never have guessed that the staring eye was that of the director Robert Siodmak. The fact that it resembles so remarkably that of the actual murderer rather gives the game away very early in the film. Then there is the spiral staircase itself that isn't a real spiral as it is broken by a straight piece of corridor every time it reaches a floor of the house. Although a climactic scene at the end of the film takes place on it and overhead shots accompany the opening credits it doesn't really have the significance the title suggests. It could be just another part of the hokum that I find so irresistible. Having recently sat through The Skeleton Key a recent Old Dark House film that contains little more than a couple of moments where figures jump out on you I can again say quite unashamedly that they don't make films like The Spiral Staircase any more. The more's the pity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being one of the last truly great thrillermystery classics I still had lingering on my mustsee list I cherished big expectations for The Spiral Staircase. Perhaps even a little TOO big Don't get me wrong it's a fantastic film and a bona fide genre masterpiece but somehow I expected even more suspense and moodiness! Let me just get out of my system that certain sequences inside the old dark house were a bit tedious and overdone. But hey who's complaining since the full rest of the film is pure perfection in terms of beauty elegance atmosphere and scenery. It's rather intriguing how certain films like Freaks or Peeping Tom to name just two caused so much controversy and scandal while The Spiral Staircase is widely considered as an untouchable landmark even though it features similar prohibited themes like voyeurism and murder victims with a disability. The opening sequence is almost too brilliant for words. A medium sized crowed gathers in a small theater for a silent movie screening while on the floor above them a crippled girl prepares herself to go to sleep. The utmost evil glazing eye watches her from inside the wardrobe and strikes exactly when she lifts the gown over her head. You can't get any more expressionistic than that. After that The Spiral Staircase establishes itself as the sheer archetype of old dark house thrillers. The beautiful but mute Helen is a social worker in the secluded mansion of the ailing Mrs. Warren. A heavy thunderstorm rages outside Mrs. Warren son and stepson argue over their life styles and the lovely secretary Blanche and the rest of the household staff either turns to alcohol or complains about the stubborn matriarch. Both Mrs. Warren and her doctor urge Helen to leave town. Could it be the maniacal killer is inside the house? This film is a rarity. Even though it doesn't require an Einstein brain to figure out the killer's identity you honestly don't care that much and remain glued to the screen to admire how the Gothic atmosphere unfolds further. Director Robert Siodmak  a German immigrant in America following WWII  truly masters the cinematography and Victorian set pieces. He also manages to include the thunderstorm as an extra  and essential  supportive character. Speaking of the cast I dare you to name a socalled 'damsel in distress' more amiable than Dorothy McGuire's Helen. She's a vulnerable angel targeted by a frustrated and obsessive madman on a mission to rid the world of imperfection. Especially the women impress in The Spiral Staircase as I simply must also mention Ethel Barrymore as Mrs. Warren nominated for an Oscar even and Elsa Bride of Frankenstein Lanchester as the maid with a taste for brandy.".

The story is pretty much okay though in the middle it was dragging on a little. A couple of scenes take the cake visually e.g. Helen in front of the mirror her wedding fantasy and when she finally begins to speak but the film looks good overall as well. The acting is just fine but Dorothy McGuire stands out even if some parts felt a little overacted she still won my sympathy for Helen. It must have been a difficult part to play I would say.A big 7 out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "'The Spiral Staircase' has a lot of nice light  dark atmosphere in and around the mansion where spookiness is abound. The story is pretty much okay though in the middle it was dragging on a little. A couple of scenes take the cake visually e.g. Helen in front of the mirror her wedding fantasy and when she finally begins to speak but the film looks good overall as well. The acting is just fine but Dorothy McGuire stands out even if some parts felt a little overacted she still won my sympathy for Helen. It must have been a difficult part to play I would say.A big 7 out of 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Spiral Staircase 1945The Power of Affliction the Affliction of PowerIf you want to buy into the demented fixation of the murderer played by the good natured George Brent you'll have to stretch it a bit. This well mannered professor feels there is no room for human flaws or afflictions in the world. Hence the mute heroine of the movie is on his tokill list. Of course this meek and troubled Helen with Dorothy McGuire perfectly cast is not about to die in front of usin fact at the end she comes to life in a way by regaining her voice thanks to the goodness of a young handsome doctor Kent Smith.If you'd rather just buy into a classic manipulation of mood and familiar suspense movie fears you're all set because that's what this delivers. Robert Siodmak who also directed the gritty and gripping The Killers and Criss Cross gives dramatic mood first priority achieved most of all with astonishing lighting and camerawork. I know there are endless astonishing black and white movies from the 1940s. But this is one of them and while you are being creeped out or downright scared for Helen watch the way the camera moves us through the shadow infested house. Some reviewers talk of the excess of clichs in the movie the thunder and lightning the rain against the windows the dark corners of hallways the cobwebbed cellar and shadows everywhere like the crazy moving shadows of trees blowing in the lightning storm. And a candle that blows out when you most need it. And a window swinging open for no reason as the rain rushes in. People complain about this? Isn't this the point? Isn't this the most revered way of making a scary film scary?Remember too this is a film that helped cement those wouldbe clichs beaten into silliness by the Bmovies in the 1950s and television later still. It gets a bit much with the blowup of the eye and the murder seen in its supposed reflectionor does it? This isn't camp it's just drama. The clichd notion that this is like Hitchcock also needs the reminder that Hitchcock's classic American suspense films are being made around the same time or later. I'm not taking away from the great Hitchcock innovations and the free spirit he brought to unfolding a good plot a spirit not really in play here but visually at least this movie is at the top of the game on its own terms.There are some strong supporting parts each perfectly exaggerated just a hair like the gruff old woman in bed played with energy by Ethyl Barrymore no less. And there is that terrific view at the beginning inside a World War I era movie theater a woman is playing live piano for soundtrack as the crowd is sitting rapt in the dark the projector being cranked by hand. And remember our mute but not deaf heroine watching The Kiss as we watch lives in a world parallel to that in the silent film. As the woman upstairs is being strangled a dead girl is carried on screen below. This is great stuff. And then the man runs up a sort of spiral staircase in the hotel.And the gorgeous spiral staircase in the house is to truly die for.".

	schema:reviewBody "As this year already the fourth Fnf Freunde movie hits cinemas I would like to review the very first from the bunch. It is directed by Mike Marzuk and written by Klehmet and Wehling based on the Enyd Blyton books. All this also applies to films 24 in between there was always only roughly a one year break. Seems like they want to rush as many films as possible. And for good reason as the films steadily grew in audience numbers. 3 was more successful than 2 and 2 was more successful than 1. We will see if the newest film can top the third movie in terms of box office again as well. The director and writer duo all returned to work together on these movies and same goes for the kids. Eisenbart The Door Wickie had the most acting experience from the quartet before the film. Oettl and Schlingensiepen had some experience too also already appeared in the same film before this franchise and only Nickel was a complete newcomer to acting roles.Now maybe you recognized I only mentioned 4 but the titles says five friends. That is right. Number 5 is their dog Timmy. This first film is about Eisenbart's character becoming friends with the other three her cousins. She initially is not interested in them at all but they grow closer quickly as they go on an adventure together. Initially only Timmy is a friend to George. What I did like was that it was very easy to quickly make a connection with each of the kids. It also helped a lot that it was not difficult at all to keep them apart and see who is who not only because of their looks but also because of their behavior. A crucial difference in this film compared to the other movies is how we do not know who the antagonist is until very late. In the other films it's clear right away but here it could be a special agent wildlife cameramen M'Barek and Hfels reunited in Fack ju Ghte or even police officers and my guess that it would be Anatole Taubman's character was very wrong. I liked that inclusion of suspicion.And of course there is also a story on friendship. The next films are about a new kid bonding with the 4 other kids and here this new kid is Eisenbart's character. There are only very few things that I did not like for example how the dog immediately listens to all of the kids although it knows all except George only for a very short time. But these are just minor flaws and it's nonetheless great to watch this beautiful dog help the gang. The music and songs did not really impress me either. There was two interesting scenes which depicted that George is really not a usual girl like Anne. When Anne gets her hand on a gun she quickly throws it out of a window but when George gets it she points it right at the bad guys like a boy would. Fearlessly.All in all I recommend this film. I liked it more than the second film and about as much as the third film which is also pretty good. Children films from Germany usually based on novels are really booming in Germany right now and Fnf Freunde is a good watch for everybody still young at heart.".

	schema:headline " Intense and heartrending drama about jealousy that leads to tragic consequences";
	schema:reviewBody "Solid film dealing with jealousy  passions  treason  sexual intrigues and an extraordinary acting by the main cast . Concerning a deep love story who transformed a pair of hardworking people  an orange factory labourer called Carmen Aitana Sanchez Gijon and a truck driver called Antonio Daniel Jimenez Cacho  both of whom about to marry themselves . The two were the inseparables  a happy couple  but spontaneously emerges a demon  jealously . A month before he's to marry Carmen  Antonio encounters a picture of a goodlooking young in swimming trunks with his arm on her shoulder . The photograph triggers jealousy  he questions Carmen Carman's friend Cinta Maria Botto  and his friend Luis Luis Tosar who introduced him to Carmen . Cinta tells Antonio the man's first name and Antonio subsequently investigates . Carmen tells him that the man meant nothing to her  and that the picture was taken before she met Antonio . She loves Antonio and sets out to wipe the photograph from his mind through lies and kinky sex . Slowly Antonio finds out about the man  and about Carmen's dark past. There takes place the wedding  but jealously goes on . Now a bitter  resentful as well as deceived husband attempts to find a way to resolve the sad truth that consumes their marriage . Furthermore  he proceeds a particular vendetta until a breathtaking ending . Solid but downbeat drama by Vicente Aranda mostly filmed in city of Valencia and surroundings . It is a peculiar story of love  lies and jealousy with an intrigue behind . This interesting as well as intimate story is a passionate retelling and a touching drama  including strong as well as exuberant sex scenes . Vicente Aranda also writes the script along with Alvaro Del Amo based on their own story and being filmed in his usual formal and stylistic scholarship  without leaving a trace the thoughtprovoking issues  in terms of dramatic and narrative excitement . The main problem has to face Jealousy beyond not being able to avoid falling into a claustrophobic drama is precisely derived from the coldness of its staging  which eventually become monotonous and heartbreaking over 100 minutes and some of footage . Very good acting by duo protagonist such as Daniel Jimenez Cacho as Antonio  a man now broke and ill turned into a greeneyed monster and Aitana Sanchez Gijon as Carmen who wants to be in love with him  she overcomes with sentimentality and takes Antonio under her reins but her ploy backfires and he remains fixated on jealously . The secondary actors were very intelligent chosen and they all did a marvelous performance . As support cast is frankly magnificent such as Mara Botto  Alicia Snchez  Pepo Oliva  Carlos Kaniowsky  Itziar Miranda  Aitor Merino and special mention to Luis Tosar  previously his successful Celda 211 so that became to him a first star . Spotless pictorial though sometimes dark cinematography by Jose Luis Alcaine  Pedro Almodovar's usual he carries out a photography with juicy atmosphere  being filmed in Valencia and Bilbao  though wastes the scenario of these gorgeous cities . Jose Luis Alcaine is deemed to be one of the best Spanish cameramen with a long and prestigious artistic career and Almodovar's ordinary cameraman  he has photographed successes such as Volver  The bad education  The skin I live in  and Women on the verge of a nervous breakdown . Furthermore  a willingness almost perfect of the elements of each shot  every sequence  every space . Sensitive and rousing musical score by Jose Nieto  Aranda's usual  including an enjoyable leitmotif . The flick had limited success  but is considered to be Aranda's one of the best . The motion picture was compellingly produced by two great producers  Fernando Bovaira  Jose Luis Escolar  being professionally directed in his particular style by veteran filmmaker Vicente Aranda . He directed a series of awardwinning movies firmly establishing him as one of the best Spanish filmmakers . His usual film editor is own wife  Teresa Font . Vicente is an expert on literary adaptations as he has adapted four novels by Juan Mars Canciones Amor en Lolita's Club 2007 El Amante Bilinge 1993 Si Te Dicen Que Ca 1989 and La Muchacha De Las Bragas De Oro 1980. Vicente often shoots strong erotic scenes  being jealousy a customary issue in his films . Vicente has been working from the 60s with Fata Morgana  Las Crueles  Novia Ensangrentada  Clara es el Precio  among others . His greatest successes were intense dramas with plenty of sex such as Amantes Pasion Turca  Si Dicen Que Cai  Intruso  Tiempo De Silencio  Carmen  along with a delinquency tale  El Lute I and II starred by Imanol Arias  his fetish actor along with Victoria Abril They have worked together 12 times and specially the historical story titled Juana La Loca also dealing with jealousy . Rating  Better tan average . Well worth watching .".

	schema:reviewBody "This Spanish film is basically well carried out by director Vicente Aranda and his leading actors Aitana SanchezGijn and Daniel Gimenez but the ending is absolutely senseless because it doesn't confront the dramatic situation that is being set up during its long 110minutes of running time. It leaves the audience with a feeling of having been cheated out of a more interesting denoument without having to take what to us is the easy way out. For such a letdown of an ending the film should have been shorter.".

	onyx:emotionText "This Spanish film is basically well carried out by director Vicente Aranda and his leading actors Aitana SanchezGijn and Daniel Gimenez but the ending is absolutely senseless because it doesn't confront the dramatic situation that is being set up during its long 110minutes of running time. It leaves the audience with a feeling of having been cheated out of a more interesting denoument without having to take what to us is the easy way out. For such a letdown of an ending the film should have been shorter.";

	schema:reviewBody "We all have felt jealous. We all know how jealousy can affect a relationship in different levels. It can either hurt it or even end it. Our main male character demonstrates that jealousy can also be deadly.Everything is going great between a young couple until the male character played by Jimnez finds out that her soon to be wife the hot Snchez Gijn was once engaged with the love of her life. He investigates more and more until he finds out the shocking past of his beloved woman. This is where everything turns ugly and our male lead becomes psycho unfaithful and aggressive.The movie enters a nonsense period about past half of the running time but near the end it recovers and leads the viewer to a shocking ending that demonstrates how jealousy can be deadly!The acting is excellent. Veteran Spanish actors who deserve more acting chances shine through the movie. The sex is quite graphic but it's justified. Aytana Snchez Gijn delivers a marvelous performance because she can truly demonstrate how she is affected about her boyfriend's jealousy and obsession for Jos her ex lover. She plays perfectly a woman that is DEEPLY in love and that would do ANYTHING in order to convince her man that he's the love of her life. Gimnez steals the show with a performance that starts as high quality in dramatic aspects and ends up in some kind of psycho. A great underrated actor. My respects for his excellent performance.This is a must see for those who have gone mad after feeling jealousy. I learned a lot after watching this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always liked Gimnez Cacho's work. He's usually a solid actor but in this one he looks like a zombie and it's not because his part demanded so but for the weakness of the screenplay. If we are talking about jealous a thing this movie is based on it should be reflected almost in an animal way it's about instinct and reactions right from the guts blind rage and a mad love one step shy of hurting the one you care about. In Aranda's film this is treated just as a matter of personality like an accident in life or even in the way you may perceive things. My guess is that since the film doesn't go far beyond the words on paper to a place where it should actually reach considering the complexity of the main plot this was a no win chance for Cacho as well as Gijn and everyone else involved too.The main problem of Celos Jealous is that you don't buy the story right from the start because it's impossible to. No matter how willing you are to get INTO the movie you cant its a fact. Mainly because if you have been a witness on how somebody's extreme jealous makes his life a living hell then you'll realize how hollow the subject is taken here. And besides being a terrible state of mind it's also a common one so I think it's not that strange to have known somebody like that. But in the film there's no passion it lacks real visceral reactions and wiser ways to show a conflicted mind at least one better than just a man talking to himself. The only way they let us know how really obsessed is this guy Cacho with one of his fiancee past relationship is by showing him traveling long distances and talking to weird persons to get to find the ex boyfriend which would lead to an answer and then to a cure for his torture that's the way he sees it.I believe the message here is that a real deep love may hurt the other person if you don't keep your mouth shut to not let go out your worst doubts from the past and then inflict an unnecessary pain on your partner. Just give and take love as it is. Realize that if you're not a teen then all of your relationships got to be second hand. Just take a look over your shoulder and take a count on yours. But as I said before if Celos doesn't make an impact on us is because it suffers from a severe lack of real human factor serious reactions flesh and blood bodies and lots of pain something that cannot be felt without depth in dialogues and believable stages of grief. In it's whole atmosphere it sure fails but is not an awful movie nevertheless in terms of depth tension twists and intensity it's vague and pointless so you may find it kind of boring every now and then through the experience.".

Its starts off interesting with the use of children nursery rhymes to try to add a scary element to the movie but then half way in decides to forget about it. The title of the movie and the cover does throw you off. The scene in the cover never happened in the movie and the movie didn't really had any traps. It tries to draw you in by making you believe it's going to be a unique horror film but ends up being another slasher movie. I did not have an issue with the acting as much as I did with the script. It seemed like the writers were trying too hard to make the characters sound American with the overuse of profanity and the poor choice of dialog. Along with the poor development of the characters' back story it made the characters seem too unrealistic and unlikable to the point where you most wouldn't didn't favor anyone enough to hope they survive. This did hurt the movie towards the end of the film when things were being resolved as all the pieces of the puzzle didn't add up well enough for me. The movie even tries to hint itself at the ending and the killer but as stated before the lack of story development hurt the film's chance to give you that oh my gosh ending it was trying to go for. It wasn't a horrible ending I just felt it could have worked itself to it better. As with Saw the film tires to teach you a lesson at the end but seems like the idea was thrown at the end to try to give it some explanation and closure.The film lacked a lot of substance but on the plus side the film was very simple. As I said it was very mindless. Not overcomplicated nothing too confusing thrown at you honestly Steel Trap is good if you just want a B or C rated horror movie to throw in the DVD player on a night you don't have anything better to do.

They discover a table with name cards on them  more cryptic nursery rhyme clues intrigued the invited decide to play along but soon find themselves fighting for their lives as the clues lead to lethal traps. As the groups number decreases as various people are killed off the survivors try to figure out who is behind the clues  deadly traps  find a safe way out...Tellingly also known as Jigsaw Tower of Death this German production was cowritten  directed by Luis Cmara  shot under the title The Condemned this is a fairly decent if average Saw 2004 ripoff with a bunch of character's running around some enclosed location being killed off by various traps setup by some mysterious villain. For what it is Steel Trap isn't too bad actually I mean it's not brilliant but it's watchable. One thing that stands out here is how unlikable the character's are  it's quite satisfying to see them killed off. The reasons behind the killer  their motives are alright there's nothing profound or deep here  the twists  revelations won't amaze you but they work well enough  I do like the fact that the villain is seen to win  I liked that their main motive was just plain revenge  that killing the other character's off just felt good. The death's could have used a bit more gore  imagination while the traps themselves aren't that clever while the whole setup is rather complicated  for everything to happen the way it does took some planning. At 88 odd minutes the pace is alright although by the end scene after scene of people running around exactly the same looking corridors does tend to get tiresome although the final twist just about makes the effort worth it.The film starts off quite gory with a severed pigs head  a guy who has his lips sewn shut  then hung upside down  his throat is cut but then the other kills aren't quite as good with blood splatter but little graphic violence a woman has an axe banged into her head there's a cool slit throat  a ripped out heart. The film looks pretty good  is competent there's none of that shaky handheld crap  no fast quick editing either which always helps.Apparently shot in Cologne in Germany I assume this is meant to be set in the US as all the character's speak English  things like mobile phones exit signs  messages are all written in English. The acting is alright from a decent looking cast that features adults rather than annoying teens.Steel Trap is a fairly decent Saw ripoff as some mysterious killer uses various traps to kill off some people trapped inside a building it's not great or anything but I thought it was alright for what it was  is watchable if nothing else.".

It looks like someone wanted to take advantage of the success of slasherthriller movies like SAW and Battle Royale but just couldn't think of an original idea so mixed thriller classics and added some blood.

That's the name of the original Agatha Christie book and somehow she didn't care about being politically correct you'll figure out what the punch line of Steel Trap is. This really just a remake of the original story but sadly it is a very boring one. The characters are all very annoying and the story lacks any kind of suspense. The inevitable come back of the oh so dead killer at the end the frame job ... It's all so predictable it's not even amusing anymore.

It is generally enjoyable and actually stays truer to the New Year's Eve theme throughout the movie than Bloody New Year 1987 which got kind of Christmasy in the middle. Anyway..The movie opens on a New Year's Eve party complete with a rock performance of Auld Lang Syne on top of an abandoned office building. 5 people  2 partycrashers who come along are diverted to a VIP party on the 27th floor by text message where they find strange surprises waiting for them. As they split off to solve riddles the killer starts picking them off in twisted ways.The production values are good and personally I think the acting is not bad. The writing is kind of crap though. The initial character responses make no sense. Upon discovering place cards that insult each of them they are too excited about digging into cake rather than being suspicious. The dialogue is frequently bad. The characters go nuts rather quickly and the guy you now hate is clearly reaching to make you hate him going off about everything that is too stupid to go off about.But overall the movie is enjoyable. The level of psychotic is fun. It somewhat reminds me of the 2001 movie Valentine. If you liked Valentine you'll probably like Steel Trap.".

A group of spoiled success types..rock singer newspaper columnist television exec celebrity cook entertainment lawyer highmaintenance slutfind themselves trapped in the isolated wings of the abandoned building after following a riddle to a properly prepared party by a psycho. The psycho haunts the rooms hidden behind his prey who wander aimlessly trying to survive as he captures them one by one when certain individuals make the mistake of getting separated. Booby traps await equipped with riddles. A list containing the names of the group given an invite are labeled with specific titlesKathyloser Nicoleheartless Adampig etcand when each victim is dispatched a red X is marked through them. The killer's weapon of choice is a hook. But other methods of execution include used an ax splitting the forehead end of a knife stabbing a hole in the neck a sliced throat heart removed from a chest with it beating in the killer's hand..not elaborated in grisly detail the director uses sounds only displaying the beating heart the back of a victim's head crushed repeatedly into the floor during a scuffle and a vicious attack with a meat tenderizer. The goremurders lack bite and slasher fans who watch this genre passionately will find them merely adequte. This is a rather tedious slasher with a lot of the film showing this group trying to find an exit while bickering with each other. The characters like to insult each other constantly fighting often over superficial stuff..their antics are at times playful other instances nasty. Regardless the killer couldn't plunge the hook into their gullets fast enough for me..but alas we spend a great deal of time longer with these sleazy egomaniacs which is unfortunate. There's of course a twist..does the killer have a partner in crime? but Steel Trap is little more than a tired Saw retread set in a building that lacks atmosphere no matter how often the lights blink on and off. The killer should be creepy but he's merely a walking killdevice whose motives for committing these acts is embarrassingly uninspired. Some slasher fans might get a kick out of who's really behind this mind trap as the film closes with a warped comic tone mimicking cooking shows. The riddles used in the film are corny instead of witty leading the characters in a maze of doors and rooms with the killer knowing exactly where to strike almost at all times.".

They all must play the killer's game till the end or suffer an ill fate at the hands of a truly laughable silver masked maniac. Horror fans do yourself a favor and skip out on this one.

The direction is nothing special and the filmmaking in general lacks any features worth remembering. Some members of the horror audience may be expecting something more along the lines of a Saw sequel but in truth while the movie is somewhat sadistic it's never overly gory. The dialogue is highly uneven  while at times it's actually fairly amusing most of the time it's incredibly tiresome.The noname cast isn't really talented or engaging enough to create much interest in these inane victims. One might not necessarily hate them but it is sure is hard trying to care what happens to them. Even our villain is instantly forgettable.At the end it's really immaterial how things get resolved this viewer was just glad it was over.Five out of 10.".

I expected a movie of a quality comparable to House of 9 or Nine dead but I was rather wrong.The movie starts with the introduction to some stereotypical and rather ordinary characters and I was already close to judge the lack of originality of this movie. When the killing game began I was positively surprised for the first time. The acting wasn't that wooden and rather realistic and appropriated.The next surprise followed quickly. The killing methods turned out to be rather original the atmosphere was sinister and gripping and the whole story attached me more to the characters. The movie got truly entertaining and addicting and I kept guessing who was behind the bloody murders and why. The great thing is that there are many wrong clues and also some right ones and I happened to analyze the behaviour of each candidate and had to change my mind and opinion many times.The third and last great surprise is without a doubt the twist in the end of the movie that I didn't really see coming. Normally I have some doubts and am able to get on the right lane but this time I got completely bumped. This ending really rated this movie way up beyond the average slasher flick.To keep it short this is a rather original and gripping movie of a more and more popular genre and the rating average in here is definitely way too low. The movie is entertaining and an ideal choice for any horror movie night with your mates and you will keep guessing and expecting until the very end.".

Each person goes and meets the others as they are sent on a game that quickly becomes deadly. The characters have been hand selected by a slasher in a mask who is stalking the building and floor. This doesn't stop the characters from going out on their own which usually results in them being picked off by the killer. This modern day slasher film has a few interesting plot twists to keep you guessing and interested such as why has this group been selected to be slaughtered? The production is professional and the action moves at a good pace. This could have easily turned into a Saw clone but it chooses to center on who is behind the elaborate scheme keeping to its slasher roots. None of the death sequences stand out over the other but the movie does keep your interest. Certainly slasher film fans will have the most fun here. The movies biggest flaw and it's a common one is that most of the characters are so obnoxious you want to see them die. This isn't the first slasher film to suffer from this and it won't be the last.".

The jolting moments of inventively sadistic violence pack a pretty nasty punch. The sharp sarcastic dialogue gives the movie additional crackling bite.

Since the bulk of the characters are quite stuck up and unlikable it's a load of fun to see these hateful scum meet assorted harsh untimely ends. The tricky plot takes a few neat twists and turns as it unfolds toward a genuinely startling surprise ending. Kudos are also in order for Patrick Popow's glossy cinematography and Florian Moser's spare shuddery score. A really cool and enjoyable body count opus.".

As another reviewer saidit is NOT a typical John Ford filmbut it has to be one of his best.  Woody Strodeone of the most under rated black actors of his generation is superb as in the title role.

Jeffrey Hunter as defense attorney Tom Cantrell also turns in an excellent performancecaught between the proverbial rock and hard place when he is 'forced' to defend Rutledge.  Constance Towers as Hunter's conscience the school teacher Mary is also quite good. Comic relief is provided by Billie BurkeGlinda the good as the commanding general's wifewho cannot understand why she cant sit in the front row.   I have drawn a complete blank as to the actor who plays the prosecutor at Rutledge's courtmartial but he is also very good... shades of Hamilton Burger. As much as I respect Denzel Washington as an actor I can't imagine him agreeing to remake this excellent film.... as for Ben Affleck as Cantrell NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS.   As I said in a previous review if it ain't brokedon't fix it.....Bearing in mind that Ford Hunter and Strode are all gone it just wouldnt be right.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Ford who was among many who perpetuated black racial stereotypes notably in Judge Priest and The Sun Shines Bright got a chance to redeem himself with the making of Sergeant Rutledge. A year before in the Robert Mitchum film The Wonderful Country Negro League baseball legend Satchel Paige played a black cavalry sergeant in a supporting role. But in Sergeant Rutledge the story centers around such a character and the ordeal he goes through when accused of rape and murder. The victims are his commanding officer and his daughter.The leads are Woody Strode as the accused Sergeant Braxton Rutledge and Jeffrey Hunter as the lieutenant who defends him in a court martial. The story is told in flashback through the accounts of the many witnesses at the court martial and in some of those scenes John Ford got to revisit his beloved Monument Valley for some good old Indian fights.The murders at the fort take place simultaneously with an outbreak from the Apache reservation. Constance Towers who discovers both the results of an Indian attack and the fleeing sergeant at the railroad station becomes both Rutledge's biggest champion and the object of Jeffrey Hunter's romantic intentions.The dilemma that Strode faced was that by so many black people especially in the south. He comes upon the dead girl who he knows from the fort and the fact she's been sexually violated. Her father sees him together with his dead daughter and assumes the worst about him and shoots him. Strode is forced to kill him in self defense and then has to run. A white man might have stayed and explained. The father might not have fired on a white man either.Woody Strode had he come along ten to fifteen years later might well have become an action hero star like Wesley Snipes for instance. As it was here and in his small role in Spartacus as Kirk Douglas's opponent in the gladiator school he plays both with impassive dignity and strength. These became his career roles too bad he didn't build on Sergeant Rutledge to get better parts like black actors did in the next generation.Two of John Ford's stock company regulars shine in Sergeant Rutledge Carleton Young and Willis Bouchey. Carleton Young is Captain Shattuck the prosecutor at the Rutledge court martial and he's not above playing the race card to win his case. Very similar in fact to William Windom's prosecutor in To Kill a Mockingbird. Unfortunately for Young he's not dealing with a jury of uneducated sharecroppers.Willis Bouchey is the presiding judge at the court martial and besides the court martial he has to deal with Billie Burke his flibbertigibbet of a wife. He's got a lot grief to deal with made double by the fact that Burke is called by Young as a witness. A lot of the comic relief in Sergeant Rutledge centers around Burke. This was her farewell screen role and she went out in scatterbrained style.Jeffrey Hunter turns out to be a pretty good lawyer himself and he brings the trial to a sudden end with a bit of fast thinking on his feet worthy of Perry Mason.This very first film dealing with the black buffalo soldiers of the U.S. Cavalry is great viewing for those who like both courtroom drama and westerns. If you like both this is your film.".

Throughout the trial colour isn't mentioned at all until near the end but the underlying issue is one of race and how easy it would have been to jump to the wrong conclusion and Hang ourselves a nigger'. It was also incredibly brave to show how the protagonist Sergeant Rutledge beautifully played by Woody Strode was helped by a white woman again very rare at that time. This is a hidden gem of a movie and although the dialogue gets a little stilted at times it doesn't detract from the central issue.

Woody Strode who plays the title character helped break the color barrier in professional football years before Jackie Robinson did so in baseball. And he broke some huge barriers in this film too. Every young black man  heck every young American male today  should be required to watch this film. As Strode later said Ford and script writers put classic words in my mouth.

	schema:reviewBody "Excellent and landmark Western with a complex structure by means of flashback  being one of the best Ford films . It deals with a respected black cavalry Sergeant Brax Rutledge Woody Strode who saves a damsel in distress Constance Towers who is besieged by Indians . Later on  he stands courtmartial for raping and killing a white woman and murdering her father  his superior commanding officer . As Rutledge on trial for rape and murder  as a tribunal presided by a good judge Willis Bouchey  there he is defended by a lieutenant lawyer Jeffrey Hunter as defense attorney and accused by a stiff prosecutor Carleton Young . The tale of a courtmartial told in flashback  about a black cavalry officer on trail  well handled by master filmmaker Ford . Interesting and thoughtprovoking screenplay written by Willis Goldbeck  being based on James Warner Bellah novel  titled Captain Buffalo . This was a true landmark cavalry western  as it marked a strange occasion when a film from a major studio  Warner Brothers  depicted an AfricanAmerican player as the central heroic figure . While the movie's stance on tackling racism is laudable  here there are lots of courtroom settings that proved to be claustrophobic . The courtroom is deliberately oppressed but does make the picture somewhat static  however it includes an intriguing and twisted result to the end . Topnotch acting by Woody Strode  giving a moving performance as a heroic  yet human figure who refuses to be beaten by circumstances . Here Strode has his first main role  being usually a nice secondary actor . Support cast is frankly awesome  such as  Juano Hernandez  Willis Bouchey  Carleton Young  Rafer Johnson  final film of Billie Burke and Mae Marsh  many of them are Ford's ordinaries . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Bert Glennon filmed in Monument Valley  Arizona  of course . Stirring and thrilling musical score by Howard Jackson  including wonderful songs by Jay Livingstone . The motion picture was well directed by the master of the unspoken emotion  John Ford  who carries out a detailed look at covert and over racism  however  John has to rely on long speeches to get his points across . Ford puts on the highest pedestal of human honor to an AfricanAmerican  which by that time when the film was made  it resulted to be a heroism . It proved the false accusations against John Ford as a racist director . Along with his cavalry trilogy  They wore yellow ribbons Rio Grande  Fort Apache  and Stagecoach Searchers The man who shot Liberty Valance this Sergeant Rutledge turned to to be one of the best Westerns .".

In the 1950s and 60s American was still struggling desperately with racism and it was still widely acceptable to demean or mistreat Black people. However this film deliberately tries to debunk this myth that Black people are in some way inferior. The film attacks racism without being preachy or ridiculous something that makes me hate GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT due to its very heavyhanded way of dealing with antisemitism.Woody Strode as usual plays a very dignified and wonderful role as a soldier on trial for rape and murder. He was a very fine actor and you wonder how much further he could have gone in life had he been White. Hunter plays the man defending him and shows more than he could in most of his other pretty forgettable films. The actual story of what occurred unfolds in flashbacks told during the course of the trial and the style is very reminiscent of Akira Kurosawa's film Rashmon. This is VERY ironic as for years Kurosawa had been a huge fan of Ford and tried to emulate the master director! In this case it is the other way around! The film is nearperfect in the acting story and execution. Watch this film and see that Westerns CAN be more than just the typical horse and Indian flick.".

	schema:headline " Ford openly displays his art and poetry";
	schema:reviewBody "John Ford openly displays his poetry in this magnificent film Sergeant Rutledge. Maybe the great director and artist was annoyed that many did not get the antiracist messages that permeate all his works starting with The Searchers ever noted it? and decided to make a definite open statement.To be as clear as possible Ford willingly shows his art poetry and trademark techniques in the most evident way. He masterly uses images and camerawork to convey emotion. We see Woody Strode Sergeant Rutledge constrained in a small chair his neverending shoulders covering half of the screen. And we feel uneasy. We feel that something evil is going on that it's deeply wrong to keep such a man in chains let alone to hang him. And then we see Woody Strode standing out the Monument Valley on the background like John Wayne in many other Ford's movies. I'm sure that such parallel WayneStrode was Ford's deliberate choice. Ford uses his skills of epic poet to describe characters. Rutledge is arrested and searched. They find no money or other goods just his emancipation papers. So here we have a Man with all his richness his honor his courage his strength and an emancipation paper. Great stuff! And then Rutledge says to a wounded mate We don't fight the whites' war. We fight for our honor. Only Ford always manages to turn military rhetoric into poetry mainly thanks to the visual beauty of the scene. Woody Strode makes an outstanding deeply touching job as the black cavalry sergeant. His acting is sober poised but intense with no melodramatic sides and he physically dominates the screen by the way what an amazing athlete Strode was at age fortysix!.Rutledge is the Hero the Legend of the movie. Yet Lt. Cantrell Jeffrey Hunter is as interesting a character as Rutledge is. Cantrell is a man of the 19th century. Unavoidably he does have racial prejudices but he nobly endeavors to overcome them and certainly at the end of the story is a better person than at the beginning.I guess that the two female characters represent Ford's dream. Indeed they both do not even understand racism. The poor murdered girl loved his friend uncle Rutledge and that's all. She doesn't even get the hints of the old ladies who disapprove this friendship. And the same can be said of Cantrell's fiance Mary Beecher very well played by Constance Towers. She nurses the wounded black horsesoldiers with no attitude of doing something special. And some lines of Mary's show Ford's wonderful subtlety. She has been overnight with Rutledge in a deserted hut. Mary says to a concerned Cantrell I wasn't alone. Sergeant Rutledge was with me and he protected me as well as any officer could do. That's a lesson for Cantrell the fact that Mary pretends to think her boyfriend just concerned about military ranks implies that she does not even notice the color of the skin and requires Cantrell to be the same way. Well probably the two women are not fully realistic characters especially for the 19th century. They are idealized by Ford as a poet has the right to dream. A small remark. Most Ford's films not this one actually raise some controversy. Many heartily love them and many strongly dislike them. I think it rather expectable. Ford is a poet and a poet cannot please everyone. Personally I was indifferent if not displeased by the works of some much celebrated poets. Thanks God poets follow their own way not caring people's taste. Sergeant Rutledge is not perfectly constructed and chiseled like other Ford's masterpieces. Small defects may be found in some courtroom scenes and flashbacks. However this splendid movie deserves top grades due to the importance of its message and Ford's sincerity in displaying his art. Sergeant Rutledge is another top work by the Master.".

	onyx:emotionText "John Ford openly displays his poetry in this magnificent film Sergeant Rutledge. Maybe the great director and artist was annoyed that many did not get the antiracist messages that permeate all his works starting with The Searchers ever noted it? and decided to make a definite open statement.To be as clear as possible Ford willingly shows his art poetry and trademark techniques in the most evident way. He masterly uses images and camerawork to convey emotion. We see Woody Strode Sergeant Rutledge constrained in a small chair his neverending shoulders covering half of the screen. And we feel uneasy. We feel that something evil is going on that it's deeply wrong to keep such a man in chains let alone to hang him. And then we see Woody Strode standing out the Monument Valley on the background like John Wayne in many other Ford's movies. I'm sure that such parallel WayneStrode was Ford's deliberate choice. Ford uses his skills of epic poet to describe characters. Rutledge is arrested and searched. They find no money or other goods just his emancipation papers. So here we have a Man with all his richness his honor his courage his strength and an emancipation paper. Great stuff! And then Rutledge says to a wounded mate We don't fight the whites' war. We fight for our honor. Only Ford always manages to turn military rhetoric into poetry mainly thanks to the visual beauty of the scene.

Braxton Rutledge a Buffalo Soldier of the 9th U.S. Cavalry who was up before a courtmartial for the rape and murder of a white girl Major Dabney's daughter Lucy.Taking place in the court room the story is told in flashback as Rutledge's Woody Strode troop officer and defence council Lt. Tom Cantrell Jeffrey Hunter attempts to piece together the evidence. From the outset Ford is on biting form as the case is being tried in a biased and corruptible court we as the viewers are left in no doubt that Rutledge could be at the mercy of obnoxious white racists. It's one of the many things that makes the film a bold and at times angry picture.This was after all two years before the critically acclaimed To Kill A Mockingbird thus making it one of the flag bearers for early acknowledgement of race relations in America. As the sharp narrative moves forward cloaked in visual excellence with Bert Glennon this time being Ford's cinematographer of choice the film always keeps us guessing as to the outcome. We really can never be sure such is the stench of racism that hangs heavy a stench that is counter pointed by Woody Strode's wonderful and powerful performance as the on trial man. Also in fine physical shape at 46 Strode serves notice to just what a fine and important actor he was in relation to Black Americans in Hollywood. Hunter is handsome and potent as the council in the middle of a real tricky trial and Constance Towers as Mary Beecher is the glue binding them and the story all together.It's a first rate picture from Ford one that is largely and wrongly forgotten when talk of his oeuvre comes around. Still awaiting a DVD release in the UK it's evident that it remains hidden from many a prospective new viewer. That needs correcting because it's bold beautiful and important cinema from a master director who as always had much to say. 910".

The title character is played by Woody Strode who is AfricanAmerican and as such is on trial for the actions involving a dead white girl and her father. Jeffrey Hunter is his lieutenant who's defending him and Constance Towers is his lady friend who also says Strode's innocent. There's also Willis Bouchey as the presiding courtmartial president and Carleton Young as the prosecutor. And two more players worth mentioning are Billie Burkein her last film roleas Bouchey's wife who provides some comic relief and Juano Hernandezperhaps best known as the lead in Intruder in the Dustas another ranking officer. All of them are fine under the direction of the great John Ford. Sure some romantic scenes between Hunter and Towers might not be completely necessary and some sequences lean toward the sentimental side but that's Ford for you. Otherwise he gets fine atmospheric drama and action and brings a good social message without heavyhanding it making Sergeant Rutledge one of his more underrated works.

In this sense John Ford's film is just as good here as any film he did. The Monument Valley in Utah is used much the same here as it is in every film Ford featured it in.Fords work with this cast is a form of the artist too. Every person in this cast shines from Jeffrey Hunter's lead role throughout. Ford proves here he doesn't need John Wayne James Stewart or any of the biggest A List stars of 1960 to make a terrific film. This film is done with his style  flair. It has possibly the best performances on film of the entire cast. The classic courtroom  flash back sequences work as well as ever too.The second way to look at this is for political messages. I think it is a mistake too look at this film for that. Granted this is the largest black cast ever assembled for a Ford film but that does not really mean he was trying to make a civil rights message here. In fact from what I see the history here is fatally flawed as the period after the Civil War this is set in would not contain these people.Racism was not addressed immediately after the Civil War period. We wish  maybe Ford did too now that issue had been Monday Morning Quarterbacks in 1960. True History indicates otherwise. What this script does is take some 1960 people who were coming around to the idea that racism is wrong  places them after the Civil War. The result in this film is mixed on how effective that really is.Entertainment is something this film does provide well. Ford the artist does shine through here which makes this a much better than average film in it's era. I did read a review on here that takes offense too the women being sent out of the courtroom during certain testimony in the trial. The truth in that era is that could have happened. You have to remember that women did not get the right to vote until years after the time this movie is set in.Don't look at this movie as true history though. It is revisionist history. What I enjoy with this film is artistry of a great director taking an excellent cast  painting a great picture on a film canvas. This film does that very well.".

The film is mostly shot inside what appears to be a kangaroo court but as in any true hero's story the truth must prevail. Woody who plays a black Sergeant in the U.S. infantry sits strong and proud of his military career and although there are many doubters in the courtroom as to his innocence of the crimes of rape and murder the film's illustrious director John Ford provides Woody Strode with a terrific movie vehicle to shine in. And shine Woody Strode does.I wouldn't dare to compare Sergeant Rutledge to the better known classic 1962 three time Academy award winner To Kill A Mockingbird starring Gregory Peck as the defense lawyer of the accused black man of rape played by Brock Peters. I do feel though that Sergeant Rutledge stands up well some 58 years later as a decent court room western which utilizes flashbacks by the various court witnesses to explain why Sergeant Rutledge is either guilty or innocent.We the audience can play judge and jury in this decent western and I judge Woody Strode's and actress Constance Towers who plays Mary Beecher the love interest of Lt. Tom Cantrell played by Jeffrey Hunter performances as more than passing the smell test. I enjoyed Sergeant Rutledge as a full drama and action filled western.I give the film a 6 out of 10 rating".

At most there were less than 20 horsemen in one scene but the actions portrayed the effect of an entire company of horse soldiers. There are too many layers in this picture for me to comment on but I always enjoy watching it when it comes on the telly. A close second in cavalry films would have to be Mssrs.

Talk about a clinic on weak writing and bad acting. My family was rolling around the floor laughing at the clumsy attempts at drama that came off cornier than anything ol' frozen Walt Disney ever dreamed up. I liked Woody Strode in Spartacus and was intrigued by his background as an athlete so that's why I gave Seargeant Rutledge a shot. What a mistake. Where to start? The writing was laughably pathetic and trite the actors artlessly overdo the clich drama and the songs Captain Buffalo for example are something my kids will be laughing about for years. I can't believe John Ford directed this wreck. I hope he was really off drinking with Sam Peckinpah and maybe this mess was actually an Ed Wood project. Living up to his first name Strode appears wooden throughout but what a physique! Woody's pecs and biceps and the beautiful shots of Monument Valley all make for nice scenery. But that was it as far as this movie's assets. As for the bad acting it was close but I'll have to go with Willis Bouchey as the worst of the bunch for his completely amateurish and inept mishandling of the role of Otis Fosgate who presides over Rutledge's trial. Honorable mention to Jeffrey Hunter Constance Towers Billie Burke and Judson Pratt for mangling their parts. Carleton Young actually isn't too bad as the prosecutor but he like the rest has to read and deliver his lines off a script that stinks to high heaven. The sexist scenes of the treatment of the women at the trial is beneath contempt but the confession scene at the end of the trial as well as the very final closing scene with HunterTowers and the black soldiers are really the twin icings on this mudcake. Just terrible. An accidental comedy.".

And it often seems like the title character is more like a prop with romantic defenders Jeffrey Hunter as Tom Cantrell and Constance Towers as Mary Beecher taking center stage. Finally the courtroom and location flashbacks aren't juxtaposed well until the exciting climaxes. Watch for fluttering Billie Burke as Cordelia in her last featured role.Also Ford extra Mae Marsh as Nellie gets a relatively good amount of screen time playing obviously a fluttery friend of Billie Burke. Ford and many members of his troupe absolutely recalled Ms. Marsh's courtroom appearance in D.W.

	schema:headline " John Ford's Tribute to the Buffalo Soldiers of the Old West";
	schema:reviewBody "Unlike most of Director John Ford's Westerns that feature much action Sergeant Rutledge is mainly a courtroom drama told mainly in flashback. The time is 1881. The gist of the story is a black Ninth US Cavalry sergeant accused in the rape and murder of a teenaged white girl Lucy Dabney Toby Michaels and also the murder of her father. Woody Strode ably plays the role of the sergeant Braxton Rutledge. When he tells his enlisted men about white woman's business we know he is talking about serious trouble. Rutledge's capable courtroom defender is Lt. Tom Cantrell Jeffrey Hunter whose job is to piece together the facts despite constant badgering by the prosecutor Captain Shattuck. In a highly emotional setting Shattuck likes to make racial innuendos although he is dealing with a military court of savvy men. Complicating matters is an Apache Mescalero outbreak of hostilities. Later in the film there are two interesting engagements between the Buffalo soldiers and the Apaches. The movie is fine enough despite two drawbacks 1 It is too long and 2 the weak trial resolution. The confession by the real murderer is overdramatic and contrived. It is doubtful that anyone in US court has made such a strange confession especially when the evidence was hardly circumstantial I had to have her!. Perhaps the real killer had a change of conscience. But despite its drawbacks the film was groundbreaking in its day and still is enjoyable today. Onlocation shooting in Monument Valley and Mexican Hat note the hat rock formation in the background shots is always spectacular. A nice shot is that of the troopers standing firm in line of battle with the Indians. Captain Buffalo is a moving western song about the soldiers. Lt. Cantrell explains to Mary Beecher Constance Towers the origin of the name Buffalo soldiers. To stay warm in winter the black troops wore coats and hats made of Buffalo hides. As they thus appeared like buffaloes the Indians dubbed them Buffalo soldiers. There is another origin not mentioned in the movie The name relates to African hair that looked to the Indians like the shaggy buffalo coat in winter. In the feature quite a few Buffalo soldiers have speaking parts and future Olympic gold medal winner Rafer Johnson plays an army corporal. Sgt. Skidmore Juano Hernandez has a funny line Trouble come double sir. Rutledge has the best line in the movie when he tells Mary Beecher Lady you don't know how hard I'm trying to stay alive.Billie Burke Glenda the good witch 1939 was at 76 years as usual too old for her part as Cornelia the wife of Col. Otis Wingate 53 yearold Willis Bouchey. Here she shows her real age as she is fluttered and genuinely shocked when a teenaged girl rides her horse astride and not sidesaddle with legs close together as some ladies did back in olden times. She is also none too pleased when white women speak to black men. She certainly played the giddy one. Postscript Obviously after the period of the movie 65 years had to pass before four major events of the civil rights movement occurred 1 integration of interstate commerce in 1946 2 desegregation of the armed forces by Pres. Truman 1948 3 Brown vs. Topeka Board of education in 1954 and 4 the Montgomery bus strike 1955.".

It was a far cry from the demeaning stereotypes of black people that one found in the movies only a few years earlierincluding Ford's own The Sun Shines Bright. Today it's a different story. The movie seems obsessed with miscegenationthe sheer horror of a black man having intimate contact with a white woman! Good thing Sergeant Rutledge was an honorable man who would never do such a thing.Then there is the portrayal of Sergeant Rutledge as something larger than life. Instead of Stepin Fetchit we have The Noble Black Hero. We see Woody Strode in several poses designed to portray him as an almost mythic character.The movie alternates between courtroom scenes that are not very exciting and outdoor sequences that in true John Ford fashion are beautiful. The early sequence in the railroad station is dreamlike and scary. The views of Monument Valley are majestic.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Ford's grandson Dan wrote of Sergeant Rutledge that Pappy was really feeling his age on this one and I guess he's right. There is a scene near the beginning in which a cavalry officer Jeffrey Hunter meets the blond young Constance Towers. The scene takes place on a train at night. But Ford didn't bother to put the interior of the railroad car on rockers. The result is a static picture of two people talking on a stationary interior set.The same carelessness extends to the rest of the film. Many of the interiors were obviously shot in the studio with painted backdrops outside the window. The few images of Monument Valley true Ford territory are magnificent and stand out from the rest. The writers have given the defense counsel a big mistake in the dialog. Jeffrey Hunter argues that so far the evidence the court has is balanced but that one iota of evidence can tip the scales either way. Now even the most callow screenwriter knows that evidence does not come in iotas. It invariably comes in shreds.There is a problem with the casting as well. Willis Boucher is heading Woody Strode's court martial. He's always a reliable blowhard. And Jeffrey Hunter is a stalwart leading man. But it's arguable that Woody Strode himself can carry such a prominent part in a film. He's a football player not a natural actor. He has one monumental statement and handles it well but the speech is just a bit too long about one sentence too long. The rest of the acting is below par. Ford was at that point in his career where he was ready to pass out roles to old friends but his old friends were disappearing. This is one instance in which more of the John Ford stock company would have been a welcome substitution for actors in important roles who just can't handle it. The suave and supercilious Judge Advocate Carlton Young is fine but Constance Towers isn't much of an actress. Jan Styne as the son of the suttler Fred Libby has the capacity to act in a routine television sitcom and evidently has been allowed to do so. As his father Libby is a positive embarrassment being slapped around in the witness chair until he confesses to the rape and murder of a young blond  I had to HAVE her! I had to HAVE her! He slumps to the floor and pounds the seat of the chair sobbing and overacting. Perry Mason would never have allowed this to happen.Yet there's something enjoyable about the movie. Not just that it was made by John Ford but that it's a courtroom drama with enough outdoor action scenes to keep a viewer interested. There are a few plot holes but what's the difference? Ford is making up for all the butchery he's visited upon minorities in the United States. Killed more Indians than Chivington and Custer combined he said  or something like it. I'm too lazy to look up the exact quote. It's a little confusing but at no point is it boring. Another observation. The cavalry officers all have trouser stripes of burnt orange whereas the legal officers wear stripes of a kind of bright platinum. I much prefer the latter. They're really spiffy. And if I were to join the postwar cavalry I would make sure I was a lawyer so I could wear those brilliant trouser strips instead of the dull gold of the cavalry.I'm giving it six points but I'm being a little generous in doing so.".

The family is all set to go on a vacation so he figures it shouldn't be too much of a problem. When he hits the house late at night everything seems normal aside from a suspicious guard dog leashed in the front yard. Arkin shrugs it off and goes for the safe but while attempting to crack the combination he hears someone moving about in the house. You see Arkin isn't the only intruder on the property. A sadistic madman has beaten him to the punch only he isn't interested in collecting gemstones. He's interested in collecting people that he deems worthy and those that he doesn't will meet a most unpleasant end.Going into this film on the weekend of it's theatrical release at the very least I had hoped for a pleasant diversion. It had certainly caught my eye but the director's connection with the atrocious Saw franchise gave me reservations. Fortunately not only did I have nothing to worry about but seeing it wound up being the best time I had in a theater last year. What transpires for the majority of the film's running time is a tense game of cat and mouse between Arkin and the collector. You can tell that the latter suspects someone else is running around the house but Arkin manages to avoid him while trying to rescue the family in the process. In fact the collector never would have known about Arkin as he was out of the house without ever having been spotted. That damn kid!Marcus Dunstan and his crew really did a lot with the budget they had. The film has a unique look and sound design. The look is a large part of what drew me to the film in the first place back when the TV spots were airing. Solid use of music as well. It's fierce it's visceral and it's nasty but the atmosphere created here is what sets the thing apart from others. That and the collector himself a wicked villain who goes after his victims with an intensity that I found refreshing. No slow slasher walk here. The eyes were a nice touch too reflective like those of an animal.The security system from Hell is an intriguing twist on your typical home invasion setup. It certainly makes for some unique situations. There's a different trap around every corner so no running at full blast to make an escape and you had better watch where you fall. The boyfriend's fate is the film's best set piece almost Grand Guignol in it's execution. There's also one demise that can best be described as human flypaper.There are some suspension of disbelief flaws in there but I enjoyed the ride too much to really mind in this case. It's a mean horror film that is strong on mood and takes itself seriously. Hard to believe it's from the guys behind various Saw movies as I can't stand any of those.".

Eventually  and this was a natural progression of the retarded regression of this increasingly cretinous subgenre  the serialkiller acquired magical powers as well but without becoming a ghost or a demon which is the only way all this illogical piffle could be halfway justified. This is when the movie serialkiller became invincible. By the 00s he had as much power as all the Nordic and Hindu gods combined and then some. TC another recent entry in a long line of such amazingly mindless little filmic concoctions. If green bugeyed aliens ever invade us and slaughter us all they might one day find a copy of TC watch it and then realize Yup we were right all along. We did the right thing.The Collector duh name is a man not a creature who has no rhyme reason or purpose. He simply shows up at a random household kills and tortures everyone in sight but has a generally friendly relationship with spiders and large bloodsucking cockroaches which he keeps in jars and occasionally feeds with blood pouring out of his victims' stomachs. We are told by his bloodied and beaten up bait that the Collector kills people he doesn't need and keeps those he wants. Huh? Not in one scene is there the slightest indication that this might be true he kills everyone. Besides what would he keep any of those dumb stereotypes captive for? They're awfullywritten Tinseltown characters who the hell needs them? I certainly don't. So in a sense the collector is quite right to kill them all but while he's at it he should have gone for the writers' and the director's throats too and then jumped off a cliff the only way to get rid of ALL of the wasteful carbonbased debris here.Nor is it even clear how the hell bait knows this about the collector considering that the killer doesn't utter a word during the entire movie. I can't quite picture the killer driving with bait sitting in the back of the van in his box the two holding a conversation Well you know I keep those I want and kill those I don't want. That's kinda my shtick. In fact when the movie finishes you are nonethewiser about either the killer's appearance motivation or his background. He starts off as the perennial nondescript Man In The Mask and he leaves the movie as the Man In The Mask pissing off in his van. The point? None. What have we gained from TC? Diarrhea. The writers didn't even bother to give us a backstory not even vague clues to it. To return the favour I won't bother to watch anything else they ever did or will do in the future certainly a great way to build up a fanbase. The killer manages to set about a gazillion boobytraps within a single night a workload that a team of experts would be required for working for at least a day. The boobytraps are so intricate and spread out that it would require slow tiptoe walking  at all times  for this socalled collector to even move about the house without falling into any of them especially since it is dark half the time. He has superhuman strength and this description might be considered an insult by the collector because his physical prowess is about 1000 times larger than superhuman and yet the burglar manages to throw him around the kitchen like a rag doll. Even sillier by that point the burglar shouldn't have had energy left to punch out a baby seal let alone a killer with Jedi powers the burglar had already been cut butchered tortured burned slashed and diced Perhaps he too has superhuman powers? Why would I even ask this question of course he does.As does the little girl. Her very predictable survival is just one of the many symptoms of the clichd script. Somehow she manages to achieve what none of the seven adults had. Not the only predictable plotdevice or turn of events did the writers of this tired script actually think that we didn't anticipate that the burglar would be hit by a police car? That's the oldest shtick in the book. What we could NOT anticipate however was that the writers would actually get the collector to ram his car against the ambulance and then pick up the burglar whom he then very predictably sticks into his baitbox  nevermind the dozen police cars all around. Just so the filmmakers ensured that we know that everyone in this movie is either a mindless zombie moron or a hellfire demongod the burglar actually CARES about the fact that he's got the diamond and even ASKS the ambulance technician what time it is so that he can deliver it on time to his loser wife. That scene could have been so funny  in a silly ZAZ comedy. Why would they include such a goofy funny moment in a sadistickillerontheloose thriller. I am so SURPRISED that such a perfectly puttogether movie would have such a silly glitch.But it's me who's silly I am actually trying to tie some of these dumb shenanigans to the real world. TC's parallel universe makes the Hellraiser franchise seem like a BBC science documentary series. There is nothing in this runofthemill flick that even remotely has to do with the world we humans inhabit. This ridiculous story might as well be set on planet Zong.".

They're awfullywritten Tinseltown characters who the hell needs them? I certainly don't. So in a sense the collector is quite right to kill them all but while he's at it he should have gone for the writers' and the director's throats too and then jumped off a cliff the only way to get rid of ALL of the wasteful carbonbased debris here.Nor is it even clear how the hell bait knows this about the collector considering that the killer doesn't utter a word during the entire movie. I can't quite picture the killer driving with bait sitting in the back of the van in his box the two holding a conversation Well you know I keep those I want and kill those I don't want. That's kinda my shtick. In fact when the movie finishes you are nonethewiser about either the killer's appearance motivation or his background. He starts off as the perennial nondescript Man In The Mask and he leaves the movie as the Man In The Mask pissing off in his van. The point? None. What have we gained from TC? Diarrhea. The writers didn't even bother to give us a backstory not even vague clues to it. To return the favour I won't bother to watch anything else they ever did or will do in the future certainly a great way to build up a fanbase. The killer manages to set about a gazillion boobytraps within a single night a workload that a team of experts would be required for working for at least a day. The boobytraps are so intricate and spread out that it would require slow tiptoe walking  at all times  for this socalled collector to even move about the house without falling into any of them especially since it is dark half the time. He has superhuman strength and this description might be considered an insult by the collector because his physical prowess is about 1000 times larger than superhuman and yet the burglar manages to throw him around the kitchen like a rag doll. Even sillier by that point the burglar shouldn't have had energy left to punch out a baby seal let alone a killer with Jedi powers the burglar had already been cut butchered tortured burned slashed and diced Perhaps he too has superhuman powers? Why would I even ask this question of course he does.As does the little girl. Her very predictable survival is just one of the many symptoms of the clichd script. Somehow she manages to achieve what none of the seven adults had. Not the only predictable plotdevice or turn of events did the writers of this tired script actually think that we didn't anticipate that the burglar would be hit by a police car? That's the oldest shtick in the book. What we could NOT anticipate however was that the writers would actually get the collector to ram his car against the ambulance and then pick up the burglar whom he then very predictably sticks into his baitbox  nevermind the dozen police cars all around. Just so the filmmakers ensured that we know that everyone in this movie is either a mindless zombie moron or a hellfire demongod the burglar actually CARES about the fact that he's got the diamond and even ASKS the ambulance technician what time it is so that he can deliver it on time to his loser wife. That scene could have been so funny  in a silly ZAZ comedy. Why would they include such a goofy funny moment in a sadistickillerontheloose thriller. I am so SURPRISED that such a perfectly puttogether movie would have such a silly glitch.But it's me who's silly I am actually trying to tie some of these dumb shenanigans to the real world. TC's parallel universe makes the Hellraiser franchise seem like a BBC science documentary series. There is nothing in this runofthemill flick that even remotely has to do with the world we humans inhabit. This ridiculous story might as well be set on planet Zong.";

	schema:reviewBody "If you're tired of all of the watered down PG13 socalled horror movies of late and if the thought of sitting through one more remake or reimagining as the studios have dubbed them makes you want to tear your hair out then The Collector will be a welcome respite. Yes there are similarities to Saw and Hostel and yes some will deride this flick as being nothing more than the latest entry into the torture porn genre but if you're a horror fan and you let those things deter you from experiencing this film on the big screen then you're going to miss out on a truly enjoyable evening at the movies.Full disclosure I LOVED the original Saw and have at least liked all of the sequels. I wasn't a big fan of the original Hostel and there have been several other socalled torture flicks that have elicited no response from me other than a big yawn. The writersdirectors of The Collector were involved in the creation of Saw 46 but I think that they've done a much better job with this movie.Don't go into this flick expecting a complete retread of Saw because you're not going to get it. Sure there's a killer who utilizes a form of traps to kill people but his methods are different. First off he gets his own hands dirty unlike Jigsaw who sits back and watches from a distance. Second redemption apparently doesn't matter to him. The major difference between The Collector and Jigsaw is that Jigsaw gives people a chance to save themselves. The Collector doesn't want you to live... unless you're the one that he's chosen to collect see tag line He always takes one.This film has a basic plot but it's in its simplicity that it excels. There are no convoluted layers to see past or to laugh at as is so often the case and the basic setup doesn't try to be anything fancy. You'll learn everything that you need to know about the main characters within the first 15 minutes and then you can just sit back and watch everything unfold.The camera work is excellent and the film comes across as extremely dark discordant and claustrophobic. The soundtrack is perfectly in tune with the feel of the movie and really heightens the timing of each of the scares.By now I'm sure that you've heard that the film is very bloody and that's an understatement. There is nothing contained within the trailers that will prepare you for what you're going to see on the big screen. The film made everyone in the audience be they young old male or female gasp at least once.If you're into gore I highly recommend that you see this film and make sure that you stay until the end of the credits.".

I can only describe it by calling it a scary soap opera. My friends and I literally spent the first 1520 minutes of the movie laughing. But we figured that wasn't why you watched horror movies anyway so we kept going with it. Then as it moved into the more intense part of the movie it just got worse. The main character Arkin has scoped out a house that he's going to rob to pay child support an attempt at character development?. He goes in the house while the family is supposedly away and in the time that it took Arkin to crack one number on their safe the collector has managed to set elaborate traps in EVERY ROOM of the house. The next twenty minutes of the movie are spent watching Arkin wander aimlessly through the house finding the traps and making pathetic attempts to escape. Then we find out that the family is already captured inside the house! Why on earth did he set traps??? For himself?? For random burglars that are coincidentally breaking into the house at the same time does this happen often??? For any teenagers that just want to have sex in the house?? How convenient! All of those happened! And just when you think that at least the ending MAY be decent that gets ruined too! You spend 90 minutes watching this guy that you never really cared about finally escape from this house just to watch him get smashed by the police coming to save him. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry or just punch the wall so I literally stood up and walked out of the room cursing the fact that I had just WASTED an hour and a half of life.That's how bad it was. Pathetic.".

From the writers of 'Saw 46' comes a new chapter in America's love affair with the subgenre known as torture porn. To me it plays more like an Rrated 'Home Alone'. You know if Macauley Culkin's traps were made VERY effective.I was expecting a standard horrorslasher flick when taking my seat and was pleasantly surprised. the opening credits mix somewhere between the opening sequence of 'Se7en' and a Tool music video sets up perfectly the mood in which you will spend the next hour and a half. confused but intrigued. freaked out but with a big grin on your face. there is plenty of gore for fans but not nearly as much as one would expect from graduates of the Saw school of horror. whilst our hero sneaks amongst the boobytrapped household trying not to set up a carpet of steel bear traps awesome! or tripwires connected to swinging blades of death also nice perhaps the creepiest thing in the movie is the way in which the director sparingly uses the killer. We rarely actually see him acting out his brutality upon his victims. But when crouched in a corner watching two hot young teens do what they do best and the light reflects off of the corneas of his dead eyes hidden behind that odd silk mask... yeesh! Another pleasant surprise to the film is it's use of quiet a rarity in horror movies especially torture porn. Most of the film's action is in hiding which means the protagonist must avoid detection at all times. There were screams in the theater but about 89 of those were coming from the audience.I would definitely recommend this to a movie fan with a strong gut and a healthy sense of what's going to be behind Door 3? curiosity. Bonus points for being the fist movie to actually visualize the classic childhood game of Can'tTouchtheFloorBecausetheFloorisHotLava well played".

	schema:reviewBody "As the story of the Collector unfolds it quickly becomes obvious that writerdirector Marcus Dunstan is knowledgeable when it comes to the horror genre and knows what makes people click. First there is a 70s80s feel to this movie. From the dirtyish cinematography to the pacing editing and the casting choices a lot of this reminds me of the less polished horror films of these decades. One of the aspects where this movie shines is with its protagonist Arkin. A downonhis luck handyman struggling to pay his bills. Josh Stewart was a revelation for me in this role. I can't wait to see what the future has in store for this actor. Is he a onenote actor who was perfectly cast or is this some serious talent? I for one would lean toward the latter. Stewart is perfect in making us feel Arkin is a decent guy with a will of is own but just suffers from a total lack of respect by the people around him. He oozes charisma despite the loser role he has to work with and reminds me a little bit of Sean Penn. What makes the film effective is really exploring the character of Arkin early on. There is a simple situation driving this man to do what he is about to do and we can relate to him. Unfortunately the movie begins to lose steam when Arkin gets inside the house. At first the traps and situations are intriguing. But character and story development halts to a crawl. Who is the collector and what is the meaning of this collection? We don't really know and Dunstan doesn't seem to care in the least. Themes explored throughout the movies? Again doesn't seem very relevant. As the story progresses the traps become the star of the film and the whole thing seems more and more farfetched. What should be the meat around the bone becomes the entire movie. The concept seems more like the latest horror gimmick. It's a somewhat interesting and entertaining one but one must deplore all the character development of Arkin if the rest of the movie was really just about mindless fun. All in all this is a solid movie reminiscent of the trashy dirty 70s and early 80s horror flicks. But it seems to be lacking in themes and symbolism that made those movies so great and I sensed the writing lost its purpose midway. I also deplore what I sense like a desperate attempt to build a franchise as opposed to make a great movie. The movie seems like a setup for sequels a TV series pilot more than a single work of art to be enjoyed. The movie deserves a 5.5 and is relatively welldone. If this review seems harsh it's just that the first half hour or so lets you think the movie will be much more powerful than it actually ends up being. Very curious to see if a sequel will be done for this one.".

Do we really need to see Marcus Dunstan's gratuitous on screen violence and brutalities to deal with during our current economic turmoil? Frankly I don't think so! We shouldn't welcome inhumane tortures and brutal abuses in real life we don't need to see them in films. This film is perhaps reflective of the twisted and warped mentalities of Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton? None of the cast members in this film does offer memorable or praiseworthy acting talents. The film basically is clustered with scenes of barbarous acts of killing of gruesome traps chasing or being chased and a series of hideand seek rigmaroles. Dialog is scanty and trasy and basically a composite of groans and screams. It doesn't really take any experienced actor to take on any of this film's roles. Even Josh Stewart as the main protagonist clearly lacks emotional expressiveness! It'd be hilarious if Dunstan and Melton should decide to offer a sequel of this awful film. What can they offer except for the same opening with their 'evil' box landing in another address and the rest of the film with more glamorization of inhumane tortures and brutality in a crappy with lame dialog and ridiculous characters.I'm surprised that this disgusting film is not rated NC17.".

So fair enough he is some nut that wanted to torture humans but why all the traps? I feel that this film is a 'copy' of the SAW movies in part. Horror with lots of graphic and clever twists.Unfortunately they are not clever and make no sense.All in all don't bother read a book or go for a walk but avoid this dribble at all costs.".

Don't bother to waste two hours of your life watching this total and utter garbage.The story makes little sense the acting is terrible and the direction is very poor! Most of the time you can hardly see what is going on because its set at night.i'm not going to go into details about the plot as that has already been covered.What i cannot understand is how 'The Collector' managed to rig all those traps in just a few hours and why? So fair enough he is some nut that wanted to torture humans but why all the traps? I feel that this film is a 'copy' of the SAW movies in part. Horror with lots of graphic and clever twists.Unfortunately they are not clever and make no sense.All in all don't bother read a book or go for a walk but avoid this dribble at all costs.";

On the other hand you could also say that there might be no way that someone who is crazy can know that.Of course this is a horror movie the tag on the coverposter should be a giveaway and so you will have quite a few bloody scenes in the movie I think it is not yet available completely uncut in Germany so you should know that this is not so much a psychological movie a bit too but more a movie about violence.

He was actually quite silly looking. And many of the traps were asinine like something a 5th grader would come up with. Not scary not thrilling not even believable. And in the middle of all this enter some criminal element thread that was completely disjointed from the plot. It was just cut in there clumsy to the point of painfulness. Again a prime opportunity for extremely poor acting and the director didn't disappoint. I admit I liked the first Saw movie but none of the rest of them. I guess I'm just not a traps sort of movie fan. I'm a fan of solid characters and dialogue strong plot development believable situations etc. Ya know movie stuff. I tend to hold my nose and cut short films like this. Indeed I turned it off somewhere in the middle or perhaps two thirds of the way? I don't know. I stopped paying attention at that point.

The Collector is much more than just another cashin attempt to make some coin. Director Marcus Dunstain clearly had a vision with this one. The killer in this one is not someone that asks questions. Jigsaw was a nasty individual as well but he had a motive for doing what he was doing a reason if you will. The Collector Creepily played by Juan Fernandez just likes to hurt people. He's gleefully psychotic and kills people in the most sickening ways imaginable for his own demented pleasures. There is no background on this guy and that makes him all the more terrifying. In some ways that could have worked against it but I didn't feel it was needed here and added to the atmosphere. The gore scenes deliver. I won't spoil them but gore hounds will be replenished for their thirst. My only real carps are I wish the finale went on a tad longer and that is was hard to make out what was going in a couple scenes because I had trouble seeing. It was a bit too dark. William Prael plays for a very good reluctant hero. His desperation had me rooting for him. I enjoyed him a lotFinal Thoughts Sometimes a second viewing does wonders. It sure did with the Collector. It's not perfect but it's a highly suspenseful thrill ride that lacks the budget of a Saw but is arguably better than a lot of the Saw sequels. Recommended.

For starters the production values were above average for a Canadian movie of the time except for when we see the snake at the end  it does indeed look like it was made out of paper mache. There are a few impressive gore effects though not as much as you might think and the sorority house attack sequence is pretty amusing. It was slow at times but seldom could you find it boring.But I won't deny that the movie is filled with problems. The editing is quite bad at times with scenes cut short and some information seemingly missing. The whole snake cult subplot turns out to be for NOTHING  the movie would need very little additional rewriting if it was completely cut out. The scenes are mixed together with clumsiness  after Peter Fonda's character is introduced it takes about half an hour before he returns! Ultimately the movie completely falls apart around the last 20 minutes or so leading to an awful climax and ending. Not just awful but abrupt  it's pretty clear the ending was considerably tinkered around with in the editing room for some reason. Could it originally have been even more awful than this? Quite possibly.".

	schema:reviewBody "The ultimate in cheesy monster movies this lowbudget oddity is blessed with a betterthanaverage cast for the genre but otherwise it falls mostly subpar. It's a slowmoving and often boring mess with long passes of dialogue about nothing in particular an unintelligent script which often repeats the same words and passes and direction which shows absolutely no flair for visual art. Its also one of those movies which ran out of money during production meaning that at the end we get lots of padded footage from earlier in the movie which doesn't make much sense being inserted where it is. The simple storyline involves a giant snake being transported to America where it escapes of course  the film wouldn't exist if it didn't and wreaks havoc on a university campus.The best and most hilarious part of the movie sees the snake invade a sorority house where it stalks the screaming naked girls like an ultracheesy Michael Myers impersonation. Here's a film which utilises a dated 'snake cam' often used since in monster movies and such where we see the bloody deaths through the snake's tinted blue vision. The sappy Tangerine Dream theme song only adds to the weirdness of the proceedings. For the blood and guts fan the film reaches about an average level of grue with some bloody snake bites and attacks and at least one bit of fun rubbery special effects which shows a victim swelling and disintegrating as a result of a snake bite! The snake itself is a cheesy papiermch type model but it serves its purpose well and at least looks fairly imaginative.Heading the cast is Peter Fonda delivering a typically bland laid back turn as an investigating doctor. However his character hangs around in the sidelines and doesn't actually achieve much as a hero. The heroine is also extremely bland so its left to our favourite ham Oliver Reed to deliver the performance goods. From trancing out in a static box to slashing at the venomous serpent with a knife come the abrupt but powerhouse climax he's in control and he makes the movie. The only other cast member of note is Al Waxman typecast as a slimy villain who hams with gusto. Aside from a few fun performances a handful of decent action bits and some slimy special effects however SPASMS is an unusually bland movie and for the most part a disappointment.".

Since the encounter the hunter is telepathically linked to each attack done by the snake by way of an allblue color perspective. The serpent is eventually captured after a vicious rampage against the island's native inhabitants and smuggled to North America for research when it escapes it's handlers. From there all hell breaks loose setting up a final fateful confrontation with Reed's character. Spasms is a fairly decent suspense movie that will keep you riveted as you follow the snake's indiscriminate path toward each doomed victim it encounters. Special effects are generally good for it's time showing some of the damage impact of the serpent's poison on it's victims but shots of the rarely shown snake itself does reveal some limitations due to lack of budget...this movie would be a good candidate for a CGI enhanced remake with increased budget to tie up the original's loose ends mainly the believability of the snake itself. The movie is loosely adapted from the novel Death Bite. Spasms is an increasingly hard to find title which so far is only available in it's outofprint VHS format.".

This crap movie won't appeal to fans of grotesque creature features nor will it to lovers of typically cheesy 80's horror. The inventors of the story were stupid enough to use an unreal snakespecies so don't expect to actually see the creature as nobody knows what it looks like. Instead the screen turns blue when the events are supposedly seen through the snake's eyes and its victims just try to look terrified as the camera rapidly approaches them. William Fruet who's actually a personal favorite horror director of mine because he made the very competent House by the Lake and Funeral Home totally messes things up here as he never manages to create any tension and completely fails to make the viewer emphatic with the characters. There wasn't enough money to finish the film so they seemingly also cut back on lighting and set pieces. The whole thing is extremely dark and lacking decors. I bet Peter Fonda is still wondering to this day what purpose he served by accepting this role as he adds absolutely nothing at all.".

Yes there is a bit of gore such as when victims react to the snake venom. I appreciate all that went into doing such an effect now in the age of quick CGI effects.The film is slow in places the snake is barely seen for most of the film and may not impress too much once you've seen it but overall I enjoyed it as a product of its time and had fun with it. Also early 80's soundtrack contributors Tangerine Dream supply the song over the closing credits that's worth checking out on its own.".

The scene  at the sorority is remarkably exploitive and gratuitous and it's one of the most overdirected moments ever caught on film. It's fun to watch because it's so overthetop silly and exploitive that you can't help but laugh at it all. But the whole moment doesn't add anything to the movie and they could have spent the money that cost to shoot that fun but useless moment on a better ending or a better snake. After the scene when Al Waxman is killed in the van the scenes before his death are long and pointless SPASMS suddenly becomes a oneman show we only see Oliver Reed overacting and walking around with flashbacks of all the POV shots of the killing or attacks the snake had made previously. The flashback scenes of the snakes POV shots are PADDING and the producers needed to extend the movie for a little longer before the stupid abrupt conclusion because they ran out of money. So for almost 10 long minutes we see Reed walking about like an imbecile the whole moment intercut with the flashback scenes which are useless because the initial scenes were still fresh in my mind.

It concerns a gigantic serpent captured on a faroff island which is brought to America for experiments. The beast escapes and goes on a killing rampage but Reed is able to track it down because he shares a psychic link with it after it bit him on a hunting expedition years previously. I watched this movie with a girl who was terrifed of snakes. Even she found it awful. The snake looks so fake and the scenes in which it attacks victims are so devoid of tension that there is nothing remotely scary about the film. Reed and Fonda are in this purely for the money. Their performances are neither interesting or interested and the chemistry between the pair is nonexistent. I felt insulted by this movie and I wanted my money back after hiring it. Don't make the same mistake as me steer clear of this film!".

It concerns a gigantic serpent captured on a faroff island which is brought to America for experiments. The beast escapes and goes on a killing rampage but Reed is able to track it down because he shares a psychic link with it after it bit him on a hunting expedition years previously. I watched this movie with a girl who was terrifed of snakes. Even she found it awful. The snake looks so fake and the scenes in which it attacks victims are so devoid of tension that there is nothing remotely scary about the film. Reed and Fonda are in this purely for the money. Their performances are neither interesting or interested and the chemistry between the pair is nonexistent. I felt insulted by this movie and I wanted my money back after hiring it. Don't make the same mistake as me steer clear of this film!";

	schema:reviewBody "I think I liked this a whole lot more than most as it is indeed riddled with the most obvious flaws  all of which somehow come back to a script that doesn't work completely nor is allowed to due to budgetary problems. Oliver Reed plays a wealthy businessman who had gone on a hunting trip with his brother seven years ago. While there he was bitten by this supernatural snake whose venom mysteriously didn't kill Reedthough did his brother but rather made a psychic connection with him instead. ? Anyhow the film opens with Reed having some hunters capture the beast in Micronesia and bring it to him in San Diego. Reed enlists the help of Peter Fonda as a psychic specialist giving him a full laboratory and underwriting for research. While this is going on a snake cult leader wants to abduct this snakehow they initially knew about it is even a greater mysteryand they have hired Warren CrowleyAl Waxman as the sleazy man who will get them the snake for their cult  not to be worshiped but because the snake is the great Satan or some crap like that. The story quickly erodes however into the snake being unleashed in San Diego and going on a killing spree. What exactly do we see? It surely isn't the snake. We get some angles of his head but never a body shot. We do get these color muted scenes that are suppose to be things from the snake's POV as well as Reed's once the psychic hotline is stronger. Believe it or not this POV stuff works and is not really that bad. But the rest of the film cannot carry these small moments terribly far nor a plot that just wasn't finished. We never get any closure with the snake cult  it just disappears at some point in the film. Peter Fonda is barely in the film despite a prominent role. Oliver Reed looking like he could use a trip or two to the gym walkswith a cane through his role with unrealistic calmness at some points and unbelievable hysteria at others until the end comes and it is the low point of the film in every definition of that word. Despite all those things I kind of liked Spasms. Director William Fruet has obvious skills though he doesn't always share them with us. Reed and Fonda are indeed bad but in an enjoyable manner. Al Waxman is a hoot. There are some weird inexplicable plot threads beyond explanation  what about Reed's relationship with his niece? Were they going for some incest thing or something else? We never do find out though the foundation had been laid much earlier. The biggest problem with the film is not the acting the direction or the ridiculous story but the misnamed title. This film should never have been called Spasms. Yes we some faces bloated and popping all over when bitten by this snake. The effects are intriguing to say the least. The film would have been better served if called something that was more closely related to what the film was about. How about The Seven Year Snake Meets the Seven Year Itch. Snake Eyes. Snake in my Head. Okay a more serious attempt might be Venom or something simple. Again I concur this is a very bad film but one that I liked for being somewhat fun. There are a couple scenes which stand out the darkened opening scene where you seebarely due to the poor lighting the men Reed has hired to catch the serpent looking on when the serpent opens assault on the natives. How about the greenhouse at the university where Fonda and niece run from the snake. The three girls being snaked to death in their homecatch the pretty blonde in the shower sans clothing Or my favorite scene is the girl in the bikini catching a ball in a park. Man was that a snug fit...uh hummm...Spasms is a fun trashy film to some degree...take it from me.".

It also left him with a strange disorder where he has some sort of mental connection with the serpent. Reed pay a hunter to capture the snake and ship it back to America where he wants a doctor Peter Fonda to find out what's going on. But of course the snake escapes and goes around killing people.SPASMS also known as the second of two killer snake films from Reed isn't that good of a movie. In fact while watching the film I could easily see why this sat on a shelf for a couple years before finally getting released. The movie is a real disappointment and especially if you're a fan of such movies where a large animal breaks free and goes around killing people.The biggest problem with the film is its screenplay. I mean a psychic connection between Reed and the snake? Yes that is an original buildup for a story but c'mon! That's a bit too silly even for a grade B horror movie. Another problem is that the snake doesn't get nearly enough action. There are way too many scenes with characters talking about the snake and these are just boring and go nowhere. I would also argue that the film is at its most entertaining when the snake is doing its thing because we get some pretty good special effects and especially seeing the body reaction to the venom.Reed and Fonda are always worth watching but I think it's fair to say that both of them were simply picking up a paycheck with their performances. The supporting cast really isn't much better. Did I mention the silly POV shots of the snake? These here really didn't help matters either. Overall SPASMS is a pretty bad and disappointing movie that could have and should have been much better.".

Spasms is a daft cheaply made creature feature shocker from the early 80's with two recognizable stars attached Oliver Reed and Peter Fonda collecting their pay cheques but delivering two extremes in their acting. Reed hauntingly hams it up I really believe I'm bounded to it while Fonda keeps it cool and collected. Outside of those two there were some other familiar names involved. Director  cowriter William Fruet is no beginner to the genre with making films like Death Weekend and Funeral Home before this one. Cinematographer Mark Irwin shows up. Then you have the Tangerine Dream adding to the score. Although these curious inclusions don't add too much and it shows in the final product. A gigantic deadly serpent is transported from a Pacific island back to the States and is kept boxed up at a university where Dr. Brazilian is hired by wealthy businessman Jason Kincaid to experiment on the telepathy link Kincaid shares with the serpent. However before doing so it comes loose and goes about terrorising the community. The systematic plot actually starts of rather well setting up the mood but it really does lose its way when it goes on the rampage becoming simpleminded outrageous and ending on a very lousy incoherent climax. Neither is it that fun when the rampage transpires or in its tackiness. Even the muddled script has a few story threads which are incompatible and abrupt like the subplot involving a religious snake worshiping fanatic. Director Fruet's handling is cramp and rudimentary in its execution with lopsided pacing by lingering on many talky exchanges. Supposedly the production runout of money towards the backend and its shows by padding it out with recycled snakevision shots that happened early on in the film. The attack sequences are too little and the ones that occur are vicious and jolting in an exploitative manner but rather tensionless with the snake mainly staying offscreen and the victim being thrown around. We only get glimpses of the serpent until it comes to the final reel when the rubber beast is fully shown. It doesn't look that great and you could see why the lighting was mostly dim. On the other hand bluefiltered serpent vision got a real work out and was welldone. The most memorable thing about this production would have to be the aftermath of the serpent's attacks as the ghastly makeup FX was vivid in its depiction of the skin bubbling and blistering. Outside the two stars there were decent support from Kerrie Keane and Al Waxman.Spasms has a poor reputation and rightfully so but I was slightly entertained.".

Instead of some tripped out perverse creature feature epic what starts out as a kind of intriguing voodoo revenge crossed with nature striking back drama quickly devolves into a giant rampaging rubbery monster movie.The tipoff should have been the PointOfView photography meant to show the snake's view of the world as it stalked  attacked it's prey. When handled correctly i.e. ALIENS 3 or even RATMAN with David Warbeck P.O.V. photography can add an element to a film by showing people reacting to a genuine menace. Here it is just a relatively cheap gimmick meant to take the place of showing the monster however and nothing really important or revealing is seen during the P.O.V. shots to indicate that hey! this is a big weird freaky snake on the rampage. SPASMS could have been a movie about a monster kitty cat on the loose or maybe a runaway vacuum cleaner. Come to think of it now THERE is an idea!!The choice of having the monster be a snake was arbitrary and raises a couple of silly nagging questions about the thing How was it able to send pretty brunette coeds flying through the air with enough force to not just smash into a bathroom door but fly clean through the door to smack against the shower stall? Snakes have no arms or fingers no feet to dig into the ground to get a firm purchase on the floor and use momentum to get a 125lb human body into motion. Maybe it was smacking people around with it's head like a baseball bat. Evidence to the contrary the snake was also intelligent enough to have seen horror movies and know where to go to kill people most notably a college dormitory. It also knew where Oliver Reed lived suggesting access to a rolladecks. This is some snake.The one thing I was pleased by in regards to the film is that while some live snakes were used during the early voodoomystics scenes none were used in the big horror finale. None appear to have been used to ill ends during the course of the film let alone exploited for their sexual connotations. Which when you think about it isn't exactly an easy thing to do in a horror movie about snakes especially those with naked shower scenes set in coed dormitories. Stripped of it's latent phallic horror the snake becomes just another juggernaut of animalfriendly destruction. The producers instead relied on a cheap looking giant rubber snake puppet which got laughs even when attacking the coed in the shower  which is never shown by the way. How can you fault a movie for not being exploitational enough? Next time anyone asks point them in the direction of SPASMS. Great sleazy name for a movie but if you are looking for lurid thrills forget it the people who made this film had something else in mind.Just what it is I haven't a clue It doesn't really work as a monster thriller until about the final 15 minutes by when most people would have followed the boys out the door to the art bar where you can't even smoke anymore. Fans of Peter Fonda will like the movie and devotees of dumb rubbery grade C monster movies will be well served though I will personally qualify this film as an enigma who's existence can only be explained by contract obligations.410 Has about a half dozen good laughs two really nice breasts and a conclusion rather than an ending.".

A bunch of Aboriginal natives are performing some kind of tribal ritual dancing around a bonfire complete with severed pigs heads on poles. Suddenly a giant snake appears well according to the film it does as we don't actually see it at this point it kills a few natives and then gets itself captured in a net by a hunter named Mendes Miguel Fernandez. Mendes works for rich businessman Jason Kincaid Oliver Reed and sends the giant snake back to the U.S. via a cargo ship before his untimely death. However Warren Crowley Al Waxman works for a secret snake worshipping religious cult run by Rev. Thomas Thanner George Bloomfield who wants the giant snake for himself as he believes it's the 'reincarnation of our leader'. Thanner has hired Crowley to obtain the snake by any means necessary. Crowley bribes a Sailor Patrick Brymer to steal the snake. While trying to do just that the Sailor is bitten by the snake and after his arm expands and bubbles he throws himself overboard. Kincaid wants the snake because while he was out hunting it killed his brother and bit him. Now Kincaid has a telepathic link with the snake Kincaid hires psychologist Dr. Tom Brazilian Peter Fonda to try  figure out the hold the snake has with him. Tom feels that telepathy is caused by a virus  and that the virus may have been present in the snakes venom therefore spiritually connecting both of them. Hey I didn't write this stuff OK? So the snake arrives in America  Tom convinces a friend Dr. Claire Rothman Marilyn Lightstone to keep it in her laboratory at the local University. That night Crowley  one of his goons Duncan Tyrone Angus MacInnes break into the University to try and steal the snake but only succeed in letting it escape into the night! A giant venomous snake is loose Tom along with Kincaid's niece Suzanne Cavadon Kerrie Keane decide they are responsible. As the snake starts to kill local residents they set about locating  destroying it but Kincaid  Crowley have other plans for it. Directed by William Fruet this is one silly excuse for a film. The script by Don Enright from the novel Death Bite by Micheal Maryk  Brent Monahan is an absolute mess as you can probably tell from my plot synopsis which makes it sound a lot better than it actually is. The main problem is that Spasms has no sense of it's own absurdity bizarre snake worshipping cults giant serpents attacking naked women in the shower telepathic links between humans  snakes are taken 100 seriously and played totally straight. It simply doesn't work  comes across as extremely silly. Having said that it moves along at a fair pace  isn't too boring at only 85 minutes. The ending was a bit of a disappointment too rather lazy  predictable. The snake itself isn't seen in it's entirety just glimpses to start with  by the end Fruet gives us a chance to scrutinise it's head which wasn't a good idea considering the cheapness of the effect. Spasms stand out moment has to be the part where Crowley is bitten his body and face starts to expand  bubble in a very impressive  gross special effect by Dick Smith among others. There isn't any other gore or violence worth mentioning besides this. The shower scene is wholly gratuitous did the female victim really need to be undressed taking a shower for the scene to work? Acting wise what on Earth are Oliver Reed  Peter Fonda doing in this complete  utter nonsense? All I can think is that they needed beer money badly if you know what I mean. The film is generally well made with nice production values  cinematography although director Fruet fails to inject the film with much flair or imagination. Spasms as a horror film fails totally as a piece of soso entertainment it's OK as a bizarre head shaking curiosity it can't be bettered. Just about worth watching if your a die hard horror fan like me otherwise don't bother.".

It's message is NOT that if you tie up and beat a woman she will love you in return.This is a movie about two people who are unable to master life on their own. This has led Ricky to the mental ward and Marina to being a drugaddicted porn star who just happens to have a streak of luck because a movie director is completely obsessed with her. In the end the two have found each other and it looks as if together they can find the happiness and home they always were looking for. Beautiful...Yes Ricky's method of convincing Marina to love him is horrible and unacceptable. His attitude toward women and life in general is seriously twisted and he just cannot think of any other way to get what he needs to fulfill his desire of living what he considers an ordinary life. Why does Marina fall for it? Probably because he's the first person who ever seemed to care about her. He fights to get her he fights to help her. Even if his interest in her is ruthless and possessive it is a genuine deep interest and that is what she has been missing all her life.I found Atame to be a fascinating and remarkable movie.

The director Pedro Almodvar is the same one who brought us masterpieces like Talk to her and All about my mother. Although you wouldn't figure it out from the plot lines of the three movies Tie me up Tie me down is much lighter and less involved than the other two.The pace as with all Almodvar's movies is just the right one not too fast or slow. I did not like the character of the director in the movie and did not like his acting that much... Probably the only weak couple of scenes are those depicting his infatuation with Marina.The ending may seem predictable and lame but I liked it. It is one of those feel good endings.Although there is a hot sexy scene in this movie I question the NC17 US rating for that scene. I saw so many Rrated movies that were much more explicit... My point is if you get this movie thinking it was one of those European soft porn flicks you will be disappointed.My vote 910.".

Probably the only weak couple of scenes are those depicting his infatuation with Marina.The ending may seem predictable and lame but I liked it. It is one of those feel good endings.Although there is a hot sexy scene in this movie I question the NC17 US rating for that scene. I saw so many Rrated movies that were much more explicit... My point is if you get this movie thinking it was one of those European soft porn flicks you will be disappointed.My vote 910.";

	schema:reviewBody "Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! is a film to see with an open mind. I found nothing offensive or sexist about this film which deals with two unusual and sexuallyliberated people of extremes. Ricky Antonio Banderas is a mental patient who had just been released from the sanitarium. Marina is an exporn star now doing a lowbudget horror movie. Marina is also a drug user. Ricky is obsessed with Marina  we later learn they were once sexual together. Ricky proceeds with his obsession and plans of romance and the future and kidnaps Marina. The kidnapping was not meant to be violent but events turn out to be somewhat violent. Ricky tells Marina she will fall in love with him and they will get married and have a family. Marina resists. Ricky feels such a need for Marina so much that he must tie her up and keep her quiet when he is sleeping or out of the apartment. He believes she will eventually fall in love with him but Marina's actions are discouraging. He tries to get her to like him when they are not in uncomfortable situations and he tries to be a good provider. He even becomes angry over Marina's drug abuse. Marina seems to adjust to her kidnapping  becomes more social with Ricky. He goes to lengths to provide Marina with the things she needs and ends up getting beaten up in the process. SPOILERS Marina suddenly finds herself feeling emotions for Ricky when he arrives beaten and bruised. She begins to kiss him  tries to make him feel better. They make lovehave sex lively and verbally. Ricky decides it is time to leave Madrid Spain and go elsewhere. Marina agrees. He steals a car but in the meantime Marina's colorful sister Lola Loles Leon discovers Marina. They take to escape as Ricky comes back to find he is now alone. Lola finds Marina's story disturbing and Marina's love for Ricky to be kinky. However Lola will help Marina find Ricky if Marina feels that strongly for him. Ricky  Marina are reunited with Lola's help and in the end Ricky and Lola discuss his new status as a family member within Marina and Lola's family. This is not a film about violence or sex as a lot of people seem to believe and the violence that occurs is part of the plot. The sex is easily because of the love between the two main characters and we know people in love like to make love. It is true the plot of a man kidnapping a woman to get her to fall in love with him is extreme but remember Ricky is a character of extremes. He is a man obsessed with Marina. He is a man with the idea that he will get her to love him no matter what it takes. Antonio Banderas plays Ricky extemely well. Victoria Abril plays Marina excellently. The rest of the cast is a colorful collection of Spanish actors and actresses. Several have been in other films by Pedro Almodovar. Loles Leon stands out as Marina's sister. This film contains nudity including frontal nudity profanity sexual situations violence the violence in the film is nothing of an unusually violent nature and drug use. It is rated NC17 but probably not for the sex scene. It more likely received this rating for the bathtub scene in which a windup toy swims its way between Marina's legs and is shown penetrating her. Almodovar can create very colorful characters and situations and the film is full of different emotions. His use of humor is interjected wonderfully and is a good break for the film's more serious scenes. Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! is very good in every way acting writing music direction technical etc. and everyone I have shown this film to has enjoyed it.".

	schema:headline " twothirds of a fantastic dark comedy on the nature of sexual insanity though not as successful as later Almodovar";
	schema:reviewBody "It's safe to say that even in a film by Pedro Almodovar that is only marginally successful within the margins there are some good steamy questionable times to be had. I can just imagine Pedro sitting in front of his notebook just figuring out ways to mix sex filmmaking kidnapping and other lewd exercises into some kind of cohesive single film. What makes a very good chunk of Tie Me Up Tie Me Down exciting satirically is that Almodovar never gives in to making anything TOO serious. Which is perhaps what ends up transitioning the situation Ricky Antonio Banderas and Marina Victoria Abril are in from the absurd and flirtingly masochistic to the ironically conventional and quasisweetness that is obviously deep in Almodovar. Perhaps the tying up and retying becomes part of a metaphor on the filmmaker's part that despite it being something very dangerous and totally provocative it's also inviting in ways that would be elusive otherwise. Then again that the material does mostly work by being so disturbing in the bluntness and perpetually deranged mindset of Ricky but then in the human connections that are enhanced all the more. If only the motivations even in such loose and wackyAlmodovar circumstances were a little more convincing. Nevertheless I liked a lot about Tie Me Up Tie Me Down up until it goes off the rails with its logic turning into knots simply I just don't buy that Marina falls for Ricky just like that even if she was an exjunkie porn star and Ricky's advances are like that of a uppity headstrong but shy 13 year old a slight reminder of A Life Less Ordinary's bizarrely innocuous kidnapping turned romance. Chiefly the performances and the usually artyyettrashy style from Almodovar and his crew. Banderas is by the way in one of his best and funniest performances here a near emblem of the male ideal for a life with a woman and a with an innocent yet fervent attraction to bondage with that perfect look in his eyes detailing all even in brief moments. Yet there was something about his stay in the mental home all those years that did something to his ideas towards sex and what it is to live and Banderas captures this mix of intense sadism crossed with the heart of an old Hollywoodstudio leading man who will do anything to brush the leading lady off of her feet. Abril is always believable too even when Almodovar gives her character a turn around into something more akin to an exploitation film however sweet it tries to be. While she decides to underplay her immediate fear of her kidnapper it works to add a level of comic timing to Ricky's own oddball ways. They make a great pair really especially when it comes to that 'turning point' where Almodovar uses his unique style to get five ceilingmirrored shot of a pivotal scene.There's also a fantastic role of the director of the film Marina is starring in at the start of the film the aged Maximo Espejo Francisco Rabal who's been in countless films including the Eclipse and Belle de Jour who has the ideas burning and changing around at a beat as to what his ending will be for his actress death being saved something else? His moments on screen display a richness that lies often in Almodovar's script where the surreal pressures of shooting the movie for Maximo somewhat carry over and sort of dissipate as the characters become vulnerable into that realm where reality and unreality cross paths. This is heightened and made a little additionally conventional by the musical score which like many of Almodovar's work is a tip of the hat to Herrmann compositions and old Hollywood romantic classics. There's even an emotional upheaval when Ricky and Marina meet again on that balcony overlooking the vista. The wildest thing about the picture is that one does become absorbed in the push and pull relationship between 'kidnapper' and 'kidnapee' I quote that for its a little redundant to use those terms as the film goes on and that these fed up people are practically the most average couple you'd ever meet. There's sensational comedy stacked in there too in Ricky's behavior moustache the film within the film being shot that strongman character is amazing the random TV commercial about Spanish retirees and just the consistent absurdity in the repetitive ritualside of the tying up and down. But there's something missing in Almodovar's third act to live up to the better parts early on and he chickens out on really making this a much better more challenging effort. I'll probably watch it someday again though if only for Banderas and Rabals' performances.".

They make a great pair really especially when it comes to that 'turning point' where Almodovar uses his unique style to get five ceilingmirrored shot of a pivotal scene.There's also a fantastic role of the director of the film Marina is starring in at the start of the film the aged Maximo Espejo Francisco Rabal who's been in countless films including the Eclipse and Belle de Jour who has the ideas burning and changing around at a beat as to what his ending will be for his actress death being saved something else? His moments on screen display a richness that lies often in Almodovar's script where the surreal pressures of shooting the movie for Maximo somewhat carry over and sort of dissipate as the characters become vulnerable into that realm where reality and unreality cross paths. This is heightened and made a little additionally conventional by the musical score which like many of Almodovar's work is a tip of the hat to Herrmann compositions and old Hollywood romantic classics. There's even an emotional upheaval when Ricky and Marina meet again on that balcony overlooking the vista. The wildest thing about the picture is that one does become absorbed in the push and pull relationship between 'kidnapper' and 'kidnapee' I quote that for its a little redundant to use those terms as the film goes on and that these fed up people are practically the most average couple you'd ever meet. There's sensational comedy stacked in there too in Ricky's behavior moustache the film within the film being shot that strongman character is amazing the random TV commercial about Spanish retirees and just the consistent absurdity in the repetitive ritualside of the tying up and down. But there's something missing in Almodovar's third act to live up to the better parts early on and he chickens out on really making this a much better more challenging effort. I'll probably watch it someday again though if only for Banderas and Rabals' performances.";

This requires recognition that the film is intended to be pure farce and that some allowance should be made for antisocial behaviour since both leads are psychologically damaged characters.Despite the comedy the film is a serious work which features a very unusual love affair between two mentally handicapped people. This does nothing to explain what I found to be its very real charm but to say much more would normally constitute an unfortunate spoiler. However the very unfortunate English language title under which this film was released in North America Tie me Up Tie me Down not only provides this spoiler but is also potentially misleading and it will probably be helpful to add that the film has nothing to do with S  M practices. The bondage is designed to prevent an unwilling prospective bride from running away but merely increases her determination to eventually do so. The incident which finally changes her mind about her suitor constitutes the heart of the film and is a perceptive look at what really makes many people tick. The aching need of a handicapped person for love and respect comes through very clearly and makes this film very well worth watching. For this reason I rate it at eight out of ten.".

In this story most of his usual ensemble of actors appears providing outstanding performances without exception. Despite the often bizarre personas depicted by Almodvar's characters and situations which are equally so they nonetheless end up seeming more engaging likable and normal than the more mundane. Antonio Banderas and Victoria Abrl and their characters Ricky and Marina are handsome offbeat to say the least and incredibly sensual  both individually and as a couple. But you know what? All of this works and you love them and have no problem believing that as the picture ends they will be happier more faithful better parents and enjoy more fulfilling lives henceforth than say the Cleavers Bradys or the Father Knows Best or Cosby clans. In my opinion directorial geniuses such as Almodvar Allen and Levinson have an innate ability to present stories and characters in a manner where metaphor and reality somehow fuse and join to entertain and provide a profound message  in harmony  and without either facet detracting from the other. When you go to rent a DVD or tape or scan the movie section in your newspaper always keep a lookout for Almodvar's latest.".

Of course has the touch of his movies but this one it stands out of the little number that i see of him. With Antonio Banderas like the crazy man and Victoria Abril that i see last time in Tacones Lejanos Atame! is a story of wishes and desire. A story of how the an human been can meet another human been. You can say I will never belong to that person and the next day you can be in love of that person. And i hope that don't misinterpret me... i mean kidnap a person is a bad thing and i don't support him. But of course we sometimes reject persons that could be our person. Atame! has too an interesting perspective of the direction of a film. The movie talks about the end of a movie maker. A movie maker that just want do his last work good before dies. Maybe is a fright or is an aspiration that directors has because they don't want that the work be bad they want a perfect movie just like this character. A fright that all of we must give to face no matter our aspirations or work.Atame! is a great comedy that we must take like fun and of course like a teaching.Sorry for the mistakes... well if there any".

	schema:headline " Diluted and boring film a clef.";
	schema:reviewBody "It's a notentirely fictional story about the AngoAmerican landings at Anzio on Italy's west coast. It's diluted because the story behind those landings is far more interesting than what we see on the screen. Names personalities and motives are changed around so that hardly any echo of the real characters remains although we get a lot of information about characters created in the screenplay.Basically Robert Ryan plays General Mark Clark who was in charge of the operation and was in overall command of the Fifth Army. He was an interesting guy for a general  tall vain brave halfJewish a largefeatured face like the mask of Tragedy carrying around a sidearm as a prop. Arthur Kennedy plays General John P. Lewis modeled after Gen. Lucas in charge of the landings themselves. Mitchum accuses him of being timid three times and in a way he was although it wasn't entirely his fault. Arthur Franz has a small role as General Lucian K. Truscott the junior general in command of the Third Division Audie Murphy's division. All the names have been changed to protect the guilty.Here basically is how it worked. The Allies of half a dozen nationalities were being slaughtered throwing themselves against the German Gustav line which ran across the Italian boot from sea to sea commanded by the unconquerable Monte Cassino. The Anzio landings were designed to catch the enemy by surprise from behind and relieve pressure at the Gustav line. Mark Clark who saw to it that any reference to the Fifth Army in the press appeared as a reference to Mark Clark's Fifth Army had supervised similar earlier landings at Salerno. They were successful but just barely. The landings at Anzio were handed over to Lucas whose orders included a drive inland if possible to the Alban Hills which commanded a perfect view of the beachhead and the main highway to Rome. Lucas had just troops enough to dig in and consolidate or to race pell mell to the Alban Hills but not enough troops to do both. Lucas was advised by Clark Don't stick your neck out like I did at Salerno. The line is directly quoted in the movie but is given to Robert Ryan's fictional general. So Lucas didn't stick his neck out. He went inland seven miles stopped short of the Alban Hills and dug in. Clark who was on the beach agreed with the decision. And Lucas wasn't the cocksure but mistaken strategist played by Arthur Kennedy. The real General Lucas kept a diary and it's full of gloomy forebodings. The Germans under Kesselring and Mackensen were caught unprepared. Nothing stood between the allies and the Alban Hills or Rome for that matter. But Lucas did nothing and for good reasons. He didn't have the resources to take Rome and hold it. Except for the probe by Rangers as shown on screen and others by British troops everyone dug in and waited for the German reinforcements to deploy which happened apace. Kesselring was a very efficient tactician and had plenty of time to bring in troops in the stalled Allied beach head. Instead of Anzio rescuing the troops at the Gustav line the situation was turned around. In the end some 24000 American and 9000 British casualties were evacuated from the beachhead. Clark fired Lucas and gave command to Truscott. When the German resistance finally collapsed General Clark had an opportunity to drive eastward across the Italian boot and cut off the German troops to the south. He chose instead to forget about capturing the German army and to zip his own troops north along the highway to Rome so that he could conquer the open city. You know  like Julius Caesar? The German army promptly withdrew north to their next massive defense line where the Allied advance stalled again. I leave it to the viewer to decide which story is more engaging the historical one or the plot we see on the screen which is mostly the story of seven survivors of the Ranger patrol who try to make their way back to Anzio a story we've seen many times before. I wish I could at least say that the story presented on screen is well done but the fact is that it's not. This is one of Mitchum's lazier performances. Sometimes he sounds positively drunk. No one else stands out including Peter Falk who has the reactivity of a noble gas. Arther Kennedy is the smarmy General Whateverhisnameis. And some other posters are absolutely right about the score. Whew! A simpleminded wouldbe catchy love song doesn't turn into a martial theme just because you throw some snare drums behind it and play it as a march. What a missed opportunity.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's a notentirely fictional story about the AngoAmerican landings at Anzio on Italy's west coast. It's diluted because the story behind those landings is far more interesting than what we see on the screen. Names personalities and motives are changed around so that hardly any echo of the real characters remains although we get a lot of information about characters created in the screenplay.Basically Robert Ryan plays General Mark Clark who was in charge of the operation and was in overall command of the Fifth Army. He was an interesting guy for a general  tall vain brave halfJewish a largefeatured face like the mask of Tragedy carrying around a sidearm as a prop. Arthur Kennedy plays General John P. Lewis modeled after Gen. Lucas in charge of the landings themselves. Mitchum accuses him of being timid three times and in a way he was although it wasn't entirely his fault. Arthur Franz has a small role as General Lucian K. Truscott the junior general in command of the Third Division Audie Murphy's division. All the names have been changed to protect the guilty.Here basically is how it worked. The Allies of half a dozen nationalities were being slaughtered throwing themselves against the German Gustav line which ran across the Italian boot from sea to sea commanded by the unconquerable Monte Cassino. The Anzio landings were designed to catch the enemy by surprise from behind and relieve pressure at the Gustav line. Mark Clark who saw to it that any reference to the Fifth Army in the press appeared as a reference to Mark Clark's Fifth Army had supervised similar earlier landings at Salerno. They were successful but just barely. The landings at Anzio were handed over to Lucas whose orders included a drive inland if possible to the Alban Hills which commanded a perfect view of the beachhead and the main highway to Rome. Lucas had just troops enough to dig in and consolidate or to race pell mell to the Alban Hills but not enough troops to do both. Lucas was advised by Clark Don't stick your neck out like I did at Salerno. The line is directly quoted in the movie but is given to Robert Ryan's fictional general. So Lucas didn't stick his neck out. He went inland seven miles stopped short of the Alban Hills and dug in. Clark who was on the beach agreed with the decision. And Lucas wasn't the cocksure but mistaken strategist played by Arthur Kennedy. The real General Lucas kept a diary and it's full of gloomy forebodings. The Germans under Kesselring and Mackensen were caught unprepared. Nothing stood between the allies and the Alban Hills or Rome for that matter. But Lucas did nothing and for good reasons. He didn't have the resources to take Rome and hold it. Except for the probe by Rangers as shown on screen and others by British troops everyone dug in and waited for the German reinforcements to deploy which happened apace. Kesselring was a very efficient tactician and had plenty of time to bring in troops in the stalled Allied beach head. Instead of Anzio rescuing the troops at the Gustav line the situation was turned around. In the end some 24000 American and 9000 British casualties were evacuated from the beachhead. Clark fired Lucas and gave command to Truscott. When the German resistance finally collapsed General Clark had an opportunity to drive eastward across the Italian boot and cut off the German troops to the south. He chose instead to forget about capturing the German army and to zip his own troops north along the highway to Rome so that he could conquer the open city. You know  like Julius Caesar? The German army promptly withdrew north to their next massive defense line where the Allied advance stalled again.

	schema:reviewBody "When Winston Churchill was asked to appraise the Anzio operation he said that instead of hurling a wildcat on the beach and flanking the Germans the 36000 allied troops at Anzio were nothing more than a stranded whale.Of course the whole Anzio landing was Churchill's own idea but to give him some credit it was an attempt to try and break the logjam of the Italian offensive. The Allies had landed back in 1943 at Salerno and Churchill's 'soft underbelly of Europe' proved to be armor plated. Progress was measured in yards. It wasn't like the trench warfare of the first World War but it was enormous American British Canadian and other assorted allies casualties.Anzio Beach was selected for a landing up the Italian coast near Rome to both outflank the Germans and maybe take Rome. It worked but the American commander John P. Lucas moved too cautiously having remembered the 21 Day pitched battle at Salerno in those first landings in Italy. Field Marshal Kesselring was able to bring down reinforcements from the north and contain the Allies on that beach. There in fact they stayed until they linked up with the main offensive months later just before the American Fifth Army liberated Rome officially on June 5 1944.The story of the military failure of Anzio is told with fictional names as Robert Ryan Arthur Kennedy and Arthur Franz play Mark Clark John Lucas and Lucian Truscott respectively. Truscott is the guy who relieved Lucas and kept the Allies from being driven off the beach although to be fair to Lucas his priority was a secure beachhead and he certainly succeeded.The other story of the film Anzio is that of Ernie Pyle like war correspondent Robert Mitchum who drives all the way to an unguarded Rome and then gets caught with a bunch of American GIs and one Canadian in trying to get back to Anzio beach.Earl Holliman Reni Santoni and Peter Falk play some of the soldiers with Mitchum and they do well. This is definitely not a war for glory for them they're just trying to survive out there. Falk particularly is riveting in playing an American who was wounded and invalided out of the American army from the Pacific Theater who then moved to Canada to join their army. Why you would ask because he's grown to like it and has a real jones for combat.Anzio unfortunately doesn't concentrate on either story long enough to tell it in the best possible way. It had potential to be a great film but falls short. In addition Jack Jones's singing of the theme song is jarringly out of place. What I would like is someday for someone to tell the story of the original landings in Italy at Salerno Messina and Brindisi. That would make a great motion picture if done right. When you watch Anzio you are sad for the colossal waste of human life it was especially since the objective wasn't obtained. And a great story needs better telling.".

	schema:headline " Antiwar drama comes off as hollow";
	schema:reviewBody "American director Edward Dmytryk headed to Italy to shoot Anzio one the most lopsided World War II epics to come out of the 1960s. Despite some good intentions this film fails as both an antiwar drama and an action piece.The film stars Robert Mitchum The Enemy Below as Dick Ennis a cold and cynical war correspondent that does his work on the front lines with the infantrymen. When the squad he is accompanying gets cut off behind the German lines due to an ambush he must pick up a gun and help them fight their way back to Allied lines.The movie has a lot going for it right from the start. Every actor looks comfortable especially Mitchum. Robert Mitchum has never been one of my favorite American actors simply because he always seems to be acting  despite the dimensionality of the part Mitchum can never seem to break out of a box. Here he looks to be having plenty of fun and seems quite natural in the role. Mark Damon Between Heaven and Hell provides the necessary dramatic opposite as an infantryman who can't seem to agree with Ennis on his policies. Arthur Kennedy Attack and Retreat is the exact opposite of Ennis' character as the incompetent General Lesley who takes too much time establishing a solid beachhead and allows the Germans to launch an offensive pinning his men down on the beach. Peter Falk Situation Normal All Fouled Up on the other hand is totally wasted as Corporal Rabinoff a soldier who has become addicted to combat. Earl Holliman Armored Command is the Sergeant in command of the squad and he makes the most out of a clichdrole by giving his character personality. Be sure to watch for Robert Ryan Anthony Steel Arthur Franz and Patrick Magee as Allied Generals.There is only one big battle sequence which expertly staged and filled with tanks extras and big explosions. However its effectiveness is limited because of two key flaws. Primarily American soldiers are seen to stand up in the open and rush German machinegun nests only to be mowed down by overwhelming enemy fire. Secondly there's a ridiculous scene in which Ennis and a soldier engage in a discussion about the war right in the middle of a fight despite the fact that bullets and artillery shells are landing all around them! The final smallscale climactic showdown with German snipers was much more suspenseful due to some excellent editing and great music score.One major flaw in the film is unfortunately the script. It's as if Anzio can't decide if it wants to be a gungho flagwaver or a downbeat antiwar story. The first half the film is filled with humorous almost slapstick scenes although some of Mitchum's dialog hints that this is going to change  and it does in fact the focus turns around 180 degrees. Throughout the second half of the film the action stops dead in its tracks so that the characters discuss issues of personal sacrifice what constitutes above and beyond the call of duty etc until it's been repeated so much that you can't stand to hear anymore. For all of this discussion the conclusion is pretty forced. Mitchum says something along the lines of Men kill each other because they like to. Maybe if we all sit back and realize it we could stop the killing and get along. That statement defines overemphasis. Instead of being a history lesson about the real Anzio campaign the film turns into a social commentary on Vietnam.The onlocation shooting served the proceedings well as the film looks like sunny Italy in every frame. The scene in the Italian house looked excellent and Dmytryk uses wide angles throughout to show off the scope of the Italian locales. The score ranges from victorious and rousing to mournful and depressing which contributes a great deal to the mood of some important scenes  such as the entry into liberated Rome and the significance of one character's death in the sniper sequence.Anzio is a mixed bag but despite a lack of focus on one theme it manages to be entertaining and satisfying as a drama with enough wellstaged action scenes to hold it together and help obscure the muddled antiwar sentiments.".

	schema:headline " Failed blockbuster about the Allied invasion of Italy that wastes the talents of great actors and nice locations";
	schema:reviewBody "This War movie contains crossfire  thrills  largescale action  battles  shots of troops  tanks and amphibious landings . This average film never pulls things together enough to rise above continuous images of military marches  tanks  smoke and shootouts . This wouldbe blockbuster is not a description of such an important event but it is a context in which the battle in Italy offers the concrete development  life and death  a few men in the first days after the Allied landing on the beaches of Anzio . Nothing memorable  nonsense scenes and undistinguished recounting with allstar cast though frankly wasted such as Peter Falk as Cpl. Jack Rabinoff  Earl Holliman as Sgt. Abe  Mark Damon as Wally Richardson  Arthur Kennedy as Maj. Gen. Jack Lesley  Robert Ryan as Gen. Carlson  Reni Santoni as Pvt. Movie and Giancarlo Giannini as Private Cellini  among others . Furthermore  a hackneyed screenplay and full of clich . Evocative cinematography in Panavision by Giuseppe Rotunno Federico Fellini's usual cameraman  location filming for this movie was conducted in and around the environs of Rome Italy . Atmospheric as well as thrilling musical score by Riz Ortalani  including an enjoyable leitmotif . The motion picture was middlingly directed by Edward Dmytryk and Duilio Coletti .The motion picture was partially based on real events  As Operation Shingle January 22 1944 was an Allied amphibious landing in the Italian Campaign against German forces in the area of Anzio Italy. This operation was aimed at outflanking the German army on the Winter Line and as such allow for an assault on the capital city of Rome . It was one of WWIIs bloodiest battles as the Allies smash through the German lines which have enclosed the Anzio beachhead . The operation was commanded by American Major General John P.

This average film never pulls things together enough to rise above continuous images of military marches  tanks  smoke and shootouts . This wouldbe blockbuster is not a description of such an important event but it is a context in which the battle in Italy offers the concrete development  life and death  a few men in the first days after the Allied landing on the beaches of Anzio . Nothing memorable  nonsense scenes and undistinguished recounting with allstar cast though frankly wasted such as Peter Falk as Cpl. Jack Rabinoff  Earl Holliman as Sgt. Abe  Mark Damon as Wally Richardson  Arthur Kennedy as Maj. Gen. Jack Lesley  Robert Ryan as Gen. Carlson  Reni Santoni as Pvt. Movie and Giancarlo Giannini as Private Cellini  among others .

Evocative cinematography in Panavision by Giuseppe Rotunno Federico Fellini's usual cameraman  location filming for this movie was conducted in and around the environs of Rome Italy . Atmospheric as well as thrilling musical score by Riz Ortalani  including an enjoyable leitmotif . The motion picture was middlingly directed by Edward Dmytryk and Duilio Coletti .The motion picture was partially based on real events  As Operation Shingle January 22 1944 was an Allied amphibious landing in the Italian Campaign against German forces in the area of Anzio Italy. This operation was aimed at outflanking the German army on the Winter Line and as such allow for an assault on the capital city of Rome . It was one of WWIIs bloodiest battles as the Allies smash through the German lines which have enclosed the Anzio beachhead . The operation was commanded by American Major General John P. Lucas Arthur Kennedy and was intended to outflank German forces of the Winter Line and enable an attack on Rome. The resulting combat is commonly called the Battle of Anzio.The success of an amphibious landing at that location in a basin consisting substantially of reclaimed marshland and surrounded by mountains depended completely on the element of surprise and the swiftness with which the invaders could move relative to the reaction time of the defenders.

	schema:reviewBody "It's a shame that the makers of a movie made about one of the bloodiest battles of WWII chose to make a semifictional work. The real story is far more gripping than this movie. Anzio was a four month struggle which for the Allies had no rear area. There was nowhere an Allied soldier could go that was out of range of German artillery and planes.The real battle for Anzio was a true Allied effort with the British and Americans locking in a duel to the death with the best German troops Hitler could put in Italy. It was supposed to break the deadlock of the Gustav line by flanking but was doomed from the start because it lacked sufficient landing strength. True the road to the Rome WAS uncontested on DDay but Kesselring himself said later he would have easily cut off and destroyed any such small force if it extended itself even to the Alban Hills let alone Rome.The story of the loss of Darby's Rangers is covered in other movies better of the 767 Rangers sent on a mission only six returned. It is but one of many stories of horrific sacrifice of young lives. Further south in a diversionary mission designed to take pressure off the Anzio landing the US 36th division lost 1600 men in a single night trying to cross the Rapido river. The British took terrible losses especially in the German offensive of 1819 Feb 1944 mainly due to their bad luck of being placed in the line in the area in which Hitler personally chose to concentrate the main German offensive which came within about 1000 yards of breaking the last line of defense.Such losses are unimaginable today yet they were accepted then as the price that must be paid to rid Europe of Hitler.There are no films that I know of that do justice to Anzio. One would be better served by reading any of the numerous books about Anzio or even reading the writeup at httpwww.army.milcmhbrochuresanzio7219.htm  it is infinitely more interesting than this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "You know that you're in trouble when the protagonist in a World War II movie is an Ernie Pylestyle newspaper correspondent who is still trying to figure out why men kill each other. Why do we kill each other? the leading man asks a general on the eve of the historic landings. How can a perfectly ordinary goodnatured guy who wouldn't slap down a mosquito sit up in an airplane and bomb 1000 sleeping strangers down beneath him? If the question weren't idiotic enough the highranking general that he is discussing war with replies We do it to survive Mr. Ennis. In war it is kill or be killed. Talk about bromides! Sleepyeyed Robert Mitchum is cast as this naive newspaperman named Dick Ennis who covers the war for the International Press. What a name. Dick Ennis?! Ennis likes to ask idiotic questions and he refuses to carry a grenade or tote a gun. Nevertheless he winds up giving orders to the G.I.s who assembly around him as if he were in command.No Young Lions director Edward Dmytryk's Anzio doesn't qualify as a traditional bigpicture military action epic in the tradition of either The Longest Day or The Sands of Iwo Jima. This fatigueinducing 116minute movie portrays the American military in a derogatory light but the Hal Craig screenplay alters the names to protect the incompetents. The real battle of Anzio turned into a bloodthirsty nightmare but this Dino De Laurentiis production amounts to one big bore. Instead of depicting the disaster at Anzio the filmmakers focus their attention on some forgettable heroics behind enemy lines. History tells us that the Allies landed at Anzio but expected the same stiff opposition that they faced at Salerno. Instead they landed and encountered no resistance. Ennis piles into a jeep with another G.I. and whirl off to Rome. Along the way they pick up a wisecracking U.S. Army Corporal Jack Rabinoff Peter Falk of Columbo and they wheel into Rome like a trio of tourists and spot only one German jeep. Meanwhile British General Starkey Patrick Magee of A Clockwork Orange wants to launch a small attack but pusillanimous twostar U.S. General Jack Lesley Arthur Kennedy of The Lusty Men refuses to believe that the Germans would let the Allies catch them with their pants down. Ennis and company return and describe the picnic that driving into Rome was. Meanwhile Field Marshal Albert Kesselring Wolfgang Preiss of Raid on Rommel cannot believe that the Americans have not launched a spearhead off the beach. Instead General Lesley wants to establish a beachhead.Eventually Lesley decides to send in an American Ranger battalion led by Colonel Hendricks Wayne Preston of The Man on the Spying Trapeze but German tanks are waiting for them trap them in a crossfire and wipe them out. Ennis who accompanied Hendricks survives with several other G.I.s including Platoon Sergeant Abe Stimmler Earl Holliman of Sharkey's Machine and Ennis berates General Lesley over the radio for being a timid leader. Ennis taunts the bespectacled general with lines like He walked them into a park and left them in a graveyard. Naturally nothing like this would ever have happened in a patriotic World War II era war movie. After they lose radio contact Ennis Stimmler Rabinoff and the survivors spend the rest of the movie wandering around behind German lines. They discover that Kesselring is erecting fortifications at night with Italian citizens at gunpoint to stalemate an American advance. Later Ennis gains some insight into the battlehardened Rabinoff one night after they have holed up with three stubborn Italian women in their home. It seems that the irreverent corporal suffers from occasional bouts of belly aches brought on by hand grenade shrapnel left off from a tour of duty in the Pacific. Rabinoff explains that he came back lied about his age and managed to enlist again because Rabinoff prefers the adrenaline thrill that he derives from these life and death antics. Basically we have a U.S. soldier who is fightingby his own admissionnot to defend democracy but because he loves to battle. Naturally Hollywood would never have portrayed an American soldier in such an uncomplimentary light in World War II era movies.Indeed Anzio was lensed in Italy but the scenery is the only thing authentic about this anemic combat thriller. Dmytryk helms one mildly suspenseful scene where Ennis and company have to pitch big rocks into a plowed up field so they will know where the enemy has planted landmines before a flamethrowing German tank gives them the hot foot. Near the end Ennis finally picks up a Thompson submachine gun when his men and he are pinned down by German snipers. Ostensibly other than Field Marshal Kesselring the Germans are shown in long shot speaking German with the exception of one scene where they are seen up close disarming an American G.I. and later killing him because he tries to save a photograph that they have taken out of his wallet and thrown away. The opening titles song is outofplace and the usually dependable composer Riz Ortolani provides a woebegone orchestral score. Robert Ryan appears briefly at the beginning and reappears at the end during a victory parade as U.S. General Carson. Arthur Franz who starred in Dmytryk's 'The Sniper has a cameo as Major General Luke Howard. Anzio exposes the folly of the battle and Ennis gets to berate the American general for being timid. Altogether this Columbia Pictures release is not worth a Purple Heart. Anybody who watches Anzio deserves a Purple Heart.".

Instead there's a very long leadin to the battle and then we basically follow the exploits of seven American soldiers who get stuck behind enemy lines and try desperately to get back to their comrades led by a war correspondent named Ennis played well enough by Robert Mitchum. That story was suspenseful at times but a movie with this title should have given far more information about one of the bloodiest battles in Italy during the war. Instead all we really get told is that the Allied generals were far too timid in their approach and that they missed a golden opportunity to occupy a largely undefended Rome. Instead the American commander chose to concentrate on solidifying his beachhead and the troops ended up unable to advance at all once the Germans realized what was happening. The end result  as the U.S. Commander himself notes in the movie  was summed up by no less than Winston Churchill I had hoped we were hurling a wildcat into the shore but all we got was a stranded whale.There is some philosophical reflection about warfare scattered throughout this largely through Ennis who wonders why men fight and kill each other. In the end he himself picks up a rifle and kills and he comes to a sobering conclusion which certainly has some historical credence  we kill because we like to. This conclusion is somewhat tempered by the closing scenes which depict a triumphant American entry into Rome with the citizens of Rome cheering them wildly  thus suggesting that there was some noble purpose to this particular war.Overall though this is a very disappointing movie about a battle of some significance at least in cost and the Battle of Anzio probably deserves a better treatment than this.".

	schema:reviewBody "I agree with the bulk of reviewers about the plot for this film and quality of the production. My above average rating is based on the action in the film and its historical reference to the failed assault plan with the Anzio landing in WW II. Others have commented as well on the level of acting by the main figures. The movie is based on a book but I can't understand why Hollywood changed the names of the generals to fictitious ones. Sure that whole fiasco was an embarrassment to the U.S. and our military leadership. But let's see and hear the truth look at our mistakes and learn from them  not cover them up or play them down. I wonder why there has not been another movie made about the Allied landing Operation Shingle and the Battle of Anzio to lay out the whole story. In hindsight it's easy to pick the right choices for actions and plans to succeed in any matter. But in the case of Anzio the generals high command and even the public learned of the error early on. The Allies stopped to build a beachhead. Most know the story. Major General John Lucas was wary of getting pinned down as had happened at Salerno. He didn't want to lose as many lives. But the plan for this landing was to advance and take the Alban Hills above the beaches  and then to proceed to Rome if possible. Instead he moved a few miles inland  and dug in short of the hills. What is befuddling is that common military sense seems to have gone out the window. First Lucas didn't pursue the orders to take the hills. Second when the Allies encountered no resistance at all in the landing why didn't he push forward until they encountered resistance? That's a basic rule about finding where your enemy is and what is his strength. Third  the importance of the hills was obvious because they commanded overview of the entire beach area. That would be the place to dig in to protect the beach. As the movie shows a jeep actually reached the outskirts of Rome with no resistance  and reported back. But Lucas still chose to dig in and wait. So this paranoid fearful general gave up the element of surprise that the landing had been and instead entrenched and allowed the Germans to move in and surround the area with heavy artillery and armored power. The result was a five month battle that was among the bloodiest of WWII with 30000 casualties. Equally bad it gave German Field Marshal Albert Kesselring time to later pull his troops from the southern barrier and regroup all his forces north of Rome to continue to hold the Allies at bay with costly encounters. One wonders if this operation under General George Patton wouldn't have turned out much different. Wouldn't Patton have seized the moment cut off Kesselring's defensive line in the south freed Rome and prevented a German regrouping north of Rome? He could have done that in a few days. So could Lucas have done if only he hadn't been so timid and paranoid. And that would likely have had the Allies pushing toward Paris by the time of the DDay landings at Normandy five months later on June 6 1944. Instead the worry about too many casualties led to many more and further ensured the dragging on of the war. Apparently the U.S. military leadership has not learned an important lesson from the Anzio fiasco. We have had other instances since WW II of weak generals who fail to take initiatives with much more costly results. This isn't to pick on generals. But when we consider that just a few guys at the top make decisions that affect the lives of thousands of men under their commands perhaps we need to find a better way to pick our battle leaders and weed out or bypass those who can't make bold and clear command decisions.This film Anzio is about the unopposed landing at Anzio and the Allies decision to dig in. It's not about the bloody battle that results. It gives us a little taste of action with some Ranger forces. But it's enough to raise questions in the viewer's mind about the poor leadership and failed opportunities and the consequences they had at Anzio and in the war. For that this film has some value as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "RELEASED IN 1968 and directed by Edward Dmytryk  Duilio Coletti Anzio aka The Battle of Anzio chronicles the uneventful Allied amphibious landing at Anzio Italy in late January 1944. While a reconnaissance detail offers evidence that there's no serious enemy opposition in the 30 miles between Anzio and Rome the commander Arthur Kennedy inexplicably decides to digin which provides Field Marshal Kesselring Wolfgang Preiss the opportunity to marshal his troops against the invasion. This prolongs their capturing Rome until early June.Winston Churchill was dissatisfied with this commenting I had hoped we were hurling a wildcat into the shore but all we got was a stranded whale. The movie focuses on a war correspondent Robert Mitchum who accompanies a small group of Rangers who patrol the Italian countryside and are ambushed at the Battle of Cisterna and try to make it back. The soldiers are played by Earl Holliman Peter Falk Reni Santoni et. al.The movie's based on real events but you can tell that the writers pandered to the audience in light of some of the contrived dialogues e.g. General Lesley quoting Churchill at the end Lesley of course representing the reallife General Lucas. Another negative is the incongruent soundtrack and score most notably the opening song by Jack Jones The World is Yours. Yet it could be argued that this lends the movie a unique charm.Some armchair critics complain that the movie should have focused more on The Battle of Anzio as far as the invading Allies fighting Kesselring's counterattack but that's here to a point since all the events fall under the umbrella of that battle and I think they came up with an innovative way to condense 4.5 months into a fairly compelling two hour flick.THE MOVIE RUNS 117 minutes and was shot entirely in Italy Naples Caserta  Rome. WRITERS H.A.L. Craig et. al from Wynford VaughanThomas's book. ADDITIONAL CAST Robert Ryan has a small role.GRADE B".

The movie focuses on a war correspondent Robert Mitchum who accompanies a small group of Rangers who patrol the Italian countryside and are ambushed at the Battle of Cisterna and try to make it back. The soldiers are played by Earl Holliman Peter Falk Reni Santoni et. al.The movie's based on real events but you can tell that the writers pandered to the audience in light of some of the contrived dialogues e.g. General Lesley quoting Churchill at the end Lesley of course representing the reallife General Lucas. Another negative is the incongruent soundtrack and score most notably the opening song by Jack Jones The World is Yours. Yet it could be argued that this lends the movie a unique charm.Some armchair critics complain that the movie should have focused more on The Battle of Anzio as far as the invading Allies fighting Kesselring's counterattack but that's here to a point since all the events fall under the umbrella of that battle and I think they came up with an innovative way to condense 4.5 months into a fairly compelling two hour flick.THE MOVIE RUNS 117 minutes and was shot entirely in Italy Naples Caserta  Rome. WRITERS H.A.L. Craig et. al from Wynford VaughanThomas's book. ADDITIONAL CAST Robert Ryan has a small role.GRADE B";

	schema:reviewBody "Anzio is an action packed war movie which balances the action with just the right amount of pregame war talk character study and plot development. What this means in layman's terms is you get your money's worth. You'll be excited with never a dull moment while being interested in what the characters have to say at the same time. This also means you care about the characters one way or another. Anzio might be best understood as having three dimensions in the story line. First it's an all out blood bath series of shootings with an extremely riveting fight against snipers in the end. Second it's the story of military strategy which is supplied by Robert Ryan Arthur Kennedy and Arthur Franz among others doing the high ranking officers making decisions bit. Third and most importantly it's the story of why men have wars. The war correspondent who links these all together is played by Robert Mitchum. His character is one of the most well defined characters ever written in a war movie. The third dimension really grips the story with Peter Falk playing a veteran ranger who is famous for his exploits in the unit a man who seems to enjoy the killing but has a softer side too. His character may be the second best defined character of war movies if you omit Jungle Fighters. The final shootout is an emotionally gripping sniper attack that leaves you on the edge of your seat. Possibly the best filmwork for any war movie ever done and it would be the best film editing too if not for one glitch in which the sniper attack comes from out of the blue in sequence. But that may be just what the director intended. It is effective but leaves you wondering Where am I? more than anything else. And these troopers know where they are. The music really doesn't suit the subject matter even in contrast. It's like one of the early MTV videos. Music and video don't match. Just ignore the music and enjoy the show.".

	schema:reviewBody "The trouble with saturating a genre is that sometimes really good movies fall through the cracks. In the late 1960s renowned director Edward Dmytryk made a realistic WWII drama about Anzio starring Robert Mitchum Peter Falk Earl Holliman Mark Damon and Arthur Kennedy. Dmytryk directed Crossfire twenty years earlier so Robert Ryan made a cameo in this movie with one scene and a great entrance. It was very cute to see proper respect given to the old timers but I have to warn those of you out there who love Arthur Kennedy he looks really old in this one so if you like him in his youthful days you might want to skip this movie.Anzio reminded me of Too Late the Hero it's very tense gritty without being overly violent and focuses on a small band of soldiers faced with an impossible mission. I liked both movies so I think it's a fair bet that if you like one you'll probably like the other. In this movie a mission goes wrong and seven hundred troops lose their lives leaving only seven survivors. Without a radio and trapped behind enemy lines how are they going to make it back? Or will they at all?This isn't a cheesy war movie nor is it overly upsetting. It's more of a matteroffact war movie. Some people die some bigwigs make mistakes and sometimes danger finds you when you least expect it. There are countless scenes where the soldiers are joking or taking it easy and either gunfire or other noise from the enemy makes them remember they're in the middle of a warzone. If you prefer movies that film from the front lines this one won't be your cup of tea. But if you know what to expect and you like what you're expecting this is a great one to rent.DLM Warning If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells like my mom does this movie might not be your friend. In the first scene someone swings from a chandelier and it might make you sick. In other words Don't Look Mom!".

	schema:headline " Down Underworld noir thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "'The Hard Word' is an excellent wellpaced Australian movie straddling the genres of the American noir caper film and the British thickear crime drama. Some of the sequences in this movie remind me of scenes in 'The Asphalt Jungle' 'The Killing' 'La Jetee' the Peter Sellers comedy 'TwoWay Stretch' and even 'Eating Raoul' ... but 'The Hard Word' is definitely a oneoff original and it's very good.The early scenes in this film take place in the Australian prison system. I've done some prison time Down Under in my original name before I changed it and I found these scenes extremely realistic. Seppos and Poms Yanks and Brits will have difficulty understanding the Strine slang in this movie for instance when an inmate shouts 'Half yer expletive luck!' it's not instantly clear to nonAustralians that this means 'I wish I was half as lucky as you.' Also American audiences will be confused by this movie's references to racetrack 'bookies'. In Australia as in Britain but unlike in the States bookies are lawful businessmen 'turf accountants' who privately take bets at sporting events as independent contractors.And most confusing of all for audiences outside Australia some of the dialogue in 'The Hard Word' is spoken in 'butcher talk'. This is never explained in the movie so I'll reveal that butcher talk or 'rehctub klat' is the dialect used by reallife Australian criminals for covert conversations in public ... in which every word is spoken BACKWARDS very rapidly. Even if you know the secret you won't understand a conversation in 'butcher' unless you've practised a lot. In Britain criminals have a gimmick called 'backslang' which is a simpler version of the same thing. Several times in 'The Hard Word' the dialogue is brilliantly ambiguous carrying two meanings at the same go.Three felons are released on the same day violent Dale easygoing Malcolm and Pepsiswilling motherobsessed Shane. The dialogue identifies them as brothers they don't look remotely alike but that line explains why they stick together no matter what. As soon as they get out our lads participate in an armouredcar robbery that's been set up by their crooked lawyer Frank ... but Frank might be setting them up for a fall. And while the lads were 'inside' Frank has been having a go with Dale's sexy wife Carol. Rachel Griffiths who plays Dale's wife is not conventionally beautiful ... but in this film she gives one of the sexiest performances I've ever seen on screen.SLIGHT SPOILERS COMING. There are some eyecatching frame compositions in this film all credit to directorscripter Scott Roberts. But several pieces of business seem to be set up only to create odd images on screen. A rival gangster lures Dale into a trap by disguising himself as Dale's wife and then hiding in their bed with a gun I found this wildly unlikely. Frank kills another gangster by cramming a lava lamp into his mouth no blood no broken teeth just an interesting visual composition. One long sequence takes place inside a restaurant shaped like a giant cow.An actor named Robert Taylor doesn't he know that this name's been used before? is very good as Frank the brothers' crooked lawyer. Frank dies a horrible death. How to get rid of the corpse? We know that Malcolm is handy with a sausagegrinder and in the next scene we see him grilling some FRANKfurters on the barbie. That pun is no coincidence. Damien Richardson is a revelation as Malcolm.On several occasions the crooks jeopardise their own wellplanned caper by brawling or arguing I found this a very accurate depiction of criminal behaviour. Yet there's one very implausible plot twist during the robbery at the Melbourne Cup when Shane is supposed to open a locked door by typing a 4figure number into a numeric keypad ... but a henchman named Tarzan insists on doing it himself even though he's dyslexic. Doesn't Tarzan realise that his dyslexia disqualifies him from this job? Sure enough he mucks it up.During the caper sequences I kept expecting to see the clich shot from every caper film ... when a swagbag rips open and banknotes go flying in all directions. Blessedly that hackneyed image never came. For most of its length 'The Hard Word' commendably avoids clichs. I thought Rhondda Findleton quite sexy as an angermanagement counsellor with a semiLouise Brooks hairbob but I was annoyed when her character became that prisonmovie clich the sexy female prison staffer who goes home every night and can get any man she wants on the outside yet who becomes sexually involved with one of the inmates a few minutes after she meets him! I couldn't believe that this woman would be having sex with Shane ... it would have been much more plausible if she had merely led him on arousing herself with his sexual frustration while offering him no release.At the very end of this flick the three brothers and Carol are striding purposefully towards the camera. 'Please' I thought 'please do NOT commit that horrible clich of freezeframing the final shot.' Instead of a freezeframe the final image went into a slomo ... which is also a clich but not quite so hackneyed yet. Despite a few complaints I'm vastly impressed with this highly entertaining movie. I'll rate 'The Hard Word' 8 points out of 10. Nice one cobber!".

I enjoyed this from start to finish and did not find it as formulaic and predictable as many other films in the genre. It's sort of like an Australian version of the film Confidence only with better acting and more interesting characters. Guy Pearce throws himself into the role and does not waver.Even when the focus is on another actor his presence commands the attention of the audience. Few actors are as skilled in stealing a scene without ever saying a word. The female characters are rather one dimensional but it's a detail that's easily overlooked as they are not the central focus. Definitely worth a visit to the video store.".

	schema:headline " Lock Stock and Aussie?";
	schema:reviewBody "Big time Hollywood star Guy Pearce returns to his old stomping grounds in Australia to headline crime thriller The Hard Word. Straight out of the pages of a Robert G Barrett or Gary Disher novel The Hard Word has plenty of plot holes making for an occasionally bumpy ride. But it does the job as a gritty Australian crime story. Also owes something to the direction of Guy Ritchie as several times I felt like I was watching an Australian version of Lock Stock. Pearce heads a trio of bank robbing brothers stuck in jail waiting to be released by their employers  high profile members of the police force and their lawyer. Upon their release they become involved in a new scam developed by their crooked lawyer which could make them very rich. The old criminal traps of sex and greed rear their head however producing a cataclysmic reaction. Joining Pearce in a quality Australian cast are Golden Globe winner Rachel Griffiths Joel Edgerton The Secret Life of Us Damien Richardson Vince Colosimo and Kym Gyngell. The real beauty of this film is that it' obviously Australian. So many Aussie films these days pander to the American market by reducing the Australian identity. However in The Hard Word we see the back streets of Melbourne and Sydney the tarmac entrances to the cities and even our nation's obsession with big objects gets a run. There's been no attempt to make the cities and other backdrops more glamorous and therefore less identifiably Australian. The crims in this film live on the edge of their seats like real criminals everywhere. They are hard men but with personalities like you and me. Not like the characters we are served in American movies who drive around in flash vehicles live in mansions and take great delight in getting involved in car chases with police. These guys live in the shade avoiding confrontation and identification where able. It is this respect for Australia and the determination of the film makers to give The Hard Way some substantive local grit that makes it a successful film proving that not all Australian movies have to be quirky. Weekly recommended movie Two Hands 1999 starring Heath Ledger Bryan Brown Rose Byrne and Tom Long. If you loved The Hard Word then this is certainly the movie for you.".

With an excellent cast including Guy Pearce and Rachel Griffiths it also features a hugely silly putty nose stuck on Pearce's face. God knows why. Also in the cast are two of Australia's best character actors... the gorgeous Rhondda Findleton see her also in LOVE IN LIMBO and the adorable hilarious Torquil Neilson from the equally maligned farce LET'S GET SKASE. Both these support actors would be big stars if on TV overseas but they just never get big release parts here in Australia... bit like the superb he man Jack Campbell from THE NOSTRDAMUS KID and charming Nicolas Beaumont. THE GUARDIAN star from TV Simon Baker  of L.A. Confidentialseems to have taken all the roles for these guys in one career. THE HARD WORD is a wannabee heist caper with some nasty behavior. Sam Genocchio's 2004 micro budget crime calamity GET RICH QUICK also attempted the same Aussie genre with genuinely disgusting and hilarious results. Wait until you see how Rachel Griffiths greets Guy Pearce peering at her from behind the glass prison visiting room window in THE HARD WORD....

Not the case here at allThe Hard Word has enough going in both departments to keep you more than interested and entertained a credit to writerdirector Scott Roberts. The music in this film is also worth mentioning  it's very good and matches the style of the film perfectly. What makes the movie special is an amazing lowkey performance from Guy Pearce whose talent becomes more evident every time he graces the screen. Playing one of three incorrigible but nonviolent bank robbing brothers he manages to make his character watchable interesting and original.  Costar Rachel Griffiths plays his sneaky trashy twotiming wife her performance is not quite up to Pearce's but doesn't do anything to weigh the film down and most of the other actors are topnotch.    I don't think this film did much business in the US yet another indie that probably played on about three screens and no one heard about but I predict it will find an audience on video and could even become a bona fide cult classic.".

And together they all plan to execute Australia's biggest heist!Joel Edgerton who was Uncle Owen in a 2 minute Star Wars 2 role is exceptional I love how he plays a bit of psycho! He was the standout for me  he had a much larger part than I had expected garnering more screen time than Rachel Griffiths. Guy and Rachel were terrific Guy especially found that spark he had with Priscilla Queen Of The Desert. And I really enjoyed Damien Richardson he gave Mal nice aussie bloke appeal. I liked the scene in the prison kitchen with Mal  Tony Greg Fleet  well all their scenes together were good actually they were kind of quirky funny. Vince Colosimo from Lantana fame as usual is gorgeous and as I said before the whole cast were great!It is extremely violent  I can see why its original title was Blood and Guts.

	schema:headline " It pays to see this tough and refreshing Aussie crime flick!";
	schema:reviewBody "In my time I have seen many films that have shown the bad side of people's lives with The Hard Word being no exception. This film has it all. The tough guys using aussie language committing major crimes and misdemeanors and most importantly they are having  a bloody' good time while they are doing it. If I was to be part of thieving gang then I would ask for a ticket to join in with the closenit robbers known as the Twentyman's'.Meet the Twentyman brothers Dale Shane and Mal hard bitten thieves with a self imposed honour code that demands nobody gets hurt. The three are languishing in a Sydney prison on remand for armed robbery. Dale the levelheaded leader of the Twentyman pack is helping the trio focus their life beyond crime while he focuses on his wife Carol. Middle child Mal is affable sort whose love for butchery helps him while away hours behind bars. Shane the youngest is a loveable lunatic with a short fuse. When word comes that their corrupt and well connected lawyer frank has secured them bail the boys whisked off to perform a job' and all goes well. Frank has greased the appropriate wheels ensuring the local cops don't cause trouble yet the brother's find themselves back in the slammer all too quickly. Frank bullies the brother's into one last heist a grandiose scheme that will either liberate or kill them once and for all!I really enjoyed this Australian piece of cinematography. The cast of this film was big but extremely good. The three Twentyman brothers' were played well by there acting talent. I really feel that Guy Pearce has been a breath of fresh in the movie industry whether it be in his home country or overseas. He played the careful and leading Dale. I really liked what Pearce did in this role. He was extremely intense but in way a seriously dangerous character though his chosen life would say otherwise. All he wanted was to do the jobs' and be able to live comfortably. Guy has some impressive movies on the CV including the brilliant L.A. Confidential Memento and the very feminine Priscilla Queen Of the Desert' . The other star of this show is another Australia acting talents Rachel Griffith. Like Guy Pearce she lightens up the screen as only she can and has been refreshing to the movie industry. She played the tart' Carol wife of our leading crime man. She was perfect for this role. I feel that no other actress could have got it better. Griffiths has had a good time of late and is about to star in the upcoming movie on the famous Australian bushranger Ned Kelly and has been in the recent movie hit Blow starring Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruise.Dale's younger brother Shane is played by Secret Life of Us' star Joel Edgerton. Shane is a very angry criminal but is also very cheeky in what he does to help his jailridden brothers taste freedom once again. His character is I am sure what young people are like when they dabble in crime. Joel has starred in other movies like Erskinville Kings Star Wars Episode II and Ned Kelly.  The other Twentyman brother was played by actor Damien Richardson. I enjoyed how he acted in this character immensely. He was so typically Australian' in almost everything he did and said. Yet he was also like Dale in that he was in it for the cash' and to not hurt anyone. Look I could on about the cast of this film with good roles from Robert Taylor who played the scheming lawyer Frank comedian Kym Gyngell Russell Dykstra Rhondda Findleton and Vince Colosmo.Yet this film also had a wonderful story and showed off the landscape that it had beautifully. The film's story was written by its director Scott Roberts. I feel he put the right amount of Aussie colloquialisms in it to make me feel like it is a part of my everyday life. Yet this story while it might be simple in parts was an extremely clever in how it was written with the premise of three brother's being in jail for crimes they have committed very ingenious. A mention of the language that this film has is important. Swearing is now being accepted more than ever by society yet in the movies it seems to still shock many people. The Hard word had plenty of Hard words' but were used in a suitable context. What do you expect from harden criminals anyway? However the work of the cinematographer also needs a mention here. This role was taken on by Brian J. Beheny who showed off the attractions of both Sydney and Melbourne well in this film. As a former Melbournian resident the way this film used Melbourne was really rewarding for me personally.  For me living a life of crime would be a an extremely difficult choice as I feel the tag crime does not pay' is good motivation not to experiment in unlawful activities. In a way this movie shows that tag to be true. Yet this film shows the other side to crime well. To see how these bad guys stick together and are so faithful towards each other is exceptional. When you are about to watch this film you could be mistaken for knowing what to except but let me assure you that once you have viewed the Hard Word' the characters' and most of their actions will amaze you to the point that you would never have imagined or forget. This is another positive step forward for the Australian movie industry.    CMRS gives The Hard Word' 5 Brilliant film".

At no point does it actively engage its audience. A bunch of stuff happens but you just don't care.The script is second rate at best. More often than not trite contrivances drive the story and characters do completely illogical things often going out of their way to do so for no reason. I've heard more better conceived and more logical storylines from my 6 year old nephew. Half the characters could easily be written out of the film without affecting the film in any negative way take Rachel Griffiths character half her involvement in the film seems like an afterthought  something they came up with when the producers realised they had a real actress on board.Acting is a highly mixed bag. Most of the characters aren't too bad but some are awful. The character Frank had the worst timing for delivering lines I've ever come across in a major character. Many of the extras or minor characters are crap.A poorly directed mess which at the same time is not unwatchable. wait until it's on TV or if you're really keen to see it video. Certainly not worth the time or money on the big screen. 410".

They basically keep spending time between robbing banks and prison. When a huge heist opportunity comes their way revolving around the Melbourne Cup they see their chance to get out for good with a nice lump sum of cash money.The cast is solid featuring Guy Pearce Mike from Neighbours Joel Edgerton and Rachel Griffiths the storyline is OK but the story just bugged me.

One needs humorous scenes or funny moments to meet that description. I'm limited to a thousand words and could take this film apart almost scene by scene but let me add the following there are more than several key scenes where results happen that are never explained more SPOILER How did the corrupt lawyer possibly figure out where the stolen 10 million was hidden but since he was apparently the one who stole it why would he then six months later track down the three brothers and threaten them with prison if they didn't go after a huge heist? Since he tried to have them murdered previously what kind of schmuck would be so out of it to approach the wouldbe victims? Awful awful movie.".

You do find yourself rooting for the three brothers and rooting against both the corrupt cops and the lawyer. The weaknesses were that 1 very occasionally it seemed like a TV movie especially as similar roles had been played by some characters before on TVand 2the section where they escape with a drunk blonde with the loot is unconvincing.

In that respect it's not unlike Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo or some of the more risqu Benny Hill skits sure it's stupid vulgar and corny but sometimes exactly those kinds of comedies can fill a comedy niche with certain viewers.Most of the humor IS combination cornyvulgar  with some of it venturing into the grossout variety. But I did laugh out loud more than once and at least found myself chuckling throughout most of it. The scenery is great  I mean you've got the Swedish suntanning team prancing around in bikinis providing proof that Swedes aren't all a bunch of squareheads afterall. Victoria Silvstedt who really is from Sweden is quite beautiful BTW. In addition there are some picturesque scenes of a Mediterranean coastal town where the cruise ship makes a port visit. The cruiseship set  created on a soundstage in Cologne Germany believe it or not  is quite well done I was going to say gorgeous but since I'm straight I guess I shouldn't use that word.Roger Moore costars and I wasn't shocked or disappointed or disgusted as some other commenters appear to have been to see the great former James Bond 007 make an appearance in the film playing a doubleohgay doubleokay sort of old poof. He actually has some pretty funny lines in the film especially at the end when they are preparing to skydive.The other actors  Cuba Gooding Jr. Horatio Sanz Roselyn Sanchez et al  were certainly more than adequate to convey the whole silly sexfarce comedy of the film.So I would have to recommend it as worth seeing  the caveat being that it's probably intended more for adults and for those times when you want a lighthearted zany not meanspirited sexfarce sort of comedy. You'll never look at Roger Moore in a James Bond film the same way again I guarantee it!.".

	schema:headline " A Trip that's hard to forget  unfortunately";
	schema:reviewBody "Two straight guys end up on a gay cruise. I really really wonder how anyone could have thought that this simple idea would make for a good and funny movie but unfortunately a lot of people thought so and there we are.I mean in my opinion the worst kind of movies are bad comedies. I can live with bad action movies or bad horror movies or even bad dramas. But watching a really bad comedy is like getting beaten up. Other bad movies at least can make you laugh sometimes but if a comedy is really bad there's nothing left to enjoy.I can honestly say that Boat Trip is one of the worst comedies I have ever seen. The story itself is awful and even worse unbelievably predictable. There isn't a joke you don't see coming miles before it happens and it's always one you really wish won't happen because it is such a bad one. But every joke here hits its bad mark and leaves you with nothing more to do than to stare at the screen in disbelief.The whole gay issue is handled as bad as possible. There is not a single normal gay person on this ship. Everyone is a kind of a freak dresses like a woman makes exaggerated moves and is saying uh and oh and ohoho and ohlala and things like that all the time. Every clich you can imagine about a gay man is implanted here and beaten so long until it's last drop of life vanishes. And it's all about sex. Everyone is kissing and touching and making sexual advances at everyone else. At the breakfast buffet there is an ice sculpture that looks like a bunch of penises. That's supposed to be funny. When one character makes a change of mind from hating gays to being gay it is so unconvincing that 1 minute later he is running after one of the babes. When he asks a store clerk if they got any condoms a dozen gay men hand him some condoms because you know gay people need them ho ho. The other guy has to act as if he's gay so he can sleep with the girl he loves don't ask about the logic. When they do so under an orange tree oranges fall down so that afterward they are covered in about 100 oranges. He also does a dance show as a drag queen for about 3 minutes. Everyone is shocked or disgusted about being gay no matter if it's a man or a woman. Imagine that this movie is about gays and it isn't even sure what to think of them. When one guy starts philosophizing that gay people may not be so bad after all you're almost ready to believe him. This movie is as sexist homophobic and horny as a movie can be.The characters are unbelievable cutout stereotypes played by untalented actors with no conviction at all. Yes there is Cuba Gooding Jr. who let's face it is not a talented person and hasn't done a good film since Jerry Maguire and As Good As It Gets. His fat stupid partner is one of the worst actors in this movie. Victoria Silvstedt plays one of the super babes by showing as much as she can without undressing. Roger Moore wanders through the movie as a kind of preacher who wants everyone to become gay and says one line that is unforgettable. Before parachuting out of a plane he really says I was in the service for her majesty once. That hurts. There is Vivica A. Fox on autopilot Bob Gunton in a 5second bit nevertheless credited in the opening credits Richard Roundtree in a 10secondbit dito and Lin Shaye as the babes' trainer and at the same time as the most painfultowatch person in this film. Roselyn Sanchez as the love interestgirl is the only one who doesn't make you cringe every time you see her. But maybe that's just her looks and who cares anyway?There is nothing good in this movie nothing at all. The music is stupid with references to West Side Story of course the gay men wear colorful dresses women's clothes or leather suits the women wear bikinis or seethrough dresses and even the extras are unconvincing. Uneccessary to ask how two loser guys can pay for such a luxury trip. Or why Roselyn can jump into a pool and dry in 2 seconds afterward. Or why she says she likes being on a ship with gay men because then she doesn't have to care about her makeup or her clothes when while saying that she wears a lot of makeup and very sexy clothes.Two scenes of unbelievable stupidity are worth mentioning. In one the fat guy somehow has sex with the babes' trainer instead with one of the babes. How this worked I don't know since the room is obviously lit so that you see exactly who's lying in the bed but he nevertheless crawls between her legs which leads to the two fighting across the room while the trainer gets orgasmic when being shot through the room with a fire extinguisher.The other absolutely worst scene shows Roselyn Sanchez showing Cuba Gooding Jr. how she satisfies a man orally and she does it with a banana for about 2 minutes. The scene ends with Cuba Gooding Jr. ejaculating out of the window on the face of one half of a gay couple. This scene was one of the most painful scenes I ever had to watch in a cinema and the temptation to walk out has never been bigger.This movie is simply dead in the water in every way. Avoid it at all costs please. Let the makers know what they did to the world by making this movie. Have mercy with yourself.".

However I was surprised to find that the movie is not bad at all. Quite enjoyable really  and not even gaybashing or anything like that. I guess that you can't rely too much on opinions posted at sites like IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes or any other like that. You have to watch it for yourself and judge for yourself. It definitely did not deserve the extremely poor rating that it received at Rotten Tomatoes. I rate it 7 or 8 out of 10. I think that is quite fair in my opinion.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Jerry vomits onto his girlfriend when trying to be romantic he finds himself dumped and depressed. Weeks turn into months and his best friend Nick decides to help him out of his funk by getting them onto a cruise together. However a fight in the travel agents see them being accidentally booked onto a gay cruise. Unfortunately for them they only realise this after they have set sail. With no land in immediate sight things look bleak but both Jerry and Nick find more opportunities than they had expected.If there is a warning noise in comedies ie a cinematic fire alarm then surely it must be any film that has the main character dancing alone in their flat to a James Brown song. So when this film opened with that I immediately got on edge  a feeling that didn't change for the rest of the film. With a foundation of homophobia bikini wearing models and loud humour this is very much a comedy that aims at a teenage market and probably does enough to satisfy them if not anyone else. The gags are obvious and simplistic and are unlikely to appeal to anyone who doesn't think that cum jokes are the height of humour homosexual men are 99 clichs and that large breasts are the most important thing in a woman. I don't really think these things so I only laughed once the whole time  and even that was cut short as a good joke immediately turned into crudity. Without laughs the story is exposed for the predictable puerile mess that it is.The cast don't help the material and seem to just accept the level that it is at. Goding Jr mostly mugs his way through it and to his credit at least puts his all into it  a lesser actor would have shied away from some of his scenes but Cuba seemingly has no shame. The one good thing to say about him is that he does have an easy chemistry with Sanchez although that may be more to do with the fact that she is sexy and natural and is easily the best thing in the whole film. Sanz is a typical fat funny guy but I use the word funny with reservations as he is nothing special. Fox may get a hard time from Boondocks but films like this hardly help her case  she is poor in a small role. Moore puts his heart into his role but at times he does himself no favours and pushed it too far. Why people like Gunton Silvstedt and Roundtree bothered is beyond me.Overall a very basic comedy that has very very few laughs and will probably only appeal to the male teenage market that it is squarely aimed at. The stereotypes are flying the crudity and homophobia is rampant and the only thing missing is entertainment value. Sanchez dominates with a sexy and natural performance but that is mainly down to just how very average everyone else is.".

It must be recognized as a clever commentary on the often overlooked fact that gay men and straight men differ in sexual preference but are similar in some other respects.The subtlety in the pretense of presenting what superficially appears to be a dreadfully juvenile and unfunny film as a means of illuminating the prejudices of the audience is utterly brilliant. So brilliant in fact that many of the more literal minded among us might leave the theater unaware of the profundity of the film and think they just endured one of the worst movies ever produced.That would be their loss. Approached on a more openminded level this film will reveal startling truths such as the little recognized tendency for some gay men to behave in an effeminate manner and the even less explored reality that such behavior makes many straight men uncomfortable. Even more revealing is the film's shocking premise that being in the company of gays does not inevitably cause a straight man to desire to perform fellatio. By exploding this myth this film may do more to strengthen the ties between straight and gay men than any development since the advent of unisex hair styling salons.Most movingly but with adroitly comedic undertones this movie boldly suggests that despite these hidden truths gay and straight men can coexist even within the confining environment of a seafaring vessel. Of course the cruise liner is itself not merely the setting or environment in which this cinematic exploration occurs but indeed a metaphor for our ever more crowded society and the ultimate verity that we are all adrift in this mad world together. The failure of this film to receive its due from critics only shows the dangers of daring to break new ground in Hollywood.".

Roselyn Snachez is simply put hot and the overall story line is comic and reminiscent of the stupid B comedies of the 80's. This movie really is a gem and the people who find it dumb and  pointless don't see the real meaning behind the film it is meant to be dumb and pointless.

For the other people in the movie they are not good for anything. The whole movie is based on gay jokes and after the first 2 that gets boring. This is like those movies in the early 90's movies like ski school and such titles. The only difference is that they had boobs in them and were funny and Boat Trip doesn't have either.

Yes it has the typical gay jokes but no the movie doesn't center on gay bashing or glorifying.  It explores the subject of sexuality as just an everyday occurance and makes fun of both hetero and homosexuality.  The Swedish Tanning team is a great example of reminding men what it means to be hetero. Roger Moore plays more than just a bit part in the movie and when he is on screen he is absolutely funny.  Horatio Sanz is in my opinion one of the least recognized and most underutilized funny men of our time.  His actions and timings always make each scene better than the last.  Cuba Gooding Jr. is excellent or course.  His acting in the film is very much different than one might expect and creates another more human feeling to the film. Roselyn Sanchez is absolutely stunning and delivers a solid performance.Boat Trip is not a serious film and it is not supposed to be.

Also it has the feel of a bad 70s TV drama. The concept has been done to death but that wasn't necessarily a turn off but the pace is turgid and the story itself doesn't have any interest at all.Likewise with the characters. They don't feel like characters or real people at all just overdone caricatures. Jeanne Tripplehorn gets the worst of it and her overdone performance suffers from it. Madonna only so far has impressed me in Evita but her performance here is lifeless and disengaged here.Only two things have any real spark. One is the striking scenery and the other is the earthy charm of Adrianno Giannini. However these two are not enough to salvage the movie from being an insipid bore. All in all not recommended. 110 Bethany Cox".

Or perhaps they already have since this film was largely dumped with little fanfare and deadly wordofmouth. One would hope that being directed by her talented husband who's created some interesting andor terribly entertaining work would bring out the same quality Madonna showed in Desperately Seeking Susan alas it just isn't meant to be for here she is at her very worst singularly convinced of her own greatness the smugness permeating every frame she's in made all the more unbearable by her wavering fauxBritish accent an accent that only underscores the fact that her speaking voice is immature in quality and not especially pleasant. This may sound unnecessarily cruel but LISTEN to the woman and LOOK at her films of say the past decade like a latterday Bette Davis there is an unmistakable brittleness to not only her carriage but to her very face and body which here despite the warm photography displayed throughout the film perhaps its only saving grace are done no favors. To her credit the entire affair is so misbegotten that one wonders if the world's greatest actress on her best day could do anything with this mess. No one involved escapes unharmed Bruce Greenwood actually seems pained to be onscreen though poor Jeanne Tripplehorn seems to carry herself as if she's actually in something good which had me thinking all the while Denial ain't just a river in Egypt! Adriano Giannini son of Giancarlo Giannini star of the Italian original Swept Away... is like his father before him immensely attractive and isn't altogether bad despite winning a Razzie nomination for Worst Actor but like almost everything else about this production it all comes back to Madonna on whose shoulders rest the blame. Why her? Why not her husband director Guy Ritchie? Just who do YOU think was behind this remake? What actress wouldn't want nearly every shot of a movie to be centered on her with only a relative nobody sharing the screen? Oh sure Ritchie deserves some blame surely he  or someone  ANYONE!  should have and could have taken his lead aside and insisted on something bordering on ACTUAL FEELING in her line readings for her performance is so wooden it's a surprise the rest of the cast didn't get splinters or at least display a semblance of warmth...but she seems resistant to be anything but a cinematic black hole. Above and beyond anything else this is strictly a vanity project for its star so she is ultimately accountable for it. A film like this an Odd Coupleish war of the classes should be light and fun with leads who can bounce off one another with witty even romantic dialogue for what else can a film whose plot involves two disparate people stranded really be? Honestly I don't think anyone involved knew exactly the tone they were trying for it succeeds neither as comedy I defy you to laugh even once or romance Madonna's iceprincess routine precludes ANY chemistry.

All of which is basically true. Moreover the film looks awful with preposterously saturated colours clumsy composition banal locations and ridiculous costumes.But the worst thing about Swept Away isn't any of these things. The worst thing by a long way is the philosophy behind it. I went to see Swept Away because I thought it might be a 'so bad it's good' film that even if it was terrible it might be kind of funny. How wrong I was. Here's the plot in a nutshell Madonna plays a nasty rich woman and the entire film is a long process of watching a man humiliate her beat her and even rape her. At the end she emerges a 'better' woman for all the abuse she has suffered and is grateful to her rapist. Just to remind you this is supposed to be a comedy. Ha ha ha! Because raping and beating women is just so darn funny! It's not funny it's horrible. It doesn't matter how spoilt and nasty Madonna's character is. Seeing a woman undergo violence and abuse  and 'enjoying' it  is vile and would only appeal to a twisted mind.The film honestly left me feeling sick to the stomach. I dread to think what this film says about Richie's relationship with Madonna but one thing is certain he hates women. If you remade Swept Away as a 'hilarious' comedy in which a black person was beaten and punished by a white person until heshe started to love being a slave and was pathetically grateful to hisher white oppressor it would be banned. And rightly so.This is a sick nasty film. If you haven't seen it I really recommend that you don't.".

	schema:headline " Never have so many raspberries been so well deserved";
	schema:reviewBody "Madonna's career in the cinema is a strange one. One could easily dismiss films like this one and Body of Evidence as the vanity projects of a conceited pop diva who can't act for toffee but imagines that her ability to belt out a hit tune automatically qualifies her as the next Meryl Streep or Helen Mirren. And there are indeed several other pop divas who are labouring under that particular delusion. And yet there is more to Madge's career than that. She is also capable of giving perfectly creditable performances in decent films like Desperately Seeking Susan Who's That Girl? and A League of Their Own and was particularly good in Evita. Which makes it all the more frustrating when something as bad as Swept Away comes along. When I saw the film I assumed it was a ripoff of the successful eighties screwball comedy Overboard. The main character in Overboard played by Goldie Hawn is called Joanna Stayton here she is Amber Leighton. I wondered whether the StaytonLeighton rhyme was a deliberate hint by the scriptwriter that the earlier film was his inspiration. Both Joanna and Amber are the spoilt and bitchy trophywives of wealthy businessmen. Both women go for a cruise aboard a luxury yacht in the course of which they manage to alienate a workingclass man here a sailor named Giuseppe by their arrogant and unreasonable behaviour. In both cases the tables are turned by a sudden stroke of fortune meaning that the man now has the upper hand allowing him to take revenge on his former tormentor. And these being romantic comedies in both cases the illmatched couple end up falling in love. Since seeing the film however I have learnt that it is a remake of a 1974 Italian film of the same name. At least it had the same name in English the original Italian title was the less snappy Travolti da un Insolito Destino nell'Azzurro Mare d'Agosto. Adriano Giannini who plays Amber's lover here is the son of the actor who played the equivalent role in 1974. Nevertheless I still feel that comparisons between Swept Away and Overboard are illuminating because the films despite their similarity in theme are very different in tone and quality Overboard being far superior. Part of the reason is the way the lead characters are played. Yes Joanna is a prize bitch but Goldie Hawn never forgets that she is acting in a comedy and plays her with an appropriate lightness of touch preparing us for the transformation in the later scenes when Joanna's more human side begins to come through so that psychologically we can accept the romance which develops between her and Kurt Russell's character. Logically of course the plot of Overboard is quite implausible but screwball comedies enjoy a certain immunity from the laws of logic. Madonna however appears not to understand the difference between comedy and serious drama playing Amber with a fierce earnestness far more appropriate to the latter so that whereas Joanna is amusingly nasty Amber is merely hateful. In the later scenes we can never accept her as a person capable of love or affection. Beyond being the son of a famous father Giannini has few qualifications for his role. His English is not good and he speaks his lines as though he had learnt them phonetically without any real understanding. His main technique for expressing emotion is to rely upon a single expression a farouche scowl presumably indicating his discontent at his treatment by Amber. Giuseppe incidentally is a Communist something which indicates how much Hollywood politics have changed since the Cold War ended. In any American film made before 1989 except perhaps Beatty's Reds Communist generally meant fanatical enemy of democracy. In this film it means something romantically exotic and thrillingly dangerous like some fierce but beautiful beast of prey. The film is also badly directed by Madonna's then husband Guy Ritchie. It does not flow smoothly and it is visually unattractive to look at being bathed in a harsh glaring light. Its main flaw however is neither the acting nor the direction but its objectionable world view. When Amber is shipwrecked on a deserted island with Giuseppe he realises that she is unable to find food for herself and that his skills as a fisherman now give him the upper hand. He takes advantage of their situation not only to humiliate her but also to abuse her physically and on one occasion sexually assaults her. In real life these two would probably have ended up murdering one another but this is Hollywood not real life and they end up falling passionately in love. To call this misogynistic view of the relationship between the sexes objectionable would be an understatement. Even Neanderthal seems inadequate given that Neanderthal women were by all accounts hefty creatures built like the proverbial brick outhouse and doubtless unwilling to stand for any nonsense from their menfolk. The critical and commercial failure of Swept Away finally put an end to the Material Girl's acting career. She could afford to shrug off the controversy aroused by Body of Evidence a bad film certainly but by no means as bad as this one on the basis of there's no such thing as bad publicity but when bad publicity turns to public ridicule even a confirmed attention junkie like Madonna must realise it's time to call it a day. The film swept the board at the 2002 Golden Raspberry Awards including inter alia Worst Picture Worst Actress for Madge and Worst Director for Ritchie. Giannini unaccountably missed out on Worst Actor. Never have those raspberries been so welldeserved. 110 only the fifth film out of more than a thousand to which I have given the minimum mark.".

You'll be drunk in no time and then  BONUS!  the movie won't seem as horrific as it really is.";

	schema:headline " Thought provoking";
	schema:reviewBody "The critics were spineless in their analysis of this movie.  Typically critics posture as examples of openmindedness but quickly turn hypocritical when a story takes a view contrary to their own brand of envogue political correctness.The media is perfectly willing to jump up and applaud dramatic material exploring social taboos ranging from child sex to four thousand different types of murder but when it comes to exploring the raw and uninhibited relationship between a man and woman on a desert island and the primal gender characteristics that evolve the relationship they get scared and run for cover  because it does not promote their everchi chi unisexist agenda.While not the best made film of 2002 this movie was actually an interesting story with a powerful statement about society love and relationships and on its own takes a radical and even liberal look at these critical elements of our everyday lives.In their run for cover aside from directly and personally picking on Madonna and her husband' the sociopolitically driven critics tended to haphazardly pick at various elements of the movie such asThe film appears washed out  in my analysis with this the director found he could  evoke a mood in the audience utilizing this effect.  The white wash look imposed a hot desert like feel which created a dry distaste of the lives the aristocrats were living.  It sets up an underlying melodramatic tone that exudes in Madonna's character and reflects the harshness of her current life. Utilizing nonstandard film traits is consistent stylistically with other Guy Ritchie films.Madonna is too melodramatic  once again intentional flavoring that adds contrast as her character arcs throughout the film. It also sets up the humor we find in her drastic transformation. It is only because she was a super bitch' before that we can at first enjoy when the tables are turned. Our enjoyment of course quickly turns to concern when we feel that Giuseppe goes too far by our standards.Unintentional humor  perhaps the audience is laughing at the very right time yet the intently politically correct critic is simply offended that the audience finds these moments funny.The plot is improbable  welcome to movie land.  The majority of plots and stories in general are improbable.About half the critical reviews I read admitted the reviewer's real problem with the movie and positioned the subject matter as dated antediluvian archaic etc. This reflects their own fear that the movie might allude to some uncomfortable truths about human nature.Swept Away simply but brilliantly breaks two people down into their primal roles as a man and a woman.  In the film absent the rules of a structured society the physically dominant man assumes a role as the hunter gatherer and usesabuses this dominance to subordinate the female character that once tormented him.  The woman Amber who had found her previous plastic life to be unsatisfying falls dependant on Giuseppe and uncovers a deeper meaning to her existence in the form of an animalistic carnal attraction that surfaces and drives her to a passionate relationship with him.  The movie unfitting with modern social mores suggests that innate gender biased traits can form the basis for truly passionate and meaningful love.If we expound on this the message is that men and women are inherently different and naturally gravitate to different roles in a relationship and that society at least in some instances can interfere with these deep rooted urges.It is a gritty believable yet a bit uncomfortable suggestion that perhaps gender roles do offer some reward in society.  It was enjoyable to watch humorous at times and a little painful at others.  I give the director the benefit of the doubt and can assume that I was guided well through the story.The movie is far from perfect in that we don't particularly empathize greatly with any of the main characters at least until the final few scenes of the movie though I am not sure we are supposed to.  Much of the dialog was not properly updated from the 70s to the 00s  the discussion about chemicals' for example.  Also there are some embarrassingly poorly made scenes  such as when Amber and Giuseppe are supposed to be zipping along in a speed boat and there is not such as a hair moving on their heads and every scene where the Mediterranean looks about as wavy as a backyard poolOne thing is for sure  the subject matter is surprisingly thought and discussion provoking and the movie is better than 98 of the other new release rentals out there. Rent it and talk about it.".

	onyx:emotionText "The critics were spineless in their analysis of this movie.  Typically critics posture as examples of openmindedness but quickly turn hypocritical when a story takes a view contrary to their own brand of envogue political correctness.The media is perfectly willing to jump up and applaud dramatic material exploring social taboos ranging from child sex to four thousand different types of murder but when it comes to exploring the raw and uninhibited relationship between a man and woman on a desert island and the primal gender characteristics that evolve the relationship they get scared and run for cover  because it does not promote their everchi chi unisexist agenda.While not the best made film of 2002 this movie was actually an interesting story with a powerful statement about society love and relationships and on its own takes a radical and even liberal look at these critical elements of our everyday lives.In their run for cover aside from directly and personally picking on Madonna and her husband' the sociopolitically driven critics tended to haphazardly pick at various elements of the movie such asThe film appears washed out  in my analysis with this the director found he could  evoke a mood in the audience utilizing this effect.  The white wash look imposed a hot desert like feel which created a dry distaste of the lives the aristocrats were living.  It sets up an underlying melodramatic tone that exudes in Madonna's character and reflects the harshness of her current life. Utilizing nonstandard film traits is consistent stylistically with other Guy Ritchie films.Madonna is too melodramatic  once again intentional flavoring that adds contrast as her character arcs throughout the film. It also sets up the humor we find in her drastic transformation. It is only because she was a super bitch' before that we can at first enjoy when the tables are turned. Our enjoyment of course quickly turns to concern when we feel that Giuseppe goes too far by our standards.Unintentional humor  perhaps the audience is laughing at the very right time yet the intently politically correct critic is simply offended that the audience finds these moments funny.The plot is improbable  welcome to movie land.  The majority of plots and stories in general are improbable.About half the critical reviews I read admitted the reviewer's real problem with the movie and positioned the subject matter as dated antediluvian archaic etc. This reflects their own fear that the movie might allude to some uncomfortable truths about human nature.Swept Away simply but brilliantly breaks two people down into their primal roles as a man and a woman.  In the film absent the rules of a structured society the physically dominant man assumes a role as the hunter gatherer and usesabuses this dominance to subordinate the female character that once tormented him.  The woman Amber who had found her previous plastic life to be unsatisfying falls dependant on Giuseppe and uncovers a deeper meaning to her existence in the form of an animalistic carnal attraction that surfaces and drives her to a passionate relationship with him.  The movie unfitting with modern social mores suggests that innate gender biased traits can form the basis for truly passionate and meaningful love.If we expound on this the message is that men and women are inherently different and naturally gravitate to different roles in a relationship and that society at least in some instances can interfere with these deep rooted urges.It is a gritty believable yet a bit uncomfortable suggestion that perhaps gender roles do offer some reward in society.

No the director working with his own wife is not the real problem. Frances McDormand won an Oscar when directed by her husband in the excellent Fargo. No it's the bullying of the female character into subservience as a result of which she learns her 'place' and falls in love with her 'master'  it very much reminded me of The Story of O in its dehumanisation of the protagonist in which she becomes a willing accomplice.

You can fool some of the people most of the times but you can not fool the NYPD cops or for that matter cops in general. This movie should not be saying that it is based on a true story. The only true incident was the rape of the nun. But the apprehension of the two young men that committed this heinous crime was not the way it happened. Read the book and see what I mean. For one tough cop Mr. Dietl should have told Hollywood about his other exploits as an NYPD cop. Apparently those stories did not merit being put into the script. So what happens? Fiction with a childhood friend of Bo's that becomes a mafia made man. To add insult to injury another mafia made man goes after Bo's partner. Never happened.

It doesn't help that the protagonists are the usual Black nunrapists on angel dust or crack in this case  where did I see that before  Hill Street Blues it doesn't help that Dietl is chumming up with the local maffia Mike McGlone who are ok after all as they're just good Catholic boys from the hood. Does Mike McGlone as the local mafia hood do anything illegal other than kiss Stephen Baldwin and sit around in a restaurant looking unemployed? And what's with all this kissing stuff? I think Stephen Baldwin and Mike McGlone kiss at least three times throughout the movie?Something must be very rotten with the police when they and the mafia are just a bunch of good old boys and the FBI fighting corruption are just out to get a small time hardworking cop. Right. How mean of them. I guess they just don't understand.

Unfortunately or fortunately considering NewtonJohn's future success TOOMORROW was not a hit and any further adventures of the Band called TOOMORROW remained unfilmed. TOOMORROW The Movie tells of an alien race who discover the music of NewtonJohn and her pop band TOOMORROW. Seems the aliens need a break from their own computer generated music and the earthling band is just the cure. So a convuluted plan is hatched to kidnap the band and bring them to their planet so they can record some tunes. Believe it or not the movie isn't THAT bad  and certainly doesn't deserve the relative oblivion it has been consigned to. All of the actors are fairly engaging the special effects are OK the songs are cute in a prefab Archies sort of way Val Guest's THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH direction is brisk and Olivia shows off her long long legs with some revealing costumes. The print was supplied by the British Film Academy and it was MINT! I hope a DVD video release is in the offing. Ms. NewtonJohn seemed amused by the film and gratified by the audience's response.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like many Olivia NewtonJohn fans I sought out TOOMORROW to catch an early film performance by Olivia and also because I enjoy seeking out lost movies and while the film is certainly lightweight and contrived I'll admit I enjoyed watching it. The concept here was to take a prefabricated rock group sort of a British take on The Monkees inject a scifi story line and tie everything together with a groovy pop music soundtrack with the requisite soundtrack LP and singles. History has told the story the aliens desperately looking for new musical vibes plot was way out there the tunes were too lightweight and the resulting film opened and closed quickly then promptly disappeared. Despite all that TOOMORROW is still worth viewing for those fortunate enough to come across it. Olivia is absolutely charming here as a college studentband member and while she later admitted in interviews that she literally resorted to shouting in order to project her voice it really doesn't detract from her performance or the film. Her interaction with her bandmates is lighthearted and carefree. The music is pretty much bythenumbers pop bordering on bubblegum perhaps Don Kirshner leaned a little too close to his musical creation The Archies here and it's a bit of a stretch imagining an alien race finding just the thing they're looking for in these tunes. Hugo Montenegro's musical interludes are definitely dated but they're in context with the time and setting and the special effects are also decent considering the age of the film. There's also an amusing bit of light farce when a female Alphoid named Johnson is summoned to seduce Vic Cooper problem is Johnson apparently wasn't informed as to which one was Vic Cooper and her crash course in the art of seduction came from viewing a couple of nudie flicks. I'll concur that while TOOMORROW isn't exactly toprate it's worthy entertainment if approached with the mindset of a midnight movie and it certainly deserves to be rescued from obscurity. I'm not holding my breath but if by some miracle the powers that be who are keeping TOOMORROW from being officially rereleased have a change of heart I'd love to see a genuine DVD issue with some cool bonuses to do the film justice especially if Anchor Bay is given that chance.".

The story is odd aliens hear the sound of the band Toomorrow and discover that they need those vibes to survive. Friendly alien kidnaps them and they save the aliens' world. Sounds pretty stupid?

The Way Of Lost Souls 1929 was the 2nd silent film of Pola's I saw after the compelling and funny A Woman Of The World 1925. I do think the other title The Woman He Scorned is actually a better title for this film because the lighthouse guard who marries Pola truly scorns and pities her in the beginning but marries her anyway because he promises God to save the unfortunate if he is saved in a shipwreck. How kind of him.I saw the DVD version put out by Grapevine before they went out of business. This DVD version has replaced English subtitles but the beginning credits are in French. The music soundtrack with Pola singing at one point seemed out of sync many times and the sound of the projector kept interfering with the music but otherwise the two main musical themes in the soundtrack were quite haunting and appropriate.Pola just keeps you engrossed in this film with her fascinating performance. She definitely had a screen presence that few other actresses had here she just draws you in to her world and you are completely mesmerized. She plays a fallen woman trying to go straight but she has the misfortune of falling for the too puritan lighthouse guard played convincingly by German actor Hans Rehmann and he eventually ends up  figuratively  stabbing her in the back. Moral for women never fall in love with somebody who prides himself on being loftier than you and other people around him. This film was beautifully photographed. I loved the moment when Pola stares in the mirror and tries to improve her looks by cleaning her face and playing around with a pretty scarf until she finally likes what she sees in the reflection. All women can relate to that moment. And the moment when she wakes up after her marriage night and touches her husband's pillow tenderly indicating subtly what transpired the night before. Today a romance movie isn't considered complete unless they show couples writhing around chewing on each others' faces. Completely disgusting and immoral. The old films were wonderful they left it all to your imagination with little tender moments like that pillow scene.I enjoyed the film and give it a 9 out of 10.".

A lighthouse keeper Hans Rehmann wanders in for a drink and is spotted as an easy mark by Negri and her pimp Warwick Ward. But after a fight and drawn knives the lighthouse man walks off leaving Negri on the barroom floor. The pimp is dragged away.... She races after the hero and begs him to take her away.....He leaves her in the village but a fastrising storm swamps his boat as he returns to the lighthouse and as he is drowning promises that if he lives he'll protect the weak..... After their marriage Negri must learn the most rudimentary household chores but eventually the two find peace with one another.But the pimp returns and seeks shelter in their house. Negri hides him but he is seen leaving the cottage and the police descend.The big finale is at the lighthouse. The pimp follows her as she runs to the husband to tell him what's happened and beg forgiveness. But as she's leaving the pimp jumps out and demands money. She tells him to take her boat and is handing him cash when the husband catches them.There is an exciting battle on the edge of a cliff but the husband has time to turn to her and call her a whore and to be gone. The police arrive and they and the hero chase the pimp while Negri jumps in her boat and heads to open sea.Very odd film roughly shot and edited and it contains synchronized sound effects music gulls wind and one section where Negri hums while ironing. But the opening in the saloon is exceptionally realistic and Negri though never a favorite of mine is very very good. She's tough as nails in the opening sequence funny while attempting to cook breakfast and touching when she removes the harsh makeup and dons a new scarf and realizes that she is young and pretty and happy....Certainly worth a look.....".

Jesus told the parable of the prodigal son to show how God rejoices over any of his people who stray from the fold and return. Since it was a story to make a point the writers had a free hand to make a plot with proper biblical quotations in the script.Edmond Purdom plays the starring role as one of two sons of Walter Hampden the other being John Dehner who are seemingly content with their life. Dehner certainly is but Purdom has a taste for some excitement.While in town shopping for supplies Purdom makes essentially a grandstand play good act that it was when he frees a mute slave played by James Mitchell from Neville Brand who is an overseer for the Baal high priest Louis Calhern. Later on Purdom cavalierly humiliates Calhern who plots a bad revenge for this slight to him and his religion.He finds Purdom's weakness fast enough. Lana Turner who is THE Baal high priestess is something special a lot of that due to the fact that blonds are scarce in that region of the world. And that by the way is a fact duly noted in the story. One look at her and Purdom is putty in her hands.She leads him on quite a path of degradation but our Prodigal hero works his way back to his father and the religion of his people.Not that this is a great story anyway but The Prodigal suffers from the fact that Edmond Purdom is not an actor of any great warmth. Technically proficient Purdom never made it to the top because he was not charismatic enough to be a hero. His career was a lot like Stephen Boyd's except Boyd realized it and became a great portrayer of villains like Messala in BenHur.As for Lana Turner sexy yes but Turner always fought being cast in period pieces of any kind she always felt her best roles were in modern day dress films. Blonds did not have more fun in this film in the end. MGM was getting rid of its high priced contract players at this time and Turner was not being showcased with any great care.The Prodigal did follow the DeMille formula of high falutin' dialog about virtue sprinkled with sex. In this film with Turner sex laid on with a steam shovel. But it wasn't as good as those fabulous DeMille Bible epics Samson And Delilah and The Ten Commandments.".

This is puzzling inasmuch as he was a goodlooking fellow with a fine voice and real acting talent but perhaps the cold cynical nature of his two major roles kept audiences from warming to him.

If that is possible then this is a spoiler review.At first I was very pleased with everything about the movie. The acting was good. Every thing looked quite authentic or at least how in my mind I thought they should look. But if the viewer is familiar with the Christian Bible the longer you view the movie the worse it gets. The plot is no where near scripture. I know this movie lost money and in my opinion this is the reason. If the film industry would like a biblical movie to make money they should at least make an attempt to keep it somewhat near accurate. I could not under any an any way tell another Christian that this was a good movie for family viewing. The first 15 minutes or so is accurate there is a little bit of accuracy in the middle but not much and the last 5 minutes or so is worth watching. The rest is a bust.".

If that is possible then this is a spoiler review.At first I was very pleased with everything about the movie. The acting was good. Every thing looked quite authentic or at least how in my mind I thought they should look. But if the viewer is familiar with the Christian Bible the longer you view the movie the worse it gets. The plot is no where near scripture. I know this movie lost money and in my opinion this is the reason. If the film industry would like a biblical movie to make money they should at least make an attempt to keep it somewhat near accurate. I could not under any an any way tell another Christian that this was a good movie for family viewing. The first 15 minutes or so is accurate there is a little bit of accuracy in the middle but not much and the last 5 minutes or so is worth watching. The rest is a bust.";

A mute Mr. Mitchell is wounded and taken home to live with Mr. Purdom's family. They worship one God Jehovah according to the opening narration they are Hebrew.

Turner's likewise aroused but requires a payment of pearls as is customary for Baal. Meanwhile high priest Louis Calhern as Nahreeb the previous owner of Mitchell desires revenge. Turner does little to justify her star billing. This is an adaptation of The Prodigal Son story from The New Testament Luke 15 1132 which is mentioned in the introduction.

Anyway considering the maligned reputation of THE SILVER CHALICE 1954  which I caught recently coincidentally in tribute to its own leading man Paul Newman  I must admit that I found this an even lesser and duller Biblical outing! True Christ's parable does not provide much detail of the hero's experiences after he leaves his Hebrew hometown for another Pagan citybut what we have here is among the lamest and most stodgily presented trips along the wayward path this side of Cecil B. De Mille being closest in theme to his SAMSON AND DELILAH 1949! Though the supporting cast looks mighty impressive on paper including two from THE SILVER CHALICE itself namely Joseph Wiseman and Walter Hampden  Neville Brand Louis Calhern Paul Cavanaugh Henry Daniell John Dehner Cecil Kellaway and Francis L. Sullivan  the participants are either given little to do or embarrassed by their unwieldy costumes and unflattering makeup especially Brand's making him look like a 20th century wrestler!. Of course while the film purports to tell Purdom's tale MGM saw fit to give top billing to their resident alluring star Lana Turner but needless to say this type of role did nothing to her career and she was probably happy to throw herself into women's pictures thereafter. However perhaps the film's biggest fault is the fact that the filmmakers thought it imperative to include such incongruous scenes as Purdom hilariously grappling with a fake voracious buzzard and the spectacular actionpacked finale which totally subverts Christ's message in that the hero is seen returning home humbled so as to conform with the original text when truly he should have flaunted the victory of his God over the rampant Paganism in Damascus!".

His arrogance gets under the skin of the local bigwigs who eventually get fed up and decide to take him down a few pegs. He takes out his frustration over being taken advantage of and generally acting like a chump by leading a revolt which destroys the society of Damascus and results in anarchy. He goes along as his pals stone the priestess to death even though she wasn't really a bad person and didn't do anything really wrong except to faithfully practice her evil religion. Then he goes home with his tail between is legs where much is made of him.";

Sullivan I'm too old for many things Samarra but I'm too young to die! and a gleeful performance by Neville Brand as the most hideous of heavies all help to offset a ridiculously improved and Hollywood improving expansion of Jesus Christ's clever condensation of The Adventures of Toby as recorded in the New Testament. Yes beyond a few ridiculous exchanges of King James English between a determinedtobedull Hampden and an equally unmoved and unmoving John Dehner right at the finish the screenplay bears virtually no relationship whatever to even the New Testament parable The Prodigal Son let alone to the story's Old Testament genesis in the Book of Tobit or Toby or Tobias.However cinematographer Ruttenberg's expert lighting and those dazzling sets compensate for a lot. And there are other bizarrely appealing features too though these do not include Walter Hampden's tedious old platitudemouthing patriarch and the oddly incongruous phrases of original King James dialogue which sits most uneasily into this tale's meretricious semiBiblical frame.MGM have spent money like manure on everything except the script and direction both of which are hopeless. Without the obvious input of Ruttenberg Thorpe had obviously no ideas how to use CinemaScope to advantage especially given the enormous sets he has to play around with here. The action is often spectacularly staged but with only four or five exceptions all the dialogue scenes are loosely framed in the center of the screen. And even the action cries out for improvement here and there. For instance the climactic toppling of Baal looks most compelling in the trailer but unfortunately Thorpe neglected to shoot the crowd's approach from the corresponding left angle so this really effective shot could not be edited into the film at all. The movie itself has to rely on a tame righthand topple instead! Thorpe's careless printitanyhow approach is also evidenced by the extraordinarily large amount at least for a studioshot movie of postsyncing. All Joseph Wiseman's and Taina Elg's dialogue has been revoiced and even Miss Turner mouths a now silent line fortunately back to camera. Odd dissolves and juxtapositions betray the desperate devices of a film editor vainly trying to patch together odds and ends of impossibly illmatched footage.As for our stars Edmund Purdom reprising his role in The Egyptian 1954 seems even more woodenly out of place while Miss Turner unwittingly portraying her onedimensional floozy as the stuff of burlesque certainly rates as being equally amusing though decidedly far more agreeable to look upon. I suspect this is Herschel's final film. He designed many costumes for 20th CenturyFox from 1936 to 1942 freelanced briefly in 1948 then worked for MGM from 1951 to 1954. His bestknown films on some of which he worked with other designers are Joan of Arc Quo Vadis Dream Wife Julius Caesar Latin Lovers and Give a Girl a Break.".

	schema:headline " Exceptionally realistic and cold Noir film in which Lino Ventura as stubborn Police Inspector is awesome .";
	schema:reviewBody "Classic French Polar film with two greatest stars of the seventies  homely  craggylooking mug Lino Ventura and attractive Marlene Jovert . Rude police inspector Lonetti brutish burlyframed presence Lino Ventura  a twofisted  violent cop detains a son of powerful lawyer and this one seeks vengeance . As soon as chief inspector to be aware  Leonetti has been sent to a suburban district after being reprimanded . Leonetti is angry to be moved a secondrate police station but he is assigned to form a peculiar team . There he meets young and beautiful Jeanne Dumas Marlene Jovert who is given as his colleague . Both of whom join forces to catch smalltime delinquents . Later on  the duo formed by the efficient policeman and the rookie cop are soon assigned a very difficult assignment  to find a missing witness whose evidence is instrumental in convicting a killer called Soramon Heron . They start searching throughout Paris  asking neighbours  finding several tracks and red herrings . Meanwhile  they are pursued by a mysterious gangster called Greg Michael Constantin . This is a suspense Polar or French Noir film in which intrigue and thriller is continuous . From the beginning to the end it turns out to suspenseful  including well developing of interesting characters  and for that reason is entertaining . The movie has great loads of emotion  darkedged drama  tension and intriguing events . Exciting and thoughtprovoking screenplay by the same Jose Giovanni  based on the novel titled Dernier Domicile Connu written by Joseph Harrington . Studiocharacter about unsettling characters damned to inevitable tragedies  powerful finale  stylized set pieces heightens the suspense and tension have place in all Jose Giovanni's filmmaking . One of his favourite actors was Lino Ventura  whom Jose directed many times . Actors' interpretation is excellent  as Lino Ventura  as Marlene Jobert . Ventura as a serious as well as tough cop with dark past is magnificent . Lino was a big French star and exboxer  looking for gangster types for his next film  director Jacques Becker gave the inexperienced 34yearold his first acting job as bad guy support to star Jean Gabin in the crime thriller Hand off the loot 1954 . Lino went on to appear with Gabin in several of the star's subsequent movies  often playing a gangster  including Crime and Punishment  Speaking of Murder and Maigret. Lino came into his own as a toughnut character star in the 1960s playing both sides of the moral fence  as policeman or mobster . Lino appeared in scores of films now considered classic French cinema . His peculiar aspect took the form of various criminals types as in Second Breath 1966 and Happy New Year 1973 as well as dogged  goodguy inspectors in The incorruptible 1975 or The French Detective  Illustrious Corpses 1976 and The Grilling . He played other unforgettable films  such as The Three penny Opera  Modigliani The adventurers  The slap Jailbird's vacation  The army of shadows  Witness in the City and Joe Valachi's papers . Support cast is pretty good  as Paul Crauchet  Michael Constantine and uncredited Serge Marquand . Evocative and atmospheric cinematography by Etienne Becker is simply riveting . Special mention for musical score by Franois De Roubaix  it's sensitive and agreeable  including a feeling leitmotif . The motion picture was well produced by Jacques Bar and compellingly writtendirected by Jose Giovanni  making a memorable work  though sometimes results to be slowmoving . Giovanni participated in the French Resistance during World War II . Worked as a lumberjack  diver  mountain guide and coal miner . Jose wrote 20 novels 2 memories' books  33 scripts  and directed 15 movies and 5 TV movies . His novel Le Trou The hole slang for prison  which became a classic film  was based on his own escape attempt from a Paris prison . Director Jacques Becker bought the rights of the book and directed it in 1959  considered to be the best prison movie . That's how Jos Giovanni entered the cinema world . He became a wellknown dialoguist  scenarist too working many times with Jacques Becker . Then he directed his first movie in 1966  La Loi Des Survivants  while he was still writing novels about gangsters  cops  prison and manly friendship . He was a purveyor of a certain kind of noir movie  creating his own company and a tiny studio . Some of his films  many are based from his own novels  include Le Rapace 1968 La Scoumoune 1972  The gypsy 1975  Boomerang 1976  and Le Ruffian 1983. Giovanni directed some great French actors as Alain Delon  Jean Gabin  JeanPaul Belmondo  and  of course  Lino Ventura .".

Their careers take an upswing when unbeknown to Leonetti his former boss assigns him the futile task of finding a witness in 8 days before a major murder trial. What his superiors didn't count on was Leonetti's tenacity in finding this uncooperative witness and the fact that the accused also has some men out with the same task. This is the third film from director Jos Giovanni writer of THE SICILIAN CLAN and it proves to be a pretty grim affair. There is a lot of commentary on the rat or should I say ant race as Leonetti is just a cog in the wheel of justice at one point Jeanne event comments on his unending searching asking if he is a robot. Audiences will probably feel the most connection with Jobert's character as she is tackling the assignment with a fresh belief in the system. Ventura is awesome in the lead role of the seenitall vet and he has a great fight scene toward the end. You'll probably see the end coming but it still has quite an impact thanks to a matteroffact presentation by Giovanni.".

Police are supposed to be searching for key witness in an important trial and give the task to an out of favour cop known for a tendency to get the job done by whatever means. The marvellous Lino Ventura is that cop and almost as an aside he's given a rookie assistant played by Marlene Jobert. It is an early film for her but she had already been in Louis Malle's Thief of Paris and Godard's Masculin Feminin! Both are great in this and just as well because they are the film as we follow them around the outskirts of Paris following clue by clue. Much of the film is clearly shot in the streets and is really well done. Being French there is always time to stop off in a cafe or bistro and these slower scenes are also very well done. This doesn't sound particularly thrilling but it is faultlessly put together and never lets up as we race from corner to corner of those charming Parisian streets.".

The translation to French society is done very well keeping and preserving themes such as the superficiality transience and anonimity of life in a major city. The human cost of such an urban existence can come very high as illustrated in a scene where two detectives go to a school in order to ask questions about a pupil. Teachers and staff are kind and dedicated but point out that many of the children disappear somewhere along the line as a result of their parents moving losing their jobs divorcing... The result is a state of permanent changeability where no one succeeds in getting a good grasp on the background problems and capabilities of the various pupils.Jobert and Ventura as the detectives are in fine shape and give good performances. Unfortunately the first ten minutes of the movie are confusing mainly because someone somewhere thought it would be a good idea to start the story while showing the initial credits. This was not a good idea. After this confusing beginning the movie proceeds in a clear and linear fashion enlivened by occasional thumbnail sketches of urban eccentrics. Watch out for the seemingly normal and civilized lady who treats her pets like infants but hates every child and adolescent she sees  they're all grinning apes or hot little sluts.At one point in the movie  I'm trying to avoid spoilers here  one of the characters gets involved in a savage street fight. The fight is wellchoreographed and wellexecuted exuding a realistic violence and viciousness. Strangely the character thus attacked and beaten up is capable of continuing his activities where logic would dictate an urgent hospitalisation followed by many months of careful rehabilitation.

	schema:reviewBody "In a nutshell I'd call this police drama 'pretty good'. But not nearly as excellent as some reviewers have made it out to be. On the plus side are the standout performances of tough cop Lino Ventura and his rookie assistant the enchanting Marlne Jobert. In the early 1970s Jobert was probably France's most indemand actress so lovely and so endearing that it was hard not to fall in love with her. I succombed immediately on seeing her irresistible performance in Ren Clment's classic Rider on the Rain where she is perfectly paired with the redoubtable Charles Bronson.Also on the plus side are many gorgeous glimpses of Paris by day and by night.On the minus side though is the contrived drama of the movie. Like many French police films of the period it tries too hard to be more than a police story. It strives to be a meaningful essay on modern society morality and lost illusions.Still it's pretty good and if you're a fan of directors like Sidney Lumet Arthur Penn and Elia Kazan you'll probably find a great deal to like in Dernier domicile connu. But if your taste runs more toward Alfred Hitchcock and Fritz Lang you can skip this one and go directly to Rider on the Rain.".

In the film 'Last known address' there is some great work done by actors. Lino Ventura is the one who would not stop at anything to reclaim his lost honor. He has always viewed his honesty as a force. Marlne Jobert's character undergoes major changes especially with regards to her involvement with Lino Ventura. In the beginning she is shown as a mere colleague but ends up being a companion of life.

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film on the European culture channel ARTE mainly for its two great stars Lino Ventura and Marlene Jobert which I remembered dearly from their performances in the French movies of the 70s. I was not wrong it is actually the quality of their acting that holds the whole film or what survived the four decades since its making.It's a cop story like the ones they loved to film at that point in time and they still love to film nowadays. Ventura is a tired cop hit by life he lost his wife and daughter in a car accident and by the system he is sent to a nonimportant job because of a lawyerish intrigue. He pairs with young enthusiastic and sweet Jobert in searching for a key witness who seems to have evaporated in the urban jungle. Their moves are followed by the mob who tries to avoid their boss being condemned as result of the witness deposition. They find the witness and his kid daughter the emotional balance of the story but the ultimate result will be tragic.While the two principal characters are alive by virtue of the acting of these two wonderful actors the rest of the film is written in quite a conventional manner. Lino Ventura is tough battered by life and human Marlene Jobert is beautiful fragile and naive and has the most beautiful pair of eyes in the history of French cinema which does not lack beautiful eyes. The ending inspired many other films to come but if remade today the film would be much more tense much more violent and more true to reality. 'Dernier domicile connu' does not age well. It's still worth being seen by fans of director Jose Giovani or of Ventura and Jobert as one of the solid pieces of their work.".

He loved that it displayed a stubborn officer walking his beat in the midst of general hostility against police. It was really fashionable to criticise the police around 1969 and Giovanni is happy to drive the point home more than once most prominently in Paul Crauchet's monologue but generally in the absurdity of Lino Ventura's assignments. Subtlety is definitely not Giovanni's forte but here it blends well with the simple police procedural.All in all this could have been a tremendous modern noir with a better director Melville Sautet. The result doesn't show important directorial choices. Camera work and editing are average and sound editing is poor while Franois de Roubaix's score would have been sufficient to carry most of the images. In the end you will feel as if the movie simply vanishes from your memory while you were really rooting for Ventura and Joubert minutes before.".

I'm sure that this is a pretty hard movie to come across but if you ever get the opportunity to see it by all means take advantage of it.";

If you practice Kung Fu you have to watch it repeatedly to learn a lot from the real masters. It is quite good for the first Kung Fu movie made in China about 20 years ago.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Tang Emperor is betrayed by one of his own generals who installed himself as the new Emperor of the eastern region. The population of this area are the ones to suffer with many forced into slavery to work at his demand. Chieh Yuan and his father are two such men but one day Chieh and his father fight back and although the two bravely hold off the guards his father is killed as he instructs Chieh to flee to fight another day. Neardeath Chieh finds himself at a Shaolin monastery where he is taken in and nursed back to health. He takes up the teachings of the monks  in particular the martial arts  and prepares for the day he will meet his father's killer. In the meantime though he has to worry about the many rules that his new life imposes on him.On some levels this film is a terrible mess of a thing. The plot is quite basic and the writers really need to hit three stages of narrative which are 1 events before the monastery 2 events at the monastery and 3 events around the conflict that closes out stage 1. These are all in place but it is up to them how they fill out these three stages and in this case it must be said the answer is not that well. We get lots of things happening but not of them are that good. Chieh manages to kill a dog which belongs to the daughter of his master eat meat and get the others eating meat and do all manner of things that kinda go against the whole Buddhist monk vibe that he had been working on. The film has these come up and be laughed off by the others and after a while it just feels a bit weird. I'm not defending Buddha here and if these bits had been funny or engaging then I would not have cared one bit but as it is they don't work and even as time filler they are not that worth while.In reality though this doesn't matter because nobody has come to this film for the plot so much as they have to see Jet Li making his film debut and jumping right into film success. And jump he does I'm not want to avoid rubbish linking puns as almost all of the action in this film is impressive and engaging. Some of it is quite soft in regards the danger faced by our characters whereas some is pretty tough but whether it is a training demonstration or the final montage of fights it is really impressive on physical and technical levels. It also helps that it is well short. Having just watched Transporter 3 recently Shaolin Si comes over as a breath of fresh air in how it is willing to put the camera down and shoot action sequences where each take is longer than gasp 1 second and brace yourselves we get several moves in each take no!. This lets us see that the cast can do their stuff and you can see why Li became a massive name because he is unbelievably skilled and has great physical control  heck I've started to make a little grunting noise every time I stand up whereas he seems to do the impossible in his stride. Looking back and even then Li does get all the attention but everyone else is just as good with lots of impressive moves. Not everyone has as good a screen presence the daughter being a bit weak for example but when it comes to the action everyone performs.Shaolin Si doesn't have the greatest script and by extension the performances and also how much the viewer will care about the characters are also weakened. However in regards simple physical ability of those involved in the making it is very engaging indeed. There are consistent and enjoyable scenes of martial arts action  a couple stand out above the rest but all of them are impressive and fun to watch. Ignore the narrative but definitely stay for the action.".

I don't quite see the nuance.Which is not the say the film is bad. In fact it is quite good and draws a firm line between romance and Buddha. And the scenery. Wow. I don't know if these are real locations or sets but it is world's better than the onedimensional scenery we find in the Shaw Brothers movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are some spoilers down below. Just a bit of a heads up. It has some pretty good fight sequences and some emotional drama that managed to get to me. I was lucky enough to find a subtitled version online so did it live up to what I expected? For the most part yep! Right from the outset with the drama orientated opening which was my cue to realize I was at least going to get a quality film. I'm a big fan of Jet Li's. I enjoyed his motives for revenge and never say die attitude but I felt they could have gone a lot further with it. My only complaints about this movie are this. It's that there are some rather unfunny slapstick sequences. Martial Art stars like Jet  Jackie Chan are infamous for these and usually they are a hoot but I didn't like them very much in this one. Maybe I'm being a stickler but I don't find a dog accidentally being killed very funny. I also didn't appreciate the slaughtering of multitudes of sheep. It made me very uncomfortable and turned me off for a little bit. It does have some decent training sequences and the fight sequences despite presumably being filled with wires were above average. Jet Li shows off that charisma that he is well known for here. It's no surprise as to why he achieved stardom.Final Thoughts It was a pretty good film and always interesting. I wouldn't say it was awesome but it did provide me with entertainment for the most part which is all I care about. Well worth watching if you manage to find it 710".

You are not watching this movie for the story it is for Jet kicking some serious butt.Since my user name is what it is it should be no surprise the only thing I hated about this movie was all the disgusting meateating. I am used to people eating dead animal flesh in movies but it was super offensive to have Buddhist Shoalin monks eating flesh off the bone.

There is another scene where a lamb's throat is crushed by a follower of the evil king and his lackeys run around killing sheep with lances. I understand the setting was long before the existence of PETA but it was nonetheless surprising disturbing to see actual animals butchered on camera.Nevertheless the Kung Fu in this movie is spectacular. Jet Li and his costars have such incredible command of their movements it is breathtaking.

So it's no surprise that the motive for the happenings in the film La Vergine di Norimberga directly rely on Nazi war atrocities  and to combine Gothic horror with the darkest chapter of German history is undoubtedly unique the German version however censored the whole Nazi subplot and made the killer's motive much simpler  avoid this version at all costs. This combination may sound odd but it works in this film perfectly and gives it also a no war ever againstatement that I fully support but if one watches how many wars are always going on in all different places on earth one really wonders if mankind has learned of the past war atrocities including WWII.Christopher Lee gives another supporting role to remember and Riz Ortolani's score is bombastic but fits the Gothic atmosphere of the picture. There are some surprisingly gory moments in the film concerning it was made in 1963 but they never make the impression of being gratuitous or senseless. I highly recommend this film not only to fans of the genre. The U.S.video print from Panther Video long out of print though presents a surprisingly good looking picture quality with lush colors and clear sound that would also make a fine DVD release possible.My rating 8 out of 10  look for this gem!".

	schema:headline " Another Great Gothic Tale From Margheriti";
	schema:reviewBody "La Vergine Di Norimberga aka. The Virgin Of NurembergTerror Castle is a wonderfully atmospheric and delicately demented Gothic gem from genius director Antonio Margheriti that should appeal to every fan of the uncanny. No true Horror fan or even cineaste in general could possibly deny that the late Margheriti had a great talent to create a Gothic atmosphere. Especially his 1964 masterpiece Danza Macabra aka. Castle Of Blood starring the incomparable Barbara Steele is pure Gothic brilliance and ranks among my personal favorites. While The Virgin Of Nuremberg does not quite reach the brilliance of Castle Of Blood in my opinion this is yet another excellent Gothic Tale that no lover of Gothic and Italian Horror can afford to miss. The film is terrifically set in a medieval castle full of terrible instruments of torture. Mary Hunter Rosanna Podesta whose husband Georges Rivire is the owner of the castle since he has inherited it from his father awakes one night hearing screams. The castle was once owned by a bloodthirsty judge and after four hundred years the judge suddenly seems to be walking the castle again craving for blood...The film builds up a wonderfully creepy and yet often beautiful atmosphere from the first minute the eerie castlesetting ingenious camerawork and sublime score by the brilliant Riz Ortolani go in hand how it will only be experienced in Gothic tales from the good old days. For the year of its release 1963 the film has an unusually high gore level and an enormous nastiness. Horror icon Christopher Lee as far as I am considered one of the greatest actors ever has a small but great role. Lee is once again outstanding and my only regret with The Virgin Of Nuremberg is that he had not quite a lot of screentime. The English aka. title by the way is not quite 100 accurate. La Vergine Di Norimberga does indeed translate as The Virgin Of Nuremberg however it is also the synonym for a gruesome medieval torturing device  the iron maiden. Atmospheric excellent and very very creepy The Virgin Of Nuremberg is a Horror experience that no real genrelover could possibly afford to miss. Films like this one prove that Margheriti was Italy's second only to Mario Bava when it comes Gothic Horror. A mustsee for every Italian Horror fan or lover of Gothic greatness.".

While The Virgin Of Nuremberg does not quite reach the brilliance of Castle Of Blood in my opinion this is yet another excellent Gothic Tale that no lover of Gothic and Italian Horror can afford to miss. The film is terrifically set in a medieval castle full of terrible instruments of torture. Mary Hunter Rosanna Podesta whose husband Georges Rivire is the owner of the castle since he has inherited it from his father awakes one night hearing screams. The castle was once owned by a bloodthirsty judge and after four hundred years the judge suddenly seems to be walking the castle again craving for blood...The film builds up a wonderfully creepy and yet often beautiful atmosphere from the first minute the eerie castlesetting ingenious camerawork and sublime score by the brilliant Riz Ortolani go in hand how it will only be experienced in Gothic tales from the good old days. For the year of its release 1963 the film has an unusually high gore level and an enormous nastiness. Horror icon Christopher Lee as far as I am considered one of the greatest actors ever has a small but great role. Lee is once again outstanding and my only regret with The Virgin Of Nuremberg is that he had not quite a lot of screentime. The English aka. title by the way is not quite 100 accurate. La Vergine Di Norimberga does indeed translate as The Virgin Of Nuremberg however it is also the synonym for a gruesome medieval torturing device  the iron maiden. Atmospheric excellent and very very creepy The Virgin Of Nuremberg is a Horror experience that no real genrelover could possibly afford to miss. Films like this one prove that Margheriti was Italy's second only to Mario Bava when it comes Gothic Horror. A mustsee for every Italian Horror fan or lover of Gothic greatness.";

	schema:headline " As Visually Beautiful as a movie can be";
	schema:reviewBody "What truly makes the difference between La Vergine di Norimberga and the rest of the Italian horror movies of the 60s and 70s is the amazing visual composition that director Antonio Margheriti creates with the aid of his team. Music and visuals converge to create one of the most beautifully looking horror movies.Based on a novel by Frank Bogart the movie is about a woman Mary Rosanda Podest who has recently moved to his new husband's castle in Germany. The Gothic castle keeps many secrets and one night Mary watches a murdered woman inside of one of the many torture devices kept in the castle's museum. Her husband Max Hunter George Riviere thinks it was a hallucination since there is no proof a murder took place in the castle but she is convinced that the old family friend Erich Christopher Lee is responsible of the murder. The mysterious dark figure of The Punisher roams the castle but is he a ghost? or something else? This movie mixes perfectly the suspense and the mystery the jazzy score at first may seem odd but it fits the movie very well giving a bigger atmosphere of surrealism to the movie very fitting to Mary's confused state of mind. The beautiful sets are like a canvas with a palette predominantly red that gives the movie an elegant yet dark look. It is a very unique look for a horror movie and it works in an awesome way.The acting is good for the most part although the dubbing that Italian movies used to have is a bit bad. Particularly in the case of Christopher Lee whose voice is quite different. Nevertheless Podest makes a great performance and while Lee is relegated to a supporting role he also makes a good job. George Riviere's performance may not be the best although It would be better to judge it with the original audio.The score is haunting and very appropriate. Oscar winner Riz Ortolani created a score that sets up the atmosphere of surrealism the film demands. In fact if a flaw was to be found was that at times it feels too much style over substance as there are points of high visual beauty but little plot development.The SFX are quite advanced for its age mainly in the makeup department as the movie delivers some gore making a bizarre contrast between the beauty of the setting and the gruesome violence of the villain. While this movie may seem outdated it is an overlooked gem that is still very good.This was the first horror movie by Antonio Margheriti and it was without a doubt his best. A joy to watch Italian Gothic horror at its best. 810".

Is the sadistic hooded killer who creeps around the castle at night Mary's new husband? Or is it the sinister looking Christopher Lee? Or is it...gasp!...someone else??? The truth comes with no build up of suspense although the makeup effects used on the living skull are pretty cool considering the time this film was made. But with the exception of the lovely Gothic atmosphere and the rat scene this film is pretty dull. I had to fast forward through at least 20 minutes of Mary just walking around to get to the good stuff...and there wasn't enough good stuff to make up for the overuse of the FF button. I give it a 4 out of 10.".

The truth comes with no build up of suspense although the makeup effects used on the living skull are pretty cool considering the time this film was made. But with the exception of the lovely Gothic atmosphere and the rat scene this film is pretty dull. I had to fast forward through at least 20 minutes of Mary just walking around to get to the good stuff...and there wasn't enough good stuff to make up for the overuse of the FF button. I give it a 4 out of 10.";

The film may be a bit slow by the standards of today's audiences but was a real chiller back in the midsixties when it came out.

	schema:reviewBody "Behold the scenery...the sets...the music...the atmosphere! The Virgin of Nuremberg is as Gothic as it gets and the perfect film to demonstrate that horror once was the most sophisticated genre in cinema! The movie opens with a terrific precredits sequence in which a woman wanders around an ancient castle and she senses she's not alone. This sequence alone is at least ten times scarier than anything featuring in a horror movie of the last fifteen years. When the story moves on we learn that this women is the wife of Max Hunter whose father owned the castle that also serves as a museum. Something bizarre happened to him during WWII and Max as well as the servants seem to be aware of the presence of an evil creature who tortures innocent women in the dungeons of the castle. It isn't the plot that makes this film so mesmerizing mind you. It's the sublime atmosphere along with the stunning set pieces and top notch musical score by Riz Ortolani!. The tone is truly ominous and genuine scares are merely reached through slowly developed eeriness thunder lightening and booby traps all around!. The Virgin of Nuremberg is beautiful to observe and in a strange way very sexy! By the way in case you're looking for sleaze you'll feel cheated! Despite of what the title leads to believe 'The Virgin of Nuremberg' isn't a fragile young girl but a gruesome torture device in the shape of a sarcophagus. The unfortunate victim gets hisher eyes stabbed out in by pins attached on the inside. There are a couple of other impressive torture methods featuring in this film like the sequence involving an icky cage and a hungry rat! Very very creepy! The Virgin of Nuremberg easily is Antonio Margheriti's greatest film although I have a strange admiration for his filthy achievement Cannibal Apocalypse and another proof that he was a severely underrated filmmaker. If you like classic horror...this is a must!".

I am beginning to hat this mans acting and choice of jobs. I recently watched all the Lee Dracula movies and his best attributes are his costume and stance his British accent as Dracula is ridiculous and his dialogue is trash. Hammer was good for a couple of things setscolorlighting and music. Go watch some of the trash Lee appeared in the 70s. Real garbage. Very sad.Now to this movie. What we have here is a wife of a castlemuseum owner wandering around. It started out mysterious and intriguing. Then nothing much happens. The husband is away most of the time. And Lee is there to show off his stupid scar. The story is somehow about a Nazi conspirator to kill Hitler who is deformed and now he's on a rampage to torture women just as the new wife movies in. How convenient! I guess producers needed stores and they picked this one.The music is completely inappropriate. We have some kind of Bebop jazz number in a castle horror film probably to invoke some kind of romance between the new wife and husband. Then there's the ridiculous horror tones when the wife is running around outside. The death scenes are nonsense. The makeup is trash. Lee was garbage. There's a real funny section when he climbs the side of the house then rolls off and falls to the ground. I was hoping he was dead. But then get this and FBI agent helps him and since they can't get in the house they drive away to get help. Well if you have a car and you just tried to get in the castle by breaking down the door with your shoulder maybe you can try crashing through the door with the car rather than driving away for help. Maybe the cops can bring a battering ram or have extra keys to the castle. Real stupidity in this film. There's a scene where the husband is trapped in a dungeon filling with water. This goes on for  hour. Finally he miraculously breaks out and then saves his wife. And then we get the happy ending. Lee dies in a fire with the Nazi punisher. This is one stupid crappy movie. If you're a fan of Lee DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. If you're a fan of horror movies or movies in general or art or life or anything do not see this movie. The film makers had a budget. Sets a freaking castle some decent actors that were given crap dialogue and this is what we get.The only reason to see this movie is to study it then read the reviews of people who likeloved it and then write a psychological paper on the human mind. Current IMDb rating is a joke at 5.9. This is a 1 star nothing to see here. Garbage storydialoguedubbingactingscenesmusicsound effectseditingjust plain stupid movie.

This little subplot allowed for the use of Nazi newsreel footage and to explain why the guy has had the flesh removed from his head  which amazingly seemed to make the facial muscles larger than they should be.

When she awakens her husband and the servants try very hard to convince her it was all a bad dream but she isn't THAT stupid and so she spends much of the movie blindly investigating what is happening. So you see someone horribly murdered and you stick around and investigateeven after being attacked by a hooded maniac!?!? Can anyone be that addlebrained?!?! Despite this murder and a lot more mayhem to come the household does its best to cover up what is really happening. Again this made no sense and was just dumb. Even worse after the maniac is eventually cornered and is about to die his servant Christopher Lee runs after him into the burning castle to die as well. Gee...yet ANOTHER brainless character! Oh and now that I mentioned Lee let me point out that he is NOT a reason to see this film. Despite having a majorly cool scar across his face his role is at best secondary. Plus although the dubbing of his voice is close that is NOT Lee's voice. Now I understand that this was originally an Italian language production but why they didn't have Lee use his own deep and melodious voice is beyond me.Also if you are brave enough to see this mess of a film listen to the sound track. It might just be the worst sound track I have ever heard from a film. While not as inept as that in THE BEAST FROM YUCCA FLATS the problem is how inappropriate the music iswith a flashy jazz score when something befitting a Gothic horror film was required. It's bad...laughably bad.So what is GOOD?! Well the mood is excellent and very spooky. While not as over the top gross and moody as THE TORTURE CHAMBER OF DR. SADISM made roughly the same time with Christopher Lee it is unusual in the brutality and vividness of its chamber of horrors. This does work well.Overall unless you are a rabid fan of Lee or you like really bad Italian horror films then this one is very very skipable.

	schema:headline " The jazz score does not work in this horror flick";
	schema:reviewBody "Though I am fond of listening to jazz I found the jazz score for this movie too intrusive and distracting. The problem manifested itself early in the movie when during a break in the action a very nice jazz melody rang out that unfortunately seemed to be totally inappropriate to the setting and mood being created by the visuals. Great movie music supports the mood or spirit of the action on the screen. It should not take over. There are exceptions or course such as the music from O Brother Where Art Thou which essentially plays a lead role in that film. In my opinion the film would benefit greatly from a rescore or at least the provision of an alternate score. Has anyone tried this kind of thing before? It would be well suited to the DVD format.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on a novel by Frank Bogart this film has several titles including 'Horror Castle' which is the one I viewed. It seems people either love or hate this film. In a castle by the Rhine a hooded killer is killing people mainly women. Is it Max Hunter the owner of the castle? Is it the scarred Erich his assistant? Is it the frozen faced Martha the housekeeper? Is it Fred the butler? Or is it....? Sounds interesting but I found it rather tedious. The plot and the actions of the characters don't make any sense. Most of the film seems to be Max's wife Mary wandering around the castle in a silky dressing gown being frightened. Only at the hour mark does she get dressed. Rossana Podesta as Mary Hunter is very picturesque roaming about in her silky dressing gown but it does pall after a while. Christopher Lee as Erich doesn't have much to do. The rest of the cast are bland. The Riz Ortolani score is amusingly over the top. On the positive side the film does look good and the sets are atmospheric. Being a dubbed version some of the credits are Anglicised. Editor Otello Colangeli becomes Angel Coly director of photography Riccardo Pallottini become Richard Palton and of course as often happens director Antonio Margheriti becomes Anthony Dawson. But when he is credited with special effects Antonio Margheriti now becomes Anthony Matthews!Not a classic as other people see it but then that's only my opinion.".

Trying to overcome the fear especially after an encounter with a strange man she can't identify she begins to suspect that the servant Erich Christopher Lee is the cause despite assurances he's safe. As he tends to business nearby she is soon enthralled with the legend of the castle's past owner and decides to investigate the story. Shortly thereafter she begins to see a strange figure running around the castle's grounds but can't seem to figure out their purpose or who it is. Using her own suspicions as well as whatever evidence she can muster from the investigations she eventually discovers the truth about the figure and tries to stop it.The Good News This here is one of the best examples of the genre. One of the main things this gets right is the incredible suspense and on display. The opening is a fantastic example with the flowing gownclad woman following the agonized cries of a woman coming from somewhere within the castle leads her to discovers blood flowing into the collection bowl beneath the Virgin of Nuremberg a fabled iron maiden torture chamber that is now a museum. Opening the spiked door Mary is horrified to see the body of a freshly dead woman inside the corpse's eyes have been gouged out leaving ragged bloody sockets. It's a fantastic scene with the endless wandering through an enormous house during a raging thunderstorm using only a candle for light until they stumble upon a rather shocking and horrific scene. This is really eerie from the glimpses shown strewn around the house of various torture devices some with the skeleton remains of victims still there all the way to the creepy and intense reaction to the eyeless corpse hidden in the statue. That goes handinhand with the great sets in here as every corner and crevice is filled with inky black shadows pierced only by the glow of a flickering torch or flash of lightning. Thus the look of the film never approaches the surreal instead remaining much more grounded in realism. This one handily avoids the pitfalls of others out there in the genre and makes marvelous use of the huge sprawling castle set. Even the outside scenes have a nice feeling to them as the spaciousness of the castle grounds mix well with the giant castle looming in the background. The later scenes in the crypt look cool and a very tense stalking scene in the darkness is masterfully played out. The film also has a couple of really great shock gore scenes that are a lot more graphic than most others of the time. These are the discovery of a victim her head covered with a cage inhabited by a very hungry rat which has gnawed away at her face the initial discovery of the first victim and finally the killer himself unmasked his face nothing more than a skull covered with the faintest suggestion of skin. These images are really quite out there for the time and make for some great moments. The sequences at the end with the torturer are just as good being a little creepy with some graphic brutality stakes placed into the film to give it a little extra punch to what's going on. These here are what really make the film enjoyable.The Bad News There isn't a whole lot here that doesn't work. The fact that this one doesn't exactly have the best paced story is something to get over as there's a couple of instances where the film doesn't really do much but consist of endless wandering around the castle grounds and at times that's a little too much to take. It does have a creepy feel but then there's points where it doesn't do anything other than to wish for a faster moving pace. There's also the needless insertion of a couple scenes where two doctors are apparently talking about what's going on but their inclusion nor the object of their discussion is never given. At times it feels like it's there to simply speed up the runtime and otherwise have no need to do it. These here provide the film's only real flaws.The Final Verdict A fantastic Italian Gothic entry that has a lot going for it this one is a really watchable film that will have a good feel to it. Highly recommended to Italian Gothic horror or 60s horror in general while the notso fans won't really get into this one.Today's RatingPG13 Violence".

	schema:headline " Mario Bava I worship thee!";
	schema:reviewBody "Irresistible and genuine Gothic scares combined with atmospheric camerawork and breathtaking scenery Welcome to yet another visual masterpiece directed by the greatest horror genius of all time Mario Bava! The Whip and the Body isn't the man's most mentioned achievement it's not even in my personal Bavatop 3 and yet I still rated it a solid 9 out of 10. That should give you somewhat an idea of how excellent his total repertoire in fact is. The Whip and the Body is a unique film in many ways but particularly because of the controversial substance it dared to bring forward. Don't forget that the year of release was 1963 and Mario Bava unscrupulously introduces characters with taboofetishes like S  M. The story is terrifically set in the 19th century where Kurt Menliff returns to his eminent family after being banished for several years. The family's hate towards Kurt's vile behavior is only surpassed by their fear and only the gorgeous Nevenka has a secret desire towards his wicked sexual preferences. In a particularly astonishing sequence he whips her repeatedly and roughly... before continuing with making love. Terror overcomes the Menliff family when Kurt is found murdered in his room and when the tormented Nevenka begins to see his appearance in nearly every chamber of the castle. As it usually is the case in Bava's films the plot contains quite a few holes and illogical moments but they're totally forgivable if you acknowledge the intensity and power of the wholesome. Especially praiseworthy is Mario Bava's unequaled talent to turn totally natural things into terrifying atmosphereelements Blowing wind pouring rain footprints covered in mud...all these ordinary things turn into suspicious omens in the hands of this masterful filmmaker. With his skilled cinematographic eye Bava perfectly knows how to raise an unbearable tension that grabs you by the neck immediately and it doesn't let go until the very last scene fades away. All the other typical Bavatrademarks are clearly present as well namely an authentically creepy score a minimum of stylish gore burning rotting corpses!! and  last but not least  a stunning use of color shades. Mario plays with colors like he invented them and this emphasizes the spookeffect even more. The Whip and the Body is a more than just a shocking horror film. It's an offbeat lovestory a Gothic poem AND an unsettling horror tale all in one! If you love beautiful cinema don't miss The Whip and the Body.".

	onyx:emotionText "Irresistible and genuine Gothic scares combined with atmospheric camerawork and breathtaking scenery Welcome to yet another visual masterpiece directed by the greatest horror genius of all time Mario Bava! The Whip and the Body isn't the man's most mentioned achievement it's not even in my personal Bavatop 3 and yet I still rated it a solid 9 out of 10. That should give you somewhat an idea of how excellent his total repertoire in fact is. The Whip and the Body is a unique film in many ways but particularly because of the controversial substance it dared to bring forward. Don't forget that the year of release was 1963 and Mario Bava unscrupulously introduces characters with taboofetishes like S  M. The story is terrifically set in the 19th century where Kurt Menliff returns to his eminent family after being banished for several years. The family's hate towards Kurt's vile behavior is only surpassed by their fear and only the gorgeous Nevenka has a secret desire towards his wicked sexual preferences. In a particularly astonishing sequence he whips her repeatedly and roughly... before continuing with making love. Terror overcomes the Menliff family when Kurt is found murdered in his room and when the tormented Nevenka begins to see his appearance in nearly every chamber of the castle.

All the praise thrown on director Bava is certainly needed because it's obvious he could take some mud and make it look wonderful but that doesn't mean all his films turn out great. I think the biggest flaw with this film is the rather weak story which doesn't really contain any shocks and it's fairly simple to figure out what's going on so in the end when the climax happens there's no real shocks. Christopher Lee turns in a terrific performance even though for some reason his voice is dubbed in the English language version. That fantastic look that Lee brings says all we need to know about his character. The supporting cast isn't as impressive but they fit their roles just fine. The cinematography is top notch and the use of lighting is also what makes this film stand apart from others in this era.".

	schema:reviewBody "Made around the same time as Mario's classic horror anthology BLACK SABBATH this deserves the same accolades as his other more famous work. Upon release WHIP was unfairly neglected hacked up censored and critically frowned upon for the subject matter sexual violence. Next to RABID DOGS 1974 it was also the most difficult of Bava's genre films to acquire in America I'm not even aware of an accessible home video release until just recently. All but forgotten for decades but now finally available in a gorgeous restored cut on DVD from Sinister Cinema WHIP is an absolute must see for Bava fans and very highly recommended for aficionados of Gothic horror. It is also a film that demands to be seen by any person interested in filmmaking as art  in set design costume design lighting schemes color shadow and music used for the creation of atmosphere and mood. Every single frame is composed with the utmost care and every inch of the screen exhibits such astonishing attention to detail that it almost begs to be watched in slow motion to soak it all in. Bava is a rare cinematic artist a true visionary who uses celluloid as his palate painting all the colors of the dark on drab dank and dreary castle walls and corridors. Even though the story slips into the routine at times it also is above average progressive serious entertaining and even extremely ballsy for the 1960s in that it dares to romanticize sexual violence and sadomasochism.Christopher Lee who considers this one of his best films is perfectly hateful as Kurt Menliff a coldeyed sadist who returns home to his family's seaside castle after being banished years earlier. His ailing father Gustavo De Nardo as Dean Ardow calls him a serpent his brother Christian Tony Kendall aka Luciano Stella has since married Kurt's beautiful ravenhaired exfianc Nevenka Daliah Lavi and the loyal housekeeper Giorgia Harriet Medin whose daughter Tanya had taken her own life after being seduced and abandoned by Kurt quietly plots her revenge. Also in the house is a pretty but plain young cousin named Katya Ida Galli as Isli Oberon who is actually in love with Christian and would undoubtedly make a much better mate for him. No one exactly welcomes Kurt home with open arms so when he's found dead with a dagger driven into his neck the same fashion Tanya ended her life it isn't a surprise though it does create a shroud of suspicion over every person in the castle. Even worse Kurt seems to have returned from the dead to haunt terrorize and inflict damage via the lash on poor emotionally fragile Nevenka.The most interesting and complex character in the film turns out to be Nevenka herself. Her lovehate relationship with Kurt is unique and memorable. Though Christian is handsome gentle and devoted to his bride she obviously has the strongest passion and love for the cruel Kurt who claims the reason he came back to the castle in the first place was that he heard his brother had married his former lover. Kurt's return has nothing to do with guilt over his immoral actions but everything to do with control over Nevenka. It is made very clear during a beach love scene right before Kurt is murdered that the two do share a deep personal bond and a sexual secret. Right before his death Nevenka is reminded by her former lover You haven't changed... You always loved violence! before he alternates viciously whipping her with his passionate kisses. And she likes it so much you get the strong feeling that her 'straight' life with Christian was miserable for her. Kurt and Nevenka's love is a love of pain and mutual violence but also of understanding that their mutual love for the sadism is a hard thing to come by. Their love is forbidden but it is still distinctly uniquely theirs... even into the grave.As he proved in THE HORROR OF Dracula 1958 and other horror films Lee is a tall towering menacing figure even when given little to no dialog. He's killed off fairly early here and appears sporadically throughout the film as a silent 'ghost' but is all the more effective in his elusiveness. Dark beauty Daliah Lavi who was a former Miss Iran is excellent in the role and should have gone on to a career similar to that of Barbara Steele who in many ways she resembles. Both ladies are able to embody Gothic horror to a T. The entire supporting cast especially Medin is very good. And Bava's mastery of the medium like I said really make the film incomparably intoxicating. He offers up twisting doorknobs disembodied voices creaking floorboards secret passageways muddy footprints hands reaching out at you from the darkness horse rides along the beach and other Gothic trappings with his exquisite flair for the visual making this a painfully underrated gem of Euroshock cinema.Some notes  Bava used aliases all around  John M. Old for director and Dick Grey and David Hamilton for his cinematography.  A scene of Lavi moaning in ecstasy as she's being whipped by Lee was so controversial that it was excised from most prints when originally released  It was filmed on location in France  Cowriter Ernesto Gastaldi also wrote THE HORRIBLE DR. HICHCOCK THE SCORPION'S TAIL TORSO and many other notable Italian horror films from the 60s 70s and 80s. The DVD comes with a few trailers for Bava films including the French version of WHIP four bios photo and lobby card gallery soundtrack access and the original U.S. main titles under the name WHAT!.".

I was already hooked after watching 'Black Sunday' for the first time but after subsequently seeing 'Kill Baby...Kill!' 'Planet Of The Vampires' 'Black Sabbath' 'Diabolik' and 'Lisa And The Devil' and others I was convinced that he's THE most underrated director of the Fantastic. Now I've watched 'The Whip And The Body' three times and listened to Tim Lucas' informative DVD commentary I'm almost ready to bow down and worship Bava like a god! This is such a fascinating movie... Visually it's stunning as to be expected Bava being a top cinematographer before turning to directing. The subject matter is still provocative but forty years ago it must have been scandalous! In fact the movie was heavily censored and when eventually released in America given the lousy title 'What'. Christopher Lee counts this among his favourite roles and it is essential viewing for his fans. He plays Kurt Menliff an evil sadistic nobleman returning to his family home after hearing his younger brother has wed. Lee's family has disowned him after a scandal concerning a servant girl he seduced who subsequently suicided. His father the Count despises him the dead girl's mother who still works for the Count curses him and his brother's new bride Nevenka Daliah Lavi fears him. Kurt and Nevenka have a past not only that a complicated sadomasochistic relationship. The whipping scenes between the two actors were a bit too much for the censors to handle back in the day and while they aren't all that explicit they are still unsettling even today. Lee and the stunning Lavi best know to most people for her later appearance in the starstudded Bond spoof 'Casino Royale' make a truly unforgettable couple. Many people regard 'The Whip And The Body' as Bava's single best movie. I wouldn't go that far myself but it's definitely one of his very best films and is sure to impress anyone who has enjoyed his other pictures. Ghost story murder mystery psychosexual character study whatever you want to call it it's a highly original movie that will stay with you for a long time. Newcomers to Bava are still best to start with 'Black Sunday' in my opinion but this movie comes with my highest recommendation.".

His father the Count despises him the dead girl's mother who still works for the Count curses him and his brother's new bride Nevenka Daliah Lavi fears him. Kurt and Nevenka have a past not only that a complicated sadomasochistic relationship. The whipping scenes between the two actors were a bit too much for the censors to handle back in the day and while they aren't all that explicit they are still unsettling even today. Lee and the stunning Lavi best know to most people for her later appearance in the starstudded Bond spoof 'Casino Royale' make a truly unforgettable couple. Many people regard 'The Whip And The Body' as Bava's single best movie. I wouldn't go that far myself but it's definitely one of his very best films and is sure to impress anyone who has enjoyed his other pictures. Ghost story murder mystery psychosexual character study whatever you want to call it it's a highly original movie that will stay with you for a long time. Newcomers to Bava are still best to start with 'Black Sunday' in my opinion but this movie comes with my highest recommendation.";

	schema:headline " Christopher Lee raises hell in Bava's baroque horror romance!";
	schema:reviewBody "Mario Bava is often hailed as one of the true gods of horror cinema and for good reason. His influence extends his filmography and many Mario Bava films have gone on to have a big effect on the horror genre on the whole. Films such as Bay of Blood and Black Sunday are well known and have been seen by many serious film fanatics but when you delve deeper into the man's list of directorial credits his lesser known films tend to be just as good as his major hits. The Whip and the Body is one such film and after viewing it I rate it among the very top of the man's movies. This Gothic horror romance features many of Mario Bava's trademarks which are the things that have won him such high praise from a number of wellinformed sources. The story follows Nevenka a young woman who is married to Christian son of the lord of the castle in which the film takes place. However things aren't so simple as Christian's brother Kurt a sadistic nobleman is still in love with his brother's bride and has returned to the castle to reclaim his girl. Things really get interesting when he is found dead only for his ghost to reappear inside the castle walls.One of things that Mario Bava is often highly praised for is his use of lighting and this film features what is probably the best use of lighting ever seen in a Bava film. The lights give flair to the scenery and help to give the film that picturesque cinematography that the former cinematographer creates so well. Despite being excellent however it's not the lighting that is the main standout in this movie it's the soundtrack. Giving the film a tragic love story atmosphere the powerful theme bodes with the lighting to help create a tense and powerful atmosphere in which Bava allows his actors to inhabit. This film represents the only pairing of Bava with British horror icon Christopher Lee and as usual Lee lights up the screen with his persona and screen presence. The whipping scenes are what made this film notorious in the first place and seeing Lee enjoying delivering the lashing is haunting and even quite frightening! The romance element of the story is wonderfully done and it offsets the horror of the story well which ultimately brings the film into balance. I rate this Bava film as one of the best the great Italian ever made and it therefore comes with a soaring recommendation.".

The fun begins when the longdisgraced older son Christopher Lee arrives after a long absence. Exactly what he'd done isn't spelled out all that clearly but you know it resulted in the death of a servant and that he's been disinherited. Soon Lee is off having fun beating a member of the family and making love to her...and she likes it! Now you THINK Lee has returned to get some sort of revenge on his family so I was surprised he took out time for this kinky tryst. And surprise surprise before he can start his plans of revenge he's stabbed to death! But through the course of the film it seems as if he's returned from the dead and very bad things start to happen...along with some more kinky whippings.The payoff for this tale is pretty good and it's a good film with a nice print. But it's also a bit uncomfortable watching the kinky stuff so I certainly can't recommend it without some reservations.By the way the DVD for this Italian film is dubbed not subtitled.

Soon Kurt the whipcracking prodigal son is killed amidst a host of possible suspects. The girl starts seeing him return from the dead. Is he still alive? Is he a ghost? Or is there never any explanation? You will have to strain your eyes till the end to find out. Now don't get me wrong. this movie does have a lot to offer. Christopher Lee gives an excellent performance in a very unusual role as Kurt the whippersnapper. Bava always showcases a sumptuous buffet for the eyes with his camera lens. He uses color as well and probably much better than any director I can think of at the moment. Every scene for him is a work of art and tackled with that in mind. The Gothic sets period costumes and the musical score are all firstrate. All of the actors do decent jobs. Lee is very good. Lavi as she who must be whipped is beautiful and acceptable. Luciano Pigozzi the European Peter Lorrebased on looks not on talent is in tow as well. But the major and most prominent flaw in the film for me and one which really reduced my enjoyment of this film was the incredibly slow pace even for Bava. It seems like forever until something ever happens and when it does not much happens. The movie is weird in subject matter and purposely vague in much of the storyline. Much is cleared up at the end but its is a long way for a very small payoff.".

	schema:headline " Brilliant  Rarely Has The Uncanny Held Such Overwhelming Beauty!";
	schema:reviewBody "With Italy being my favorite Horrorproducing country and Gothic Tales and Gialli my favorite subgenres it is not surprising that I regard Italian Horrorpioneer Mario Bava sublime master of the first and inventor of the second category as one of the greatest geniuses in the history of Motion Pictures. Unlike any other Horror director Bava made most of his films so ingeniously that it is very hard to name favorites simply due to the fact that this great man's repertoire includes so many flawless masterpieces. Bava's doubtlessly most brilliant film is the 1960 masterpiece La Maschera Del Demonio aka. Black Sunday which is as far as I am concerned one of the greatest films ever made but the man created several other flawless films that no Horror lover or even cinemafan in general could afford to miss. Such as this overwhelming film for example. In 1963 the same year in which he invented the Giallosubgenre with his milestone La Ragazza Che Sappeva Troppo and furthermore created the arguably most memorable Horror omnibus ever with I Tre Volti Della Paura Bava also brought us this wonderful Gothic gem named La Frusta E Il Corpo aka. The Whip And The Body a film which perfectly illustrates what a brilliant director he was. The Whip And The Body is the absolute proof that unlike any other director Mario Bava had a unique talent of combining beauty and terror in a most mesmerizing manner. The need of a a high quality copy is something i seldom find essential and yet I would highly recommend to watch La Frusta E Il Corpo in the highest possible quality. Whenever using the pausebutton on the remote control one has the impression of looking at a beautifully haunting painting. This is no exaggeration but merely the only proper description of how visually overwhelming this dreamlike Gothic masterpiece is.Horroricon Christopher Lee as far as I am concerned one of the greatest actors ever gives a brilliant performance as one of his most haunting and sardonic characters here. The ravishing Daliah Lavi is as stunningly beautiful as the film itself and she also delivers a stunning performance in the female lead. The supporting performances are also great the cast includes Italian genreregulars as Tony Kendall and Ida Galli. I will not give a long plot description as everybody should be capable of drifting into the dreamlike Horrors of Castle Menliff on their own. I do want to say though that The Whip And The Body is a unique and fascinating mix of Gothic Horror and SM lovestory. The eerie castle is the perfect setting for this wonderful film which takes place in the early 19th century. The brilliant score is as mesmerizing and hauntingly beautiful as the film's visual style  The Whip And The Body simply is a film that overwhelms all senses a film possibly can. This was originally intended to resemble the story of Roger Corman's 1961 masterpiece The Pit And The Pendulum another favorite of mine but it turned out entirely different the brilliant Gothic eeriness castle setting and great acting being the only mutual elements.

	onyx:emotionText "With Italy being my favorite Horrorproducing country and Gothic Tales and Gialli my favorite subgenres it is not surprising that I regard Italian Horrorpioneer Mario Bava sublime master of the first and inventor of the second category as one of the greatest geniuses in the history of Motion Pictures. Unlike any other Horror director Bava made most of his films so ingeniously that it is very hard to name favorites simply due to the fact that this great man's repertoire includes so many flawless masterpieces. Bava's doubtlessly most brilliant film is the 1960 masterpiece La Maschera Del Demonio aka. Black Sunday which is as far as I am concerned one of the greatest films ever made but the man created several other flawless films that no Horror lover or even cinemafan in general could afford to miss. Such as this overwhelming film for example. In 1963 the same year in which he invented the Giallosubgenre with his milestone La Ragazza Che Sappeva Troppo and furthermore created the arguably most memorable Horror omnibus ever with I Tre Volti Della Paura Bava also brought us this wonderful Gothic gem named La Frusta E Il Corpo aka. The Whip And The Body a film which perfectly illustrates what a brilliant director he was. The Whip And The Body is the absolute proof that unlike any other director Mario Bava had a unique talent of combining beauty and terror in a most mesmerizing manner. The need of a a high quality copy is something i seldom find essential and yet I would highly recommend to watch La Frusta E Il Corpo in the highest possible quality. Whenever using the pausebutton on the remote control one has the impression of looking at a beautifully haunting painting. This is no exaggeration but merely the only proper description of how visually overwhelming this dreamlike Gothic masterpiece is.Horroricon Christopher Lee as far as I am concerned one of the greatest actors ever gives a brilliant performance as one of his most haunting and sardonic characters here. The ravishing Daliah Lavi is as stunningly beautiful as the film itself and she also delivers a stunning performance in the female lead. The supporting performances are also great the cast includes Italian genreregulars as Tony Kendall and Ida Galli. I will not give a long plot description as everybody should be capable of drifting into the dreamlike Horrors of Castle Menliff on their own. I do want to say though that The Whip And The Body is a unique and fascinating mix of Gothic Horror and SM lovestory. The eerie castle is the perfect setting for this wonderful film which takes place in the early 19th century. The brilliant score is as mesmerizing and hauntingly beautiful as the film's visual style  The Whip And The Body simply is a film that overwhelms all senses a film possibly can. This was originally intended to resemble the story of Roger Corman's 1961 masterpiece The Pit And The Pendulum another favorite of mine but it turned out entirely different the brilliant Gothic eeriness castle setting and great acting being the only mutual elements. Mario Bava created many masterpieces in his impressive career and all of them have something particularly essential about them. La Frusta E Il Corpo is a film that shows this man's unique talent for atmosphere and the combination of the beautiful and the uncanny. This is one of the most visually overwhelming Horror films ever made and easily deserves the highest rating of 1010!";

Most of his films are gorgeous to behold but they are vapid and have no story this film is just like all the rest.  There is no point to any of it there is no plot and hardly any suspense suffice it to say it might be interesting for a 12 year old horror goof but to an adult its quite tedious.  Chris Lee is rather banal also he doesn't do much and it seems that he dubbed his own voice in the studio most of the cast is rather dull also supposedly playing some ancient noble family they look more like 1960's mop heads and morons who were on too much acid.  The dialogue what there is is crude probably written by a drunk Italian because there are so many mistakes one example was when Lee was whipping the lady on the beach and she says I can't have more ice cream!  So I would suggest renting Planet of the Vampires because that is more enjoyable than this waste.  Interesting character to note was Lesmo dubbed as the European Peter Lorre who doesn't have much in the way of presence or acting skills and he looks like a cross between a frog and a midget.".

	schema:reviewBody "They say that the most timeless cinema is that of the heart and here Italian horror maestro Mario Bava a director famed for the elements of Gothic romance seen in his work has crafted one of the world's most strange and terrifying love stories.Yes for that is what this film so often called a horror film is at it's core A love story.But that does not mean for a second that the 'love' it conveys is not a terrifying one. In fact it may be the most disturbingly poignant of all of Bava's films as even today it recounts a lifestyle that puts to shame anything that can be accomplished in a giallo film in sending a chill down one's spine mostly because it happens every day in real life in some shape or form. Only the era is different.A film that describes something like that is truly timeless. But that doesn't mean it's touching like other love stories you see in heartbreak magazines no it's not touching but it definitely is heartbreaking.On an eerie twilightlit coast somewhere in Italy estranged aristocrat Kurt MenliffChristopher Lee returns to the family castle where several years earlier he drove the daughter of the family maid Tania to suicide with a dagger. The details are never explicitly explained on how Kurt's treatment drove her to suicide but they become chillingly clear quite soon. Of course it's not just the maid who bears a grudge against Kurt but his entire family his father has disowned him his brother Christian despises him and his former betrothed can't wait to dismiss him. However his father agrees to let him stay grudgingly.The Waltons they are not.However when away from prying eyes it turns out that family member NevenkaDahlia Lavi playing pretty much the same type of role you'd expect to see Barbara Steele inis still very much in love with Kurt so alone on the beach he expresses his gratitude the only way he can He savagely attacks her and starts beating her senseless with a whip!!!!! This would be disturbing enough except for the fact that and this becomes clear quicker than you'd think Nevenka LOVES it. And as Kurt says 'You've always loved violence' it becomes clear this is something Nevenka has had a fetish for for a long time and not just tolerance for an abusive man she thinks she can change this is how she gets off and Nevenka continues to fantasize about Kurt day and night.Even after he turns up dead with the same dagger Tania killed herself with jammed in his throat. Kurt's beatings were an addiction she can't live without what will she do now that he's dead? This is where the film's horror element comes into play What if Kurt isn't dead? And if he is who stabbed him? Everyone in the household is a suspect. And things begin to get even more complicated when more and more members of the household turn up dead. Is it Kurt? Tania's ghost? As Christian investigates the answers begin to grow more and more disturbing.'The Whip  The Body' is on the whole a rather grim affair with the truly sordid subject matter contrasted with the beautiful coastal setting and fairy tale castle. The fact that a truly beautiful romantic tunelater reused in several Bava filmsplays during Nevenka's fantasies makes for a morbid bit of humor. The film will also likely bore many viewers expecting a giallotype of filmas I've seen this referred to as a giallo or protoslasher in some circles since it involves a hidden killer using a knife with it's long passages of silence and talkinessnot to mention that Christian is the blandest hero in a Bava film I've ever seen. Still typical topnotch direction from Bava the usual gorgeous cinematography and use of color along with a moving performance by Lavi and a brief but unforgettable turn by Lee as Kurtdubbed in some scenes and not in others make this more than worth your time.But what gives the film it's lasting power is the disturbing fact that there are men like Kurt and many women in positions like Nevenkawillingly or unwillinglyin real life who suffer and inflict suffering daily many of whom cannot even get out of the web of abuse they are in if they have the chance and some of whom cling to it. And knowing this goes on is more horrifying than anything in any of Bava's more straightforward horror films.Truly ahead of it's time and certainly not for everyone 'Whip' is a great exploration of many of Bava's recurring themes like the destruction of a family deceptive appearancesChristopher Lee has never been more handsome obsession and ultimately what Bava called his greatest fear That of someone alone in a room confronting the darkest aspects of themselves. It may not scare you it may not even grab your attention but this film is one of the most haunting pieces of celluloid you will ever see. It's a strange mix of 'Psycho' 'Wuthering Heights' and the relationship between Kurt  Nevenka feels like a prequel to 'The Innocents'. All in all it's worth seeing.Enjoy if you can.".

There are few films that convey desire sodeeply soyearningly but also depict repulsion justaswell and aren't the two inextricablyentwined in horror? It is perhaps the best Gothichorror film of the 1960s barnone and that includes some of Hammer's finest. Infact you can see that in Bava's Hammer's and Roger Corman's 'Gothic' films there is a dialog goingon. They copiedeach other but few would be sodaring as Bava as this is the best SM horrorfilm and the sexiest too. Dahlia Lavi couldn't be more desirable in this and the SM depictions are pretty racy even the standards of 2006. For this reason it was radicallycut in most regionsofdistribution exceptGermany!. 'Black SundayMask of Satan' 1960 may have been the 'Citizen Kane' of horror but this is Bava's 'Tales of Hoffmann' 1951 and all these films should be seen by serious horrorfans. Corman AIP and Hammer had blood brains bulgingboobs and cleavage but not this! It is probably the mostunderrated film I have ever seen. A film like The Whip and the Body has to be watchedrepeatedly to trulyappreciate and it givesup secrets with eachviewing. What has always been a shoddy dubbingjob has marred this film's reputation and relegated it tothemargins of the horrorgenre. The Whip and the Body is the essence of what truly makesup horror especially Gothichorror and it is psychosexualtension. If you cannot appreciate such literaryconcerns or the eternalissues involving the humancondition you aren't going to enjoy it because it is a pretty literaryfilm. It is poetic and stronglyerotic. It is also decidedlynot 'PC' but who cares anymore about that? Art never is nor should it be 'acceptable.' It simply is.Outsideof Hitchcock psychologicalhorror doesn't get muchbetter than this masterpiece. It is a ghoststory and somuchmore. It is a study of sexualobsession and the demons that haunt all relationships. Who has not been haunted by a lover from one's past? If you haven't you are missingsomething important in the humancondition so go out and find it. The archetype of the 'demonlover' is in fullbloom in this masterpiece and it is titillating and emotionallypowerful for it. It should also be said the film has a fewsimilarities to Ricardo Freda's classic 'The Ghost' 1963 which is likely due to the era it was madein and the fact that Bava was frequently Freda's assistantdirector. Guilt playsitspart in the films of both directors usually manifesting as an apparition. Catholicguilt? This is likely but neither Bava or Freda can be typed soeasily they were nonconformists in their stylizations with Bava even showing a connection with Slavicliterature in the works of Gogol and Tolstoy. He borrowed from a lot of literarysources including Lovecraft making it into something that was his own. The director was also known for his belief in Italian folksuperstitions and he drew from Italy's folklore and Roman mythology as well.As far as I can tell much of the 'colorcoding' in this film for givencharacters was relativelynew when Bava attemptedit. Powell  Pressberg's 'Tales of Hoffman' is the closest I can recall with this style conveying horror so effectively. Lee'scharacter Kurt Menliff is portrayed in the cobalthues of blue ever to grace a Technicolorfilm suggesting the character spectralnature. Other times Lee is lit with a greenlight on his face like Osiris. I'd say some aspects of the film resemble the myth of the resurrection of Osiris by Isis through sexuality. Lee is the dyinggod Nevenka his Astarte or Isis. Scenes of passion with Dahlia Lavi are decidedly redinhue while when the apparition of 'Kurt' gives us scenes that are green or blue. One scene has Lavi walkingdown a hallway while each side of her face keeps changingcolors as her emotions change. The whole approach is a kind of expressionism of color the hues conveying the internalstates of the characters. The Technicolorprocess made colors so deep! This is filmasartifice and we should never forget this while viewing the works of a director like Bava he reveled in this artificiality. This helped him emphasize the thematic visually rather than through dialog and a linearnarrative. Yes it's supposedto look 'fake' it's a filmreality like in a Tarantinofilm. This movie has sufferedenough! The storyline isn't very difficult to follow it's just the poordubbing by the Italian productioncompany. When a film is this lowbudget for 1963 it's usually postproduction that suffers and it does here. The owners of this property should record Mr. Lee's dialog for this film he has offered afterall so whynot? It's insane to think the producers of a film with Christopher Lee would not seefit to use his actualvoice because he is an actor who was known for it and still is.".

	schema:headline " The Images tell no Story. Bava's first unengaging movie";
	schema:reviewBody "About two years ago I got into the movies of Mario Bava. I had first seen Beyond the Door 2 and really liked the filming in it. The fact that the story ended up having resonance was impressive as well. I later found out that Mario Bava was one of the best Cinematographers to have come from Italy. Being a training Cinematographer and loving visual movies I decided to check out the rest of his films not easy in Australia. I saw Hatchet for the Honeymoon Baron Blood Blood and Black Lace On SBS Five Dolls for an August Moon I liked it!! and Lisa and the Devil.They were all terrific especially Lisa and The Devil and Hatchet For the Honeymoon. So when I came upon the widescreen uncut version of The Whip and The Body I thought I was in luck. Supposedly his best film.Well its not. Finally in The Whip and The Body Bava does what he always threatened to do. Make a film of images and nothing else. The music seems disconnected from the rest of the movie. The lighting doesnt motivate the movie as it did in his other films It just made for great colour and shadow design. The camerawork was exceptional and none of the character or situations were engaging. In all the other films I've seen of his the music always seemed to be against the grain of the movies premise to being with but after a few minutes seemed integral to every point of the film. The images carried the film in a surreal way and the story always ended up coming together. Not in Whip and the Body.The good things to say are that the Cinematography is fantastic and the camerawork and compositions are great. But none of this seems to be at the service of the story it seems to be battling the story for thematic importance and audience attention. Christopher Lee where's the voice looks AMAZING. His screen Presense in this movie is so magnetic that he is the only hope for you getting into it in any way.The Bad things are the rest of the other actors are totally without conviction. The aforementioned clash of the visuals with the story and performances direction is to blame for this somewhere. The music is so irrelevant to what is going on that it becomes a completely shallow device you can see what Bava was trying to do with this but he just didnt pull it off this time and it is a thin line between success and failure. The themes are not pulled off or delved into. Everything about the movie is so on the surface that its no wonder that everyone marvels about the cinematography.I think the only way people could enjoy this is if they invested their interests in its ideas. Reguardless of how well these ideas were pulled off. Finally this is the first Mario Bava film I have seen without any of his tragic romantic feeling. In this you never buy the romance as being anything other than a plot device. This is the first film of his I've seen that feels like it was directed by a cinematographer and not a director.I wish I had liked this as much as all his other fans seemed to. But its just not as good as its billed. Its no wonder that Bava hid under another name. I think that it wasnt until later in his career as a director that he really got hold of how to direct a film. Rather then just visually presenting it as he does here.310 for meNot Impressed.".

I saw Hatchet for the Honeymoon Baron Blood Blood and Black Lace On SBS Five Dolls for an August Moon I liked it!! and Lisa and the Devil.They were all terrific especially Lisa and The Devil and Hatchet For the Honeymoon. So when I came upon the widescreen uncut version of The Whip and The Body I thought I was in luck. Supposedly his best film.Well its not. Finally in The Whip and The Body Bava does what he always threatened to do. Make a film of images and nothing else. The music seems disconnected from the rest of the movie. The lighting doesnt motivate the movie as it did in his other films It just made for great colour and shadow design. The camerawork was exceptional and none of the character or situations were engaging. In all the other films I've seen of his the music always seemed to be against the grain of the movies premise to being with but after a few minutes seemed integral to every point of the film. The images carried the film in a surreal way and the story always ended up coming together. Not in Whip and the Body.The good things to say are that the Cinematography is fantastic and the camerawork and compositions are great. But none of this seems to be at the service of the story it seems to be battling the story for thematic importance and audience attention. Christopher Lee where's the voice looks AMAZING. His screen Presense in this movie is so magnetic that he is the only hope for you getting into it in any way.The Bad things are the rest of the other actors are totally without conviction. The aforementioned clash of the visuals with the story and performances direction is to blame for this somewhere. The music is so irrelevant to what is going on that it becomes a completely shallow device you can see what Bava was trying to do with this but he just didnt pull it off this time and it is a thin line between success and failure. The themes are not pulled off or delved into. Everything about the movie is so on the surface that its no wonder that everyone marvels about the cinematography.I think the only way people could enjoy this is if they invested their interests in its ideas. Reguardless of how well these ideas were pulled off. Finally this is the first Mario Bava film I have seen without any of his tragic romantic feeling. In this you never buy the romance as being anything other than a plot device. This is the first film of his I've seen that feels like it was directed by a cinematographer and not a director.I wish I had liked this as much as all his other fans seemed to. But its just not as good as its billed. Its no wonder that Bava hid under another name. I think that it wasnt until later in his career as a director that he really got hold of how to direct a film. Rather then just visually presenting it as he does here.310 for meNot Impressed.";

	schema:reviewBody "La Frusta E il CorpoThe Whip and the Body1963 proved the capabilities of Mario Bava to do a film that was both technically brilliant and emotionally three dimensional.  Since Bava was an admirer of the literary work of Dostoevsky then it wouldn't be surprising that Dostoevsky was an influential shoulder on The Whip and the Body1963.  Some areas of the film are inspired by CRIME  PUNISHMENT.  Literary influences also extends to Marquis De Sade and Edgar Allen Poe.  Mario Bava followed this masterpiece with another in Sei Donne Per L'AssassinoBlood  Black Lace1964.The performances turned in by Christopher Lee and Daliah Lavi are some of the finest in a Mario Bava film.  Christopher Lee plays his most evil and sadistic character up to dateI have not seen The Bloody Judge.  For the short duration Chris Lee appears on screen The Whip  the Body1963 becomes enriched by his presence.  Daliah Lavi adds a sympathetic and tragic performance in her role as Nevenka.  Daliah Lavi as Nevenka is both physically ravishing and psychologically complex.La Frusta E il CorpoThe Whip and the Body1963 is an excellent gothic period piece that was ahead of its time due to the strong imagery of erotic violence.  Its perverse eroticism is an element constantly found in any of Ernesto Gastaldi's written work for Italian crime or horror pictures.  Due to the psychological nature of sadomasochism in the film The Whip and the Body1963 was heavily censored around the world.  The whipping scenes still shock nerves in today's era of desenitized audiences.  Provided a big influence for the sadomasochism of Clive Barker's Hellraiser1986 and perhaps the films of David Cronenberg.Encounter at the beach between Kurt and Nevenka is a telling sign of their sadomasochistic relationship.  The beach used in here was a Bava trademark that appears in many of his films.  The beach used must have represented for Mario Bava a place where the beauty and ugliness of human nature can be expressed by its scenery.  Kurt's whipping of Nevenka at the beach is fueled by the inability of each to feel love because of psychological importancefrigidness.  An eroticly charged set piece that caused an uproar during its time.Red roses are an important plot object for the story.  Red roses symbolizes death feelings of inner conflict memory and repressed erotic emotions. The use of red roses on a visual level is eye popping.  The representation of red roses to suggest repressed erotic emotions can be seen when Nevenka caresses her face with a red rose.  In La Frusta E il Corpo1963 red roses take on multiple interpretations.Excellent motion picture that is also one of the famed Italian horror director's best films.  Mario Bava's ten best films are Blood  Black Lace1964 Rabid Dogs1974 The Whip  the Body1963 Lisa  the Devil1972 Kill Baby Kill1967 Bay of Blood1971 Mask of Satan1960 Black Sabbath1963 Hatchet for the Honeymoon1969 and Planet of the Vampires1965.  The best parts of the film are the use of color to suggest psychological atmosphere.  Released on DVD around a year ago with an excellent print and numerous extras.  Again the story revolves around a declining rich family ruined by decadence.Kurt's death from behind the curtains in his room is a fantastic set piece that is Christopher Lee's most stylish death scene.  The story of The Whip  the Body1963 would be modernized in a later Mario Bava film Shock1977. Mario Bava's direction boldes the film well with technical efficencey and colorful imagery.  Theme of guilt forms an elemential root for the psychological emotions of Nevenka following the death of Kurt.  A few of the film's erotic ideas would appear in another Ernesto Gastadi scripted gothic period piece called The Horrible Dr. Hitchcock1964.One theme that regularly occurs in many of Bava's films is the notion of the double that is present in movies like The Mask of Satan1960 Hatchet for the Honeymoon1969 and Lisa and the Devil1972.  Nevenka and Kurt fit the double motif with similar tastes for sexual violence.  Nevenka creates her double in the ghost of Kurt with her feelings of guilt and emotional insercurities.  The motif of the double in The Whip and the Body1963 is identical to the plot device of Fyodor Dostoevsky's early short story THE DOUBLE.  The double motif of this motion picture also finds its inspiration from Edgar Allen Poe stories such as THE BLACK CAT  WILLIAM WILSON.La Frusta E il Corpo1963 is one of a handful of films by Mario Bava that were his most personal.  The line by Christopher Lee Its wonderful to see things being born to see them born and to see them die is an interesting one.  The line mentioned above signified Mario Bava's views on the subjects of death and mortality.  Its the film that best describes Bava's personal feelings on life love and death.  La Frusta E il Corpo1963 and Lisa E il Diavolo1972 are good Bava film companions because they share in common many ideas and thematic qualities.Emphasis is on psychological horror because of the atmosphere and mood created by Bava the cinema photographer.  Dark romantic horror film that shows eroticism in a more emotional light not found in many American horror movies.  Hauntingly beautiful film score by Carlo Rustichelli.  Only towards the end does Nevenka open up and reveal her unrepressed love for the late Kurt.  Slow moving horror picture that is best recommanded to anyone with an aquired taste film viewing patience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mario Bava once again creates a poetic moving film a Gothic chiller with plenty of atmosphere the use of shadows here to evoke fear figures predominantly even more than in Bava's other work and with a romantic tragic love story at its centre. THE WHIP AND THE FLESH highlights Bava at his most sensual as he focuses the film on a masochistic relationship something which was not taken lightly when the film was first released.The film is deliberately ambiguous and offers us no explanations. It's never made clear whether Kurt has indeed come back as a ghost or whether he is just a figment of a disturbed imagination but in any case the fact is that love is far stronger than death. The film has the usual Bava trappings a remote castle full of empty rooms full of shadows characters who are not heroic but indeed flawed a heavy feeling of nostalgia and of course supernatural occurrences and a character who may or may not be dead.Good performances are given by all of the cast members especially Lavi as the tormented Nevenka who hates herself for enjoying the whippings that Kurt gives her. Pigozzi registers as a limping manservant while Gustavo De Nardo paints a sorrowful picture of an old man with only his memories left to keep him company. Christopher Lee's performance makes a strong impression on the film indeed he is the key figure in the proceedings. Lee has said that this was one of his favourite films and he gives one of his best performances here despite the fact that he was dubbed by an American actor. Lee's Kurt is a noble man distinguished in appearance and very dignified yet at the same time he's totally depraved delighting in the pain of others. It's this dual role which makes Lee all the more interesting. The doomed romance between Kurt and Nevenka is touching despite the masochistic basis for the relationship you get the feeling that the pair really are deeply in love with each other.Of course Bava couldn't make a film without it being controversial and the sadistic scenes of whipping are a typical trademark of his powerful yet important it's not just violence for violence's sake. There are plenty of shocks faces appearing in windows and ghostly green hands reaching out of the dark as well as creepy scenes such as the muddy footprints of a ghost appearing on a wooden floor. The film reaches an eventual climax of Gothic melodrama and Bava does a good job of weaving the two plot strands of a murder mystery and a supernatural shocker into one satisfying concoction. THE WHIP AND THE FLESH is a woefully underrated film and remains powerful moving and perhaps one of the most striking horror films ever made one of the few to actually reach out and touch your heart and not with revulsion instead with mixed feelings of love and hatred in fact you're torn between the genuine love between Kurt and Nevenka and the hatred of the sadistic activities that Kurt enjoys. Added to this one of the most romantic and moving scores ever composed and you have one cracker of a film.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's pretty clear that director Mario Bava took a leaf from Roger Corman's Edgar Allan Poe films for Corman's Gothic look is faithfully replicated in a shimmering and lushly coloured period piece. There are some similarities of plot too  particularly from Pit And The Pendulum. It's mostly left up to the viewer to decide if the return from the grave of Christopher Lee's Byronic villain is just in Nevenka's imagination or real. The end could be read as her lapsing into madness  or is she really possessed? Daliah Lavi plays Nevenka whipped and seduced by Lee's Kurt and possibly then haunted by him after he has been stabbed. Lavi is superb  just as she was in The Demon an Italian preExorcist movie about an exorcism which actually has a Spider Walk. Lavi is astonishing in that movie and she's just as good here. Lee's greenish and ghostly appearance at a window appears to have been modelled on Peter Wygarde's in The Innocents but this stately Gothic hangs together extremely well. Bava directs with a moody and atmospheric hand and the film is beautifully lit.I avoided seeing this for a while as I assumed it was an over the top SM flick. Glad to discover I was wrong! Yep there are a couple of flagellation scenes but these too are somewhat poetically handled. I watched the English dubbed version so I don't know if the original Italian film is more graphic.I enjoyed this movie it's slightly heavy going in places but like Corman's early Poe films it's all in the aid of mood. Stylish and memorable.".

The end could be read as her lapsing into madness  or is she really possessed? Daliah Lavi plays Nevenka whipped and seduced by Lee's Kurt and possibly then haunted by him after he has been stabbed. Lavi is superb  just as she was in The Demon an Italian preExorcist movie about an exorcism which actually has a Spider Walk. Lavi is astonishing in that movie and she's just as good here. Lee's greenish and ghostly appearance at a window appears to have been modelled on Peter Wygarde's in The Innocents but this stately Gothic hangs together extremely well. Bava directs with a moody and atmospheric hand and the film is beautifully lit.I avoided seeing this for a while as I assumed it was an over the top SM flick. Glad to discover I was wrong! Yep there are a couple of flagellation scenes but these too are somewhat poetically handled. I watched the English dubbed version so I don't know if the original Italian film is more graphic.I enjoyed this movie it's slightly heavy going in places but like Corman's early Poe films it's all in the aid of mood. Stylish and memorable.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Whip and the Body was a controversial film in its day. This was because of its scenes showing Christopher Lee sadistically whipping Daliah Lavi. These may not seem like so much today but back in the early 60's this was pretty edgy stuff to say the least. Nowadays this film is celebrated mainly for other reasons chief amongst them being that it is yet another stylish movie from the legendary Italian genre film director Mario Bava. It starts with a sadistic nobleman returning to his family home after years of banishment. He immediately starts pursuing his brother's wife in a lecherous fashion and before long they embark on a secretive sadomasochistic affair. The trouble is he is soon murdered by a mystery assassin and to make matters even more complicated he subsequently seems to return from the dead as an evil spirit.Like the other Gothic horror films directed by Bava this one's strength isn't so much in its story as in its presentation. This director is remembered as a cinematic stylist and this is another of his films that illustrates why. It's visually beautiful with excellent compositions and cinematography allied to Bava's typically great use of coloured lighting. Of particular note are the scenes involving Lee's character returning from the grave in the dead of night. These are typified by kaleidoscopic colours and the emphasis on unusual details such as spiderlike hands. Adding to the atmosphere is a lush score from Carlo Rustichelli which was also partially reused in Bava's later cinematic milestone Blood and Black Lace 1964. It all adds up to a film so rich in style an atmosphere that it makes up for deficits such as its slow pace. It's basically yet another film that illustrates how brilliant and important a director Mario Bava was.".

I was reminded of that by the Air Force overcoat with Tech. Sgt. stripes wore by the boyfrienddealer we airmen had quite a laugh the first time that appeared on the screen because that is a 'lifer' rank. Over the years I have carried several other images from the film. Foremost was the absolutely beautiful and vulnerable daughter of the executive. As someone else commented you could not take you eyes off her. I did not realize until now that this was a 20year old Susan Sarandon in her first movie. What a loss that she did not do more movies when she looked like that. I also recall the irony of having a counterculture hero like Peter Boyle playing the title role of a rightwing gun nut. Not unlike George C. Scott playing generals in Dr. Strangelove and Patton. And of course the shocking ending made a lasting impression.30 years ago it was the most talked about movie that ever played on the base. We thought it was a great film then and I have been reluctant to see it again because I was afraid that it would be as disappointingly dated as Easy Rider. But watching it today I was amazed at how well the film has held up. It is a very strong script with few holes although you have to wonder about the boyfriend immediately getting out of the bathtub when Sarandon gets in with him.Searching for an explanation of why this film is still so entertaining I have to think it has something to do with the perfect physical casting. Boyle was physically believable as Joe as others have pointed out his portrayal would inspire the Archie Bunker character a few 'years later. Did Ted Knight model his 'Caddyshack' characterJudge Smails after the Dennis Patrick's advertising executive in 'Joe'? They look alike and sound alike. Patrick was totally believable as the wrappedtootight upper middle class executive. And Sarandon's doeeyed innocent with the Raggety Ann doll still evokes a protective response from all male viewersperfect casting. The nude and drug scenes actually hold up they were very provocative for their day and are as explicit as anything to be found in 'Thirteen'. About the only thing that dates this film is that the violence is not realistic or graphic. 'Joe' was about the same time as 'The Wild Bunch' and the tone of movie violence had a just begun to change. Another reason this film holds up is that events in the past couple of years have brought back the relevancy of the theme and context of this film. In the film both types of 'conservatives' are portrayed as full of fear and hate toward the unconventional ways of the counterculture and filled with envy at their free and hedonistic lifestyle. The counterculture is portrayed as mocking the straight culture and although paranoid toward conservatives legitimately so given that this was just a couple months after Kent State they cannot resist flaunting their lifestyle in an attempt to antagonize. The political landscape is not all that different 30 years later. I'm not sure conservatives envy young people and liberals as much as 1970 but they fear and hate them more.An excellent film that surprisingly is as relevant now as it was in the early 1970's.".

Panicstricken he retreats to a bar and meets Joe Curran played by Peter Boyle a loudmouth angry bigot who is bitter over how his beloved country has become. Unintentionally Bill allows Joe to find out that he just killed a hippie. And this is only the beginning. Joe is a classic film of an unlikely friendship. A bond between two men one of a whitecollar background the other of a bluecollar background. Bill  Joe have one thing in common they are disgraced over how crazy the world has become. Dennis Patrick  Peter Boyle have both given very realistic portrayals of their characters. Director John G. Avidsen with this preRocky effort directs this lowbudget gem with the same finesse as a movie with a 100 million budget. The script is loaded with excellent character development and very snappy realistic dialog. In spite of its strengths this film does have its weaknesses. The script falls asleep roughly 34 of the way through but it wakes up just in time for the jarring climax. This film also features a very early and uninspiring performance by a 24year old Susan Sarandon as Bill's daughter Melissa along with her hippie boyfriend Frank portrayed very blandly by Patrick Mc Dermott. One could only be thankful that he was killed off early in the film. In spite of its few flaws this is one of those forgotten films of the 70's that should not be. Even though Joe is very dated to today's standards the chemistry between Dennis Patrick  Peter Boyle is completely relevant today and it is the glue that holds the whole film together.".

The script is loaded with excellent character development and very snappy realistic dialog. In spite of its strengths this film does have its weaknesses. The script falls asleep roughly 34 of the way through but it wakes up just in time for the jarring climax. This film also features a very early and uninspiring performance by a 24year old Susan Sarandon as Bill's daughter Melissa along with her hippie boyfriend Frank portrayed very blandly by Patrick Mc Dermott. One could only be thankful that he was killed off early in the film. In spite of its few flaws this is one of those forgotten films of the 70's that should not be. Even though Joe is very dated to today's standards the chemistry between Dennis Patrick  Peter Boyle is completely relevant today and it is the glue that holds the whole film together.";

I actually sympathized with some of his complaints. Of course he doesn't mention the underlying historical socioeconomic reasons for many of his prejudices. The film also provides interesting insight into the rapid change American society was undergoing at this time. Recreational drugs casual sex and the challenging of parental authority became in vogue and replaced the more time honored traditions of respect for God country and seniority.  Susan Sarandon fans will be delighted. Joe is her film debut. She also provides viewers with a visual treat near the beginning of the film. Recommended 810.".

Life magazine even had a write up on this film released the year after Easy Rider Joe sort of takes a look at American society from the other end of the spectrum that of a conservative blue collar bigot. In real life Peter Boyle is a very kind gentle man he said he had a hard time changing his voice into Joe's aggressive snarl. For example Joe talks of how good it felt to kill Japs in WWII. In real life Peter Boyle's military service was shortened by a nervous breakdown. Nevertheless Boyle is chilling in his monologues where he talks of niggers and queer liberals. All In The Family came on a year after Joe was made and Joe is really a nightmarish version of Archie Bunker. All In The Family made us laugh at our fears and prejudices Joe hits us with them like a punch in the face and makes us sick. This was one of Susan Sarandon's first films and she is good as the wealthy businessmen's daughter whose father is forced to kill her at the end. The bloodbath in the end of this film is horrific and expertly done. It reminds you of the violence in The Wild Bunch. This is the film that made Peter Boyle a star and hardhat a household world. This movie is never shown on tv and is very hard to find on video but it is well worth your time to see it. Maybe that reason that Joe was so popular is that there is a little bit of him in all of us. He represents our fears and hates and inner demons. Maybe were looking at ourselves and that makes it even more chilling.".

Joe figures out that Bill is a killer but even armed with this knowledge he doesn't exactly blackmail Bill.

Bill isn't as angry a man as Joe but he does find him to be an interesting individual.The way that a few separate worlds and worldviews collide makes for good entertainment in this effort from screenwriter Norman Wexler and director John G.

The other actors such as Audrey Caire as Bills' wife and K.

Bill turns to Joe for help. Their search leads them through the seediest parts of town where both men's inner hatred and loath is furthered tested.Critique This was director John G. Avildsen's first sleeperturned smash hit an amazing run which included 'Rocky' 'The Karate Kid' 'SplitImage' 'Weekend at Bernie's'.

In the bar is Joe a man who hates blacks and hippies and who is giving full vent to his spleen. In one sense Joe's rant is dated couched in terms of the events of the late 1960s. But in another sense his diatribe is a timeless expression of bigotry one that it is just as fresh in the twentyfirst century as it was back then.Bill confesses to Joe that he just killed one of those hippies because it eases his conscience to admit his crime to someone who understands though he quickly says he was just kidding. Later when Joe realizes that Bill actually did kill a hippie something he has always wanted to do but probably never would have he calls Bill up and says he wants to get together. The two of them form a deadly combination resulting in a massacre of hippies. Inadvertently Bill kills Melissa his own daughter.The first time I saw the movie was in 1970. As the years passed my memory was that Bill and Joe killed a bunch of harmless peaceloving hippies. But having seen the movie recently I realize that the hippies are not portrayed sympathetically. Early in the movie when Melissa enters the room she shares with her boyfriend he is taking a bath. She gets in the tub with him and he immediately gets out. It is not clear whether he is merely indifferent to her romantic gesture or whether he despises her but either way he treats her like dirt.Speaking of dirt that reminds me of their feet. Notwithstanding the bath their feet are filthy. Back in those days having dirty feet was de rigueur for hippies because being unclean was a way of displaying contempt for the rules of society. And just to make sure we know they have the required dirt and grime when they get in bed together the camera films them from the end of the bed so that we get full view of the bottoms of four filthy feet.Later when Bill and Joe participate in an orgy of sorts we get the spectacle of Joe's naked beer gut coming down on top of some hippie chick as he prepares to have sex with her after remarking that he doesn't need any foreplay. While this allows us to see how crude Joe is as if we were not already convinced it also tells us something about the hippie chick on whom he descends for a girl would have to be pretty much of a lowlife to take part in such a degrading act.Furthermore the hippies are thieves for they rob Bill and Joe of their wallets which angers them so much that they track the hippies down at which point things get out of hand and the massacre ensues. In other words the hippies are unlikable dirty and immoral. And while it would be going too far to say that they got what they deserved their behavior does seem to vindicate much of what Joe was saying about them in the bar.".

When he is betrayed through thievery read trust of the older generation to the newer generation he lashes out through an unrelenting chain of murder. Perhaps it is due to the Tarantinos of Hollywood that the watcher expects bloodstreaming death in the end scene but the bloodless shootings long for any sort of impact or realism.

	schema:reviewBody "An odd thing about the movie is that no one comes off very sympathetically. That goes for life styles as well whether working class upper class or hedonistic hippie. Everyone's compartmentalized and disdainful of nonpeers. Of course the movie's crux lies in working class Joe's Boyle alliance with whitecollar Bill Patrick over their mutual hatred of hippies. And that's following Bill's pivotal murder of his daughter's drug dealer boyfriend.The movie was much talked about at the time. After all the hippie movement was widely seen and heard on America's airways but not so working class America's reaction. For guys like Joe it seemed everybody was making social progress except for working class white males. Plus potsmoking kids were doing things that beer swilling bluecollar guys could only dream aboutfree time free sex few responsibilities. Worse these kids were insulting the nation's traditions the very ones that afforded them the luxuries they enjoy. The movie may exaggerate some but the nub of Joe's hatred of those he thinks are ruining the country is on the mark. Then too I suspect a similar sentiment lives on in today's Tea Party though not as pronounced. The movie also suggests the potential of a broader cross class reaction. Significantly Joe's working class anger eventually spreads to whitecollar Bill as together they make war on what they see as a youthful parasitic class. To me the movie's really about the emerging crisis of the Vietnam era concerning not only who will shape the nation's present but its future as well. Now after 50years the hippie movement may have vanished but the animus against minorities and others regarded as not fully American remains a potent force. The movie may have aged but this aspect hasn't. In passing note in the movie how the feminist movement has yet to have impact. Thus uppity women are not included in Joe's long list of cultural evildoers. Still it's entertaining to wonder how Joe and especially his dutiful wife would react to housewives desiring more options.The movie itself has a number of memorable scenes. I especially like it when our two crusaders guzzle booze while denouncing potsmoking kids. Then too Joe's barroom tirade came at a time when audiences were not used to such uncensored explicitness as gutter obscenities and hateful ethnic slurs. Thus Boyle's fiercely delivered rant was spellbinding at the time and I suspect still is. But most of all is that subtle sequence of Joe and Mary Lou Callan sharing an awkward evening with their social betters Bill and Joan Caire. What a masterpiece of staging scripting and performance. It's almost wrenching to watch the two wives try to deal with the class barriers separating them once they've been thrown unceremoniously together. Caire is especially meaningful as she betrays hardly a hint of what she's really thinking while the eager Mary Lou does her best to please. Yet every time the housewifely hostess does something agreeable Joe steps on it with an uncaring remark. Comparisons with TV's Edith Bunker and All in the Family 19711979 do hit the mark.It's easy to deride Joe's unabashed vulgarity. Still he's always straightforward about what he thinks. No guesswork there unlike the whitecollar guy who plays up to him once he thinks Joe's going to be his new boss. Plus Joe works hard at a demanding foundry job. In short he's that average joe who does the sometimes dirty work that keeps the nation running. In that key regard he deserves respect maybe not for everything he thinks but surely for what he does. And maybe if hard working guys like him got more respect for what they do they wouldn't be so ready to take frustrations out on others. To me that's one of the most important issues raised in a movie that's as relevant today as 50years ago when I first saw it.".

This ain't really a spoiler but the key to the film is the big corporate never does wrong guy making friends with this semitroglodyte Joe and he gets some kind of...validation from his bigotry and stupidity and sense of being wronged. Yet few would argue that the dealer boyfriend did deserve to die. And those kids shouldn't have ripped Joe and Compton off. And Joe and Compton were actually getting into the hash and the young skin until they got ripped off. A simple film in many ways except that in 1970 New York City was par to a battle zone thanks to Nixon's care and all of the money going to the war in Vietnam. As I write this 2252007 there is a very long wait on Netflix for this film  which makes me happy because I think there are people out there who want to learn. This was a pretty good snapshot  not exact a bit caricaturist  but actually pretty close to how it was back then. And the scary thing is  things haven't changed that much. Sure there's no more welfare but that just means the wageslavery has won out. Amazing how millionaires will complain about not making enough money then complain that 5.15 an hour is too much to pay their people.".

What can I say? Well the best performance is that of the late Peter Boyle as the title character who after finding out about a man's killing the drugdealing boyfriend of his daughter wants to bond with him even though he's a Madison Avenue executive who has nothing in common with the very lowerclass conservative Joe. In fact there are plenty of funny scenes of Joe at this guy's party making smart alecky remarks there. Oh and it should be noted that the actress that plays the daughter who they're looking for after she disappeared from the hospital after overdosing on some drugs is none other than Susan Sarandon making her film debut! This was a pretty hardhitting movie for the time it was made late '60searly '70s and was compelling work from scripter Norman Wexler later of Saturday Night Fever and director John G. Avildsen later to do Save the Tiger Rocky and The Karate Kid. Certainly the ending packs a wallop even today after all these years! Highly recommended for anyone curious about the counterculture of that time. P.S. Among the cultural artifacts seen here are a Raggedy Ann doll a box of Ritz crackers a bottle of Heinz ketchup and unique for the era a Nixon poster asking Would you buy a used car from this man?".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie reminds me a bit of the best picture film Cavalcade that was made a year before The World Moves On. Both stories are set over a very long time period and involve a wealthy family during good times and badthe bad being WWI. However there are also a lot of differencesenough that it's well worth seeing both films.The film begins in the early 19th century. At the death of a socalled 'Cotton King' his will is read and it gives amazingly detailed instructions about his estate. To satisfy the conditions of the will the family must make a business merger and then send its family members to set up a business empire in the major industrialized nations at the timeFrance Prussia later to make up a large part of Germany Britain and of course the United States. Through the decades the family ties remain strongeven after there are distinct lines of the new family that speak different languages. The idea is that despite national interests the family and the company come first. However this is all complicated 90 years later when WWI arrives. And surprisingly the film continues from the end of WWI to the Depression and its impact on the family.The film has excellent production values and clearly was a project that Fox Studio heaped a lot of money onwith lots of fancy sets an up and coming director John Ford and a pretty good cast headed by Franchot Tone and Madeleine Carroll. For the most part the writing was also firstrate and the film quite enjoyable. There were only a couple things I really disliked about the film. First subsequent generations of family members are played by the same actors in several casesas if descendants look EXACTLY like their parents grandparents or greatgrandparents. This is a stupid Hollywood clichas this does not happen in real lifeeven with families where incest is all the rage!! Second for 'comic relief' for the WWI scenes Steppin Fetchit is casteven though he has NOTHING to do with the movie. And no he does not play the 'black sheep' of the family! He is simply a walking talking negative racial stereotype that was very popular in the 30s but which makes almost everyone cringe today and it should. Also the notion of a need for COMEDY during WWI is brainless and misguided to say the least! What part of 11000000 war dead is funny?!Now you should be able to look past these two problem areas with the film and if you stick with it the movie is pretty amazing for its scope its very brutal scenes of warfare some of the most harrowing of the era in fact and its rather nonpartisan standwhich was quite the rage in the early to mid1930swhen most Americans had come to accept that this war had no good guys or bad guysonly many victims. Of course WWII and the rise of Hitlerism in the years following this film would change this attitude considerably. Still it's a mostly forgotten fact that practically all films about WWI made in America during the 1930s were very critical of the war and took a neutral stance on itas was also true of many of the films in France such as Grand Illusion and J'Accuse! as well as Germany up until the Nazis took control Westfront 1918. Plus I was amazed that the movie dared to criticize the rise of nationalism and fascism in the 1930sthey were correct but Hollywood aside from this film pretty much ignored this until AFTER WWII had already begun!By the way you probably could guess that I am a history teacher and film buffhence all this background material that you might find interesting. And speaking of this history teachers should particularly appreciate this wellmade film.".

Through the decades the family ties remain strongeven after there are distinct lines of the new family that speak different languages. The idea is that despite national interests the family and the company come first. However this is all complicated 90 years later when WWI arrives. And surprisingly the film continues from the end of WWI to the Depression and its impact on the family.The film has excellent production values and clearly was a project that Fox Studio heaped a lot of money onwith lots of fancy sets an up and coming director John Ford and a pretty good cast headed by Franchot Tone and Madeleine Carroll. For the most part the writing was also firstrate and the film quite enjoyable. There were only a couple things I really disliked about the film. First subsequent generations of family members are played by the same actors in several casesas if descendants look EXACTLY like their parents grandparents or greatgrandparents. This is a stupid Hollywood clichas this does not happen in real lifeeven with families where incest is all the rage!! Second for 'comic relief' for the WWI scenes Steppin Fetchit is casteven though he has NOTHING to do with the movie. And no he does not play the 'black sheep' of the family! He is simply a walking talking negative racial stereotype that was very popular in the 30s but which makes almost everyone cringe today and it should. Also the notion of a need for COMEDY during WWI is brainless and misguided to say the least! What part of 11000000 war dead is funny?!Now you should be able to look past these two problem areas with the film and if you stick with it the movie is pretty amazing for its scope its very brutal scenes of warfare some of the most harrowing of the era in fact and its rather nonpartisan standwhich was quite the rage in the early to mid1930swhen most Americans had come to accept that this war had no good guys or bad guysonly many victims. Of course WWII and the rise of Hitlerism in the years following this film would change this attitude considerably. Still it's a mostly forgotten fact that practically all films about WWI made in America during the 1930s were very critical of the war and took a neutral stance on itas was also true of many of the films in France such as Grand Illusion and J'Accuse! as well as Germany up until the Nazis took control Westfront 1918. Plus I was amazed that the movie dared to criticize the rise of nationalism and fascism in the 1930sthey were correct but Hollywood aside from this film pretty much ignored this until AFTER WWII had already begun!By the way you probably could guess that I am a history teacher and film buffhence all this background material that you might find interesting. And speaking of this history teachers should particularly appreciate this wellmade film.";

	schema:reviewBody "Until I actually watched it I had never heard of The World Goes On. The name of director John Ford was what called my attention although I was already familiar with its stars Madeleine Carroll and Franchot Tone because I had watched both in 1935 films respectively The 39 Steps and Mutiny on the Bounty. The story is about two families that are partners in the cotton business. It all starts in 1825 when Richard Girard Tone becomes partner of Mary Warburton's Carroll husband but falls for her. She comes back to England and never sees him again but it comes that 89 years later their greatgrandchildren with their same names get to know each other and fall in love. Mary leaves an almostgroom and marries Robert during the war in which he participates as a soldier in France's Foreign Legion. What comes is the many changes the business faces during and after the war with its owners like Richard's cousins each in one different country.Almost all the film is a regular historical drama but near the end it becomes unforgettable because it perfectly predicts World War II. Talking about a war after it happened is very easy but mentioning it before it starts is the cleverest thing movies could have done. The sequence of images even shows some of the countries who were later involved in the conflict like Germany Italy England and Japan. If WWII hasn't happened this end would be a huge flaw and would be deleted in further releases. But it happened and being able to foresee it in 1934 is at least amazing. Of course no one can pass without noticing Dixie Stepin Fetchit and the horrible black stereotype. It was certainly a funny character in the 30s and it would also be today considering his messes if he wasn't shown as a feebleminded. This is a sin not only John Ford committed in that time but maybe we can forgive him of it and let ourselves be touched by the final image of this surprising film.".

All is well until WWI breaks out and soon the families are torn on all issues. I've read numerous reports saying that director John Ford never cared for this film and rumor has it that Fox was really hounding him to film screenplays the way they were written and not to go so far off track. Rumor has it that Ford did exactly that here and turned in a pretty lifeless movie just to prove a point to the studio. Of course this has never been proved to my knowledge but if you watch the film it's easy to see why this might be the case. I've seen dozens of films from the legendary director and there's no question that he's made some duds throughout but THE WORLD MOVES ON should have been a classic but the end result is so lifeless that you can't help but think there was something going on behind the scenes. Ford has always been great at showing patriotism but that's missing here and it plays an important part of the picture. There are many actions scenes scattered throughout but none of them contain any energy and they come across so flat that it seems like they just set the camera up and started shooting without trying to do anything special. This is especially true during some horrendous comedy moments with Stepin Fetchit which are just so embarrassing that you really wonder what the director was thinking. I know Fetchit appeared in several Ford films and the image that he plays rubs a lot of people the wrong way but no matter how you view it the way the character here is used is just bad. Performances are pretty good from the leads Franchot Tone Madeleine Carroll Reginald Denny but they're certainly letdown by the direction. The look of the film is quite good and there's a very interesting story here but sadly it just never comes to life. I think with more care there's a classic movie here.".

	schema:headline " The Rothschilds of Cotton";
	schema:reviewBody "For a John Ford film this one is usually not mentioned in any retrospectives I know concerning his career. For a film that is internationalistic in scope it gets sadly neglected.Another reviewer compared The World Moves On to Cavalcade which came out a year earlier. For me this film most closely resembled The House Of Rothschild only instead of money the commodity is cotton and in the 19th century. In some places cotton was considered a kind of currency like in the American south. In 1825 the American family Girard merges with the British Warburtons and then has other sons settle in France and Germany just like Nathan Rothschild's kids as early proponents of globalism. After an 1825 prologue the action skips to 1914 where Sig Ruman of the German branch is hosting a big blowout with nary a thought to a possible war breaking out. War and the Roaring 20s type materialistic peace that followed are what is dealt with.By the way also watching this film I did wonder just how the combine managed to weather the American Civil War. But that was never mentioned.The film focuses on Franchot Tone of the American branch and Madeleine Carroll of the English Warburtons. They marry and she jilts Reginald Denny of the German branch in the process. Then Tone almost on a lark enlists in the French Army. The family with losses both financial and personal carries on though.Shoehorned into the film is Stepin Fetchit in a real travesty of a role. He's the family retainer as he usually is. Here he spots some French Senegalese African soldiers in dress uniforms and he thinks it's a lodge and wants to join. Of course he's eagerly recruited. Today's viewers might not realize but the popular Amos N' Andy radio show had their protagonists as members of the Mystic Knights Of The Sea Lodge. That reference to a lodge would not have been lost on a 1934 viewer. Stepin Fetchit's role adds zero to the story and it's more offensive than usual.Best part of The World Moves On are the battle scenes in World War I. They are not glamorized in any way hardly like one of Ford's cavalry epics.I rate The World Moves On as low as I do because of Stepin Fetchit. Had he not been there this would far higher on John Ford's list of films for quality.".

For me this film most closely resembled The House Of Rothschild only instead of money the commodity is cotton and in the 19th century. In some places cotton was considered a kind of currency like in the American south. In 1825 the American family Girard merges with the British Warburtons and then has other sons settle in France and Germany just like Nathan Rothschild's kids as early proponents of globalism. After an 1825 prologue the action skips to 1914 where Sig Ruman of the German branch is hosting a big blowout with nary a thought to a possible war breaking out. War and the Roaring 20s type materialistic peace that followed are what is dealt with.By the way also watching this film I did wonder just how the combine managed to weather the American Civil War. But that was never mentioned.The film focuses on Franchot Tone of the American branch and Madeleine Carroll of the English Warburtons. They marry and she jilts Reginald Denny of the German branch in the process. Then Tone almost on a lark enlists in the French Army. The family with losses both financial and personal carries on though.Shoehorned into the film is Stepin Fetchit in a real travesty of a role. He's the family retainer as he usually is. Here he spots some French Senegalese African soldiers in dress uniforms and he thinks it's a lodge and wants to join. Of course he's eagerly recruited. Today's viewers might not realize but the popular Amos N' Andy radio show had their protagonists as members of the Mystic Knights Of The Sea Lodge. That reference to a lodge would not have been lost on a 1934 viewer. Stepin Fetchit's role adds zero to the story and it's more offensive than usual.Best part of The World Moves On are the battle scenes in World War I. They are not glamorized in any way hardly like one of Ford's cavalry epics.I rate The World Moves On as low as I do because of Stepin Fetchit. Had he not been there this would far higher on John Ford's list of films for quality.";

There is an astonishingly good combat sequence but apparently most of this footage comes from a French film that Fox bought a few years before Ford made World in '34. Nonetheless the combat stuff is breathtaking and very well integrated with studio footage of the principals. Stepin Fetchit has some good lines. Some nice compositions show that Ford or his cinematographer wasn't totally disengaged. The multigenerational love story with its mystical overtones seems totally out of character for Ford but the opening and closing shots of Christ on the cross remind us of Ford's lifelong religiosity.".

If you have a look at David you will see that he is Amy's boyfriend and behaves like that but when he is getting deeper into the whole techno scene in the US and his parties become more famous he is slightly loosing contact. There is only his work and the time after when he is preparing the next party. Or think of The Wighnomy Brothers and Gabor who became ill so that he had to stop djing producing and travelling. I think he did not realize the fact being ill because he was leaded by the music  although a lot may say that the alcohol plays a main role. So you see that there are of course people that get lost in music!All the recordings from different festivals  remember the Modeselektor gig  the interviews with Modeselektor The Wighnomy Brothers Monolake Ellen Allien Phillip Sherburne or Tobias Thomas the Kompakt Tour and the Interview with Wolfgang Voigt which you can find on the DVD show how deep the different musicians are into the music.

	schema:reviewBody "Some films tend to glorify rock and roll by showing off its glamorous side full of adventure and wonder. Sid and Nancy does no such thing. Instead it exposes the dirty grimy seedy underbelly of punk rock which is full of violence and drugs. Gary Oldman plays Sid Vicious the bassist for British punk rock group the Sex Pistols. The film chronicles his life from when he meets his junky girlfriend Nancy Spungen to the tragic demise of that relationship. It is a loud mean ugly and crass film that perfectly captures all that the Sex Pistols stood for... anarchy. Filled with all sorts of sex drugs and rock and roll Sid and Nancy is a seriously wild ride.If there's anything that makes this film it's Gary Oldman and Chloe Webb. These two are incredible Oldman more so. Oldman captures the self destructive tendencies of Sid excellently and takes it to a frighteningly believable extreme. It is a terrifying and shocking experience to watch him run amuck in this film spray painting walls nonstop drinking shooting heroin every chance he gets burning houses etc. He is the true essence of anarchy and yet somehow we feel sympathy for him. This is solely because of Nancy the girlfriend. She is a character you love to hate. She is a pathetic excuse for a human being always whining to get her way and her drugs never contributing anything positive to Sid's life and always screaming about her own problems. It is sickening and it makes the film all the more twisted and engrossing as we watch such self destruction unfold on screen.It's not easy to tell a story where your two main characters are so easily hateable but somehow this film does it. I think it is because of the balance between Nancy and Sid that we feel compelled to pity Sid and despise Nancy making the film engaging in an offbeat and slightly deranged way. Their story is so backwards and so wretchedly obscene that we have to be interested in it somehow. It starts off simply enough. The Sex Pistols are all about anarchy and they go around beating people up cursing drinking and all that sort of thing. But it isn't until Sid meets Nancy that things really start to explode as the story falls deeper and deeper into a twisted fit of depravity. Thing get worse and worse for the two as the film progresses and Sid's life slowly crumbles around him with him too drunk or too high to even notice. The film does lag a little bit towards the middle as the conversations between Nancy and Sid begin to get a little repetitive but we are then hit by an expected yet still powerful ending that closes out the film at just the right tone and atmosphere.There is really nothing sane or reasonable about Sid and Nancy. It envelopes true chaos and discourse through the life of one man and his ridiculous girlfriend. It is a chore to watch this film as it does chronicle a life full of the most horrible habits and attitudes imaginable but if you can stomach it all then Sid and Nancy is a fantastic film to experience. I loved this film and was truly fascinated by it. It displays a lifestyle a would never want to live. Instead I only want to learn about it in vulgar detail from a great film like Sid and Nancy.".

The film perfectly captures the time frame of what is indisputably the music and cultural phenomenon known as Punk Rock the only blight on this great piece of work is the ending which as Cox agrees is far too romanticised after the harshness the viewer has just sat thru. Yet this film ranks as one of the most honest and frank music biography movies out on the market and I urge anyone who stays away from it because of an aversion to Punk and it's offshoots to seek it out ASAP.The acting from Gary Oldman  Chloe Webb is nothing short of amazing the photography from Roger Deakins is very impressive.........witness a scene as Vicious leaves a New Jersey prison and walks across a deserted scrap heap with New York prominent in the background the twin towers cloaked in cloud . The direction is smart funny and handled perfectly till that ending  and the music arrangement is done adroitly by all involved but I have to say that viewing it now and hearing Joe Strummer sing Love Kills at the closing credits gives me an added emotional kicker SO YES A LITTLE BIAS HERE FROM ME .810".

	schema:reviewBody "When I was 15 I loved this movie because I loved the Sex Pistols and everything punk.  Now that I am twice that age I love this film for its unflinching portrayal of two people's lives despite how uncomfortable it makes us how little we sympathize with them as people or how hard it is for us to comprehend the choices they made.  I personally believe at least part of the discomfort comes from the fact that at some level we DO understand Sid and Nancy their love for each other and the choices they make beneath the haze of addiction.I realize seeing it with adult eyes why my parents were so shocked I was watching this film in 1987.  But ironically it was the best antidrug message I could have seen in my teenage years.  In performances so masterful they make me wince fight off nausea and weep for their misfortune Gary Oldman and Chloe Webb constructed characters no one would ever want to be. The supporting cast deserves accolades as well  in particular Andrew Schofield turns in a seamless portrayal of Johnny Rotten who unlike Sid knows full well Malcolm MacLaren created him.Having read And I Don't Want To Live This Life by Debora Spungen and having seen more than a handful of documentaries with live footage of the band throughout the years what impressed me most was the consistency of tone that Oldman and Webb bring to their performances.  They are spoton not just in stupor and excess but in tenderness and rare moments of clarity.  The movie's ending was unique among biopics where the truth is in dispute in that it did not profess to know the answer to that burning question did Sid kill Nancy? any more than Sid knew himself.Why watch a film about a couple of junkies who came from unremarkable backgrounds and disappeared into the bleakness of drug addiction?  We seem to want our films to be about something loftier than ourselves.  I view Sid and Nancy more as a play than a movie  we allow our plays to be about uncomfortable subjects and unhappy people but seem to think that celluloid must be as bright as the projector light behind it.  This film is a study in love and dysfunction its characters are painfully imperfect but perfectly portrayed and we cannot help but respond even if our response is the deep squirming discomfort that leads us to say we disliked the whole experience.I rated this film a very rare 9.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is not historically accurate. Let's get that out of the way right off the bat. This is not about the history of the Sex Pistols. Details don't matter this movie is about feeling. Two misguided deluded outcasts who are so completely desperately in love that they won't leave each other even though they are probably the worst people in the world for each other. They spiral into heroin addiction which is NOT glamorized. Some of the scenes with them bunkered down in the Chelsea Hotel are downright disgusting and one of them is killed although no one knows how exactly how. Punks are usually the unsentimental type so they tend to give this film the twofinger salute. Well screw them. It is a beautiful film which speaks more honestly about love and addiction than any Oscargrabbing shite that I can find in the New Release section. Gary Oldman and and Chole Webb are excellent inhabiting their characters right down to marrow. The era is evoked wonderfully and the film is littered with gorgeous iconic images the best of which being Sid and Nancy kissing in an alleyway while garbage rains down on them from above like rice at a wedding. Also most people ignore how FUNNY this movie is despite it's heartbreaking subject matter. This is an enjoyable movie not a punishment or a slog through the mud. After seeing this movie a friend of mine was so moved she packed up everything she had and moved to London where she lived on the streets for a year trying to form a punk band. I'd recommend this movie to anyone not just punks or Sex Pistols fans. It's appeal is much more universal than that. To me this movie exemplifies my idea of true love. It isn't always pretty. It can drag you over glass lead you to your grave debase humiliate and destroy you. But it's a connection so strong that you can't deny it. And it's so beautiful that you really don't care if it kills you.".

Most of Sid and Nancy revolves around the two titled postteen's attempt to maintain some semblance of a real relationship in the midst of a lot of drugs and selfinduced violence. What stopped me from turning off this sad statement of a generation was the performance of Gary Oldman. His sneering imitation of Sid's contempt for almost everyone around him masked a touching vulnerability when it came to Nancy and  yep even their pet kitty.And I've got to give the truly unforgettable award to Sid and Nancy based on one single cinematic moment in the film you know what that moment is don't you? Yeppers  Sid belting out a searing rendition of Old Blue Eye's favorite My Way. Set against a backdrop of stairs that call to mind every high school assembly Oldman scratches and claws at this song with such a ferocious intensity I'd give him the gold statue right now.Because that's what a cinematic moment really is the sum total of the character presented to the audience in a kernel of truth. Gary Oldman  an actor whose gold statuette is long overdue  captures the twin torments of a twisted teen that really just wants to be loved and doesn't know how to get past his own angry angst.".

These are two tortured souls in communion who seem at odds with just about every facet of society  even the extreme punk rock counterculture to which they both ostensibly belong.A major problem with the film and all the more reason to tip our hats to the two leads is that Sid and Nancy are written as such abrasive and disagreeable characters one is hard pressed to relate to them on any meaningful level.And while the recreation of their reckless and volatile rebelliousness is quite detailed and credible we never get a sense of how they came to be so angry and tortured to begin with. Even the smallest glimpse at their inner turmoil would have gone a long way in creating sympathy and concern from the audience. Instead director Cox relies on the pureness of their genuine love for each other to provide that hook. That strategy succeeds to the extent it does ONLY because of Oldman's and Webb's amazing transformation into these parts.If you own a DVD player try to get a hold of the Criterion Collection edition of this film.

I was pleasantly surprised to find a coherent energetic but ultimately melancholy study of codependency with two terrific central performances.We get to know Chloe Webb's childwoman Nancy to a greater extent than we do Gary Oldman's wildman Sid. Not the actors' fault. In fact it's not a fault at all. There is something inexplicable there. Whatever forces were at play in forming the young man who became Sid Vicious it's to the credit of Alex Cox and his team that they don't waste time speculating upon them or trying to analyse them. Instead the film lives up to its title starting just before the relationship starts and ending just after Nancy's death. The era in which the film was made is a significant factor in appreciating it. It was in the UK at any rate a time when the welfare state that had been so painstakingly put into place began to be systematically unravelled a land where the notion of Society was belittled in which hyperindividualism was lauded where any sense of community was being abandoned and the search for it becoming a joke. WALL ST the'hero' of which was to famously declare Greed to be good was released the year after SID AND NANCY. I remember all that only too well. And of course it's not over yet the unravelling continues.Sid and Nancy meet in a frenzy and finish in a fog. In between they shore each other up as best they can two bits of flotsam on an indifferent sea. We're shown only a little of where Sid came from mercifully not enough to help us theorise about how he came to be the embodiment of anarchy. Instead through Oldman's bravura we see his unmitigated charisma at which the film's unctuous Malcolm McClaren played by David Hayman smiles knowingly and which he merrily exploits. We do see Nancy in the context of her family but again instead of attempting to use this encounter to explaining her Cox gives us a sense of how pleased the family was to get rid of her. If Romeo and Juliet had been like Sid and Nancy the Montagues and the Capulets would have paid to get them married and out of Verona altogether.".

Instead through Oldman's bravura we see his unmitigated charisma at which the film's unctuous Malcolm McClaren played by David Hayman smiles knowingly and which he merrily exploits. We do see Nancy in the context of her family but again instead of attempting to use this encounter to explaining her Cox gives us a sense of how pleased the family was to get rid of her. If Romeo and Juliet had been like Sid and Nancy the Montagues and the Capulets would have paid to get them married and out of Verona altogether.";

The original punks were anti fashion and anti everything attracting misfits of all kinds and colours although art and fashion students made up the majority. This really was an open house with prostitutes homosexuals and exhibtionists being equally welcome.This is accurately depicted in the movie.Sid and Nancy were from this hangingon group and although joining the group as bassist  and groupie respectively Nancy tried to get it on with most of the band they were never more than window dressing. The Pistol sound was LydonRotten's voice and Steve Jones's power chords. Sid never even played on the records.It is notable that many icons manage to have an icon haircut Elvis Rolling Stones Beatles all set hair fashions and amazingly SV even managed one himself with his perfect spikes. His look his life and his early death made him a cult but he didn't leave a legacy behind other than a series of halfhearted drunken rants.Hard to see how Oldman could do more to be Vicious other than lose a few years. SV died at 21 and Oldman is clearly older 28 at the time of filming but that is my only quibble. Chloe Webb as Nancy is also good but annoying like a dog that won't shut up barking and chewing the furniture until you just accept it. A life consisting of drugs sex and TV  often consumed all at the same time.Alex Cox's direction possibly because he knew the punk movement first hand rather than through the papers is first rate  like Quentin Tarantino lite  but he is  just as much a flashinthepan as Sid and Nancy himself. He can't make a mainstream movie because all he is interested in is man's ugly underbelly and without major acting talent these things look selfindulgent and even amateurish.However this is a moral look at drug taking  not the fun before it gets serious moral  the its never a good idea full stop one. Sid is a child Nancy is barely any more than a child but more streetwise. Too lazy for work she used oral sex like most people use a credit card.I like this film because it has something to say about undeserved fame what you do or the few choices you have after your fifteen minutes is up and how empty headed people with no agenda get treated in this big bad world. Whether you want to spend time learning all this is up to you but it is very well done if you do.".

I saw it again just last night and it was worse. Over the decades since Sid kicked Nancy's bucket and then his own several documentaries unearthed footage and books of reminiscences have strengthened our acquaintance with the 'punk rock' story and its myriad subplots. However as the director and cowriter of 'Sid and Nancy' Alex Cox would have known the entire story back in the early 1980s. He just didn't want to film it. Instead we get a wildly inaccurate phantasmagoria starring two painfully overacting hams who look several years older than the historical characters they are meant to be portraying. The entire English punk scene is pulped down into a bunch of exaggeratedly lurching moronic and pettily destructive idiots falling over repeatedly and making life difficult for themselves and others. What about the intelligence and originality of the Buzzcocks or the Banshees? What about the Clash's social conscience? What about the Sex Pistols' mediasavvy and musical talent? Check 'The Punk Rock Movie' Sid actually could play albeit in a basic 'Dee Dee Ramone' manner and if you'd like to listen to the live bootlegs they bear little resemblance to the incompetent racket served up by the 'Sex Pistols' in 'S  N'. Moreover couldn't Cox have staged the 'Pistols' English gigs with an audience who doesn't look like it was straight out of 1984? Check the halfmohawks and the 'positive punk' girls' puffedup hair. Almost as bad as Spike Lee's 'Summer of Sam'. While we're at it why are there no swastikas? So what if Alex Cox didn't want them in his precious movie in 197677 they were right there in front of everybody. Again check the footage. Sid Vicious made the swastika tshirt an icon he pretty much lived in one. You might as well try to do a biopic about the Grateful Dead and leave out the peace symbol. Look as you can tell I could easily spend 10000 words telling you how insultingly bad stupid and dishonest this movie is. Maybe one day I will but suffice to say that with its focus on two of the most obnoxious universally disliked and talentfree members of the 1970s punk movement it is a totally charmfree excursion into biopic territory. It is also intolerably bad history.".

Gary Oldman is my favorite actor and he's in fine form here although his Sid Vicious accent degenerates into a kind of generic Brit accent by the end of the film. I was interested in the story of Sid and the Sex Pistols but true to the title the film focuses squarely on Sid's relationship with Nancy. The film assumes a general and broad knowledge of the life and events of Sid and the Sex Pistols. You get tidbits of reportedly 'real' happenings from infamous stories but it plays out as a disconnected series of events without any framework to ground you in the lives of any of the characters. The dialog is mostly semicoherent druginduced babbling while stumbling blindly from one downtrodden location to another. In short the film much like Sid's life is a trainwreck. Is this intentional? Trying to capture the feeling of what it was like? Maybe maybe not. But it's a moot point. The film's main fault is in failing to create any sympathy for it's characters. Unlike other films which show the unglamorous cycle of drug dependency such as Trainspotting and The Basketball Diaries Sid  Nancy shows not one redeeming value in its 'protagonists'. I was actually grateful when Nancy is no longer a focus of the story because I couldn't stand hearing her whining and screaming on the screen anymore. I thought the end of the movie might pull it out and make the whole thing worthwhile now that the focus was squarely on Oldman. And what do I get instead? A meaningless sequence where he dances with children before a magical cab pulls up to escort him and his newly revived love off to Neverneverland. Yes I'm aware the disco on the radio had meaning. Well this sequence is certainly a happier note to end on than what happened in real life. And why not toss in another sequence glorifying a destructive codependent relationship based on drug use? Yes the film has the audacity to imply that this is real love. If you're 13 and looking for a film to romanticize and justify your rebellious antieverything feelings and you have a lot of knowledge and fascination for Sid Vicious you might enjoy this film. For everyone else stay away. The details are fudged and fuzzy the script is misguided the directing is slipshod and unless you just HAVE to see Courtney Love's first role the acting isn't worth sitting through the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "You really need to ask yourself if you love the Pistols and the general era of the late 70's. If you do the film will fall flat for you. The details are all wrong the key incidents of the band and Sid's involvement with them are way off. The personalities of key people are wrong some characters just made up rather sloppily too. So we can forgive it for being a wholly inaccurate of Sid Vicious' life. Fine but so then what we are left with is a basic love story. It fails at this too mostly because Nancy is written out pure spite and misogyny. She is therefore not only unlikable but wholly uninteresting. You never believe the love story because quite frankly Nancy isn't really written as a human being just a series of tropes about junkies and that awful idea that women are shrews that stifle men's creativity.The truth is Nancy was much more physically beautiful than this film wishes to admit. She was also quite charming in fact if you know junkie culture you know that charm deadly psychotic charm is a key way to survive and support your habit. None of that is shown here so that ability for junkies to convince others they are clean or kind or honest is obliterated. Nancy was smarter than this film gives credit for yes even though she was a junkie with more charisma too and if they had written her that way it would make for a better film. The real Sid fell in love with a real human being a flawed one to be sure but the kind of junkie a lot of us could fall for. In this film she's just a very nasty series of dull obvious tropes. Just about everyone intimately involved with the Sex Pistols has disowned this film. I think there are moments of visual poetry in this film I think Gary Oldman's performance is excellent but the script is a Hollywood hackneyed attempt to reduce the Sex Pistols to every stereotype and narrow prejudice those who were never punks have always harbored about the punk movement. It's sad because there is some real craft to this film it had tremendous potential but ultimately you can just never believe Sid would fall for this lessthanhuman harpy. Sad because there's a real reason Nancy swept Sid off his feet. The truth in this case is not only stranger than fiction it was also far more compelling.".

Nancy was smarter than this film gives credit for yes even though she was a junkie with more charisma too and if they had written her that way it would make for a better film. The real Sid fell in love with a real human being a flawed one to be sure but the kind of junkie a lot of us could fall for. In this film she's just a very nasty series of dull obvious tropes. Just about everyone intimately involved with the Sex Pistols has disowned this film. I think there are moments of visual poetry in this film I think Gary Oldman's performance is excellent but the script is a Hollywood hackneyed attempt to reduce the Sex Pistols to every stereotype and narrow prejudice those who were never punks have always harbored about the punk movement. It's sad because there is some real craft to this film it had tremendous potential but ultimately you can just never believe Sid would fall for this lessthanhuman harpy. Sad because there's a real reason Nancy swept Sid off his feet. The truth in this case is not only stranger than fiction it was also far more compelling.";

	schema:reviewBody "Nauseating Nancy Spungen portrayed by Chloe Webbhas always made this movie hard for me to watch. I can't feel any sympathy for such an obnoxious person and she was more or less just as horrid in reality. Sid Vicious was basically a sweet naive kid who had a difficult time believing the truth about Nancy's days as a prostitute. He really did love her and most people don't believe he was the one who killed her especially since he was reported to be UNCONSCIOUS on Tuinal on the night in question. This movie should by no means be taken as fact regarding ANYTHING Andrew Schofield is especially terrible as Johnny Rotten. He was supposed to meet and study Rotten but then admitted to him that the scenes had already been shot and Cox just wanted to use Rotten's name in connection with the film. The Rockhead character who is supposed to be Johnny Thunders the guitarist for the New York Dolls Heartbreakers etc. is ridiculous at least they didn't use J.T.'s actual name. Nancy wasn't in England to chase after Johnny she was obsessed with Jerry Nolan the drummer for the HeartbreakersNew York Dolls. Anyhow we'd be here all night if I pointed out every inaccuracy in this movie. Gary Oldman is an excellent actor and does a good job although he's playing Sid the stage persona as opposed to Sid the person. If you just watch the movie as the story of two tragic lovers and don't compare it to reality it's alright I liked it a lot when I was a 14yearold punk heh. Cheetah Chrome's quote in Please Kill Me is amusing Fg Nancy. If Sid hadn't killed her I woulda ha ha ha. Nancy was probably the most miserable person I've ever met in my life.".

	schema:reviewBody "People often use the description of a road accident to describe an event that is so ugly they don't normally want to look at it but is in turn so fascinating that they simply cannot look away. Alex Cox's depiction of the relationship between Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen fits that description to a T. It consists of so much ugliness that nobody in their right mind would normally watch it for pleasure but it is done in such a fascinating manner that one can't help being fascinated.Sid Vicious was definitely not one of humanity's finer specimens. His name was a total misnomer given that he apparently couldn't fight his way out of a wet paper bag. His musical skills were so close to nonexistent that I could probably play a better song than he does in spite of never having played in a band before. So it is hardly a surprise that much of his daily activity consisted of destroying himself. Nor is it surprising that the girlfriend who tries to exploit his total lack of talent is even more vapid and idiotic than he is.The real John Lydon refers to this biopic as the Peter Pan version and I don't doubt that this is to some extent true. No film studio in its right mind is going to pay to have what really happened with Sid Vicious and the people around him depicted on film especially not now that one cannot bring a period piece with a decent cast to completion without spending a good fifty million. Interestingly John Lydon also describes himself as being the only talented member of the Sex Pistols and this is borne out by his musical output after their breakup so it would be interesting to see a biopic about him.Not having seen any original footage or performances of the real Sid Vicious I am not going to comment on whether Gary Oldman captures the character or not. What he does capture is the general obnoxiousness of the scene. It takes genuine talent as an actor to capture the performance element of a musician so terrible that a genre known for terrible musicianship considers him among the worst. One's instinct when putting a bass guitar in their hand is to do at least a halfway competent job of playing it so it must have taken some effort to restrain that.Alex Cox having just come off the production of Repo Man obviously wasn't willing to give up his ideas about nonobvious humour. While there aren't nearly as many sight gags here there's enough sequences that make one laugh in spite of themselves that they cannot help but wonder if it was unintentional. Oldman's impersonation of Vicious doing My Way as only Vicious would will make you laugh cry and reminisce even if you were a mere toddler at the time Vicious died.I gave Sid And Nancy an eight out of ten. There are some films that one is inclined to respond with a wellemphasised good with when old cranks talk about how they don't make films like this anymore. When people tell me they don't make films like Sid And Nancy anymore I think it's a damned shame.".

	schema:headline " The greatest story of doomed love since Romeo and Juliet";
	schema:reviewBody "Sid and Nancy is one of those rare films that has all the bursting exuberance of youth without all the negative side effects.  There are no scenes that scream out HEY LOOK AT US!  WE'RE YOUNG WE'RE TWISTED DON'T YOU WISH YOU WE'RE US!?  Okay maybe it has a few but none of them feel like they exist strictly for shock value none of them feel the least bit contrived or unnecessary.  That is what makes Sid and Nancy so great. Most film criticism stems from reaction to prior film releases. Reviewers like Siskel and Ebert tend to cling to comparisons as a safety blanket and as an almost cop out for original thought.  Director Alex Cox Repo Man tells a story of doomed love that tends to defy easy categorization.  Its brilliant combination of ultra realistic biography and surrealistic conjecture create a film universe that had not been seen prior to its release. The film opens in a dingy New York City Chelsea Hotel room.  Sex Pistols bassist and Punk Rock icon Sid Vicious Gary Oldman in a staggering performance is being questioned by police about the apparent murder of his girlfriend and world famous rock n' roll groupie Nancy Spungen Chloe Webb Twins TV's China Beach.  Smash cut to the punk rock era of 1977 London where Sid meets Nancy in a world of anarchy and disillusion inhabited by kids who don't know quite what they are disillusioned about.  After a brief first encounter there is no chemistry between these two classic lovers but soon Nancy sees Sid at a Sex Pistols gig jumping around on stage freely showing his lack of musical ability and its love at first sight.  Note it is a documented fact that Sid Vicious barely knew two chords on the bass guitar.  When Sid after asking Nancy to cop some heroin for him bashes his head against a brick wall in a twisted attempt to empathize with her Nancy's love is only reaffirmed by Sid's complete abandonment of personal safety.  Before we know it the two are shooting up the drug which immediately begins a cycle of codependency that only desperate youth could satisfy.  So the question arises are they really in love?  Or do they need each other to support their habit? Well the question is answered at least in Alex Cox's eyes in a scene where the Sex Pistols play a gig on a riverboat which ends violently in a police clash with Sex Pistols fans.  As the boat docks the punk rock youth pour onto the dock to escape the Billy clubs.  Sid and Nancy casually stroll through the chaos unscathed as if they know that their love will protect them. As corny as the above event my sound Alex Cox quickly juxtaposes with a scene of pure brutal addiction where we get to witness one of the most frantic fiending for drugs scenes ever shot. Sid and Nancy's desperation does not only make us cringe it also makes us laugh with a classic comic topper that has to be witnessed to gain full appreciation.  There in lies the beauty of Sid and Nancy a locomotive of a film that is always on the verge of jumping the tracks but is saved at the breaking point by carefully placed contradictions that more often than not makes us laugh. As if the above were not enough to make an engrossing movie the film is also a great example of integrating historical events into a story without distracting the viewer from the film's unifying themes.  Sid and Nancy is a great anthology of the rise and fall of a social movement which behind the spiked hair and leather jackets was a dead on assessment of the hypocrisy that existed in England and the United States circa the decadent 1970's.".

	onyx:emotionText "Sid and Nancy is one of those rare films that has all the bursting exuberance of youth without all the negative side effects.  There are no scenes that scream out HEY LOOK AT US!  WE'RE YOUNG WE'RE TWISTED DON'T YOU WISH YOU WE'RE US!?  Okay maybe it has a few but none of them feel like they exist strictly for shock value none of them feel the least bit contrived or unnecessary.  That is what makes Sid and Nancy so great. Most film criticism stems from reaction to prior film releases. Reviewers like Siskel and Ebert tend to cling to comparisons as a safety blanket and as an almost cop out for original thought.  Director Alex Cox Repo Man tells a story of doomed love that tends to defy easy categorization.  Its brilliant combination of ultra realistic biography and surrealistic conjecture create a film universe that had not been seen prior to its release. The film opens in a dingy New York City Chelsea Hotel room.  Sex Pistols bassist and Punk Rock icon Sid Vicious Gary Oldman in a staggering performance is being questioned by police about the apparent murder of his girlfriend and world famous rock n' roll groupie Nancy Spungen Chloe Webb Twins TV's China Beach.  Smash cut to the punk rock era of 1977 London where Sid meets Nancy in a world of anarchy and disillusion inhabited by kids who don't know quite what they are disillusioned about.  After a brief first encounter there is no chemistry between these two classic lovers but soon Nancy sees Sid at a Sex Pistols gig jumping around on stage freely showing his lack of musical ability and its love at first sight.  Note it is a documented fact that Sid Vicious barely knew two chords on the bass guitar.  When Sid after asking Nancy to cop some heroin for him bashes his head against a brick wall in a twisted attempt to empathize with her Nancy's love is only reaffirmed by Sid's complete abandonment of personal safety.  Before we know it the two are shooting up the drug which immediately begins a cycle of codependency that only desperate youth could satisfy.  So the question arises are they really in love?  Or do they need each other to support their habit? Well the question is answered at least in Alex Cox's eyes in a scene where the Sex Pistols play a gig on a riverboat which ends violently in a police clash with Sex Pistols fans.  As the boat docks the punk rock youth pour onto the dock to escape the Billy clubs.  Sid and Nancy casually stroll through the chaos unscathed as if they know that their love will protect them. As corny as the above event my sound Alex Cox quickly juxtaposes with a scene of pure brutal addiction where we get to witness one of the most frantic fiending for drugs scenes ever shot. Sid and Nancy's desperation does not only make us cringe it also makes us laugh with a classic comic topper that has to be witnessed to gain full appreciation.  There in lies the beauty of Sid and Nancy a locomotive of a film that is always on the verge of jumping the tracks but is saved at the breaking point by carefully placed contradictions that more often than not makes us laugh. As if the above were not enough to make an engrossing movie the film is also a great example of integrating historical events into a story without distracting the viewer from the film's unifying themes.  Sid and Nancy is a great anthology of the rise and fall of a social movement which behind the spiked hair and leather jackets was a dead on assessment of the hypocrisy that existed in England and the United States circa the decadent 1970's.";

In the brief intervals between Chloe Webb's whining the film manages to veer into interesting visual territory. But ultimately it's unrewarding at times treacly heroin mythologizing and historical inaccurate. What does director Alex Cox really know about the punk movement anyway? I would hardly rely on the impressions of an upper class intellectual who was on his way to being a lawyer when punk happened. He was such an outsider that he turned to Joe Strummer of the Clash for help. Would no one from the Sex Pistols camp talk to him? He didn't even get Johnny Rotten's accent right. Skip this and watch Filth and the Fury instead.".

There was no exploration of the relationship between the two and other people in Sids life were virtually ignored. John Lydon was a schoolpal yet you would think from this movie that there was no friendship between them at all. Sids mother was a major influence on what made him who he was but no reference was made to her whatsoever. Maybe the threat of legal proceedings from her influenced the directors objectivity.In the end Sid was made to look like a stupid victim of Nancy yet other chronicles reveal that he truly did have strong feelings for her. This film gives no indication as to why and demeans him as a person. Sid may have been many things but he wasn't an empty shell.The sad fact is that a young boy of 21 died through drug abuse and I feel this movie simply romanticizes it and tries to make it look cool.Hopefully one day someone will make a movie that realistically captures Sid the sex pistols and England as they really were at that time.

However I was ultimately unable to engage with this movie. The problem unfortunately is the protagonists.Although Oldman and Webb are very good in their roles ultimately the film suffers from the fact that neither Sid Vicious nor Nancy Spungen were especially sympathetic figures. Frankly they were a pair of idiot junkies whom even their own entourage couldn't stand. There was nothing tragic about what happened to them they simply selfdestructed. I simply could not care about them.They didn't even have the saving grace of being hugely talented. Although Vicious was a good performer he wasn't the greatest who ever lived. Spungen was mainly known for going out with Vicious. If this had been the case of a Caravaggio or Hemingway who collapsed under the weight of his own genius it might have been more engaging.".

The reason being that we know what the individuals involved looked like then and look like now and we are aware of what really happened and can compare the real people to the fantasy version that the director chooses to put on screen. For example Sid Vicious's famous swastika Tshirt gets bowdlerised into a hammer and sickle Tshirt the latter apparently being more intune with director's PC totalitarian sensibilities. Yuck.In this movie the director comes off looking like the talentless pretentious declass wannabe that we always knew he was from his other films a Will Self of the cinema. Alex Cox has totally bought into the synthetic cartoonish onstage public image of the Sex Pistols and the punk movement and mistaken it for the real people involved. The result resembles Star Trek fan fiction a lame geeky attempt to rehash someone else's already shallow work of fiction by an overly obsessive fan made all the more irritating because it is presented as if it was telling a true story. So we get Gary Oldman and Chloe Webb and the supporting cast mugging their onenote cartoonish punk caricatures throughout the length of this film with occasional injections of outoftouch intellectualisms. It's not entertaining and it's not funny although the characters behave as if they believe they are. The plot what little there is moves quite slowly to its known and muddled conclusion. The low budget shows in the poor cinematography and weak script. The only emotion I felt by the end was embarrassment for the filmmakers combined with the fervent hope that they would change careers to suit their true vocations as checkout clerks and sociology lecturers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Prince of Darkness 1987 is John Carpenter underrated absolutely apocalypse classic supernatural horror flick! I know I should choose The Fog above Prince of Darkness but after watching this film for the first time. I absolutely love it so damn much. It is actually about an apocalypse that means the end of the world. A group of college students with a priest and a college professor finds a mysterious cylinder in a deserted church. If opened it could mean the end of the world. It containing a swirling green liquid that spits in the students and makes them possessed by the entity which uses them against the others. The fight for survival and rescue has begun. Starring Donald Pleasence from Halloween 1978 Escape from New York 1981 Victor Wong and Dennis Dun from Big Trouble in Little China 1986 Jameson Parker from Simon  Simon 1981  1995 and Thom Bray from Riptide 1984  1986. I love this film to death alongside with The Thing 1982 is the second installment in what Carpenter calls his Apocalypse Trilogy which began with The Thing 1982.It is one of my all time favorite supernatural horror flick from the 80's. I got it now why is underrated you have to be very smart about it. I always can enjoy this film from John Carpenter and it is a classic film for me! A lot of people don't understand this movie but I love it and the soundtrack is amazing. The special effect this horror film had on young teenagers 14 minus they were truly scared. It really worked and it had some interesting ideas. Lisa Blount was so beautiful in here and she was so outstanding her role as Catherine Danforth! This movie is truly amazing!!!! I am so glad that Victor Wong and Donald Pleasence return in the John Carpenter horror film. The both worked in the past 70's and 80's with John Carpenter on his awesome horror film Halloween 1978 and Big Trouble in Little China 1986. They are both classic films just I don't like Halloween 1978 I am probably the only who hate this film but in to Prince of Darkness I can get too I just love this film to death!!!!The visual after Catherine Lisa Blunt pushes the possessed Kelly through the mirror of the light fading out as she falls into darkness is stunning and unforgettable. Lisa Blunt kicks ass in this movie!!!!!!! I just love to death how Catherine sacrifice her self to prevent apocalypse in our world that is so outstanding! Lisa Blount did the most outstanding performance in this movie I just love her so much movies that are pure crap are getting Oscar nominates this movie did not got nothing Lisa Blount is awesome!!!! RIP to Donald Pleasence Victor Wong and Lisa Blount. May should all rest in peace! This movie has a real story to it and is not a gore for the sake of gore movie or a hack and slash movie. John Carpenter was great in the 80s. He did a great job directing this movie along side with The Fog 1980 I think this movie is his masterpiece. I like the artwork on the soundtrack album. Very creepy it is. Sorta like a face melting effect like in the movie The Thing. The voice on the soundtrack from the end of this movie still gives me chills. It's one of the best bits is horror history. One thing I noticed about Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy is a running theme throughoutthe fear of infection. In the Thing it was fear of touching the monster and having your body converted to it. In Prince of Darkness it was the scientists infecting each other with bodily fluids and in In the Mouth of Madness it was fear of Sutter Cane's book being widely spread throughout the world infecting those who read it with madness. It's interesting that this movie trilogy started up about the same time as AIDs was discovered. There was a huge panic about the disease being spread by blood and other fluids and it would have been foremost in the public mind. No doubt it inspired Carpenter a bit. The film isn't fast paced but it's not slow either gradually building tension to the very end that's peppered with a mild scares throughout to assist. There are enough twists and turns to maintain an edge to the very end with one final twist. The movie's entirely different concept of Good and Evil is developed in a very unique and unusual manner while maintaining excellent credibility. Visual and Special effects along with the stunt work are done quite well surprisingly so given the film's budget. There is some graphic blood and gore and it's very definitely R rated but it's not as much by contemporary hardcore horror film standards e.g. Saw Hostel or The Crazies remake. Carpenter makes use of some very creepy and revolting effects in lieu of it. Overall it's an excellent supernatural horror thriller and IMHO it's one of Carpenter's better films. Master of horror John Carpenter Halloween The Thing directs this terrifying battle between humankind and ultimate evil. It is one of my favorite John Carpenter best films! I am giving this movie 1010 because this movie deserves it and it doesn't need to be hated for it.".

	schema:headline " Carpenter's masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "John Carpenter's masterpiece about a priest enlisting the help of a physics professor and his students in preventing the coming of the AntiGod. Yep I said masterpiece. I consider this to be Carpenter's crowning achievement. Said priest played by the impeccable Donald Pleasance discovers a large vat of green fluid in the basement of an old church near downtown Los Angeles. He comes to realize that the liquid in the container is the very essence of Satan himself and that a sect known as The Brotherhood of Sleep has kept it a secret all these years. The secret can no longer be kept however as the apocalypse is brewing and the vat of liquid Satan is the oversized coffee pot.Carpenter really struck gold with the script for Prince of Darkness. I find it to be Carpenter's most intelligent and thoughtprovoking. I love all of the theoretical scientific and religious discussion in this film. He takes all of these wonderful ideas and forms them into one of the most intriguing story lines the genre has ever seen. It all makes for a very engaging viewing experience especially if this sort of material fascinates you as much as it does me.The film is slowburning yet intensely unnerving. The overall mood the creepy street people the church itself and the eerie occurrences caused by the AntiGod's growing power all make for an unsettling watch. Perhaps the most effective scene in the film for me is Wyndham saying hello in that garbled voice followed by Pray for death. I also must make mention of the recurring dream projections via tachyons. A brilliant idea that adds an even deeper level to the film's frightening nature. The imagery in these dreams is truly the stuff nightmares are made of!As far as the cast goes this is my favorite ensemble in a Carpenter film even more so than the one we get in The Thing. They all do fine jobs especially Pleasance and Victor Wong. I love the interaction between these two. I also really enjoy Jameson Parker in the lead and Dennis Dun is the rare case of comedy relief that actually works. He is amusing likable and his antics don't overshadow or ruin the mood that the film has built up.The atmosphere? Perfect. So is the dreadinducing score which is an uncanny fit for the material. In the same way that I see Prince of Darkness as Carpenter's best film the haunting music throughout makes for his best work as a composer. I love the score as much as I love the film itself. The sense of hopeless isolation Carpenter is able to convey despite the church being in L.A. is yet another impressive accomplishment in a film that never fails to impress.Definitely an underrated classic. Carpenter's wonderful ideas are realized to fascinating effect in the film and for me the execution is flawless. It's a rare case when I have nothing bad to say about a movie but this is one of those instances. The music the atmosphere the apocalyptic tone the marvelous ending... it all works beautifully. It's a gem that Carpenter has never bettered. I'm in the minority regarding that statement but I'm sticking to it.".

There are a well timed moments of violence but it is on a intellectual level where this film scares the crap out of you. Carpenter must have done a good amount of research as the characters try to use various scientific concepts and terms to describe what they are slowly falling victim to. The dialog very heavily resembles H.P. Lovecraft's writing who was unrelenting in providing the rational and thoughtout narration of his protagonist. One can bet that it is this element that made it necessary for this film to be made independently. The shock isn't visceral but no less effective.The only downside are a few really goofy moments I said a rich doctor! but they are ultimately forgivable and are not as sorely out of place as you might think. 810Rated R horror violence".

Sometimes Carpenter's score do miss their mark but this time the music is dead on perfect. Beyond this the movie overall is wonderful. The opening title sequence which does extend quite a bit into the film itself does a great job of setting up the characters and the beginning of the drama at hand. Once the film picks up it really doesn't let you go until the end and even then to the very last shot the film reminds you that for the briefest of moments it had you. Oh it had you. Alice Cooper makes his first theatrical film appearance with this film but he appears briefly. Instead the film centers mostly around Brian Marsh a grad student brought in as part of a group of collegiatetypes to investigate something dark and sinister in the basement of an old church. A lot of people I know pan his performance but I felt Jameson TV's Simon  Simon Parker's performance was solid and that look of confusion he wears throughout a bulk of the picture seems appropriate to the events unfolding around his character. Donald Pleasance's presence as a Catholic priest who begrudgingly recruits the team of college students and professors scientists and theorists adds a sense of credibility to the threat involved as well as the film itself. And Victor Wong  he's just fun to watch. I love this movie.".

Filled with great directiona wonderful casta creepy score and great special effectsPrince Of Darkness is John Carpenter at his best.Prince Of Darkness tells the of priest Father LoomisDonald Pleasencewho has discovered a secret that has been hidden in a church for many yearsa green container that is holding a green liquid that represents the Father of Satanan AntiGod that is pure evil. Now with the help of Physics teacher Professor Howard BirackVictor Wonghis students and others Father Loomis has to stop the AntiGod or it will be doom for the world.Prince Of Darkness is a great solid Underrated Horror film that not only marked the return of John Carpenter to the Horror genre but to his low budget roots as well. After the unfortunate box office failure of the excellent and brilliant classic the big budgeted Action Comedy Martial Arts Kung Fu film Big Trouble In Little ChinaCarpenter return to low budget films with two films the first film being Prince Of Darkness and the other film the SciFiAction classic They Live. Prince Of Darkess is the second film in Carpenter's great Apocalypse Trilogy beginning with The Thing and ending with In The Mouth Of Madness and right from the opening credits Prince Of Darkness pulls you into a horrifying nightmare that gives you a sense of dread and such impending doom a scary movie that scares you with the feel of fright and death all around. Carpenter with the ominous opening is telling us that nothing is going to be alright. POD at times feels like you are watching a dreamin fact there are several dream sequences in the filmwhere things are distorted and confusing and you're not sure of what is going on. What I also love about POD is the style and tone of the film because I look at the film POD has the style of an Italian Horror film mostly like the films of Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci because like Italian Horror films POD has frightening and disturbing imagines that will put viewers on edge because you don't know what they are or what they're about. The tension and suspense in the film is like a tightrope and as the film goes on the tension and suspense starts to become scarier and more frightening. Carpenter is a master of claustrophobia and isolation whether it is The ThingHalloween or Assault On Precinct 13 and POD is no exception and is truly filled with claustrophobia and isolation where the film's main characters are trapped on the inside and want to get out but are surrounded by evil. In many ways Carpenter has used the same story as Assault On Precinct 13 but instead of a police station and gangs it's a church and possess homeless people. With POD Carpenter asks a thoughtprovoking question what if a demon not just the Devil himself but an AntiGodnot God the creator of Heaven and Earthbut an evil God were to come into our world and brought evil onto our world with darkness and evil. Carpenter asks these questions with the characters mixing subjects of ReligionScience and physics. But pure evil can never ever be truly explained by anyone no matter what not by ReligionScience or Physics. POD also addresses the issues and conflicts between Science and Religion represented by the characters Father Loomis and Professor Birack but the issue in POD is handled really well and done with amazing intelligencegreat writing and imagination. The pace of the film will bother some people where some people will think the film is slow but I love the pace of POD because like many Horror films of the 70s and 80s POD builds up the film with tension and atmosphere and when the Horror starts it never stops. The films main characters in the film are not always likable but at the same time they are not like slasher victims waiting to get killed off and you feel sorrow and sympathy for them when things go bad. The violence and gore is simple but effective and disturbing and fits in with the grim tone of this film. The ending of the film is classic Carpenter. It's a truly scary and shocking conclusion that's very bleak and like many Carpenter endings it ends on a cliffhanger. A great ending. The cast does great jobs in their roles. Donald Pleasence is brilliant as Father Loomiswith Pleasence bring depth and sympathy to the role. Jameson Parker is great as Brian Marshone of Birack's students. Victor Wong is fantastic as Professor. Howard Birack and has great scenes with Pleasence. Lisa Blount is excellent and sexy as CatherineBrian's love interest. Dennis Dun is wonderful as Walterwith Dun bringing Humor to the film. Alice Cooper is creepy in a non speaking role as Street Schizo. Susan BlanchardLisaPeter JasonDr. Paul LeahyJesse Lawrence FergusonCaulderDirk BlockerMullinsAnn YenLisaand Anne HowardSusangive good performances as well.The direction by John Carpenter is brilliantwith Carpenter always moving the camera while using great angles and giving the film a dark and creepy atmosphere. Great direction by Carpenter.The score by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth is amazingscaryintense and dark and fits the frightening tone of the film. There is also the great song Prince Of Darkness heard briefly in the film by Alice Cooper. The special effects makeup by Frank Carrisosa is greatrealistic and disturbing. Wonderful makeup effects by Carrisosa.In final wordif you love John Carpenter or Horror filmsyou will love Prince Of Darknessa scary and frightening Horror that is very underrated and is Carpenter at his best. Highly Recommended. 1010.".

	schema:headline " The green goo";
	schema:reviewBody "I missed this one the first time around back in the 80s and despite what all the critics say I didn't think it that bad at all. Ok some of it's pretty silly and Jameson Parker and Lisa Blount were about as wooden as two totem poles but the story did keep my attention without me having to reach up and change the channel.  Plus I really dug the tension filled pulsating synth soundtrack by Alan Howarth.A group of graduate students  scientists are called upon by Father Loomis Donald Plesance to investigate a mysterious canister filled with green goo that is stored in the basement of an abandoned church.  Right after they get there all kinds of strange things begin to occur such as the homeless led by a palefaced Alice Cooper going around zombielike killing people outside the church earthworms and ants clustering on window panes in strange patterns and machines and equipment moving on their own.When the team begin to translate an ancient document that was also stored in the basement they find out that the canister contains the energy of the son of Satan who was banished to the darkside eons ago.  This supposedly occurred in ancient Middle Eastern times but how it got to L.A. is never explained.One by one each of the students are either killed off or possessed by the entity that is slowly growing around them.  The scene where thousands of beetles eat away at the guy in the church parking lot is cool.  It looks pretty funny when his hands and then his head falls off rolling around on the ground.  Hilarious.Then one of the females has all the green fluid from the canister flow into her mouth and eyes from the ceiling in a reverse matte shot.  That looks pretty cool too. While she's lying on the cot her stomach starts to expand and she starts to decompose as this thing is growing inside her.  It seems the Prince of Darkness is going to use her as an incubator to grow his fetus.  The scene at the end with the mirror leading into an alternative universe and Satan's arm being outstretched towards the woman was fairly impressive. It sort of looked like it existed in some kind of clear oily fluid that had the consistency of cooking oil.All in all I think this is a pretty entertaining John Carpenter flick to watch on a Saturday night and I consider it light years above his recent mess GHOSTS OF MARS.  7 out of 10.".

I suspect I bought it because it was a Carpenter movie and I also suspect that is the main reason why most people bothered to watch it in the first place.It is hard to comment this movie. Overall I would say it is flawed on many levels. The characters mean precious little and only half way through the action do they seem to care much about the evil green container. spoiler As a result caring for any of them is nigh impossible which completely spoils all the effect the final sacrifice might have had. end spoilerAs for the green liquid...it is there as a medium through which the ultimate evil is transmitted from person to person. Which may seem like an original idea but cannot be efficiently translated in terms of imagery. Reading the plot this seems to be a killer it contains all the ingredients of an amazing horror movie the suspense the fear of the unknown the desperate struggle to survive and the looming presence of evil coming ever closer.Sadly all this falls flat on its face as soon as it hits the screen. There is no suspense. Characters go from room to room half bored then scared but hardly ever driven by any tension. They eventually round up to ward off the zombie like creatures but by the time they do so we can no longer care. The impression that evil is biding its time is never achieved and surely not handled with any degree of pathos. The endings tries to scramble all the data we already had which is supposed to make us rethink what we just saw yet it fails to be interesting or even convincing.A few scenes were very good though. spoiler such as the strange pregnancylike state of comatose semi death which affects one of the characters and the subsequent makeup effects that reveal a rotten zombieish countenance worthy of Mr. Savini the cockroach scene in which a man completely dissolves into a mass of scampering roaches the mirror scene with Catherine eerily floating through the darkness almost like a modern Ophelia pretty much all Alice Copper scenes end spoilerAnd one thing must be said about this movie the premise is extremely original and it is a very odd piece of cinema. I honestly wish I had liked it more but alas I did not.".

I think it's finally getting the recognition it deserves and is gaining a small cult following.The acting for the most part is really good. There are some very memorable lines of dialog and I think the script is very well written. Again music is key here. The music helps with the feel of the movie which is very unsettling.Also Alice Cooper has a very small but memorable roll.

	schema:reviewBody "It has been more than 10 years since I have seen this movie but it is clear from reading the user comments that no one understands the basic plot. It is a little heavy and presupposes some basic knowledge of physics so I will do my best to explain it even though it has been 10 years.In a plot similar to the Da Vinci Code Satan or Evil unbeknownst to everyone has been locked up and carefully guarded for millenia. However the forces are starting to stir in an unusual manner so the priest guarding the presence summons some scientists to study it setting in motion a chain of events that eventually bring about the return of ultimate evil to our world. We are gradually made aware of this because the scientists upon arriving at the church begin having unusual dreams. The dreams are messages from the future accomplished by tachyons which are particles that travel faster than the speed of light. A well known property of physics dictates that time slows to zero for particles that approach the speed of light and theoretically time goes backward if the particles break the speed of light. So we are to believe that humans in the future have developed tachyon transmissions to warn humans in the past i.e. the present and prevent an apocalyptic event. Unfortunately the transmission is jammed for some reason and never completed so the scientists do not know how to interpret the dream or in this case message.Eventually the series of events climaxes when a possessed student tries to bring the ultimate evil to our world but is stopped by a lady scientist who tackles the possessed student and gets trapped in the alternate dimension supposedly all is well.However the movie concludes when one of the scientists some time later finally receives the full transmission where it is revealed that at some time in the future the ultimate evil emerges from the church in the form of the lady scientist who got trapped.For me this conclusion provides the thought provoking idea that the message that humans in the future were trying to communicate was that the lady scientist would become the ultimate evil. So we are left to wonder if anything could have been done to prevent the chain of events tachyons or not! It's a rare horror that follows similar themes as Terminator which I give 7 out of 10.".

It's very original well paced and damned frightening. Donald Pleasance is a Catholic priest who recruits his friend Victor Wong a physics professor Victor Wong of Big Trouble in Little China to draft a bunch of his best grad students to study a large vial of green liquid that is supposedly an ancient relic. The grad students being people of science find the assignment very silly but it's definitely weird and has some unexplainable stuff going around it. On the base of the vial there is a Latin inscription that claims that the liquid is the essence of Satan which will someday be used to bring back Satan's father to rule the Earth. Soon enough the liquid finds its ways into the mouths of a few of the students who become possessed. Dennis Dun of Big Trouble in Little China appears as one of the students. Highly recommended for fans of the director and horror fans in general.".

Carpenter lays the atmosphere on thick especially with a reliably spooky electronic score and a pace that burns slow and steady. Deep in the crypt of a church there lies a large glass vial containing swirling green matter a pseudo scientificspiritual cocktail that contains the anti god a denizen composed of backward atoms that wants to break out and raise a little hell. Grim faced priest Donald Pleasence will prevent this at any cost and hires a team of underpaid undergrads led by a crusty professor Victor Wong to research it camping out in the church for kicks. You can imagine how this goes and there's a refreshingly old school 'Body Snatchers' vibe as various characters fall victim to the creeping dark forces. There's also mindstimulating scifi ideas at work too though including an intriguing time travel prospect and a deft little jab at religion via the story's trickier elements. Carpenter although hailed as a master of horror is no simpleton when it comes to ideas and he flexes his cerebral muscles nicely here.

They are missing one of the key aspects upon which this movie stands disbelief. And it's also the same reason why you can watch this film maybe 40 years later and it would probably still creep the livin' hll out of you.Indeed it starts a little slow. The music Carpenter adds for the nondialog scenes builds a very thick sense of dread. But it's when they get the graduate students is where this film gets legs. The students and the professors all of whom are very scientific and rational people are asked to analyze something that only lives in what modern Man thinks is nothing more than Dark Age superstition. Yet the green goo is there in all of its horrible glory. Moreover not only are they asked to PROVE that this is evil incarnate but find a way to stop it. And their reactions reflect their basic struggle to come to grips of what they are seeing.And yet Carpenter's sound track rolls on. It really does give you the creeps.And that's the genius of the film the fact that the security of modern thinking has just been ripped away in one fell swoop and you're staring straight into a chapter or two of Revelations of John in the flesh. And you're trying to turn it all back with test tubes and computer printouts. Even early in the film you get the impression that this isn't going to end well.And then there is the dream sequences that lengthen as the movie rolls. This is also key to the movie for reasons that I won't explain because it is a potential spoiler.To that end this is a film whose premise is to turn Christianity on its head. For those of faith this is a bit of an issue. I personally put that aside  it's a horror film and a flight of fancy. All in all this film is best experienced in the dead of the night in a darkened room alone. That you'll get it.The last scenes in the movie are undoubtedly the best.".

Oh man! It's creepy and exceedingly ominous and the shakycam newsreel quality gives it an extra punch.The plot You don't have to be a genius to understand what is going on in this film but you do need to pay attention. The supernatural physics is a little nonsensical of the Popular science variety but the basic premise is explained in layman terms.The characters Actually while the science is hocuspocus I really liked that the film's characters were mostly grad students. The actors do a great job of portraying annoyed skeptical science grad students. Horror flicks are filled with numbskull undergrads and it is nice to see the hidden sector of college life revealed in its nerdy glory.The skinny I'd describe it as a BiblicalLovecraft horror film. It's got the whole evil universe theme running alongside an effective Hell breaks loose plot.".

Oh man! It's creepy and exceedingly ominous and the shakycam newsreel quality gives it an extra punch.The plot You don't have to be a genius to understand what is going on in this film but you do need to pay attention. The supernatural physics is a little nonsensical of the Popular science variety but the basic premise is explained in layman terms.The characters Actually while the science is hocuspocus I really liked that the film's characters were mostly grad students. The actors do a great job of portraying annoyed skeptical science grad students. Horror flicks are filled with numbskull undergrads and it is nice to see the hidden sector of college life revealed in its nerdy glory.The skinny I'd describe it as a BiblicalLovecraft horror film. It's got the whole evil universe theme running alongside an effective Hell breaks loose plot.";

Lloyd and Mildred Davis star in a rather complicated story that sees them spend considerable time with a cute young child giving Lloyd some different material than usual to work with.The story is the kind of deliberately illogical series of predicaments that provides a showcase for a skilled comic like Lloyd as his character movies rapidly from one jam to another. Most of it takes place on a train which provides an enjoyable setting with lots of good props and minor characters.The parts that work the best turn out to be the scenes with the child. Lloyd's eager beaver style forms a nice contrast with the young girl combining humor with an occasional warmer moment that works well. The rest of the movie also contains some good gags but many of the others are only average at least by Lloyd's standards. Nothing at all is wrong with Lloyd's timing or with the pace it's just that this time only some of the gag ideas are really creative or funny. It still adds up to an enjoyable comedy that is somewhat above average overall.".

Lloyd is not on the screen during the first minutes however is really funny to watch the younger version of his character. The girl Mildred Davis clearly remembers Lloyd' s character and now is time to see him again. But is the companion of the girl who will bring the laughs. I'm not going to be very specific but for some reasons the boy that Lloyd plays has to take care of a little girl but not before we watch how the boy is. For me is really funny to watch the boy destroying almost all the town and latter wanting to repair the damages just by giving some money to a tramp who a little later will share the screen with Lloyd in a great scene under a train in movement! After this is when the boy finally sees again the girl of his childhood to finally be together but before this the boy will have a little adventure inside the train. Before dealing with the problems for not having two tickets the boy will have some little problems with the child. He tries to make her laugh however she ends saying to him something like you look silly the boy will not have an easy ride. We also watch a couple of drunks that starts with a very funny joke one says What time is it? and the other look to his clock and says Thursday  and I thought they will have a bigger part however we only see them when they go to sleep and nothing more. But anyway the boy will make us laugh a little more particularly I loved the scene when he can't dress the child and when he with the help of other men finally can he still has in his hand one of the child's clothes so he puts it in his pocket! and in the end he finally stays with his lady.

	schema:reviewBody "A moderately funny Harold Lloyd silent short at 35 min.. I recommend seeing the Lloyd film Number Please first........ 5 y..o. Dolly wants her nannyMildred to tell her a bedtime story. Mildred tells about when she was a girl about Dolly's age she met a boy named Harold and soon they realized they loved each other. But they were much too young to get married. Harold promised that he would return to her on her 18th birthday which is tomorrow. So she will take the train to her home so she will find out if he keeps his promise. Since Dolly's parents will be away tomorrow Mildred decides to honor Dolly's request that she accompany Mildred........The screen play doesn't make sense in some ways. For example Mildred meets Harold at the train station. So why would she as well as the others get on the train to her home Lloyd with no ticketno money. thus having to dodge the conductor? We wouldn't have much of a story if she had decided otherwise.......Evidently Lloyd is speeding in his car to meet Mildred. He races through a tiny town creating havoc then knocks the hay off a hay wagon part of which covers him so he can't see. He plows through a fence and barn then offers to pay for the damage. Only trouble is the man isn't the farmer. He's a hobo who takes his wallet and runs down the road. Lloyd runs after him ignoring his car. and eventually reaches the railroad where there is a waiting train. He finds the hobo sitting on the undercarriage of a car and joins him. After the train starts up he gets his wallet back and counts the money. While counting a blast of steam from a little pipe blows his money away so he is again penniless. He has a time riding the rails. When he gets into the station he spots a woman who reminds him of Mildred and finds that it is indeed her. But she's with a small child. Mildred tells him to look after Dolly while she tends to something. He sees her get on the train so when it pulls out he puts Dolly and himself on the train Dolly but not him having a ticket. Eventually they meet on the train. Mildred wants to stay away from Dolly because she discovered Dolly's father on the train and doesn't want him to know she brought Dooly without his permission. That means Lloyd will have to continue as Dolly's nursemaid until the father leaves. When it's time to go to sleep Dolly asks Lloyd to undress her and put her nightgown on. Luckily Mildred comes by to do this as Lloyd felt embarrassed to do such. Then Dolly wants him to sing her lullaby. He tries but Dolly and the other passengers soon want him to stop. Then she wants a glass of milk. Lloyd doesn't know where to get it. so he pulls the cord that stops the train. hops out and looks for a cow. He soon finds one and manages to get a little milk out in a cup. But  when he gets back amazingly the train is still there but Dolly is sound asleep.

	onyx:emotionText "A moderately funny Harold Lloyd silent short at 35 min.. I recommend seeing the Lloyd film Number Please first........ 5 y..o. Dolly wants her nannyMildred to tell her a bedtime story. Mildred tells about when she was a girl about Dolly's age she met a boy named Harold and soon they realized they loved each other. But they were much too young to get married. Harold promised that he would return to her on her 18th birthday which is tomorrow. So she will take the train to her home so she will find out if he keeps his promise. Since Dolly's parents will be away tomorrow Mildred decides to honor Dolly's request that she accompany Mildred........The screen play doesn't make sense in some ways. For example Mildred meets Harold at the train station. So why would she as well as the others get on the train to her home Lloyd with no ticketno money. thus having to dodge the conductor? We wouldn't have much of a story if she had decided otherwise.......Evidently Lloyd is speeding in his car to meet Mildred. He races through a tiny town creating havoc then knocks the hay off a hay wagon part of which covers him so he can't see. He plows through a fence and barn then offers to pay for the damage. Only trouble is the man isn't the farmer. He's a hobo who takes his wallet and runs down the road. Lloyd runs after him ignoring his car. and eventually reaches the railroad where there is a waiting train. He finds the hobo sitting on the undercarriage of a car and joins him. After the train starts up he gets his wallet back and counts the money. While counting a blast of steam from a little pipe blows his money away so he is again penniless. He has a time riding the rails. When he gets into the station he spots a woman who reminds him of Mildred and finds that it is indeed her. But she's with a small child. Mildred tells him to look after Dolly while she tends to something. He sees her get on the train so when it pulls out he puts Dolly and himself on the train Dolly but not him having a ticket. Eventually they meet on the train. Mildred wants to stay away from Dolly because she discovered Dolly's father on the train and doesn't want him to know she brought Dooly without his permission. That means Lloyd will have to continue as Dolly's nursemaid until the father leaves. When it's time to go to sleep Dolly asks Lloyd to undress her and put her nightgown on. Luckily Mildred comes by to do this as Lloyd felt embarrassed to do such. Then Dolly wants him to sing her lullaby. He tries but Dolly and the other passengers soon want him to stop. Then she wants a glass of milk. Lloyd doesn't know where to get it. so he pulls the cord that stops the train. hops out and looks for a cow. He soon finds one and manages to get a little milk out in a cup. But  when he gets back amazingly the train is still there but Dolly is sound asleep. Thus he gives the milk to a drunk who asks for a drink. Poison he mutters when he tastes it.......Lloyd's attempt to dress Dolly in the mourning is only partially successful. He winds up with an extra garment which he stuff's in his pocket. He needed help to get her dress on turning her upside down to do so! .......Remember that Lloyd has no ticket.

There's also a tramp who looks like the famous tramp. Lloyd's entry is a lot of action and hilarious stunts. He's going full out on the big action scenes. Once the gang boards the train they do get stymied by the interior comedy work. I would say that it's a half step below the great tramp. There is a comparison with Chaplin's The Kid. This one lacks the emotional connection compared to The Kid. It limits its full potential until he gets on top of the train for the grande finale. I can do without the blackface but that's comedy of its time. This is Lloyd growing into one of the greats of his era.".

Mind you Mark Jones who plays the tramp is also not lacking in appeal. We love the way he swaggers off with the money and his scene under the carriage with Lloyd is so well directed that we could certainly credit Fred Newmeyer's hand in this while producerco director Hal Roach presumably handled the somewhat flat introductory scenes with the rich dancing mother. Nonetheless for a tworeeler this one packs in enough fastpaced production values for the conventional five reels! Expertly titled by H.M.

As usual with Lloyd this is a comedy film as this is the genre where he is in his element the most when it comes to showing us his talent. Sadly like many other times too these early silent film lack in terms of storytelling and the result is that it never feels very realistic or authentic when it comes to how the characters act and behave. This is true here too and the consequence was that I cared little for any of the characters. And the story which takes place mostly on or even above a train is nothing too special either. This film has not aged very well and I am not speaking about the technical difficulties and lack of development. I give this one a thumbsdown even if Lloyd once again elevates the material by a lot.

Woody just laughs at them but not for long. The temperature drops from about 80 to 130 degrees below zero! Hey even the cartoon makes fun of that nonsense.Things get worse in a hurry as our obnoxious friend gets quickly humbled and winds up fighting it out with a cat  each wanting to cannibalize the other! Yeah the humor becomes dark. On a lighter note the village in this story is absolutely beautiful. This is colorful and very nice artwork.";

This is yet another winning cartoon in the series and one with several big laughs. The highlight would have to be an early scene where Woody is swimming and goes to jump in the water just as the winter storm hits and turns him into an ice cube. Another great sequences comes towards the end when a moose shows up as Woody and the cat are fighting. The way it ends is something that could only happen in a cartoon of this era.

	schema:reviewBody "Have you ever been so starving that you just felt like punching someone in the head? Well this particular Woody Woodpecker short may remind you a little of that! It's about Woody being a bit of a jerk and thinking that he doesn't need to bother heading south for the winter along with all the other more rational birds because he already has plenty of food stored up but the icy weather has a few things in store for the cocky Woodpecker and after he goes a little crazier than usual due to a little cabin fever and hunger pains after losing all his food an equally hungry and crazed cat shows up and the show turns into a mad battle to see who gets to eat who! Woody sure was asking for trouble in this one though he mocks his retreating neighbours he dares the cold weather to try and take his food he even laughs in the cigar smoking face of Death which is such an unbelievably hilarious and bizarre image! Starvation my foot that's totally the grim reaper with a palette swap! I suppose having the word death floating there may have been a bit much in an animated short aimed at forties children even though the elderly bird clearly says it out loud at the beginning.. As with most of the retro cartoon shorts that I've watched in one way or another over the years I love the colourful smaller details like the adorable tiny tree houses of the birds and the very impressive animation of when the blizzard sweeps on and instantly turns the sunny landscape into a winter wonderland and when Woody's battered around in the snowy clouds by the figures like a tennis racket and briefly turns into one! The whole short is a beautiful one everything is richly detailed and the action is very fluid nothing looks poorly done or clunky it's fun to watch and very easy on the eyes. This earlier version of Woody is much more fun and interesting than what they later made of him not to mention downright psychotic once he gets going! It's a very fun short but it does have some rather dark themes in it like Woody and the ugly Popeyevoiced cat's fight to cook and eat each other which is slapstick but violent and it's so macabre how they eat the poor hapless moose and all that's left of it is a pile of bones and its head stuck on a tree! And what an odd mistake neglecting to speed up Woody's voice like that at the end.. Just a neat little old cartoon that is very fun and satisfying to watch this is a good example of am old animation studio at the top of their game. Great stuff interesting funny inventive and pretty crazy! X".

Still get much enjoyment out of them now as a young adult even if there are more interesting in personality cartoon characters and better overall cartoons.That is in no way knocking Woody because many of his cartoons are a lot of fun to watch and more and also still like him a lot as a character. 'Pantry Panic' while not a Woody Woodpecker classic is still very entertaining yes even with some very corny and in a bit too silly a way puns even for cartoons puns and a fairly standard story. While there may be cartoon characters with slightly more interesting personalities Woody is still at his best incredibly funny never obnoxious and very lovable self summing him up in one word it would be wonderfully nuts. His personality traits are still evolving for example he is more vicious here in 'Pantry Panic' to usual and while a few are different others are unmistakably recognisable.For so early on the animation is great. Woody is much more appealingly designed even though still evolving while the colours are rich and vibrant and the backgrounds meticulous in their detail.Another standout quality is the music. It's characterful lushly orchestrated and is not only dynamic with the action it even enhances it. The writing is suitably witty and raises a number of chuckles while the never less than amusing and beautifully timed sight gags are even more impressive.Especially agreed the ones with the ice cube and the moose not to mention the ending. The cat is great support for Woody and in a way you root for both but you're shocked at the vicious but thankfully never overlysadistic that it'll make one uncomfortable lengths they go to against one another.Voice acting is good though Woody's original voice actor Mel Blanc only does his laugh here.In summary even with more of a vicious tone 'Pantry Panic' is still colourful and entertaining. 810 Bethany Cox".

Good luck to it!";

	schema:reviewBody "If Australian viewers will cast their minds back to the seventies they may remember The Paul Hogan Show a variety show in which Paul irreverently played the larrikin host. The twist was that he would make a grand entrance wearing tight fitting black shorts and a rugby top  a caricature of a footballer.In Strange Bedfellows almost thirty years later he cleverly parodies this costume by dressing up in close hugging spandex shorts and a black figure hugging tank top. Paul is probably having a good old chuckle at himself and we are too because there's generally lot of laughs to be had in this irreverent and funny but never offensive Australian film.This is the best film that Paul Hogan has made in years. He doesn't overplay it he's instantly amiable and most of all he's giving life to a character that fits him like a glove. But kudos should also be given to the talented Michael Caton who at times gently steals the movie from beneath Hogan's feet.Hogan plays Vince a theatre owner in the small Victorian country town of Yackandandah. Vince's wife has recently left him and now he's left with nothing apart from the singlebed he sleeps on in the projection booth. When he gets a letter from his exwife's accountant ordering he pay back years of back taxes he turns to his best friend Ralph Michael Caton the town mechanic for help.Vince has just read that the current government in a race for electoral votes is giving gay couples the same legal rights as married couples including a retrospective tax law that allows them to claim all the usual tax rebates for up to five years. Vince decides the best thing to do is become gay  at least on paper.Ralph is initially hesitant but once Vince explains to him that it's just form filling bureaucracy and that no one in the small town need ever know he decides to help his best friend out. Things seem to be going well until a letter arrives stating that a representative of the tax office is coming to visit in order to make sure Vince and Ralf really are a samesex couple.Vince and Ralf are forced to embark on a crash course in learning how to be gay. Enlisting the help of the local gay hairdresser Glynn Nicholas they learn how to place a hand on a penguin wax lyrical over a photograph of Liberace and call each other she and girl. They even take a trip to Sydney where they befriend a group of biker gays and drag queens.When the reserved and seemingly threatening tax inspector Pete Postlethwaite is sent to audit their claim Ralph and Vince must try and convince him that they are a loving homosexual couple in a small town who knows them as anything but. Adding to the shenanigans is Ralf's daughter Kestie Morassi who is coming up to stay from Melbourne she's devoted to Ralf and has a surprise in store for him.What makes Strange Bedfellows work so well is the amazing script that never condescends to either the urban gay community or the country people of Yackandandah. Judgment is never passed even though the rural folk might see the gays as weird while the gays might view the country people as homophobic. Stereotypes abound but the tone of the film is such that one cannot take any of them seriously.Paul Hogan as Vince seems to be having a great old time he's empathetic to the gay community and seems to be opening his heart to a segment of society that he knows nothing about while Michael Caton delivers a wonderfully warm character with enough complexity and selfcontradiction to be threedimensional.Detailed effectively paced Strange Bedfellows is crammed with characters you'll feel are old mates by the time the credits roll but best of all Strange Bedfellows is a terrific plea for tolerance and equality for the gay community along with a kind of homage to the age old Australian tradition of mateship.

It starts with a small lie... and then a slightly bigger lie to cover the first one and so on and so on. The secret is to make the underlying situation very serious. In this instance the threat isn't being outed to the township it's taxation fraud and the potential of being sent to jail that underpins the frantic farceurs.I watched the DVD of 'Strange Bedfellows' tonight with my partner and we both laughed like hyenas throughout. Even though most of the plot twists are obvious half the pleasure comes from predicting what's going to happen next and then seeing it actually happen as poor Vince and Ralph are plunged deeper into their charade. Michael Caton is brilliant and Paul Hogan shines too a few slightly wooden scenes notwithstanding. The rest of the cast allows anyone who's grown up with Aussie TV to play a quick game of Ooh isn't that...?The tax law reform which sets the plot in motion is very improbable  now moreso than when the film was made just last year  but it's clearly just a mcguffin to get the plot rolling and it's not worth slamming the film for it.Some people have been saying that the film is full of negative gay stereotypes since the only part of the film with real gays as opposed to Vince and Ralph's hilariously inept mincing is set in Oxford St Sydney on a Friday? night it's hardly surprising everyone's all frocked up for a night out. The important lesson here is that once Vince and Ralph sit and talk with them and get to know them the gay guys are just well guys. Which is pretty much the moral of the story. Strip away the glitter and the glam forget about who does what to whom in the bedroom  if you just stop and look people are all just people.I loved this  it's the Australian 'In And Out'.

	schema:reviewBody "Set in the heart of country Australia with a short journey to Sydney in the middle of the film Strange Bedfellows tells the story of two close friends Vince Hogan and Ralph Caton who cook up a plan to take advantage of a new law that gives tax breaks to Same Sex Couples. Trouble is Vince and Ralph are as totally straight and must 'camp it up' it order to convince the government's tax inspector Postlethwaite.The laughs come thick and fast as Vince and Ralph do what it takes to learn how to appear gay. The reaction of the locals and the great scenes set in a Sydney gay disco are only some of what makes this movie a winner. However the jokes even the outrageous ones are never at the expense of the gay community.This is the funniest movie Paul Hogan has starred in since the original 'Crocodile' Dundee. He and Caton are a wonderful double act supported beautifully by the rest of the cast including a manic band leader in the final scenes set against the back drop of some of Australia's most picturesque countryside. The ending works very well with all the loose ends twists and all being tied up.Paul Hogan was a TV star in Australia long before the world met 'Crocodile' Dundee. Michael Caton is also well known to Australian TV viewers with memorable parts on many shows from soap operas to comedy.".

	onyx:emotionText "Set in the heart of country Australia with a short journey to Sydney in the middle of the film Strange Bedfellows tells the story of two close friends Vince Hogan and Ralph Caton who cook up a plan to take advantage of a new law that gives tax breaks to Same Sex Couples. Trouble is Vince and Ralph are as totally straight and must 'camp it up' it order to convince the government's tax inspector Postlethwaite.The laughs come thick and fast as Vince and Ralph do what it takes to learn how to appear gay. The reaction of the locals and the great scenes set in a Sydney gay disco are only some of what makes this movie a winner. However the jokes even the outrageous ones are never at the expense of the gay community.This is the funniest movie Paul Hogan has starred in since the original 'Crocodile' Dundee. He and Caton are a wonderful double act supported beautifully by the rest of the cast including a manic band leader in the final scenes set against the back drop of some of Australia's most picturesque countryside. The ending works very well with all the loose ends twists and all being tied up.Paul Hogan was a TV star in Australia long before the world met 'Crocodile' Dundee. Michael Caton is also well known to Australian TV viewers with memorable parts on many shows from soap operas to comedy.";

I was very pleasantly surprised. There are certainly some moments when I almost cringed a little too more than you are supposed to as part of the comedy but in my view the blanket of warmth running through this film carried them off.The lead characters are backed up very well by some fine supporting performances. In particular I liked the parts played by the hairdresser and the straight 'pub' and gay 'club' mates.In terms of criticism I think the script could have been a bit stronger in places and in some parts you have to disable your cynicism sensors when looking at the leads' very oldfashioned notions of how they think they should act to blend in as 'gay people' but then I suppose this could fly on account of their country upbringinglack of exposure  no offence to country folk meant here.I would not quite rate this film as a classic in the sense that The Full Monty may have been but as with that movie I did feel quite a bit happier from the experience of watching it. If you are in the right mood for this film you will find it very enjoyable.".

Caton was great... he really brings to life Aussie characters and did a good job in this film.While the view of gay and lesbian culture may have been a bit skewed and over the top the film is meant as a comedy so I think it can get away with it because the whole notion of the film is fairly absurd so it just fits in with the tone of the film.So overall this film wasn't too bad.

Sure it's not great cinema it's a fun TV movie I feel and it does overly draw on stereotypes but it had some very enjoyable moments.I started to get fed up with the constant flow of stereotypes regarding gay men but then took into consideration that the characters were two smalltown Aussie blokes in their 50s who try to find out about how to act gay from the local hairdresser  a flaming whoopsie who is in fact a straight man pretending to be gay so he can safely score other men's wives  and gay porn sites. In short they don't have any real example of gay men to draw on. That's why their experiences in Sydney annoyed me because nearly everyone they met in the Sydney gay club was a drag queen or other highly theatrical femmy kind of gay person. I was hoping they would meet actual gay couples who were you know ordinary human beings. So that bit was disappointing. On the other hand aif those guys were visiting during Mardi Gras then it might not have been an exaggeration and b it was just an excuse to get Paul Hogan into skin tight foil bike shorts and hell he's still looking fairly reasonable! And c the fact their new friends were so ragingly stereotypically flamboyant ended up being necessary if the farcical events towards the end when the Sydney gays arrive for their local do further problematising their desire to stop pretending to be gaywere to work.The scenes in which Caton and Hoges practice being gay were priceless. Ditto the bit where they pretend to be a gay couple for the clearly perturbed assessor Pete Postlethwaite. Why? Because they're so terrible at it and so obviously uncomfortable.Just as it was still looking a bit offensive though came the heartwarming cheese. The scam can't be exposed while Pete Postlethwaite is there because they risk jail. They also don't want to upset their new gay friends whose support of their out life in smalltown Australia makes them feel so hypocritical. Caton's daughter has arrived with her new GIRLFRIEND in tow  cue the acceptance! And so Caton does a wonderful speech where without stating explicitly whether they're a couple or not he talks about acceptance and about how he loves Hoges. It's vastly better than what they did while being assessed and it also has a classic response from the other men of their generation in the town. I knew they weren't gay. Mateship is a wonderful thing. All in all this is no classic but it made me laugh quite a few times.".

How they go about convincing each other that they can pass as gay in order to convince the authorities and then how they can learn to act gay and live a gay life to back up their story is the action of the movie. Many stereotypes are included but somehow the Aussies know how to pull this off with minimal offense.The overall theme after the story is all said and done is one of tolerance and compassion for people who are in different societal climes. Hogan and Caton pull this off well showing how really everyone they meet in their charade is just a 'regular guy'  and for that reason the film becomes more tolerable than the usual farces that deal with 'passing'. Not a great movie but one with a wink! Grady Harp".

Hogan and Caton pull this off well showing how really everyone they meet in their charade is just a 'regular guy'  and for that reason the film becomes more tolerable than the usual farces that deal with 'passing'. Not a great movie but one with a wink! Grady Harp";

Well I spent the first three quarters feeling vaguely uncomfortable but in the last quarter the film kind of redeemed itself  kind of. It is as Paul Hogan points out in one of the many DVD Special Features neither pro or anti same gender partnerships. It was an unnecessary comment for him to make  but meant one assumes to reassure conservative Australians. I'm glad I saw this clip after I watched the film. I was not impressed. It's not a bad film  its heart is sort of in the right place  but it just feels so old hat. A missed opportunity to do something both fun and progressive. A shame really.".

Strange Bedfellows is symptomatic of what is currently ailing the Australian film industry at the moment. It is a small film has the feel of a film school assignment with underdone production values and a severely undercooked script. It's a raw still bloody and pulpy carrion of a script. The writer excuse me writers of this 'piece' would have done well to hire a professional to completely overhaul their basic concept paying special attention to the dialogue as well as ramping up the joke to minute ratio which was dire.The film is a throwback to the 1950's I have no problem with the use of stereotypes but those pressed into service for this film were retired elsewhere on this planet approximately 40 years ago. I suppose the film was about two elderly gents who were masquerading as homosexual lovers so their innocence could potentially have been genuine. But the stereotypes 'dug up' for this film lacked any form of comedic or creative interest. The lack of a creditable script and the uninspired use of stereotypes aside this film could have been worthwhile had it been ripsnortingly funny but alas it was found lacking it that department also.I have heard it before about a lot of Australian film and television product relating to the comedy genre. It is said by those in the industry that almost all Australian film and television comedies have one thing in common they're just not funny. Strange Bedfellows falls into that category it just isn't funny.....enough. There are admittedly a couple of funny happenings the opening sequence when the mailman spins around and throws the mail sack at a newsagents was mildly amusing. It was not a complete train wreck of an exercise although it was pretty close unlike a couple of other people I actually thought Paul Hogan was one of the few protagonists who looked comfortable in his role. Glynn Nicholas is also quite good as the towns hairdresser in fact as much as he could I thought he stole the film.As a long suffering Australian please in 2005 could we perhaps instead of making five halfbaked insipid quirky sleepers could we pool the funds and make one decent tearyoufromyourseat blockbuster.".

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't seen HOUSE OF CARDS in years but thanks to the many times I saw it on TBS and local channels in my youth I remember it like I saw it yesterday! During the 1960s Universal Pictures made a minigenre out of the Lighthearted International Technicolor Romantic Suspense Thriller with such rollicking adventures as CHARADE ARABESQUE and A MAN COULD GET KILLED. HOUSE OF CARDS was the loopiest of the lot from its opening sequence tracking shots of Paris from a corpse'seyeview there it is floating in the River Seine practically unnoticed by the populace...!  George Peppard plays a sort of hip '60s Hemingway type who drifts from one country to another writing his novel or boxing indeed when we first meet him he's getting the hell beaten out of him in a Paris boxing ring. One night he's shot atand discovers the triggerman is a frightened child hauntedeyed Barnaby Shaw is memorable here. Peppard drags the little sharpshooter home to his surprised mom played by the luminous Inger Stevens with a vulnerable sophistication reminiscent of Eva Marie Saint in NORTH BY NORTHWEST. Turns out the glamorous but troubled Stevens is the American widow of a French general she and her son are virtual prisoners of her sinister inlaws and their cohorts including secretive psychiatrist Keith Michell.  Stevens takes a shine to Peppard guess his iconoclastic loner routine is a welcome change of pace from the Daphne DuMaurier types slinking around the family chateau and hires him as Shaw's tutorcompanion.  Soon we're catapulted from DuMaurier Land to Robert Ludlumville as the chateau's occupants turn out to be part of a Fascist group led by Orson Welles.  Seems that Papa wanted his little man to be brought up as a Hitler youth. Before you can say Hitchcock the kid's kidnapped Peppard's framed for murder and he and Stevens are chasing and being chased all over Paris and Rome trying to save Shaw and the world from these dastardly soandso's. While some of the plot twists stretch credibility to the breaking point especially Michell's true identity and some of the more attentiongrabbing stuff is never explained HOUSE OF CARDS still manages to be entertaining despite Francis Lai's wussy score thanks mostly to the appealing leads. Peppard in his prime was wellcast as a cynical rogue with his allAmerican good looks hardboiled flippancy and breezy charm. He cracked me up whenever he improvised outlandish excuses to authority figures like in the Fountain of Trevi scene. Platinumblonde Stevens was an excellent match for Peppard both physically and personalitywise with screen presence aplenty.  It's not just her striking slightly unconventional beauty and her honeyed alto voice Stevens also had a warmth that belied her Nordic Ice Maiden looks and a knack for being at once worldly and wholesome this quality is reflected in her fab Edith Head costumes too.  This wildly complex thriller probably shouldn't be watched by anyone with a migraine or a short attention span  but if you're in the mood for a wellcast conspiracy yarn that doesn't take itself too seriously keep an eye out for HOUSE OF CARDS in your TV movie listings!".

Inger Stevens is very glamorous as the lady of the house with her problems and secrets. The Paris setting is very well used and that's important because the movie has a unique premise. The villains are pied noir terrorists left over from the Algerian revolution displaced from their colonial home reactionary and deeply opposed to the French government of that appeaser DeGaulle. It gives a certain reality to the mysterious goings on. I thought the film did full justice to the novel except that they unavoidably dispensed with the novel's use of Tarot cards to organize the chapters thematically. The music is great too. There's a title song in French that I'd love to have a recording of. It's sad to see Stevens looking so lovely and giving such a good performance so close to her tragic reallife suicide. She was special and there's great chemistry between her and Peppard.".

Unfortunately he doesn't quite make the grade in House of Cards despite the wonderful assistance of Francis Lai's music score and Piero Portalupi's attractively moody color cinematography. Mind you there is also a marvelous opening in Paris with a corpse's eyeview of the Ile de la Cit from the Seine plus a splendid climax in Rome with a fighttothedeath in the musty corridors of the Coliseum. And there are some marvelous sequences in between these two high points. But what principally drags the movie down to a less exalted level is a screenplay that is not only far too talky but that fails to generate a great deal of suspense. For one thing the villains are presented in far too gentlemanly a guise. In itself this would be a commendable innovation but it should have been bolstered by atmospheric touches. These the direction lacks. Instead Guillermin has chosen a more straightforward approach to the narrative presumably to endow it with a more realistic air but this approach only succeeds when it is enhanced by effects such as the water lapping on the shore of the Villa Frascati. Another fault lies in the casting of Inger Stevens in a key role. Unfortunately she is unable to elicit much in the way of sympathy or interest in her characterization. The other players score much better. Incidentally the script leaves a lot unexplained e.g. why is an attempt made on Paul's life?".

	schema:headline " House of Cards";
	schema:reviewBody "House of Cards has a preposterous plot which is total cornball. IMDb's summary says it all In 1960s Paris an American boxer stumbles upon an international fascist conspiracy that aims to create a new world order. Needless to say the French conspirators are too small in number to take over France let alone recolonize Algeria and build the new world order. In fact these villains are such amateurs that the extent of their talents are to accumulate an impressive arsenal of muskets in the basement drink champagne and talk nostalgically about keeping out black and yellow hordes and kidnap a poor little aristocratic boy and his depressed mother Anne de Villemont Inger Stevens. Little wonder that it only took a troublemaker Reno Davis George Peppard who spent his formative years pulling fire alarms at school to defeat the whole lot of them. Yet on the level of seeing troublemaking George Peppard poke fun at the members of the French aristocracy and outsmart them this film does actually work. Peppard is like that unruly school boy who irritates his teachers pulls fire alarms to avoid taking exams he has not studied for gets into fights during recess time and can talk himself out of any problem. When Peppard is unleashed against a bunch of amateurish Fascists at a dinner party then a fortress and finally a farm House of Cards is very entertaining. Peppard's character also has a heart of gold which is barely concealed beneath his alphamale persona. He seems to be even more repelled by violence than James Bond and only kills one villain in the entire movie. He is charming to at least three women but ultimately has eyes for only the aristocrat Anne de Villemont. This is an American James Bond who one could imagine settling down and starting a family. Unfortunately toward the end the cornball plot starts to take over and we are treated to a climax with the key villain Leschenhaut Orson Welles which does not really work. On balance though I recommend this movie largely because it's actually a lot of fun watching Peppard mingle with the French aristocracy flout their conventions and outthink them as well as go from rags to riches through his sheer personality.".

I would put it in the vein of other great EuroGoth gems like Terror Creatures From the Grave and The Blancheville Monster. Plus the immortal Christopher Lee adds plenty to the picture as he always tends to do. But like many of the other fans of this picture I would have loved to have seen Lee chew the scenery with genre queen Barbara Steele as this is the type of film that was right up her alley.Like so many other Gothic efforts the story revolves around a generationsold family curse. Christopher Lee's character is a Count who fears that a witch's curse is starting to come to fruition as members of his extended family are dying one by one. A great cast of characters makes this story even more interesting. There's Laura the Count's daughter and prime suspect in carrying out the witch's hex during her nightmarewrought sleep. There is Laura's sultry friend Lyuba I must note that the two starlets have great chemistry together and always look like they are on the verge of releasing years of bottled up sexual frustration on each other. A wise old crone who tries to help Laura decipher her nightmares. And there is a young historian who is brought in to try and find out as much of the family's dark history as he can in an effort to thwart the curse.Terror in the Crypt recently released as Crypt of the Vampire is definitely worth the time and money for any fan of EuroGoth films or even just for those wanting to get a glimpse at Christopher Lee's Italian ventures.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many of my fellow Eurohorror enthusiasts seem to have been disappointed by Camillo Mastrocinque's La Cripta e l'incubo aka. Crypt of the Vampire of 1964. For understandable reasons as the film which stars Horror icon Christopher Lee certainly doesn't range among the most memorable efforts in Italian Gothic Horror from the 1960s. Fact is however that this country time and subgenre stands for many of the greatest Horror films ever brought to screen and even many of the lesser productions such as this film are entertaining films as such. This is one of only two Horror films by director Mastrocinque the other being the vastly superior Un Angelo Per Satana of 1966 starring GenreGoddess Barbara Steele my favorite actress. This Crypt of the Vampire very obviously borrowed many storyelements from another Italian Gothic Horror film Mario Bava's unequaled masterpiece La Maschera Del Demonio aka. Black Sunday of 1960 probably my choice for the greatest Horror film of alltime and of course it also stars Barbara Steele. It can in no way compete with Bava's masterpiece of course nor with the many other Italian Gothic highlights from the day be it Bava's Antoino Margheriti's or Riccardo Freda's films of even with Mastrocinque's own Angelo Per Satana. Yet Crypt of the Vampire has many qualities. One has to give it to director Mastrocinque that he was capable of creating an uncanny atmosphere in spite of an obviously low budget. Again he did so more impressively in Un Angelo Per Satana but one has to admit that this film is also highly atmospheric.Count Karnstein Christopher Lee has sent for a doctor to help his daughter Laura Adriana Ambesi. The young lady Karnstein has been tormented by terrible nightmares and it is believed that she is possessed by the evil spirit of a dead ancestor... The film's major weakness is that it is too slowgoing especially in the first half. It is always atmospheric though and the film really catches up in the second half and gets quite creepy in some parts. Also there are some nicely demented characters such as a disfigured beggar. As it was the case with a truly brilliant Gothic film from the same year Antonio Margheriti's Danza Macabra aka. Castle of Blood this film has a certain lesbian subtext. The female cast in this film are beautiful but not comparable to Barbara Steele I can't stop praising her and Margarete Robsahm who stunned viewers in Danza Macabra. Also while the implied lesbianism is a nicely exploitative element in this film the explicit stuff that became common practice in Exploitation cinema only a few years later in the late 60s makes it look very harmless. Even so it is a fun element of the film. More screen time for the great Christopher Lee would certainly have helped the film. The female cast members are entirely hot but none of them is extremely talented. As said the film's strong point lies in the atmosphere. Overall Crypt of the Vampire is by no means a mustsee or even a very good film. However I personally enjoyed it and I think that many of my fellow fans of Italian 60s Gothic Horror might see it the same way.".

	onyx:emotionText "Many of my fellow Eurohorror enthusiasts seem to have been disappointed by Camillo Mastrocinque's La Cripta e l'incubo aka. Crypt of the Vampire of 1964. For understandable reasons as the film which stars Horror icon Christopher Lee certainly doesn't range among the most memorable efforts in Italian Gothic Horror from the 1960s. Fact is however that this country time and subgenre stands for many of the greatest Horror films ever brought to screen and even many of the lesser productions such as this film are entertaining films as such. This is one of only two Horror films by director Mastrocinque the other being the vastly superior Un Angelo Per Satana of 1966 starring GenreGoddess Barbara Steele my favorite actress. This Crypt of the Vampire very obviously borrowed many storyelements from another Italian Gothic Horror film Mario Bava's unequaled masterpiece La Maschera Del Demonio aka. Black Sunday of 1960 probably my choice for the greatest Horror film of alltime and of course it also stars Barbara Steele. It can in no way compete with Bava's masterpiece of course nor with the many other Italian Gothic highlights from the day be it Bava's Antoino Margheriti's or Riccardo Freda's films of even with Mastrocinque's own Angelo Per Satana. Yet Crypt of the Vampire has many qualities. One has to give it to director Mastrocinque that he was capable of creating an uncanny atmosphere in spite of an obviously low budget. Again he did so more impressively in Un Angelo Per Satana but one has to admit that this film is also highly atmospheric.Count Karnstein Christopher Lee has sent for a doctor to help his daughter Laura Adriana Ambesi. The young lady Karnstein has been tormented by terrible nightmares and it is believed that she is possessed by the evil spirit of a dead ancestor... The film's major weakness is that it is too slowgoing especially in the first half. It is always atmospheric though and the film really catches up in the second half and gets quite creepy in some parts. Also there are some nicely demented characters such as a disfigured beggar.

Adding to the writing credits is the fact that the film stars the great Christopher Lee but unfortunately the pacing is far too slow and the film is more 'Castle of the Living Dead' than 'Black Sunday'. Anyone that has seen one of the numerous films based on the La Fanu novel will probably know what this film will be about. Count Karnstein comes to believe that his daughter Laura has become possessed by the spirit of the dead ancestor Carmilla and sends for a doctor to help her. However this does not stop the daughter from being influenced by Carmilla. The film does well on the atmosphere front and director Camillo Mastrocinque delivers a great setting for the film to take place in with a lavish Gothic castle. However there's just not enough going on to keep the film interesting for the duration and unfortunately despite the positives the film is not very easy to follow for this reason. Perhaps fans of Gothic horror will find something to like here but while I consider myself just that unfortunately I didn't.".

	schema:reviewBody "Crypt of Horror appears to be one of those films from the early 60s that has been cut recut and released under almost a dozen titles. To me it's a shame that this movie has been treated this way over the years because I found it to be a fairly effective EuroGothic treat. The plot deals with Count Karnstein and his fear that his daughter may be the reincarnation of a relative put to death decades earlier for being a witch. Regardless of whether the daughter is a witch or not members of the Karnstein family are dying rather cruel deaths. The Count must discover the truth to the witch's curse and put a stop to the deaths before the Karnstein family looses another member.If you are into Gothic horror there's plenty here to enjoy. Crypt of Horror exudes that Gothic atmosphere and plays a bit like cross between Black Sunday and Castle of Blood. No I'm not saying it's as good as either of these films. I described it to a friend as the best Barbara Steele movie that Barbara Steele never made. A wonderfully creepy castle with miles of secret passages dreams of dead relatives that become reality women in flowing white gowns wandering through the night rituals designed to raise the dead and a hint of lesbianism are the highlights of the movie. Add to that the presence of Christopher Lee even if he has very little to do and you've got the basics of a good movie.But given my rating 610 it's obvious I had some problems with Crypt of Horror. Whether it's the result of editing poor dubbing or an incoherent script there are problems with the plot. There are far too many things that happen that make little sense or seem to have no bearing on anything else going on. Take the housekeeper and her continued attempts to bring the spirit of the dead witch back to life. Sure the witch is pivotal to the plot but why is she trying to summon the witch? What is her motivation? At least in my copy of the movie it's never explained. There are other examples of where the plot gets muddled but you get the idea.".

	schema:reviewBody "Everyone knows how wonderful the great Christopher Lee can be at playing the monstous heavynot for nothing is he known to his fans as Mr. Tall Dark and Gruesome!but many forget that he can be equally adept at portraying the good guy. Thus fans are often pleasantly taken aback when they see the 1968 Hammer film The Devil Rides Out for the first time in which Lee plays the Duc de Richleau a combater of Satanists in 1920s England though this film is weak tea compared to Dennis Wheatley's 1934 source novel. For further proof of Lee's ability to portray a defender of right and light viewers may be interested to seek out Camillo Mastrocinque's Italian Gothic horror film Crypt of the Vampire 1964 which can also be seen under the title Terror in the Crypt a superior appellation I feel as the vampiric elements in the film are very minor. In this picture Lee plays the Count Ludwig Karnstein who fears that his daughter Laura Adriana Ambesi has become possessed by a witch who was put to death by his ancestors 200 years previously and who had sworn to return to take vengeance on the family's descendants. Following the advice of his young blonde mistress Annette Vera Valmont the count hires a young expert on antiquarian matters Friedrich Klauss Jose Campos to learn more about this deceased witch and hopefully unearth a portrait of her. Laura has been suffering strange visions of late and having eerie dreams and it really does seem as if the poor gal has become possessed. Her lot brightens however when a carriage breaks down near the Karnstein castle and the beautiful Ljuba Ursula Davis becomes a guest in the ancient pile for a few days....If this story line sounds at all familiar it can be revealed here that yes this IS yet another reworking of the oftfilmed Sheridan Le Fanu novelette of 1872 Carmilla I might also add that it is not nearly as effective a filmization as Spanish director Vicente Aranda's The Blood Spattered Bride 1969 a film that I just love. Still Crypt of the Vampire is darn good enough although its debt to Mario Bava's seminal Black Sunday made four years earlier is fairly apparent and never more so than in that 17th century witchslaying sequence. Crypt also shares similarities with another Italian Gothic that I had recently watched 1963's The Blancheville Monster. Both were filmed in BW feature ancient family curses showcase some impressively moldering realistically UNDERadorned castles and decrepit tombs highlight some surrealistic dreams suffered by the leading lady sport a trio of young starlets and surprise the viewer with twist endings. And both unfortunately suffer from a sluggish middle third and an ending that can only be described as weak Crypt drags even further when Lee is not on the screen. But when he IS present the picture is galvanized thank goodness for his always welcome presence and that great mellifluous voice of his which has survived the dubbing process here. Lee's star power gives this film automatically an extra uh star. I must also add that some scenes in the film do not make 100 sense when considered in the light of that twist ending and that the characters of Klauss and Laura seem miscast. Jose Campos a young Bill Bixby type seems a bit too boyish for the role someone on the hunky order of Giacomo Rossi Stuart would have been preferable check him out in Bava's great film from 1966 Kill Baby Kill to see what I mean. And Adriana Ambesi you'll forgive me for saying sois almost too homely to portray Laura she looks like a cross between Barbra Streisand's plain Jane sister and the social misfit Catherine Sloper that Olivia de Havilland brilliantly portrayed in 1949's The Heiress. Surely Italian cinema has never lacked for lovely starlets any of them might have been preferable.Anyway the good news is that Crypt does boast a number of very welldone scenes including the discovery of a hanged hunchback with his hand cut off and the subsequent use of that hand as a candelabra in a Satanic ceremony as well as the final sequence in which Count Karnstein  Co. explore the ancient witch's tomb. The film is never without interest even during its slower stretches and I suppose is required viewing for all fans of Christopher Lee or Italian Gothic horror. The DVD that it comes to us on from RetroMedia sports a decentlooking print but is completely devoid of extras not even the customary chapter stops! Note to some aspiring outfit Howzabout a loving restoration and presentation of THIS relatively obscure instance of 1960s Eurohorror?!?!".

I hope that better copies are available if you do decide to see itthere was a loud hum throughout the film as well.";

	schema:reviewBody "One thing I could immediately appreciate about Crypt of the Vampire were the masterfully atmospheric opening sequences of a young girl wandering around the woods by herself at night and approaching an eerie and seemingly abandoned carriage. She spots something dies instantly and we the viewers only witness the door of the coach slowly closing again. This was a wondrous moodsetter for an obscure and late 60's European horror gem with the inexhaustible Christopher Lee and directed by a random Italian dude who wanted to be as successful as Mario Bava Black Sunday or Antonio Margheriti The Virgin of Nuremberg. The heavenly beautiful Laura Karnstein daughter of the honorable Count Ludwig played by Lee witnesses the aforementioned opening sequence in a dream. Since she suffers from this kind of nightmares quite regularly her concerned father seeks the help of the acclaimed Friedrich Klauss who professionally restores manuscripts. Hopefully he can find a link between Laura and a notorious ancestor of the Karnsteins a countess who reputedly kidnapped and killed young girls for the purpose of witchcraft. Is Laura really the reincarnation of her wicked ancestor like the family curse states or is the Count's young mistress Annette simply trying to drive the righteous heiress towards insanity? Crypt of the Vampire nearly isn't on par with some other contemporary European Gothic horror movies but it's nevertheless a compelling and definitely worthwhile film. The script is full of obvious and slightly less obvious twists and occasionally even dares to touch certain taboo subjects like subtle hints towards lesbianism. The Karnstein Castle is always shown from the same perspective from beneath a hillside but the interior filming locations are nice and gloomy. All the obligatory gothhorror elements are well represented including thunderstorms spontaneously dying candles secret passageways hidden vaults etc. There are also a handful of uniquely grisly and genuinely horrific images in the film like the sight of a hunchback hanging dead from a chiming church bell a corpse emerging from a coffin and pointing out who murdered her and voodoo practicing housemaids. Christopher Lee doesn't exactly give away his greatest performance ever but even as a mediocre player he's still worth admiring. Luckily in this case he also receives excellent support from the ravishing female cast members Adriana Ambesi and Vra Valmont.".

This one is similar in tone to VIVA LAS VEGAS because female lead Prowse is an independent woman and not a typical Elvis groupie. That's why I like it all the more. She is never in my opinion actually 'refrigerated' even when she turns down a pass from Elvis she's not so much rude as she is firm in her convictions.

Her introduction in the film which shows a spinning cardboard cutout in a marquee window turn into the actual Prowse in a strapless white shredded dress is breathtaking!!".

	schema:headline " Jump Starting The Career of The King Again";
	schema:reviewBody "GI Blues was Elvis Presley's fifth picture and first one since his return from the Army as America's most celebrated draftee of the Fifties. It also marked his first film with director Norman Taurog who did nine films with the King.Taurog like so many in Hollywood in front of and behind the camera was getting less and less employment and taking what he could get. These were the kind of people that Elvis's manager Colonel Tom Parker made sure helped his meal ticket in any way possible. Norman Taurog won an Oscar in 1931 for Skippy and was nominated for his direction of Boys Town in 1938 which won Spencer Tracy an Oscar. Over the years Taurog directed such musical performers as Bing Crosby Dean Martin Mario Lanza Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds. This man was most assuredly a help to the King's career and I've no doubt Parker was behind getting him. Parker is a controversial figure especially among Elvis's legion of fans as to whether he helped or hindered Elvis's career. He might have done a little of both but one thing the man was always sure of is that in Presley's movies he made sure that he got the best support in front and behind the camera. Norman Taurog extended his own career via the King. Everybody made out here.The Colonel also was a master at keeping the publicity going while Elvis was a 78.00 a month GI serving in Germany. So much so there was a tremendous about of advance publicity about this film which was about a young rock and rolling soldier who finds love in Frankfurt.Elvis gets hooked into a Guys and Dolls type bet that he can't spend the night in Juliet Prowse's apartment. Prowse is a local entertainer at one of the clubs in Frankfurt and she's got a reputation as one cold lady. But you know she ain't got a chance with the king.Part of the publicity surrounding this film was Juliet Prowse's relationship with another guy she did a film with that year Frank Sinatra. She and Sinatra were quite the item and they announced their engagement and then broke it off just as quickly. Juliet was quite the dancer both in GI Blues and in CanCan. I remember all of this quite well as a lad. And it was always a special treat in Elvis films when he got a female costar who was also musical like AnnMargret Nancy Sinatra or Juliet Prowse.Elvis had a bunch of songs in the film including his own Blue Suede Shoes playing on a jukebox during a bar brawl. One song I really liked was Pocketful of Rainbows which he sings to Juliet while riding in a cable car. It should have been a bigger hit for him.GI Blues was a fine jump start for Elvis's return to the big screen and to his loyal legion of fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was Elvis' first movie after his Army release the 1st Medium Tank Battalion 32nd Armored was Presley's regiment when he was in the Army with the 3rd Armored Division in Germany so it was used for the film the soundtrack album went to No. 1 on Billboard and spent over two years 111 weeks on the Billboard charts. This a very good Elvis movie in my opinion. It has a lot of music hence the trio excuse good humor good acting and excellent scenery of sections of Germany. He shows some funny little moves when he is singing. Little mannerisms like stopping his leg shake or funny facial expressions. His character starts reluctantly trying to romance a cabaret dancer Lili played by Juliet Prowse to win a bet so that his trio can open a night club when they get out. It starts to turn serious and Elvis does what most GI's wouldn't he backs out of the bet. Robert Ivers plays Cookie the second member of the trio a stereotypical American serviceman out for seemingly one thing take a guess what. James Douglas is Rick the third member of the trio he is looking for his lost love Marla. He finds where she lives with their baby that he doesn't know about he is told she has moved. They don't show how but Rick ends up with Marla delirious about the fact he is a father. He gets Elvis's to baby sit while the pair run out to get married after telling him the baby will sleep like a baby. If you have ever had a kids you know how that works out!! Using the crying baby to get a panicked Elvis and Juliet back together again is a cute way to accomplish what any one watching the movie would realize was going to happen. Scheming Cookie trying to win the bet takes the roommate Tina a girl he is trying to ???? out on the town so they other two are left alone as per the bet. Of course Lili finds out about the bet and things get tense for awhile between the two of them. Then things get cleared up the trio gets it break by going on the Armed Forces Network. As usual in this type of film everything turns out well for every one. Tulsa Elvis and Lili get married Rick and Marla too. Cookie can't scheme his way out of love. So all's well that ends happily.".

He takes part in a rather despicable bet as he claims he can defrost a sultry dancer Juliet Prowse. He succeeds in charming her but to his own surprise also falls for her.Well the story's simple  but it sets the stage for some truly entertaining Presley songs and some knockout dancing by the charming Juliet Prowse who also gives a good performance. The film is energetically made and the usual Presley poss is fairly likable here.There's no denying the fact that the defrost bet is very tasteless but Elvis's character sidesteps it quite nicely. Here Elvis plays basically the same character as in his subsequent films a mischievous lad wholly independent with a surprisingly strong moral sense and prone to landing in at least one bar fight. But this is the first lighthearted Presley flick and he looks like he's enjoying himself and the songs really are top notch. Tonight is so right for love and Shopping Around are among many highlights here and it's very funny to see a guy in a bar pick Blue Suede Shoes on the jukebox by some rocker named Elvis Presley and that lands him in a fight with...well Elvis.Although G.I. Blues laid the groundwork for some inferior films to come it's a very pleasant film and comes recommended to more than just hardcore Presley fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Those of us who're into Elvis' music and other parts of his considerable musical and cultural legacy should probably hate this movie.  After all it was the first symptom that something fundamental had changed in Elvis' career after his two years in the US Army.  This film obviously inspired by recent events in Elvis' life gives us a sanitized King who's familyfriendly and anything but the threat to society's moral fabric that he was perceived as being a few short years before.  At 25 Elvis was now vetted as suitable for family consumption.  Not that that's a bad thing. The March 1960 recordings that produced some of Elvis' biggest hits Are You Lonesome Tonight and the phenomenallysuccessful It's Now Or Never among them featured some of the best material that he'd ever recorded but generally confirmed a shift  or perhaps really a broadening  in focus. Maybe the two years in the Army and his first real exposure to the world beyond his own country had matured him especially given that he'd suffered through the loss of his mother during that time.Still the version of Elvis that GI Blues presented went a step further than just maturity.  If it'd been a oneoff deal there'd have been no problem  the problem was that they kept trying to remake the film as Elvis himself complained.  And the problem with THAT when you come down to it is that the man was capable of much much more.  Certainly he was able to act more effectively than we'd see in later properties like Clambake and Double Trouble.  The two films that followed this one the great Flaming Star and Wild In The Country ably proved that.  Then along came the boxoffice smash Blue Hawaii giving Elvis his biggest film receipts since GI Blues and cementing to a great extent his Hollywood future.  As if the loss of a potentially great and certainly charismatic acting talent weren't enough the focus on the bottom line led inexorably to weaker and weaker soundtracks.  It didn't take long before Elvis was with a few exceptions turning out substandard recordings that would eclipse in volume and sales the stillgreat studio work that he too seldom did during the '60s.  As catchy as I find some of these movie songs and despite the redeeming qualities to be found in many the sad fact is that most of what he recorded for the movies was far far below what he was capable of even on a bad day.  Take the movies but leave the man his music.  That is the real tragedy of Elvis' movie career I think and the reason why we should cringe at the thought of GI Blues the movie that started it all.But I can't do that.  I really can't hate such a goodnatured film.  Even this early in his '60s formulamovie days the music is watereddown to a great extent but most of the songs are still of high quality and some are exceedingly catchy or well done e.g. the title song the beautiful Doin' The Best I Can Shoppin' Around and even the sometimesmaligned Wooden Heart.  The soundtrack sold like hotcakes  over two years on the US charts!  and the movie did huge business.  Yes indeed Elvis was back! It's not the movie's fault that it became a turning point and one with ultimately dire consequences.  Elvis' performances is as befits the material not as gritty or edgy as that of his previous role in 1958's classic King Creole and this is more a straight musicalcomedy of the kind that'd sustained Hollywood for decades.  There are a few twists though such as the acceptance of one of Elvis' bandmates having fathered a child out of wedlock and Elvis gets to show off his comic skills to great advantage in several scenes including those that center upon that baby 'Tiger.'  Actually it's the scenes with 'Tiger' that I always remembered above all else from when I first saw this movie back in the '70s.  I like some of the things that indicate a selfawareness in the movie  Elvis' line at the movie's end delivered to the camera is most obvious but the whole Blue Suede Shoes jukebox scenario's pretty funny and Elvis makes two references to All Shook Up during the narrative.  Elvis does get to flash a couple of looks of anger and even arrogant confidence across his face a couple of times  he was utterly convincing just with a look at portraying such emotions  but for the most part he's a fairly happygolucky sort in this film.  He radiates charm throughout echoing the sentiments of his Love Me Tender costar Richard Egan  That boy can charm the birds right out of the trees.  Elvis' male and female costars all do a competent job throughout and someone evidently thought enough of Juliet Prowse's longlegged dancing routines to include two of them in the film.The producers shot scenes while Elvis was still in Germany but used a double for his longshots.  All of the German scenes that we see are either projected behind the principals or are scenes shot on location with other people while Elvis was still over there finishing his tour of duty.  They obviously put a lot of thought into storyboarding the film and getting costumes and everything else sorted out so that location shots would match soundstage scenes. This was not a quick and nasty 'quickie' film  that would come later beginning with the filming of Kissin' Cousins in 1963.GI Blues  it's a nice entertaining movie so it does its job.  No heavy themes or messages just the kind of thing that lets you spend a little time in the land of escapist lightweight boymeetsgirl stories.  It has its place.  It's just a pity that its place turned out to be right at the pivot point in the career of the most exceptional vocal and stage performer of the century.".

This tailormade film set the standard for the successful ELVIS movie. Presley spent the 1960s swinging and singing through Top Ten box office and record charts. G.I Blues propelled Elvis back into Quigley Publications Box Office ten most profitable movie stars where he stayed through 1966. The RCA soundtrack went platinum and was 1 for ten of its amazing 111 weeks on the LP chart. RCA planned no 45 RPM singles which helped album sales but Wooden Heart and G.I. Blues became hits anyway.Unfortunately the musical's trendsetting success overshadowed Presley's superior studio recordings from the time listen to Elvis Is Back!. Also note the rerecording of Blue Suede Shoes is a pale imitation of the 1956 original. So a creative cancer was being forged. But it's not fair to fault G.I. Blues for the sight and sound of Elvis Presley singing Old MacDonald Had a Farm in Double Trouble 1967. And although everyone including Presley longed for him to be a great dramatic actor he shows up in G.I. Blues as a charming and natural light performer.

He makes a bet with some older soldiers that he can take out a dancer Juliet Prowse but soon he starts to have feelings for the woman and wants out of the bet. Elvis' comeback film is a pretty good one even though there are still a few weak moments. For the most part the film is charming enough to keep itself going from start to finish even though the thing runs a tad bit too long. Elvis must have been very comfortable in the role of a G.I. because I've never seen him as relaxed in a role. He actually does a pretty good job here and comes off very natural and gets to show off some of his sense of humor. It goes without saying that this film wanted to cash in on The King's military career and for the most part they nail him in the role. The supporting players are equally impressive and add a lot as well. Prowse is very sexy in her role and manages a good performance. The film stealers for me were Robert Ivers and Leticia Roman as the sidekicks. Ivers has a great comic timing and makes for several funny sequences. The music numbers here are all rather hit and miss with none of them what I'd call classic Elvis. I thought the use of Presley's Blue Suede Shoes was a nice touch as was the sequence with Elvis trying to babysit. The film is certainly lightweight and predictable but it does have enough charm to make it worth watching and I'm sure the girls in 1960 were passing out at the site of Elvis in the shower.".

This was his sixth outing with director Norman Taurog the most prolific of Elvis's directors with nine films films to his credit. The Germany scenery is nice. Donovan's Reef writer Edmund Beloin and A Visit to a Small Planet scribe Henry Garson drum up some good dialogue in this lightweight but entertaining romantic comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "G.I. Blueswas the first film Elvis Presley made after his release from the army in 1960 and appropriately has an army theme. Elvis here plays Specialist Tulsa McLean a tank crewman serving with the U.S. ArmyinWest Germany. In some ways this film looks forward to the sort of musical comedies which Elvis was to make later in the sixties. Many of these had an exotic setting and seemed to function as travelogues as well as musicals. What Elvis was later to do for Hawaii in Blue Hawaii for Mexico in Fun in Acapulco and for Nevada in Viva Las Vegas! he does here for Germany. In 1960 Americans were no doubt used to films about Nazi Germany but the country we see here is not the defeated enemy of fifteen years earlier but America's new democratic ally shown as an idealised land of old timbered houses romantic vistas of the Rhine foaming mugs of lager and pretty Frauleins in dirndl skirts. No doubt the German Tourist Board was suitably grateful. Like most characters played by Elvis Tulsa is a keen singerandhis great ambition is to run his own nightclub when he leaves the army. In order to obtain some of the money needed for this venture he accepts a bet that he can spend the night with a local nightclub dancer named Lili. Lili has a reputation for being hard to get but Tulsa like most characters played by Elvis turns out to be irresistible to women and it is not long before romance startsto blossom. There are also subplots about romances involving two of Tulsa's buddies one Cookie with Lili's Italian flatmate Tina and another Rick with a local girl named Marla. Rather unusually for a lighthearted musical comedy from this period Marla is an unmarried mother when Production Code Hollywood dealt with the subject of unmarried motherhood it generally did so in the context of some deeply serious moralising movie. G.I. Blues was a success at the box office but Presley' s film career seemed to be going in a different direction when he followed it up with two more serious filmsFlaming StarandWild in the Country in both of which he concentrated more on acting and less on music. Neither however was as successful at the box office as G.I. Blues which in many ways serves as a template for the pretty girls and pretty scenery type of musical comedies which were to provide Elvis with his comfort zone during the rest of his cinema career from Blue Hawaii onwards. The main difference is that G.I. Blues musically speaking relies rather more on rock music and rather less on than the easylistening style than do the likes of Blue Hawaii and Frankie and Johnny. The film's bestknown number however is Wooden Heart derived from a German folksong. Elvis's leading lady here the glamorous leggy Juliet Prowse makes more of an impact than do some of her rather anonymous successors and her role as a nightclub dancer gives her a chance to show off her own dancing skills. Interestingly this is one of the few films to play games with the normal convention that except when making cameo appearances as themselves film stars are not referred to in the films in which they appear. While performing in a bar Tulsa discovers a record called Blue Suede Shoes sung by one Elvis Presley on the jukebox. I wonder who he was. Other examples of this sort of game include His Girl Friday in which Cary Grant makes a quip about his costar Ralph Bellamy and Ocean's Twelve in which one character's physical resemblance to Julia Roberts is an important plot point. Roberts of course plays the character herself. The banal plot underdeveloped characterisation and lack of any great acting performances mean that G.I. Blues is unlikely ever to be regarded as a classic of the cinema. As with most Elvis films the interest lies more in the music than in the characters or storyline. At least the film has more heart and spirit than a number of later Presley movies such as Frankie and Johnny and Paradise Hawaiian Style and the star himself is more animated and less wooden than he was to be in some of those offerings. And Prowse is always worth watching especially while dancing. 510A goof. The German for Fritz loves Emma is not as the scriptwriter obviously believed Fritz liebe Emma but Fritz liebt Emma. After me class Ich liebe du liebst er liebt.....".

Other examples of this sort of game include His Girl Friday in which Cary Grant makes a quip about his costar Ralph Bellamy and Ocean's Twelve in which one character's physical resemblance to Julia Roberts is an important plot point. Roberts of course plays the character herself. The banal plot underdeveloped characterisation and lack of any great acting performances mean that G.I. Blues is unlikely ever to be regarded as a classic of the cinema. As with most Elvis films the interest lies more in the music than in the characters or storyline. At least the film has more heart and spirit than a number of later Presley movies such as Frankie and Johnny and Paradise Hawaiian Style and the star himself is more animated and less wooden than he was to be in some of those offerings. And Prowse is always worth watching especially while dancing. 510A goof. The German for Fritz loves Emma is not as the scriptwriter obviously believed Fritz liebe Emma but Fritz liebt Emma. After me class Ich liebe du liebst er liebt.....";

All the Elvis movies have both a timeless quality to them while also presenting an innocence of a filmmaking age. Hal Wallis who directs many of the Elvis films also directs Blue Hawaii which is a better followup to GI Blues. The reason to watch G.I. Blues is not the story the cinematography nor the direction even though all three are done with precision and no overkill. The reason to watch is Elvis. This movie was made in 1960 when The King was at his prime and starting to feel comfortable on screen. His performances are excellent musical numbers that is and we're all lucky to have them captured. The movie and Elvis are full of charm and you wonder at times how much Elvis' real life was mirrored with all that charmlike atmosphere around him.  for an Elvis flick.

The later films when Elvis was past prime not only had those story and script problems but did have problems with production values less good supporting cast and Elvis being past prime and didn't even have the benefit of having good soundtracks.After a twoyear break for military service Elvis makes a return to the screen with 'GI Blues'. While it is not quite one of his very best films being somewhat of a disappointment after 'Jailhouse Rock' and 'King Creole' his two best 'Loving You' is high up too it does fare significantly better than pretty much every film he did afterwards and when ranked it would still rank around the top half of his filmography.'GI Blues' is not perfect its somewhat overlong length and the bland and corny script then again the script has rarely been a strong suit in an Elvis film with the odd exception like 'King Creole' being its two main drawbacks. The story is also pretty thin and formulaic.However Elvis even in a substantially changed image once again looks natural and is charismatic and charming. The sultry Juliet Prowse is likewise appealing and Robert Ivers steals scenes with some amusing moments. The soundtrack is terrific also standouts being the title song Wooden Heart Didya Ever and particularly Doin' the Best I Can as well as inspired use of one of Elvis' best known songs Blue Suede Shoes.Norman Taurog a hit and miss director for me directs assuredly and of his nine features with Elvis 'GI Blues' is one of their better collaborations easily and one where Taurog's direction actually rises above just competent. 'GI Blues' is a goodlooking film being nicely shot in particular.All in all pretty good fifth feature for the King of Rock and Roll. 710 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "From the 60's up to the 80's Italian Movie Producers made money with Horror Pictures Comedies Spaghetti Western Giallo Poliziotteschi and other Genres. But there was another unique Subgenre before Sword n' Sandal Movies. Many of later well known Directors like Mario Bava Sergio Leone Enzo Barboni Duccio Tessari and many more worked and learned in this SubGenre. Sergio Corbucci was one of them either. He should later become famous for directing SpaghettiWestern like Django Navajo Joe Il Mercenario Companeros and many more. Romulus and Remo was one of his first directing jobs and IMO he did it very well. But Corbucci wasn't the Highlight in 1961. People went to cinema to watch the clash of two Action Heroes of that time Steve Reeve Hercules as Romulus against Gordon Scott Tarzan as Remo.Both Actors were allowed to show their muscles and they have some pretty good fights. Next to them there are two attractive women Virna Lisi as blonde Princess of the Sabina Tribe and Laura Solari as an Amazon Warrior. The Story is about the mythology of the founding of Rome The Eternal City. Romulus or Romolo and Remo or Remus are twin brothers who were wetnursed by a female wolf. Surprisingly the Movie follows more and the less the mythology with few inventions. In the storyline there are some flaws but IMO not as terrible as in other Sword n' Sandals. The Action and the Fights are all well shot. There is a high body count but don't worry no blood. During watching it I got the feeling to watch a SpaghettiWestern with a lot of Horse riding and swords instead of guns. Most of the scenes are typically for this genre a fight in a gladiator arena a pagan scene a torture scene and many more. Romolo e Remo is a fine entertaining Example for this Subgenre with a nice music too.Up to the mid 60's the Sword n' Sandal Movies weren't produced any more in Italy. The audience wanted to see something new. Gordon Scott and Steve Reeve disappeared from the screen. Musclemen weren't popular any more. In the 80's a new Muscleman conquered Hollywood Arnold Schwarzenegger.".

	schema:headline " NonCampy Peplum From The Director Of Django";
	schema:reviewBody "Pretty good historical Peplum effort here by Sergio Corbucci the Italian exploitation director best known for his trend setting spaghetti western classic DJANGO. It's easy to dismiss Italian sword  sandal spectacles from the early 1960s they are universally low budgeted take shortcuts that their Americanized counterparts wouldn't dream of BEN HUR THE 10 COMMANDMENTS SPARTACUS and borrow liberally from them as well sometimes to the point of plagiarism. Not that there is anything automatically wrong with that artists steal good ideas from each other all the time and there's only so much you can do with a bunch of guys running around in tunics with swords.This one tells of the founding of Rome by the twin brothers of legend Romulus and Remus wonderfully personified by Steve Reeves HERCULES HERCULES UNCHAINED and particularly Gordon Scott TARZAN'S GREATEST ADVENTURE SAMSON AND THE 7 MIRACLES in his first Peplum outing after ditching the Tarzan loincloth. Reeves plays the noble stoic Romulus destined to be the first king of Rome whether he likes it or not and Gordon Scott plays Remus as you have never seen Gordon Scott before  Wild erratic envious prone to violence distrustful of anyone who does not blindly follow his leadership and ultimately flawed enough to come across as very human rather than the son of a Roman god. Legend has it that Reeves refused an offer to play a dual role as both brothers and insisted the producers bring in his friend Gordon Scott instead and it is a testament to Reeves' humbleness as a performer that he ceded the meatier role to his friend Reeves is great as Romulus but Scott is excellent as Remus and the performance opened the door for Scott to appear in several more Pepla before the fad wore itself out. This one proves that he was capable of acting in addition to throwing large boulders at people and the brothers' final showdown is indeed the stuff of tragedy and legend.There's actually some high powered talent behind this effort. In addition to the A list manbeef and director Corbucci spaghetti western specialists Duccio Tessari and Sergio Leone both played a role in scripting the nonhammy noncampy screenplay with cinematography by Enzo Barboni of TRINITY era fame sets by the always brilliant Carlo Simi and a sweeping robust musical score by Piero Piccioni that is quite fittingly epic in nature. Supporting cast stalwarts Piero Lulli Franco Volpi Jos Greci Laura Solari and Jacques Sernas as the scurrilous Curzio bring a breadth to the production that makes many other examples of the genre seem silly by comparison.Here is a thinking man's Peplum eschewing the traditional gladiator bouts and heman physical strength displays for a tightly woven story with a convincingly realistic tone. I would rank this movie up there with Gordon Mitchell's FURY OF ACHILLIES as amongst the best that the Italians were able to muster to cash in on the fad. Both films deal with historical legends and both maintain a somewhat serious tone throughout and you can tell with this one that the Italian filmmakers were endowed with a sense of pride in telling their own prehistory for a change instead of just another potboiler script. Even with all the chest oil there's a tone of dignity to the film that is atypical of what the Peplum genre usually has to offer.If I were to have a genuine criticism about the film it would be in regards to the barbaric horse race through a gauntlet of fire that the producers saw fit to include during the opening movements. It doesn't look like it was very safe for man or beast and I can only hope that they asked the horses' permission first before running them through the very real preCGI obstacle course of burning rubbish and trip wires just for the benefit of the cameras. You have to wonder about the Italians sometimes  couldn't they have just had a nice harmless javelin throwing contest?710".

The movie depicts a Boston dance teacher kidnapped by pirates who escapes into the sleepy Alta California village of La Paloma.This is an obvious adaptation of the reallife story of Joseph Chapman. Chapman originally from Boston deserted Hippolyte de Bouchard's piratical coastal raiding party to become the first yanqui resident of Los Angeles in 1818. Chapman like the character in the movie became a solid citizen of the little pueblo. Unlike the character in the movie there's no historical evidence that Chapman could dance however.".

Leading man Collins looks like he had everything needed to become a major star  possibly he found himself in the wrong studio at the wrong time. Without the takes afforded the standard era star Fred Astaire he manages to be dazzling in his solo routines. The scene with Collins' umbrella stuffed down the front of his pants provides a visual worthy of a Mae West doubleentendre. Mr. Morgan isn't a very convincing Don but he is always a film asset. Ms. Duna a Hungarian woman is a beautiful and believable Senorita.Currently this film is more available in black  white than color  this is not always a disadvantage but Dancing Pirate really should be seen in color. Although my Hollywood Legends VHS Madacy HWGL5512 says B  W on the sleeve this release of film IS definitely in color. It most certainly does NOT star covergirl Rita Hayworth however.

	schema:reviewBody "People have noted that the The Dancing Pirate was original and unique. That is true but it is set firmly in a Gilbert and Sullivan Pirates of Penzance absurd world. In this world a genteel dancing instructor can be mistaken for a bloodthirsty pirate.There are lots of scenes that seem to foreshadow scenes in other movies. Its important to remember that this 1936 movie preceded these other films. The scene of Dancing Instructor Johnathan Pride Charles Collins entering a small Californian town and being mistaken for an invading pirate army reminds one of The Russians are Coming The Russians are Coming Jewison 1966. The scene of male versus female Spanish dancers at the end reminds one of the America scene in West Side Story Wise 1961. Robert Collins' athletic dancing reminds one of Gene Kelley in The Pirate Minnelli 1948 although Collins' skinny frame also reminds one of Ray Bulger's scarecrow in Wizard of Oz Minnelli 1939. Speaking of Wizard of Oz Frank Morgan the wizard of Wizard of Oz gives a performance here that is very close to the wizard as he plays another bumbling authority figure the mayor of a Spanish village. Another technique first used here and copied in Wizard of Oz is that the movie begins in black and White and only switches to color when we arrive in the magical land of California. I found one other connection to the Wizard of Oz. The star of this film Charles Collins had a voiceover in The Wiz Lumet 1978.I saw a very bad dark and muddy color print of this movie on Amazon Prime streaming video. The N.Y. Times reviewer in 1936 raved about the Technicolor of the original. I hope someday someone goes to the trouble of restoring the film to its original color. This print made the film difficult to watch. However the great choreography humorous story and wonderful performances by leads Charles Collins Frank Morgan and Steffi Duna won me over.If you like Gilbert and Sullivan I think you'll find the Dancing Pirate witty and charming. The songs are by Rodgers and Hart while not their best work Pal Joey they still are very good.".

They would be moving back to Broadway and had a string of hit musicals only interrupted by Larry Hart's death in 1943.As this was an RKO film watching it now it was fairly obvious that this film was created with Fred Astaire in mind for the lead. Had Astaire done it The Dancing Pirate might be better remembered. Certainly the two songs done by Dick and Larry aren't among the most memorable. In fact the best number in the film is a dance by lead Charles Collins to Yankee Doodle Dandy that had Astaire written all over it. In fact the main weakness of the film is Collins. A good dancer Collins had a screen presence that was colorless odorless and tasteless. He plays a Boston dancing teacher who gets shanghaied by pirates and escapes the first chance he can when they put in to California for provisions.Still ruled by Spain the local Alcalde is Frank Morgan at his decisiveless best. Morgan on loan from MGM is the best thing about The Dancing Pirate.Collins is sad to say guilty by association and the men want to hang him but the women want to learn to dance so he's in legal limbo of sorts. He also has competition for the hand of Morgan's daughter Steffi Duna in the person of Captain Victor Varconi from Monterey at the head of a platoon of dragoons ostensibly there to protect the village from pirates. But Varconi has his own plans Snidely Whiplash type plans.The Dancing Pirate won an Oscar nomination for the now defunct category of dance direction. I long for the day when musicals of all kinds were being churned out and a category like dance direction was warranted. Speaking of dancing Rita Hayworth is in this film as part of her family troupe of Spanish dancers The Dancing Cansinos.The Dancing Pirate is an amusing enough film but it really needed Fred Astaire to put it over.".

	schema:reviewBody "While I note that the other comments are positive about this film I can't be.  I purchased a video of it in 1988 or so and it was the only time I saw any store carrying a video of it.  It is the first technicolor musical and it is a Rogers and Hart score one good tune Are You My Love? and Morgan and Luis Alberni try to do the best with their parts and Stefi Duna is a good dancer.  Unfortunately the screenplay is weak and so is Charles Collins.  How Collins got the role is a mystery although I suspect he was not the first person to be approached for the role  Judging from his height and build it is possible that the role was meant to be offered to the similarly slender and tall Fred Astaire.  Astaire if he was approached wisely declined because the script is so bad.  The central character never becomes interesting enough to involve ourselves in his life.  Collins probably got the role because he is a dancer his opening scene is demonstrating a dance to a music box he turns on.  But he was a stiff and boring and timid actor.  Maybe an Astaire could have colored the role properly but Collins couldn't.  And the story requires coloring.  The shanghaid dancer is mistaken for a pirate in California.  He is treated well by Morgan the local bumbling alcalde until a squad of soldiers come to the town.  They take over quite literally  they are a squad of soldiers turned brigands under Victor Valconi and Jack La Rue and are only stopped when Collins suddenly cannot take their taunts anymore and leads the peasants against them.  It is just too much of a leap of faith for a viewer to accept.  And the film fails as a result.When recalling Rogers and Hart for their musicals think PAL JOEY or THE BOYS FROM SYRACUSE on stage.  Or remember their early musical films experimental ones HALLELUJAH I'M A BUM! and LOVE ME TONIGHT. Don't remember them for THE DANCING PIRATE".

	schema:headline " Frank Morgan bumbles and stammers while the dancing master subdues enemies with umbrella";
	schema:reviewBody "It's very difficult to predict what you will think of this idiosyncratic musical comedy. Filmed in 3 strip Technicolor it's only been available in BW copies for decades. However apparently a full Technicolor copy surfaced in 2015 so perhaps this will be made available in time. This would be especially valuable for the colorful dances in the Mexican village of La Paloma.......The film title is misleading. The dancing master JohnathanCharles Collins who is the main character is not a pirate. Rather he was shanghaied from his Boston home by some pirates and given menial jobs to do until he escaped in coastal Mexican California during a shore operation.Just why the pirates went around Cape Horn to the then backwater of California is not explained. It's understandable that the people of this village might be fearful with his arrival as from a hill they saw a pirate ship off shore and initially feared that he was the captain. As it turned out none of the real pirates followed him. Just what they had in the casks they offloaded nearby is a mystery but they didn't come looking for him before shoving off. His cask was different because he had put his aunt's umbrella and music box in it. The umbrella would come in handy numerous times In subduing enemies while the music box sometimes served as music for dancing.......Before he was shanghaied he was a dancing master in 1820 Boston. Recently he had been specializing in teaching the imported European waltz which was much simpler than most other dances being taught in America.Historically the waltz was first introduced in the US in Boston but in 1834 not in1820. However there was much initial resistance to it because it involved the revolutionary practice of the couple facing close together with the man wrapping his arm around his partner's waist. Initially this was considered to intimate.. When he got to Mexico he found this attitude even more infirmly ingrained although eventually they accepted it.......In addition to waltzing Jonathan exhibited some tapdancing often mixed with skipping or jumping rather in the manner of Ray Bolgerthe scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz. In Boston after a class he so danced around the room snuffing out candles.......Initially the inhabitants of the Mexican village decided that Jonathan should be hanged. However senorita Sera Fina objected that he should be given a chance to demonstrate if he was a proficient dancer. At first he had to dance with the hangmen's noose around his neck! Then they allowed him to dance without the noose. The village men still wanted him hanged but the women strenuously objected and he was given a reprieve. .......During these proceedings Sera Fina's fatherFrank Morganwho functioned as the town mayor was quite prominent in the proceedings. He exhibited his signature bumbling and stammering mode of speech and behavior which he would carry with him into his role as The Wizard in The Wizard of Oz. He was the most interesting character in the film from the audience's point of view.......Jonathan faced a new threat in the form of some renegade soldiers from Monterey. At first they were thought legitimate and wanted to take him on Monterey for trial. Also the captainVictor Varconi wanted to marry Sera Fina demanding so many sheep from the father. Meanwhile Jonathan made friends with the local Indians and induced them to take part in an attack on the soldiers. Their only weapon was lengths of rope which they used to lasso the soldiers from above then hoist them up or tie them up. Meanwhile Jonathan was jumping around bashing soldiers with his unbelievably resilient umbrella handle. Finally he interrupted the wedding ceremony for SeraFina and the captain of the soldiers. The captain challenged him in a duel he using his sword and Johnathan using his umbrella. Using his superior maneuverability Jonathan finally was the clear winner and replaced the captain in the wedding ceremony. A celebration with much colorful dancing was held.".

Can he convince them he's just a harmless dance instructor....or is he destined to assume room temperature?This film is clearly intended as a musical. There's lots of dancing and I think in hindsight this is a mistake. The plot clearly would have worked better as a comedy...instead of a weak musical. A few laughs and no giant dance numbers and the film would have been a more enjoyable diversion...instead of inconsequential fluff.";

It seem unlikely she would then be loaned to another studio to be hidden among the Royal Dancing Cansinos.I would say all this at least warrants an unconfirmed status on Hayworth's credit for this film.

I have however a serious reservation about this film related to the culturally outdated elements in that it is not focused so much on Tango per se but on Apache a dance once popular in Paris ballrooms but which was more or less banned after some women were it is said killed in the process of dancing.Let me explain.The street toughs of Paris once named for the famous Arizona Indian tribe the Apache commonly called ahPatchee were know as the Apache pronounced ahPash The dance known as the Apache was a ballroom curiosity based on a theatrical dance in which in the standard form the woman plays the role of the prostitute unwilling to share her wages with her pimp who then proceeds to beat her up in a graceful and no doubt elevated artistic manner. This lead to the death of some dancers.This is the basis of several of the dances in this film. One wonders why in the early part of the twenty first century one should anticipate being entertained by the artful beating of exploited women even when that abuse is meted out to the graceful strains of the Argentinian Tango on the streets of Paris France.One may argue of course that this is a product of a different cultural place and time and that it might be inappropriate to be judgmental about the customs of far away places like Paris and Buenos Aires. According to this point of view the Apache is a cultural artifact like slavery or cock fighting to be admired as pure art. If that is true then perhaps the advocates would like to recast the Apache into a less obnoxiously offensive form such as the passionate rivalry of a young mother and her confessor or something of the sort.I understand that the Apache is almost entirely forgotten outside of France and Argentina although it has recently popped up in Moulin Rouge in Tango a film by Carlos Saura and in various music videos. I had some correspondence on this point when a remarkably Apache like video was produced for a song by the Italian singer Elisa Toffoli which appeared to have her being beaten up by her boy friend.In the present time the abuse of women is largely confined to some rap videos and similar creations such as Slap my Bith Up by if memory serves correctly Underworld.Is it not time to consign this sort of thing to the mists of history?".
