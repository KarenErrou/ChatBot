The music is perfect and the acting is amazing. The camera works beautifully also.

The vamp has a reputation of being a whore making out with any young male that orbits around her. Marie is not phased out by that reputation. Put a stress on reputation.The first half is set up. We get to see a lot of synchronized swimming as we become familiar with the three girls. Eventually the narrative leaves synchronized swimming behind and concentrates on the topsyturvy relations among the three.

	schema:reviewBody "The significance of French title of this film La Naissance des Pieuvres which literally means The Birth of the Octopuses is rather obscure so it is perhaps not surprising that it has been marketed in Englishspeaking countries as Water Lilies. The lilies of the English title are three teenage girls Marie Anne and Floriane who are members of a synchronised swimming team based in the Paris suburbs and the film is a comingofage drama about the development of their first sexual feelings.One feature of the film perhaps unusual for a film of this type is that it concentrates exclusively on relationships between the young people themselves. We see nothing of their parents or their teachers and very little of the adult world at all. The three girls are very different in appearance and are portrayed as being very different in character. The shy retiring Marie is slim and petite and appears to be the youngest of the three. Anne is something of a plain Jane Floriane a glamorous blonde who is very popular with the boys. The three together with a handsome male swimmer named Francois are involved in what might be described as a lovequadrilateral.Anne has fallen in love with Francois but he is smitten with Floriane who seems to return his affections although he is by no means her only male admirer. Indeed not all of Floriane's admirers are male because Marie has a crush on her attractive friend. The film charts the way in which their friendship develops at first it seems that Floriane is simply using Marie as a convenient excuse when she is in fact going out to meet boys her parents presumably object to her dating boys but have no objection to her going out with female friends. Later however we realise that despite Floriane's image as the sexy popular girl who is always the centre of male attention she actually reciprocates Marie's feelings. The film reverses some conventional stereotypes about sexuality. Anne with her short hair and rather chunky figure looks typically butch yet she is the only one of the three main characters who is unambiguously heterosexual whereas the more conventionally feminine Marie and the glamorous Floriane are lesbian or at least bisexual.Comingofage films are common enough although most of them tend to avoid the controversial topic of teenage lesbianism. Water Lilies however deals with its subjectmatter in a sensitive way with three very good performances from its three leading actresses Pauline Acquart Adele Haenel and Louise Blachere. The relationships between the characters especially that between Marie and Floriane are complex and capable of a number of interpretations. Is Floriane for example simply using Marie for sex or does she genuinely have romantic feelings for her? Could Floriane's sluttish behaviour with Francois and the other boys be just a device to hide her lesbian feelings from the outside world? Or even to hide them from herself? This was the first film made by its young director Celine Sciamma only 27 at the time on this basis she must be regarded as a highly promising newcomer. 710".

Water Lilies is a French film that deals with the lives of three distinct teen female characters and their very real struggles. Set in the world of synchronized swimming director Celine Sciamma takes you on a disturbingly honest depiction of the lives of modern teenage girls.The sport of synchronized swimming is very similar to the internal struggles of each of the girls with all of the furious action and kicking occurring just under the surface. Marie is a fifteen year old tom boyish girl that tends to keep to herself. She is short and is envious of the older more developed girls. She is best friends with the second main girl Anna. She is overweight and often resorts to childish behavior. She fears growing up and being alone. Then there is Floriane the hottest girl in school and captain of the swim team. All of these characters share many of the same problems and deal with them in very different ways. When Marie sees Floriane perform at a school swim meet she quickly becomes enamored with her. Her grace beauty and popularity make most all the girls in school envious. Marie makes a deal with her so she can watch the team practice. In return Marie has to be the reason for Floriane to leave the house at night to hook up with random boys. Floriane seems to have everything under control and lives a perfect life but we find out that can't be further from the truth. Her beauty makes her feel like an outsider as she sticks out in a crowed. Other girls are jealous and mean to her as she is looked upon as the school slut.No matter who we are or how we look everybody has body image issues and this is further compounded by the popular media. Television movies and magazine mold young minds into thinking what is normal and what is acceptable. Anna and Floriane like the same guy Franois. There a few scenes between Marie and Floriane that will make certain audiences extremely uncomfortable. That has developed a sort of controversy between groups of people. Some think that the film is nothing but a cheap exploitation of teen sex. Maybe there would be more of a basis for an argument if the film was made by a man but it wasn't. Director Celine Sciamma looks to takes great care and sensitivity to the actors and the story. This film is not for everyone but you will get hooked by the likable true to life characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "Also known as Water Lilies this film tells the story of two girls as they struggle their way into the world of love and sex. This story is told at a slow pace and that works very well. It gives plenty of time and space to get to know the different characters and to grow somewhat attached to them.Using a small cast puts some extra pressure on the people playing as they all have some more screen time than normal but the people playing in this film handle that well. Everyone is completely believable. Visual setting is great especially the underwater shots in the swimming pool add a nice effect.Many films have been made about the same subject though and this one does not really stand out above any of them. It pulls some standard pressure methods out of the high hat and works on them. It isn't bad not at all but it surely isn't great either and I do feel it could have done better if it had taken some what less explored angles.7 out of 10 synchronous swimmers".

The film premiered at Cannes in 2007 and actually won some awards there as well.The movie doesn't really stand out from others since it actually features little new once you've already seen some similar movies such as this one but this however really doesn't mean that Naissance des pieuvres is a bad one to watch. The movie is certainly a good watch that handles its subject well and tells its story steadily and therefore also effectively in a typical somewhat slow French cinematic pace.It's a coming of age movie that focus on the life of mainly 3 totally different midteenagers. Sexuality is a big theme within the movie which gets handled delicately and subtle. It makes the movie and its story overall a pretty realistic one though perhaps a bit predictable since the movie doesn't quite offer anything original enough within its genre.This type of French movie will probably scare off a lot of people because of the reason that they probably expect it to be very arty with deep layers and meanings to it. Naissance des pieuvres however is a very accessible movie for everyone and you really don't have to be into Euroteen movies to appreciate this movie. It's a sweet and somewhat sensual kind of movie due to its subject and visual approach.The movie is also being made realistic by its actors who don't had and have a lot of experience within the movie business but are authentic looking and feeling within their roles. The strong individual characters provide the movie with some nice themes and good moments.A good movie on its subject.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Thanks for your explanation.The basic theme is the first sexual emotions of girls when it is not clear if they are directed toward the same or the other sex. It is no different for boys. I think that both Floriane and Marie will eventually have heterosexual feelings without any admixtures.Much of the movie is water ballet. Sometimes the girls will have their heads downwards and nothing above the water except their feet and lowers legs with which they will wave and kick in the air. To people like me who had never seen such things before it was fascinating.  Floriane is the leader of one team of water lilies. Marie tells her that she would like to see when Floriane is training. This seems to be their first contact that is not just ordinary. Soon they will walk together. Floriane takes Marie to a garage where a boy is waiting for her and then goes away with him for an hour while Marie is waiting for her to return. I took for granted that the couple slept with each other. But we will later learn from the movie that they do less than that. I can supply some information which few users will find elsewhere. There is a scene in which Marie secretly steals Floriane's garbage bag. In it she finds an apple mostly eaten. And Marie proceeds to eat the rest.  There is a parallel scene in another movie Kazetachi no gogo Afternoon Breezes by Hitoshi Yazaki Japan 1980. This is about adult young females and a clearly Lesbian woman is vainly in love with a heterosexual woman.

Marie says she cannot do this. But still later Marie says that she is indeed willing to do it. And she masturbates on Floriane. There is no nudity in this scene.

	schema:reviewBody "I cheer for films that fill in subject matter gaps in world cinema. So after watching the trailer for Water Lilies I expected to like this film because I thought I'd stumbled on something unique a movie that honestly portrays teen lesbian love  sort of a female version of Beautiful Thing. The main characters are young French women 15 years old. Marie is slender reticent and pretty in a tomboyish way Floriane is outgoing athletic and beautiful and Anne is loyal pudgy and behaviorally immature. The erotic interrelationship between Marie and Floriane is always simmering in this movie if not at the surface then just below it. Water Lilies however is not about the dawning of lesbian love upon two teens it is about sexual frustration suffering ennui teens working at crosspurposes and  in at least two instances  joyless mechanical sex. It also proves that screenwriters and filmmakers mar their own creations when they become too manipulative.In the extra features on the Lord of the Flies DVD director Peter Brook says French cynicism starts with the arousal of sex meaning the French regard children as angels while they regard adolescents and adults with a pervasive cynicism. Part of the downfall of this film is filmmaker Celine Sciamma has gulped a mighty dose of this cynicism.Where is the joy? I asked myself while watching this film. Yes first love can be painful and frustrating but it can also be joyful and triumphantly erotic in a fresh lifeaffirming way. These positive aspects are missing from this movie there is no balance.Organically this movie wants to be a poignant celebration of first love. But Sciamma is too impressed with her own cynicism and cleverness and ruins the film. First what is the point of showing only the plump girl nude? I know there is an established tradition of tasteful teen nudity in European cinema as evidenced by films like The Slingshot The Rascals The Devil Probably The Little Thief Murmur of the Heart Friends Beau Pere and Europa Europa but this instance is a petty authorial intrusion  See audience I can make a film where I show only the unattractive person nude. Either no nudity or evenly distributed nudity would've been an honest way to go.There is a scene in a club where Floriane and Marie are dancing. What follows next is not just Floriane cynically manipulating Marie it is filmmaker Sciamma cynically manipulating her audience.Perhaps the biggest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty takes place when Floriane warns Marie she's about to request something that is not normal. Marie understandably asks Who cares about being normal? Then Sciamma plays false with her audience and the hurtling momentum of the movie because Floriane's request is a phony derivative and substitute question  not the authentic heartfelt question the movie Marie's character and the viewers who've invested their time deserve. Here are also two moments which clank falsely on the viewer's nerves 1 Since when do the French  of all people  take baths wearing bathing suits and with a turtle to boot? 2 What teen  of any nationality  would chomp down on an apple core that's been thrown in the garbage in order to get a taste of the beloved's mouth?The three main actresses are promising and if they find better vehicles for their talents may become excellent actors. Louise Blachere Anne is the best actress in terms of technique and could have a successful career in supporting roles. Adele Haenel Floriane could become a leading lady or a bombshell or both. Pauline Acquart Marie possesses an intensity and magnetism which are unmistakable. In the future she could play everything from an emotionally crippled librarian to a mysteriously sensual seductress to a reluctant politician riding a meteoric rise in acclaim.All in all Water Lilies was very disappointing. Will an honest filmmaker please make an authentic movie about two young women falling in love! No  not necessarily for the sake of this middleaged guy  but so young lesbian girls can have something of quality they can watch and identify with. And yes to fill a subject matter gap in world cinema.".

There's no unique way to approach the subject matter because anyone who has ever been a teenager has lived through this movie...all the uncertainty the awkwardness the naivety the myths of growing up. The whole point of a comingofage film is that its a predictable clich...because that's exactly what adolescence is.There's no unpretentious way to say this Naissance des Pieuvres isn't a movie at all it's a film. And a beautiful one at that. There's this looseness about the way the movie rolls that feels so natural...it's what all comingofage films should be like. Another reviewer here mentioned that it had a very Sofia Coppola feel and that's exactly right. That feeling of dreamy teenage idleness is persistent and strangely keeps the film together. There are few movies that make you feel like floating and sinking at the same time. Water Lilies did it for me. Every scene and every sound the soundtrack is BRILLIANT in this film was so deliberate and so beautifully acted.If absolutely nothing convinces you at least watch the last 5 minutes of this movie. I've replayed it at least a dozen times and I don't completely understand why. It's hypnotic and arguably one of the best movie endings of modern film.910.".

	schema:headline " Now the breast stroke!";
	schema:reviewBody "It sounds as if it should be a biography of Claude Monet but it's actually a highly focused story of relationships between three adolescent girls on a French synchronized swimming team. There are no parents or teachers to speak of no school and boys are represented by one peripheral figure the hunky Francois who enters the story determined from time to time and always leaves confused.Pauline Aquart is the youngest of the three only aspiring to join the team she so much admires. She's kind of odd looking. She's not yet out of her adolescent growth spurt and has long bony limbs big feet and no derriere to speak of. She's prognathous and sports these plump pursed lips. After a while her appearance grows on you and from certain angles she can come to appear enthralling.Adele Haenel is older  more well more developed physically. What a glamorous figure she cuts in her swim suit sauntering around teasing the boys swishing her long blond hair. But she's not what she seems. Or is she? I couldn't quite figure it out. The French are long on paradoxes and short on consistency. No wonder Francois is always sniffing after her.There's not so much ambiguity in Louse Blachere's character. She's on the team too but she's dumpy and plain and sensitive about it and has an intense crush on Francois. Blachere is a good actress and adds to the ungainliness of the character through her performance.The movie deals with the relationships between these three meaning intrigues deceptions hidden feelings and all the rest of what we associate with young girls who spend much time with one another. This is of course a tricky topic. It becomes trickier during the gradual development of a homoerotic relationship between Pauline and Adele. Not that you should expect this to be a soft porn movie. The only nudity we see is considerably less than a turn on and what little sex there is under the covers sometimes literally.I don't think I want to get into the plot or into its analysis too much partly because it's suggestive rather than expressed through action partly because it's complex and partly because I'm not sure I got it all.Let me give an example. Okay. Adele is the girl the others envy. She's also quite distant and self satisfied. On top of that she is apparently schtupping every boy and man in sight if they can be of any use to her at all from the handsome but dumb Francois to the bus driver she wants a favor from. She brags unashamedly about her expertise in fellatio. When Pauline approaches her about joining the swim team Adele uses her as a lookout during assignations with the guys. A superior and selfindulgent narcissist you know? But then the soidisant slut takes the skinny Pauline under her wing and reveals to Pauline that she's still a virgin. Really? Yes really. Pauline begins to draw closer to Adele and Adele finally confesses that she'd like to rid herself of her hymen and she would like Pauline to do it for her. Pauline now drawn sexually to Adele performs the task with subdued relish. NOW Adele would REALLY like to get it on with a man preferably older and experienced. So she takes Pauline to a boite where she dances seductively with some guy until she follows Pauline to the powder room. The two girls stand there staring at one another neither having overtly expressed a sexually tinged interest in the other. But Adele stands so close that Pauline slowly loosens her own reins reaches up and kisses Adele on the lips. Adele steps back smiling and says There now that wasn't so bad was it? and then walks back into the club.That's a pretty close description of whatever is going on between Pauline and Adele  but what the hell IS going on? Initially Adele treats Pauline like an irrelevant child later like a close friend finally like a potential lover  and the minute Pauline responds Adele walks off satisfied. Is she USING Pauline the way she seems to be using men? Does it satisfy Adele to know that she now has another person in involuntary servitude? I don't know.I've slighted Louise Blachere as the third member of the trio the plain and overripe wallflower whose expression always suggests dumbfoundedness but who at least is thoroughly heterosexual and the first of the three to rid herself of that noisome virginity but I've only skipped her for considerations of space.Should you see it? By all means. Just compare it to the typical American movie about high school kids. For men some of whom have never penetrated the female mystique this may give you some idea of what it looks like in medium shot.".

	onyx:emotionText "It sounds as if it should be a biography of Claude Monet but it's actually a highly focused story of relationships between three adolescent girls on a French synchronized swimming team. There are no parents or teachers to speak of no school and boys are represented by one peripheral figure the hunky Francois who enters the story determined from time to time and always leaves confused.Pauline Aquart is the youngest of the three only aspiring to join the team she so much admires. She's kind of odd looking. She's not yet out of her adolescent growth spurt and has long bony limbs big feet and no derriere to speak of. She's prognathous and sports these plump pursed lips. After a while her appearance grows on you and from certain angles she can come to appear enthralling.Adele Haenel is older  more well more developed physically. What a glamorous figure she cuts in her swim suit sauntering around teasing the boys swishing her long blond hair. But she's not what she seems. Or is she? I couldn't quite figure it out.

	schema:reviewBody "Water Lilies is a wellmade first film from France about young female sexuality and friendship. Sciamma works with specialized slightly sanitized material that is as offputting to some as it is alluring to others. The film focuses exclusively on three middleclass teenage girls in a tidy new Paris suburb. Their lives revolve around a big indoor swimming pool where two of the three are part of a synchronized water ballet team.Such distractions as parents siblings work and school have been neatly excised from the equation. The central sensibility belongs to the attractively sullen but skinny Marie Pauline Acquart who is not on the team but thinks she would like to be. Marie worships Floriane Adle Haenel an alluring blonde and team standout whom the boys are after. This takes Marie away from her former best friend also a member of the water ballet team the somewhat plump Anne Louise Blachre. Being less special Anne is more truly accessible to the boys. Floriane like this film promises a bit more then she truly offers. Marie has the more essential quality for a teenage girl she suffers inwardly. Flroiane doesn't so much suffer as jump into situations and then bolt.Marie is dazzled by the glamor of the water ballet as well as Floriane. Floriane takes advantage of this to make Marie first her slave and a cover for her assignations then lacking any other friends her confidante. All the other girls think Floriane a slut an illusion she encourages in the men and boys she teases because it leads them on. She suffers the pretty girl's fate of being not a person but an object and she can't resist the validation the boys give her by wanting to kiss her and bed her but she doesn't really care about any of them and knows her involvements with them are a trap. Enlisting Marie to act as her pal so her unseen mother won't know she's going out to meet boys she also gets Marie to rescue her from the boys later. It looked the opposite at first but Floriane needs Marie as much as Marie thinks she needs her. Anne is left with her discomfort with her body and a desire to get laid that's earthier and more real than the other girls'.Keeping all external context at bay Sciamma can highlight subtle shifts in the delicate equation of the three girls' goals and interactions. On the other hand the film's water madness which includes lots of showering and spitting as well as underwater swimming shots makes it feel completely airless at times and some of its 95 minutes do not pass so quickly. Luckily the film has a sense of humor and lets the trio sometimes forget their everpresent goals and avoidances and just do silly pointless girl things. It's the offbeat moments that give the film life too bad in a way that there aren't more of them. But Sciamma has the courage of her obsessions and what remains as one walks out of the theater is the personalities and their dynamics. Along the way of course it is pleasant to watch the swimming and to gaze at the girls who understandably love to gaze at themselves. There's no great revelation or drama on the way but things get a bit more interesting when it emerges that Marie doesn't just admire but truly desires Floriane and is jealous of her boyfriendswhom Floriane always stops before they go all the way. In a typical irony of this kind of plot Floriane actually decides she wants to have her first real sex with Mariebut Marie is the one who holds off because she knows it won't have the significance to Floriane that it will have to her. When it happens it's a timid mechanical affair. Meanwhile Anne has a huge crush on Francois Warren Jacquin a male swimmer but of course he is after Floriane. Boys are not an element that's been subtracted and there always seem to be several dozen ready at poolside or on the dance floor but they are just bodies and faces available studs.".

She is one of the most interesting filmmakers to me because she makes great choices on subject matters to deal with and actually makes an effort to explore areas of humanity that may not be as easily accessible to her which doesn't seem hard but if you could just see the number of respected filmmakers who just stick to their limited perspectives again and again.... Water Lilies is not an exception to this. It tells the story of Marie and Anne best friends one a little too small a frame for synchronized swimming the other a little bit the opposite. Marie and her storyline takes most of the screen time and while I loved every bit of it I also wanted equal screen time and focus with Anne. Marie finds herself getting attracted to Floriane played by Adle Haenel who is really magnetic here. Anne is attracted to this boy but of course body image issues and society make that harder. Her storyline though too short for my liking gets an amazing ending. Louise Blachre is great in the role.".

	schema:reviewBody "Emotionally brutal tale of teenage sexual yearnings. Pauline Acquart is a gawky 14 or 15 year old who obsesses over the slightly older supposedly sexually promiscuous captain of her school's synchronized swimming team Adele Haenel. Meanwhile Acquart's tubby best friend Louise Blanchere obsesses over a boy Francois who is himself trying to bang Haenel. The film sometimes seems just a tiny bit sleazy because it really does focus a lot on these horny teenage girls and as it's mostly told from the point of view of Acquart it sometimes seems obsessed with Haenel's body. But whatever prurient reasons one might have for watching this it's impossible to deny how deeply it bores into the psyche of Acquart. And Christ does she give a fantastic performance. It also has a lot of insight into Haenel's character. You kind of hate her just because she's so damn manipulative and cruel toward Acquart. She almost immediately recognizes what Acquart wants as she's so used to getting the same attitude from the men in her life and she uses it to her advantage. In one particularly painful sequence she grinds on Acquart on the dance floor but only because she knows some douchebag guy will find it hot. The two girls are just about to kiss for the first time and Acquart opens her eyes to find Haenel has backed into the guy behind her and started to grind on him instead. The Blanchere subplot on the other hand is somewhat less successful. She's kind of dumb and childish for what it's worth Acquart who has presumably been her friend since they were kids is starting to feel the same Blanchere is kind of like a safe place to back off to when her relationship with Haenel gets to be too frustrating. The culmination of her part of the film though is pretty satisfying. This is definitely one of the best films I've ever seen about teenagers. Despite the fact that I'm a straight guy Water Lilies dragged some very painful memories from my own teen years to the surface.".

Lolita is a fata morgana. Marie gets to know Floraine's double while her imitation breaks the water lily's heart. While the frog goes through the motions of catching flies for appearance's sake she gets chummy with the water lily when no one's looking. In the film's most startling scene the water lily agrees to give the frog a hand in losing her virginity through the mechanical act of oral stimulation. Floraine wants boys to like her but she doesn't like boys seemingly but it's more important to the frog that she's popular. When the water lily finally kisses the frog the frog remains a frog. The frog can't transform into a water lily or a princess because the water lily lost the frog's respect. After their lips unlock Floraine tells Marie See it's easy which is the frog's way of equating their kiss with the orgasm that her friend gave her as nothing more than a riteofpassage without any strings attached.

	schema:headline " intelligent Hitler parody";
	schema:reviewBody "I thought about leaving the sneak preview theater because I wasn't sure if I could stand Helge Schneider as Hitler. I personally dislike Helge Schneider movies. But i'm happy i gave it a second thought when i noticed that it is a Dani Levy movie. I think Levy is an excellent director.The movie seems to be a low budget production due to the crappy CGI work but nonetheless it's a good satire dealing with a serious topic in the right way... i think satire is an appropriate approach to deal with the person Hitler was. compared to Der Untergang which made Hitler a piece of popculture and tried to portray his character as real as possible this movie criticizes that and fascism with black humor sarcasm and creativity.Sometimes i found it quite Chaplinesk you know the great dictator and that's not a bad reference. I was surprised Helge Schneider's performance was decent and not as stupid as in Praxis Dr. Hasenbein no offense to Schneider fans but i couldn't sit through that movie so i turned it off after 30 minutes. Schneider is a good musician though.Ulrich Mhe's performance is great as usual. Dr. Adolf Grnbaum is an actor who gets out of the concentration camp Sachsenhausen due to the order to teach Hitler the art of acting to perform his speeches right to seduce the masses and make them believe they still could win the war. But Hitler lost faith in the over all victory so it's a tough job for Grnbaum. Hitler is pretty neurotic and a bedwetter who was beaten up by his father. Which makes it hard for Grnbaum to simply kill Hitler when he got the chance. Although this might sound like a flat comedy it's really not! It's a satire and satire hurts sometimes like reality does.I really liked the other actors who played Hitler's staff officers. It was Goebbels i liked most. Kudos to the casting because in this movie the audience hasn't the problem that it's hard to distinct one staff officer from another like in Der Untergang. They really got different characters.All in all go watch this movie. It's pretty refreshing after the hype around Der Untergang.".

	onyx:emotionText "I thought about leaving the sneak preview theater because I wasn't sure if I could stand Helge Schneider as Hitler. I personally dislike Helge Schneider movies. But i'm happy i gave it a second thought when i noticed that it is a Dani Levy movie. I think Levy is an excellent director.The movie seems to be a low budget production due to the crappy CGI work but nonetheless it's a good satire dealing with a serious topic in the right way... i think satire is an appropriate approach to deal with the person Hitler was. compared to Der Untergang which made Hitler a piece of popculture and tried to portray his character as real as possible this movie criticizes that and fascism with black humor sarcasm and creativity.Sometimes i found it quite Chaplinesk you know the great dictator and that's not a bad reference. I was surprised Helge Schneider's performance was decent and not as stupid as in Praxis Dr. Hasenbein no offense to Schneider fans but i couldn't sit through that movie so i turned it off after 30 minutes. Schneider is a good musician though.Ulrich Mhe's performance is great as usual.

	schema:reviewBody "Mein Fhrer  Die wirklich wahrste Wahrheit ber Adolf Hitler or Mein Fhrer The Truly Truest Truth About Adolf Hitler or just My Fhrer is a German Germanlanguage movie from 2007 so only a couple more weeks and this one will have its 10th anniversary. The writer and director of this 90minute film is Swiss filmmaker Dani Levy. The title already tells you what to expect here. Or does it really. Yes it is a film about Adolf Hitler but it is really a fictitious film that has nothing to do with reality. When I tell you that Hitler in here is played by Helge Schneider you should already know what to expect basically. Yes there are serious moments in here like mentions of concentration camps and other stuff but they only way to enjoy this one is really only if you see it as a comedy for the most part. It is mostly worth seeing for how absurd it all is. Hitler suffers from burnout and lacks his usual power and determination. So Goebbels gets a Jewish artistactor out of a concentration camp so that he can revive the old spirit in Hitler. Why a Jew you wonder? They explained that in the film as well because a Jew is the only one who can really evoke true emotion in Hitler because of how much he hates them. Does it really make sense? I doubt it. But that's not a problem at all as if there is one thing this film is not trying to be then it would be to make sense.It is all about giving us a different fictitious take on the subject and this idea makes a lot of sense. There are so many Hitler movies that try to be all accurate and realistic but film is always about creative fiction as well so why is it so underrepresented when it comes to depicting historic events? This is a different perspective here and as such it is indeed very refreshing. Yes not every joke is a true winner but that's never the case for a comedy film anyway. I found it easy to appreciate this one for what it is and there were actually some really funny scenes like the one when Hitler impersonates a dog and his dog wants to jump on him and the Nazi officer is watching. Or the ending is also pretty good. Let me just say Heal yourself. I think they chose a good way in making fun of the Fhrer throughout the entire movie and to show that there is another better response to him than fighting violence and cruelty with violence and cruelty. So yes this film definitely has a good message as well. And completely aside from the story it cannot be ignored that this film includes actors like Groth Noethen Schneider Mhe and others and that is a cast that cannot be denied its talent. I personally do not like Katja Riemann so I am glad she had almost no screen time despite playing such an important character. Oh well I guess Eva Braun really isn't that important at all in this film here. She does hardly play a role at all.All in all like I already said it is crucial that you approach this movie with the right idea. Then I am sure you also will not find it offensive. And if you take a look at Dani Levy's own religious background and understand that he is the man in charge then there is no reason to be offended anyway I think. I believe this film was a good satire that rarely offers greatness but gets more and more interesting the longer it goes on and has some truly hilarious scenes. People may ask if this film should be allowed and my response would be a resounding Yes! I recommend checking it out and it's another example for me that Helge Schneider is really never a miss for me regardless of him starring in his own movies or only acting. He also proved that he can easily hold his own against Germany's acting elite if he has to and I think he was a great choice for Hitler here. I am of course a bit biased when it comes to Schneider. But still this movie was a hilarious watch also very essential with this runtime and never drags probably closer to a  than a  for me and you really need to check it out.".

Nearly all the other characters seem to exist without a purpose. The don't contribute to the story in any sense besides making up some kind of conspiracy or being trapped in silly jokes. A sad example is the role of the Reichsinnenminister Himmlers part is reduced to standing around with his right arm being injured and forced to be stretched out what a waste of Ulrich Noethens potential as an actor.

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see this film with mixed anticipation because it was said to be a comedy about Hitler but it had the great late actor Ulrich Muehe in it and I was intrigued by what I had read about the plot of this film a few days before the end of the war Hitler is a nervous wreck and incapable of making the inspiring speech which Goebbels has written for him. He needs coaching by an actor and it must be someone who can rouse him to new heights of hatred which Hitler's favourite actors are said not to be able to do. So Goebbels gets a formerly famous Jewish drama teacher Professor Gruenbaum released from Sachsenhausen concentration camp with the task of coaching Hitler.The acting was superb Muehe's as Gruenbaum of course and also Helge Schneider's as Hitler Sylvester Groth's as a smooth Goebbels Ulrich Noethe's as Himmler though it was surely unnecessary to have him have his arm strapped in a permanent Hitler salute Stephan Kurt's as Albrecht Speer not at all shown as the least guilty of the Nazis and the members of Gruenbaum's family Adriana Altaras' as his wife and Shawn Karlborg as his eldest teenage son. The production was also first class  excellent photography and absolute clarity of diction.I think the film works very well except on the several occasions when the 'comedy' 'irony' would be a better word tips over into slapstick which really should have been cut both from the point of view of good taste and also because I think they weaken the film. The way in which Gruenbaum gradually acquires mastery over Hitler is beautifully paced and in terms of the film is even psychologically credible. Of course Gruenbaum urged on by his wife should use the opportunity of being so near to Hitler to kill him and he twice comes near to do it but in the end of course he doesn't  too proud of his success as a coach? And how does one end such a film? The climax is well staged but doesn't I think quite come off.With the reservations I have I am glad I saw the film. There was little laughter during the showing I attended  and I think that was right and not a criticism of the film the slapstick didn't deserve it and the 'comedy' had of course underlying it a serious idea which forbids laughter.".

Sure films like The Producers and The Great Dictator have managed to poke fun at the Nazis and Hitler and succeeded....but My Fuhrer is certainly not in the same league a these classics.The film is a fantasy set in January 1945just months before the end of WWII.

Instead of the broken man he has become his Propaganda Minister Goebbels claims to want to have this Jewish acting coach help the Fuhrer to find his former strength. And so Hitler and Dr. Adolf Grnbaum work togetherand in the process learn to need each other. Scenes where Hitler cries about his abusive childhood talks about how the Final Solution wasn't really his idea and calls the Doctor his Jewish friend are very surrealand in really bad taste.

Yet in my opinion it performs extremely well in striking the balance between comedy and reminding the audience of that cruelty of the regime for example by inserting the very serious element of Grnbaum's eldest son. But for understanding both the comedian elements as well as reminders of the cruelty it is highly recommended to have knowledge of that part of German history.I hope and it is my impression that the movie sets a visual starting point for the time that German people learn to handle that history without tabooing or forgetting it.".

So there are just 2 points from me for Dani Levi. Now I can understand why Helge Schroeder has already said to the press that he didn't agreed with Levi's understatement of the movie and the role of Hitler.You should better watch Chaplins The great dictator.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before writing my commentary I should tell you that I went into the Movie theater not really expecting a Movie that I would call a total smash hit. The reasons for my low expectations regarded mostly the lead Helge Schneider. If you were unfortunate enough and saw one of his previous works you know what I probably expected. In this movie however he proved that he actually can act. And quite well if I may say so. The story starts 5 days before the End of 1944. Berlin is totally destroyed and Hitler brilliantly portrayed by Schneider is supposed to give a new years speech. The Minister for Propaganda Joseph Goebbels however feels that Hitler lost his touch. So he enlists a Jewish Professor to help him get Hitler ready for the speech. It's a long story why exactly this person is chosen so I won't bother you with it. After being freed from the Concentration Camp he and his family who also has been freed he begins tutoring Hitler. The movie contains a lot of these scenes which once again showcase the brilliance of Helge Schneider Hitler and Ulrich Mehe Prof. Adolf Israel Grnbaum. There are a lot of other small story lines throughout the movie but I am really trying to give you an Idea of what's going on in the mainstory. The final Information I will give you about the plot is that 'Goebbels' isn't convinced that Adolf Hitler can actually do what's required of him so he comes up with another plan. So much for the story. Now for the movie. The movie is packed from beginning to end with jokes about Hitler their need to greet themselves with Heil Hitler all the time the excessive bureaucracy in the third Reich also provides a LOT of very good jokes. Well I guess the only way for you to find out is to go to the Movie theater yourselves which is was reluctant to do. I paid so off though that I watched this movie. There is not a single minute in that movie where you are not forced to laugh sometimes even out loud. I know that there is a lot of controversy surrounding this movie but I can only say the following about it Go and decide for yourselves. My opinion is though that this movie doesn't take the matter at hand too lightly and shouldn't threaten anyones believes. It was time that a German Director had the guts to make a Comedy about this. Finally I want to say that this Film is by far not as tame as commented by some.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whether you will like this movie or not will depend on your personal way to approach the subject and on your personal kind of humor. This is something quite obvious when you read the comments given so far and also regarding the controversy in the German media about the movie. Most critics for instance disgraced the movie before even having seen it simply for making fun of Hitler. Here in Germany many people still regard laughing about Adolf Hitler a nono or better nogo area. To start with I personally do not like Helge Schneider's jokes very much. Surprisingly his performance as Hitler is simply brilliant which surprises even more knowing he's not an actor!The jokes most of the time are pretty subtle and I got carried away laughing almost half the movie. Especially making A.H.'s dog Blondie an important part of the plot was hilarious. But it helps a lot if you know how to interpret a dog's behavior. It also helps a lot to know historical details of that period in order to understand some of the jokes. Until close to the end I would have given the movie a whole 10 out of 10 stars but the end simply didn't match the movie. Most of the time you have a feeling that it might have been like that at least a little but the end simply couldn't we know so! Also that wasn't funny. The last sentences then address the critics trying to shamefully explain why the movie was made.What on the other hand was very well made were the credits. People were asked about Hitler what they knew about him. It started with young children and ended with the generation which experienced the time and such were the answers. The children clearly not knowing anything simply being too young the young and grownup's knowing this and that and the elders simply refusing to answer since they still deny dealing with the time rather suppressing all memory and therefore never overcoming the experienced. And that brings us back to the critics. As mentioned above and in other comments making fun of Hitler and especially thereby showing him as a human being is difficult in Germany. But he was a human being with all faults and weaknesses in this movie even madeup ones. Seeing him as just that is a substantial necessity for understanding how all that could happen. Summing that up I'd recommend watching the movie unless you belong to the ones regarding the laughs as politically incorrect.".

I think it would have worked if it had been purely a black comedy but somehow the director inserted farcical elements such as the constant Heil Hitlering and the recurring ado about bureaucratic procedures. This may have been done to attract a larger or different audience but it didn't exactly benefit the movie. If it had been cast in the form of a lowkey but biting black satire it would have been a far better movie. I give it a 7 for what it could have been if it had been a brilliant black comedy it might have scored a 9.Interestingly for me Der Untergang was never the great movie it could have been either for essentially the same reason. In my opinion the latter movie should have focused exclusively on the psychology and claustrophobia in the bunker during the final days of the Third Reich. It could even have ended with Hitler and Eva Braun retreating. All the aboveground scenes were superfluous and indeed distracted from the drama that was going on belowground. As in the case of Mein Fhrer one cannot help but wonder if this was done purely to attract a larger or different audience.".

The director does not seem to have made his mind about the register of approaching the historical facts he is mixing the gross character satire with the historical melodrama. Some of the comical gags are too direct and too expected and it falls to the melodramatic counterpoint of the story to counterpoint the overall tone. Here the big chance of the film is to have Ulrich Mhe distributed in his last important role of the Jewish director and professor of acting who is charged no less but to saving the Third Reich by coaching Hitler in regaining his selfassurance and giving one of his historical speeches that could revive the faith of the German people and turn back the destiny of the war. While Hitler is pathetically portrayed as a madman in selfdelusion and nervous breakdown Ulrich Mhe's Prof. Adolf Israel Grnbaum is almost realistic superb in the humanity of the humble man who is saving his own humanity and the whole humanity in his sacrifice.

I will admit that there are some humorous bits Hitler playing with a battleship in the tub Hitler singing a love song while accompanying himself on the Hammond organ Hitler giving a speech in a borrowed mustache but they don't make up for the jokes about gas chambers dirty Jews etc. The writer also seems to think that watching guys say Heil Hitler is funny in itself. There are poignant moments involving the Jewish actor's family and one especially good scene in which he talks on the phone to a friend who's in a concentration camp. But then we jump back to more tasteless humor.The climactic scene has some funny lines but the way it plays out throws a bucket of cold water on the entire project.

There never was any Jew who had to help Hitler overcome his depressions. Also Hitler was not observed by Goebbels and Co. He also never wanted to flee. His hole character is wrong. This Hitler is just not the real Hitler. This film gives the impression of a nice Hitler who was not responsible for anything. Just a poor guy in a bad situation. That Helge Schneider said in public that this movie is not good says everything. What I don't get is the lack of ideas in this film. The Nazis and the second world war give plenty of possibilities to make funny scenes of it. Levi must be a very unintelligent and uninterested person. Also the camera work is really bad.".

But this movie wasn't funny at all. I would have been happy with a crazy satire. But it's also hard to accept it as a satire. The critical tone is there. It has a paradic element and characters are exaggerated. So I guess defining this movie as a satire would come the closest. But then I wonder what it wants to criticize. Because the whole world agrees on Hitler and Nazis being bad and evil. Where is the point of making this movie? Actually now that I think of it characters are more ridiculed less exaggerated. To be satirical you need to exaggerate characters right? To me it seemed that they simply made up new Characters. Ridicules characters that barely have anything to do with the real historical people. Simply ridiculing characters is the job of comedy not parody  right? For a comedy movie though this movie simply isn't funny enough. So this movie is neither a satire nor comedy. I felt like waisting my time completely. I haven't been amused I haven't been entertained I didn't learn something gosh I wasn't even moved emotionally in any way. And that is the no.1 purpose of a movie in my opinion. This movie simply passed by without leaving anything behind.".

And this is just the beginning since the movie becomes more and more absurd as the actor becomes some sort of psychoanalyst to the Fuhrer talk about stereotypes the character of Grunbaum has Weak Jew written all over it. Reportedly the director decided to make this film after seeing Downfall and feeling that Hitler and the other Nazi top leaders were respected too much in that movie. He wanted to make a comedy where Hitler would be ridiculed. One can see this intention from the start when Hitler is shown in a grotesque makeup. Fair enough. I have no problem with a movie mocking Hitler. The problem I see is that the plot is offensive and ridiculous. You just can't mix the Holocaust with a comedy. The great Dictator looks terrible now but Chaplin at least has the excuse that he filmed it before the Holocaust. To give an idea in its let's have a humor out of the third Reich theme it's as offensive as Roberto Benigni's Life is Beautiful. And the fact that the director of this is Jewish itself can hardly justify it. Note playing Grunbaum is the actor who was the Stasi officer in The Lives of Others. Sadly soon after this film was released he died of cancer.".

However there is a lot more to it than that.The film like 'Land and Freedom' gives a much needed insight into a very dirty war that has largely been forgotten.From an accuracy perspective the equipment and weapons etc were spot on for the period. Contrast this to 'Tea with Mussolini' and 'Atonement' to name but a few. The film also shows many scenes of endlessly trudging through the mountains looking for an elusive enemy with no apparent end in sight. If you read Legionnaire by Simon Murray or Wayward Legionnaire by James William Worden you will quickly discover that that was exactly what the war in Algeria was like. Finally the film shows the FLN to be every bit as brutal as the French which they were. This is a nice change from the usual blame it all on the white man theme.Aside from material accuracy this film also brilliantly presents two very real dilemmas. The first was the French fighting against their former allies. Many FLN members had fought with the French against the Germans in WW II. See 'Days of Glory'. The second is the highly relevant subject of torture. On the one hand its use is highly immoral and barbaric but it is producing effective results.Overall an outstanding film about a subject that needs to be told. Now how about an accurate film on the Korean War and the French war in Indo China.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is nothing short of brilliant. L'ennemi Intime is set in Frenchoccupied Algeria in 1959 at the height of the insurgency. A French platoon is sent deep into enemy territory to find and liquidate the head of the insurgents called Slimane. Lieutenant Terrien a novice and a humanist is given charge of the platoon after its commander is accidentally killed by friendly fire. L'ennemi Intime is a little bit like The Battle of Algiers but set in the mountains of Kabylie Berber territory in Algeria. I first saw it at the Dubai Film Festival in December 07 and was completely blown away by it. It is so gripping and visceral. The film is an incredible commentary on the inhumanity of war how not matter how innocent and good one goes to war he is almost certain to become a beast and a murderer in the end. I highly recommend this film. Every soldier who is about to be deployed to a war zone should watch Ennemi Intime. Its simplest message is that war corrupts the human soul and there are no winners once the shooting stops.".

France has always been hiding its little political secrets and taboos and although Americans have been multiplying projects about the Vietnam wars and the Watergate France rarely make movies about politics. France hides itself behind the human rights. L'ENNEMI INTIME carries a heavy burden  to be the first major popular movie about the Algeria wars since THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS by Gillo Pontecorvo 1966. The objective is the same  the war still hides a huge taboo and Siri alongside Rotman his writer has tried to talk about it in a large way avoiding caricatures and ideologies upon which things wars usually define themselves. Lots of people in France are already accusing the movie of being spectacular. But all stories important stories once they've become an art form have to drain mythology and great figures. In the way of Leone and Cimino Siri draws archetypal soldiers torn apart between their nation the facts the day to day casualties of war and their own growing madness. L'ENNEMI INTIME is a true war movie in the American tradition as HELL IS FOR HEROES MEN IN WAR or ATTACK. One mission turns nightmare. People redefine their own persona through this mission. The action like in any war movie is a political ritual that put human beings on trial with themselves. Siri uses the visual force of APOCALYPSE NOW and the brutality of PREDATOR the scene with the falling trees to build a mean nervous cruel vision as dry as the movie is short and frontal 96 minutes. Spectacular means impact shock nervous attack. To wake up the minds and make them realize the importance of this war the movie had to be spectacular. The FLN arab liberation party is cruel. French soldiers are cruel. Arabs torture Arabs tortured by french torturing themselves. This is war. A new brilliant motion picture by Florent Siri making better movies each time.".

	schema:reviewBody "INTIMATE ENEMIES 2007 This French film from 2007 is one of the better films I've seen about the The FrenchAlgerian War. This conflict started in 1954 and continued till 1962.The French had just lost a war over a colony with the fight for IndoChina. They were determined not to lose another. The Algerian FLN fought a largely guerrilla war from the countryside. The French responded in kind with small unit teams combing the country. The war was known to be quite brutal with torture etc being used by both sides. The conflict was as much of a Civil War as it was an attempt to hold a colony. Many Algerians sided with the French and fought in French Army units.This film starts out in the summer of 1959 in the inland mountains. A French platoon is based at an outpost charged with keeping the peace in the surrounding villages. They go out every day on patrol hunting groups of FLN guerrillas. Every so often they ambush the enemy and every so often they are ambushed. The war seems to be one long battle of attrition.After the platoon Lieutenant is killed in a botched operation the unit receives a fresh officer right out of France. The new man Benot Magimel is soon in conflict with the unit's veteran Sergeant Albert Dupontel. Dupontel who had been in Vietnam fighting the Viet Cong knows one has to be as hard as the enemy is. The Lieutenant learns quickly when the platoon gets in a battle with a FLN group smuggling weapons. The FLN had all been dressed as women and had nearly gotten by the patrol till the veteran Dupontel spotted the deception.The following weeks sees the platoon engaged in several firefights with various FLN groups. During one of these fights the French come close to being wiped out. They need to call in air support which hit the FLN with some large napalm bombs. Afterwards the patrol captures a man for questioning. The local intelligence officer is soon at work with batteries and electric cables. This of course does not go well with the new officer Magimel. The method though proves effective and valuable information is collected.Every night the men at the outpost get stinking drunk and count the days till they get back to France. When one of the patrols finds a friendly village massacred they respond in kind on another village. The war is boiling down to one bloody event leading into another. Needless to say there is not going to be a happy ending here.This film is well worth looking up in my opinion. The cinematography is excellent and the battle scenes well handled. The air support action is topflight with De Havilland Vampire aircraft dropping the napalm.".

	schema:reviewBody "L'Ennemi Intime is simply a nonmovie. What does it take to dish out such an unidentifiable cinematographic object? Producer blindness too proud to see the vacuum in the project too proud to have it challenged by some trustworthy colleague.L'Ennemi Intime first digital shot sets it all  it is not linked with the beginning of narration and the only purpose is to have the movie title pompously emerge from the horizon. Let's forget it. What's the story? A French platoon is stuck in the middle of The Undeclared War in Algeria. It's not really that they are stuck but there's a sensation they're alone to fight an oh so absurd war. Actually they are the French colonial power struggling against the ever elusive rebel forces who will fight to death for their freedom for Algerian independence.The subtext is clear if you know this part of History yet the political aspect is buried under the makeshift of a script I mean the episodic screenplay... well let's say it more bluntly the treatment in pictures.Would you believe the storyline is only made of a series of missions that are loosely connected fight the rebels round the corner? What else? Nothing. The pitched opposition between the idealistically young Lieutenant and the experienced tough Sergeant is not an opposition only an easygoing working relationship. Lieutenant Terrien Magimel is a bland character with no character arc whatsoever Sergeant Dougnac Dupontel is basically more interesting but nothing interesting happens to him after the opening sequence before Terrien is brought in to helm the bunch.Except for a couple of FrenchAlgerian characters there's almost nobody to root for. The absence of story is all the more palpable as locations are great and the cinematography is excellent. In the end there's a gigantic gap between the graphical aspirations of the director and the inaction imposed over by the script.Obviously the idea was to team up a promising director Siri who would deliver the images and a documentary screenwriter Rotman who would deliver the contents historical and controversial yet accurate. The problem is Siri is light on screenwriting and only understands action while Rotman is overwhelmed by his historical knowledge and doesn't know how to write fiction i.e. loosen the ties of historical accuracy to tell an engaging story featuring interesting fictional characters.BOTTOM LINE. Cinematography and locations excellent. All the rest is not worth watching.".

Producer blindness too proud to see the vacuum in the project too proud to have it challenged by some trustworthy colleague.L'Ennemi Intime first digital shot sets it all  it is not linked with the beginning of narration and the only purpose is to have the movie title pompously emerge from the horizon. Let's forget it. What's the story? A French platoon is stuck in the middle of The Undeclared War in Algeria. It's not really that they are stuck but there's a sensation they're alone to fight an oh so absurd war. Actually they are the French colonial power struggling against the ever elusive rebel forces who will fight to death for their freedom for Algerian independence.The subtext is clear if you know this part of History yet the political aspect is buried under the makeshift of a script I mean the episodic screenplay... well let's say it more bluntly the treatment in pictures.Would you believe the storyline is only made of a series of missions that are loosely connected fight the rebels round the corner? What else? Nothing. The pitched opposition between the idealistically young Lieutenant and the experienced tough Sergeant is not an opposition only an easygoing working relationship. Lieutenant Terrien Magimel is a bland character with no character arc whatsoever Sergeant Dougnac Dupontel is basically more interesting but nothing interesting happens to him after the opening sequence before Terrien is brought in to helm the bunch.Except for a couple of FrenchAlgerian characters there's almost nobody to root for. The absence of story is all the more palpable as locations are great and the cinematography is excellent. In the end there's a gigantic gap between the graphical aspirations of the director and the inaction imposed over by the script.Obviously the idea was to team up a promising director Siri who would deliver the images and a documentary screenwriter Rotman who would deliver the contents historical and controversial yet accurate. The problem is Siri is light on screenwriting and only understands action while Rotman is overwhelmed by his historical knowledge and doesn't know how to write fiction i.e. loosen the ties of historical accuracy to tell an engaging story featuring interesting fictional characters.BOTTOM LINE. Cinematography and locations excellent. All the rest is not worth watching.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie starts out with a corrupt Brit PM giving away the position of some Brit soldiers in Afghanistan who supposedly killed the Saudi king's jihadi nephew to his assistant in exchange for not canceling an 80 billion arms deal. They are expendable grunts in the kind of brutal treacherous exchange that one could imagine happening but immediately the figure is outlandish no single arms deal has ever been 80 billion America has probably given that much to Israel in the last half century. John RhysDavies of Lord of the Rings is almost too over the top as the blustery bastard PM casually dispensing with the lives of his underlings as the plot unravels. The coordinates of the title are annoyingly round numbers military units don't travel 40 miles just to get to even numbered GPS coordinates.Heather Peace plays Capt. Jill Mandelson captured by oh so evil Taliban as the only survivor after her commando unit is wiped out and later also as her twin sister in Britain. The torture scenes are the lamest and most unpleasant of the movie and the whole thing drags there she is soooo tough she takes months to just give up her name claiming to be a CNN reporter. While relatively slickly shot it has the look of a TV movie Peace has starred in multiple TV series London Burning Coronation St The Chase and sometimes waxes too arrogant and selfconfident. French Intelligence are the heroes of this flick a nice touch considering all the grief they received from America for being right about Iraq monitoring the betrayal attack capture then arranging Mandelson's rescue through their extensive Middle East contacts. Aurlie Bargme is quite credible and appealing as the sexy cool concerned French agent injecting some decency into the stew. Back in England Mandelson is ordered killed by the King's adviser because the PM finding the guilty soldiers were already aboard the Nimitz gave them the coordinates of another unit and the PM again dubiously obliges to help in her domestic assassination lest the King wreak vengeance on his adviser for the foulup.Almost bailed out on this in the first 15 minutes but it gets better as the plot moves along. Her sister an exIntelligence operative discovers what is happening with the aid of French Intelligence and sets up an elaborate wildly implausible plot to kidnap the PM's assistant Sarah played by Marina Sirtis Councilor Deanna Troi of Star Trek and torture her live on the Internet with a slowacting poison. Over a day Sis somehow demands apologies for Gulf War Syndrome and the Invasion of Iraq without ever getting to the pointed question of her sister till the assistant is 1 hours from death. Luckily she's a computer whiz so all the PM's men can't find her but wouldn't they simply immediately yank the live TV network coverage? Directorproducer Tristan Loraine a former airline pilot and documentary producer deserves credit for at least allegorically calling attention to the monstrous lies used to start the Iraq War which still provokes great rage in Britain and have engendered a serious investigation of Tony Blair. In America it has been whitewashed and categorically ignored by the media Congressand Obama it is simply not mentioned but there is a deep subterranean sickness at the vicious manipulation and betrayal by Bush and the neocons to start that misbegotten invasion and the vast cost it has entailed in lives and treasure now estimated at 23 trillion with 30 years of disability payments.Still this is a weak movie save your movie minutes for something a bit more edifying.".

However instead of presenting us with a Tony Blair clone we have an over the hill John Rhys Davies playing a gruff Yorkshire PM. Gosh we have not had one of those for 40 years in the UK since Harold Wilson called it a day.I realise Davies in real life is a right winger who probably frothed at the mouth of New Labour occupying Downing Street and introducing legislation such as Human Rights Act and the Minimum Wage but he is all wrong in the days when our leaders tend to be youngish Oxbridge types. Anyhow why pick on Blair? The Afghanistan and Iraq wars were voted by all the politicians in the House of Commons and they decided to go to war based on the facts they had and its the politicians own fault if they opted not to be more questioning.In fact why drag Iraq into it? As far as the plot is concerned it's set in Afghanistan remember the place that was a training a ground for Al Qaeda that led to 911. The nephew of an Arab king has been killed there. Little mention is made as to what he was doing in Afghanistan. It has to be assumed he was visiting a terrorist training ground. The British PM in order to safeguard a 80 billion Yes that is supposedly an accurate figure arms deal with the Arabs the British PM betrays the army unit that killed the nephew. Strangely I cannot remember New Labour doing any such thing. But never mind let's remember the films wants to critique illegal wars.We then have a torture scene in Afghanistan which is concerning and slightly bizarre as to the torture methods used seems to consist of acupuncture. Well if you have Afghans torturing a British servicewoman which includes threats of rape and amputations you are really going to get the viewers on your side with your anti illegal wars agenda aren't you!Back to the film the servicewoman confesses that she is not a reporter but SAS. She is released and the PM in order to cover his tracks orders her to be killed by the Arabs. The Arabs in this film have an undercover group of busty Arabic assassins who pose as whores and one easy on the eye killer assassin has been tasked to carry out the deed.Our servicewoman also happens to have a twin sister who decides to look into this further. It just happens to be convenient that a French outfit have been bugging the the Arabs the PM and tells the twin sister about the dastardly deeds of the British government. The twin kidnaps the PM's spin doctor Marina Sirtis and tortures her live on TV via a snake venom. The PM sends more people in to find the twin and also eliminate the spin doctor as she knows too much.On the plus side the film has managed to fit several shots of cleavage. You would have thought in a past life the director made Carry On films. As far as politics is concerned it's naive to the extreme. The plot is immensely silly and the low budget means that the PM is wondering around in a country house the type that tends to be used in porno films which is probably the reason how they managed to acquire some of the busty ladies I presume.If ever there was a list of 100 worse British films of modern times this would be a contender but might luckily it might find itself lucky to be excluded because there are worse British films than this.Thankfully there are a few familiar faces and the lead actress who plays twin sisters is a familiar face having appeared in programs such as Waterloo Road.".

The British Prime minister isn't anything like Tony Blair or Prince Williams he's an over the top caricature of a James BOND supercriminal mastermind No Mr. BOND I expect you to Die!. He's so over the top he makes the ARAB royalty and jihads seem like sane reasonable individuals in comparison. Another thing this whole film seemed as if it was filmed at some plush English manor including the Afghanistan parts. Oh and dressing up Arabs in British uniforms doesn't make them Italian Special Forces it just makes them JIHADIST stunt doubles who have to work twice as hard to earn their checks. One thing the women in this film were flat stomached flat butted but not flat chested. I'm not saying they were whipping around 48DD but they filled some bras here. Even the buff kickboxing trainer and political aid MILF also had a nice set. What this film lacked in action it more than made up for in BOOBALAGE You found this review".

	schema:reviewBody "31 NORTH 62 EAST is a low budget British thriller about the war in the Middle East Afghanistan in this instance. It's a political story about the ways in which corruption can exploit those on the ground and even lead to a murder plot. Unfortunately for this film the script is quite nonsensical positing Britain's own Prime Minister as the master villain of the piece quite happy to sell out members of his own armed forces for the sake of a trade deal.Had the villain been a junior minister with the ability to manipulate the system then it might have been more convincing but giving the Prime Minister power to do this just makes it a laugh. It doesn't help that this film is entirely cheap without any action sequences in it whatsoever in fact when something does threaten to happen such as the car scene with the two women the film randomly cuts away to the aftermath. It's not totally bad as one extended torture sequence is extremely gruelling and a few familiar faces like Craig Fairbrass Marina Sirtis and John RhysDavies show up to pick up their pay cheques. The casting director has also gone out of his way to cast attractive actresses in support. In the end though 31 NORTH 62 EAST is simply a forgettable occasionally ridiculous little thriller.".

Italian Special Forces looking completely amateur wearing illfitted undone fatigues  S.A.S. soldiers looking like a group of 50somethings pretending to play warThis movie tries so hard to be serious yet comes up with the above examples and that is just a short example of a long list of why this director is a complete joke. He has done zero homework on any facet of the movie he is making and the events and scenes he is trying to portray. Obviously NO military adviser was on set to make any of it realistic. The action scenes what few there were would have been better choreographed by a group of children. Editing was performed by my dog. Decent actors Davies tries too hard to be a reincarnation of Churchill and Sirtis who just looks old and tired must really be hardup for a paycheque to be dragged into this mess.

But this film is awfully uninspiring and the story of a family who goes bankrupt is annoyingly repetitive. Here the light romance turns into a cheesy melodrama and the director seems to be confused enough to not know what to do. There are of course touching moments and the songs are good but the portrayal of a family in times of trouble is terribly handled and is full of regular ageold clichs. Saif and Rani do their best but can't save the flawed script. The dialogues are cheap and overly emotional and the reality nonsense is pathetic.

She was very cute early on as she fell in love with the cabbie and she was very good later on as the burdened woman  the only reason to see the film. The songs were mediocre the racing scenes were well done except for Saif flashing his teeth as though he was in some comedy routine. There were supposedly heartbreaking moments but you felt not much as it was all so formulaic and often verged on caricature. There was not much of a story and it is no wonder the film did poorly. New York landscapes and the Manhattan skyline a new sport to focus on  these do not work without a decent plot.So watch it if you are a die hard Rani fan  otherwise avoid.".

That after being a super racer for years earning certainly quite a lot of money Saif has still not paid up the house he and his family live in?

I liked everything about this movie and the music was superb. Also the actors played a very great role which includes Saif Ali Khan Rani Mukherjee Javed Jaffrey and all the people who were part of the movie. And it surely matches up to its tag line Don't worry be happy. Its a very good lesson for people especially Indian people as they get very tensed out really fast and look at the negative side of their lives. This movie teaches us how to tackle these everyday and reallife situations. And behind all that to always be happy as we never know if we will be alive the next day. The overall mood of the movie was not tragic at all and that's what I liked especially about it. SRK is my favorite actor but he nowadays only appears in emotional movies so he should also appear in these kinds of movies and I am telling you I seriously hate tragic movies. Because you know in India people watch those Ekta Kapoor's daily soaps which has nothing but mostly tragedy. I say if TV serials and movies are all going to be tragic then there will be no fun. Hats off to this movie and I hope bollywood produces more of these kinds of movies so that watching movie can be fun again.".

	schema:reviewBody "That's one of the messages embedded in this very glossy yet hard hitting Dramedy from the Yash Raj camp it's their first release of the year and not a bad one might I add. Siddharth Anand clearly still very hungover Salaam Namaste hits it and drives one home for the winning team with his plucky characters plummy roles and eyecatching cinematography. At first I have to say I was quite alarmed at the pace of the movie and not to mention the annoying gimmicks because it was almost like either the writers or the director himself was nervous at his sophomoric attempt. They seemed to be trying everything to make sure they kept the audience's attention but thankfully they realise the meaty story they have to tell which allows them to ease up later. The Meet Cute between the two main characters almost seemed forced but thankfully Rani Mukherjiwho plays Radhika nicknamed Shona by her lover later on in the film does damage control with her effortless ability to not only emote but create a comfort zone for her costarswho might I say realise earlier on that they all should be following her lead which they do throughout the entire film. Saif Ali Khan plays her love interest Ranvirwho is nicknamed RV by a wellmeaning friend earlier on in the film. The film is narrated from start until halfway through by Priyanicknamed Princess by her parents she's daughter to RV  Radhika and they also have a son named Champ and a dog named Bruno so those who hate children in Hindi films should be prepared because the kids have very pivotal supporting roles. RV a tirechanger at the New York Racewaylet me just say that I didn't think NY had a raceway until I got home and checked and found one in Riverhead NY but that's miles away from NYC where RV lives and oh nevermind... when he receives the opportunity of a lifetime to become a racecar driver which he does and excels. Before this time he meets Radhika a beautiful piano playing IndoNewYorker socialite whose Ipod he breaks after sharing a cab with her and the sparks fly. A chanced meeting throws them together again and Radhika demands that he pays her 50 to replace her broken Mp3 playerwhich I must interject that the cheapest Ipod the shuffle costs 100 and hers looked like a Nano but whatever... RV pressed for time invites her to the raceway and tells her he will give her the money if he wins the race and Radhika in turn becomes his loudest cheerleader there I loved that scene by the way especially when she started playing the drums. I'm a Tabla girl myself so you know that totally rocked seeing that. Naturally he wins the race and wins Radhika's heart through a series of loves songs including the very sentimental 'Hey Shona' Shona is Bengali for Sweet they marryand yes their white wedding is truly a must see LOL! and start living the good life. Sounds like a fairytale doesn't it? Princess actually asks this question during her narration and it couldn't have been more poignant. All is not as it seems on the outside. Radhika has hidden the fact that her father disapproves of her husband and his lifestyle a warning that will come back to haunt her later on during the film. The fast life soon catches up with RV in a series of catastrophic events that not only affect him but his entire family and their financial security. This ultimately tests the limits of love trust and endurance the couple have for one another. Look for strong performances by Saif Ali Khan and Rani Mukherjeeespecially Rani who should add another feather to her hat with her standout performance in the film.The Highs include 1. The Indian Crodile Dundee dude from Salaam Namaste cleans up and plays RV's best friend. And he scores big time because he's still just as hilarious.2. the tribute to the cast of RENT with Ab To Forever which is arguably the best song in the entire film thanks to a borrow from Britney Spears's 'Me against the music.'3. Rani Mukherjee loses a significant amount of weight halfway through the movie to convey the hard time her character is going through.4. The speedway races.5. Finally Bollywood gets the film extras right! They were all so good. There was actually one lady the JFK passenger who did an exceptionally awesome job at portraying such a believable extra.6. The kids especially the girl who plays Priya aka Princess.7. Rani Mukherjee Drunk. LOL!The Lows include 1. The Preity Zinta wannabe they cast as Radhika's best friend. Thank God she like like like LIKED herself out of the film early.2. Playing mix and match with New York locations that don't exist. Um 180th street is in the Bronx not at Times Square!!!! Okay let's forget about the raceway what about the children's school which was clearly Brooklyn College which has no private children school on its campus just to mention a few.3. The City of Newyork offers free or lowcost insurance for all residents regardless of status maybe the writers should have done more research. Somebody at the hospital should have called social services on the parents.4. With all those insane races at excessive speeds through the city that RV did you would think that the NYPD does not exist her. Not true at all.".

Radhika has hidden the fact that her father disapproves of her husband and his lifestyle a warning that will come back to haunt her later on during the film. The fast life soon catches up with RV in a series of catastrophic events that not only affect him but his entire family and their financial security. This ultimately tests the limits of love trust and endurance the couple have for one another. Look for strong performances by Saif Ali Khan and Rani Mukherjeeespecially Rani who should add another feather to her hat with her standout performance in the film.The Highs include 1. The Indian Crodile Dundee dude from Salaam Namaste cleans up and plays RV's best friend. And he scores big time because he's still just as hilarious.2. the tribute to the cast of RENT with Ab To Forever which is arguably the best song in the entire film thanks to a borrow from Britney Spears's 'Me against the music.'3. Rani Mukherjee loses a significant amount of weight halfway through the movie to convey the hard time her character is going through.4. The speedway races.5. Finally Bollywood gets the film extras right! They were all so good. There was actually one lady the JFK passenger who did an exceptionally awesome job at portraying such a believable extra.6. The kids especially the girl who plays Priya aka Princess.7. Rani Mukherjee Drunk. LOL!The Lows include 1. The Preity Zinta wannabe they cast as Radhika's best friend. Thank God she like like like LIKED herself out of the film early.2. Playing mix and match with New York locations that don't exist. Um 180th street is in the Bronx not at Times Square!!!! Okay let's forget about the raceway what about the children's school which was clearly Brooklyn College which has no private children school on its campus just to mention a few.3. The City of Newyork offers free or lowcost insurance for all residents regardless of status maybe the writers should have done more research. Somebody at the hospital should have called social services on the parents.4. With all those insane races at excessive speeds through the city that RV did you would think that the NYPD does not exist her. Not true at all.";

The lead character played by Saif is named RV face some bad days in his life due to his carelessness about life. But at the end with his heroic attitude he overcomes it. Thats a simple two line story. Off course he was supported by his wife Radhika Rani Mukhejee and his friend Harry Javed Jaffery. Even his two children are so helpful that they find out that they are poor and start skipping their lunches to save money. It is actually at this point the movie loses the control. Off course everyone goes through bad patch but this bad patch? Kuchh limit rakho yaar. And finally as usual some accident with the child which makes situation worse. Saif Rani and Javed have done a good job. Saif is now too much predictable in this kind of movies. Tell me the difference between his acting in this movie SalaamNamaste and HumTum. Rani should start worrying about her age. Though she is still not old for the mother of twos she is certainly not of the age of wearing minis. Director and writer could have tried some different things to make the audience more comfortable. The storyline takes turns exactly where it needs to take turns. No surprises. Rani refusing money from her father Saif refusing to beg from his exboss Javed kicking the money and safe future for his friend these and many more are the typical scenescharacteristics shown by people in Hindi movies. The only surprise I got is at the end when Saif actually blown up his opponents car. I thought he will drop the idea of revenge or may be as shown in movie Car will help that racer to complete the race. But this doesn't happen. Thats different. Over and all this is a good movie to watch with family and then to forget about it after coming out of theater.".

	schema:reviewBody "it has nothing new to offer as it's utterly predictable. It's got those usual songs and dances crying and laughing outdoor locations etc. Siddharth Anand's second directorial effort shows improvement over his first the first one being a ripoff of so many films and sitcoms. One thing I cannot understand is why he or Yashraj films chose to shoot the film in America? This could have easily been made in India giving us more of an insight of the beautiful country. Don't we see New York in Hollywood movies and American sitcoms? Yashraj seems to be embarrassed to show India these days. Are they trying to suggest that India does not have locations worth showing in their films? I really liked Saif and Rani's chemistry in 'Hum Tum' which is why I gave this one a go. I wasn't disappointed where the two actors were concerned. Saif sort of repeats his 'Salaam Namaste'  'Hum Tum' persona but does a decent job. One may wonder if he's trying to be Salman. Why does he have to take his shirt off in every film? Rani is brilliant and looks supersexy in her new look. Javed Jaffrey finally gets a decent part in a long time. Angelina Idnani is good in her scenes but she shouldn't have done the narration. Ali Haji just tries to be cute. Victor Banerjee has about three small scenes. Yet he makes his presence felt.The technological aspect stands out. Sound effects visuals and cinematography are almost top notch. Background score is intrusive at times. Songs are forgettable but fit nicely with the screenplay.I watched 'Ta Ra Rum Pum' with little expectation. In any case I wasn't expecting a realistic flick. Hence I enjoyed most parts of it. I wouldn't say it's anywhere near the best films of 2007 but still watchable. It does have its share of excessive melodrama as almost all recent Yashraj films do and dejavu coincidences or accidents. In one sentence this is more of a family movie something you wouldn't mind watching with kids around.".

The acting of Saif and Rani was up to the mark. Especially Rani's emotions were outstanding how she handled the scenario of the movie was amazing. Javed Jaffery also played his part perfect. And how we can forget the junior actors they were also dissolved in their roles. Overall the movie is really worth to watch.".

	schema:headline " The great Indian family rendering great messages";
	schema:reviewBody "Ta Ra Rum Pum tells the story of a US based Indian cab driver turned car racer  Rajveer Singh aka RV whose fate provided him the right channel to showcase his talent of fast driving through Hariprasad aka Harry Javed Jaafery. He went on to win 50 high profile races and made enormous money married the love of his life  Raadhika nicknamed as Shona Rani Mukherjee and got two lovely kids when the illfate struck him and his rival in profession masterminded his accident during a race. The real story of this movie starts with the aftermath of that accident. RV survives but loses something as precious as life  his selfconfidence. The haunting moments of that mishap have taken on his nerves not allowing him to reach his peak in any race. The speed of his driving breaks down the moment the bygone painful moments start haunting him. Now he is scared of picking up the required speed during any race. And the result is obvious. He fails. After winning 50 races prior to his accident he goes on to lose 10 in a row post his accident.The world does not belong to the losers. A loser is bound to lose money resources recognition support opportunities almost everything. RV also heads for the same destiny because he is no longer a winner. He has to digest the harsh reality of being a loser. But one thing he has not lost  the faith of his wife in him and his abilities. She has loved him in his riches. She loves him in his poverty too. She had married her against the wishes of her rich father and now in the difficult times she is not ready to accept any parental help and hurt the selfrespect of her man. But the problem which is staring right into the face of both RV and Shona is even bigger than their poverty. Hitherto they have fostered their children luxuriously but now their offspring has to learn to live in the conditions polar different from what they are used to. How to convey it to the tender hearts ? The parents i.e. RV and Shona devise a plan to make their little son and little daughter accept the changed situation. They tell them that they are going to participate in a reality show whose requirement is to live in poverty and if they successfully spend their time in impoverished conditions they will win the show.RV Shona and the little ones shift from a palace like mansion to a small shack and start living under severe monetary constraints with RV becoming a cab driver again and Shona playing piano in the hotels and parties. The only thing that the parents cannot afford to lose is the good education of their children. Hence they work hard and arrange enough money to ensure that their kids are able to continue in their current school. Hardships do continue in terms of food clothes shelter and medical treatment. The zenith of their trouble comes when their little son needs a costly operation to survive. How to arrange the hefty sum ? RV's adversaries are happy about it mocking his helplessness and misfortune. The moment has come for RV to overpower the painful flashback and reenter the skin of the winner. Harry comes up with an opportunity which RV can encash to repulse the inching death of his son and the illfate of the whole family. Can he do it ? The movie underscores Indian family values and highlights the significance of saving alongwith earning. The lesson that RV learns the hard way is if you spend every penny you earn without any saving for the unforeseen difficult times those times will hit you harder than normal. The movie underscores the significance of wife's love and support for the husband when he is not the winner in the worldly life and her standing by him in the tough times. Shona's protecting her husband's selfrespect when the days are no longer sunny for him is exemplary. Such wife only is able to pave the way for the return of happy times for the family later. The plot of the movie has been inspired by certain Hollywood movies. Cinematic liberties have been taken aplenty and the movie is melodramatic in some parts. The filmmaker conveniently forgot that impoverished people can't wear designer clothes. Anyway the positives of the movie outnumber its negatives. It is interesting from beginning to end and several scenes leave a deep emotional impact on the viewer.Shot lavishly in the USA this movie is technically superb. VishalShekhar's music is earsoothing. I like its title track the most in which the animated characters appear with the human characters.Saif Ali Khan and Rani Mukerjee make an ideal onscreen pair. Both have complimented each other very well and lit up the screen with their marvellous performances. The child artists alongwith Javed Jaffery and others have also done their parts perfectly.So here comes the great Indian family which sticks together and renders some great messages for life. I don't know why this decent family entertainer did not score on the box office. For me at least it has a repeat value.".

Unfortunately the material they are given to work with isn't good. Mandy Moore isn't the best actress but her lines aren't really that great so can't blame her. Kellan Lutz's character isn't convincing. He doesn't look like he is ready to settle down at all more like some big frat boy. Jessica Szhor's character is more likable than in Gossip Girl. James Brolin is a bit miscast. It's nice to see Jane Seymour acting again  haven't seen her since Wedding Crashers.Overall watch it once if you are fan of the cast but bear in mind it just isn't that good.".

With some movie even if script is not strong performances makes movie strong but it fell flat in that department as well. Mandy Moore delivered same boring acting chops she showcased in previous rom com movies like License to Wed  Because I said so. Trust me if you play her scenes from all these movies you won't be able to figure out which scenes is from which movies she is the same annoying winning romcom wannabee queen. Mandy Moore should stick to animated version of herself like Tangled. Love Wedding Marriage is just another disastrous attempt after License to Wed and Because I said so to become a RomCom queen. Kellan Lutz is good when he is shirtless because his acting is atrocious nowonder he has almost nonspeaking part in Twilight Saga. Jessica Szore is Gorgeous I can never figure out why she always looked so awful in Gossip Girl? Overall Love Wedding Marriage is a dreadful 90mints of romcom you defiantly want to avoid.".

	schema:reviewBody "I like light romance comedies but what I found most unlikable about this particular movie was Mandy Moore's character's very onesided personality. She's been in too many movies where her characters have been irritating onesided primadonna types. It's unfortunate given that she is so attractive. It's incredibly irritating to see a protagonist force her vision of what her parent's marriage should be. It was pounded again and again just irritating and there was no depth to it such as her showing a painful side as to why she needs to 'fix' things ie some sense of childhood neglect nor did it show her maturing into someone who wants their parents to be happy in their own way without somebody society etc telling them what they 'should' be happy with. Who's to say anybody can tell another what makes them happy? Can't a couple go their separate ways for a few days or months to discover their individual selves? I was more pleased with Jane Seymour's character to experience a life grow do new things travel etc apart from being some wifeservant. At least with Mandy Moore's character she could have had some evolution in her efforts not just that last second fake pill overdose shenanigan to manipulate her parents to be more altruistic instead of dominatingmanipulating.The conflict with the husband regarding the manipulation was well played. Mandy's character manipulates a fake lifeanddeath situation to deceive his mother into not wanting to be on her own for 6 months out of her life for once. Mandy's husband called her out on this blatant manipulation and I felt that was the most honest part of the movie how shallow selfish the manipulation was to judge for other people what 'should' make them happy that it involves some stereotype instead of personal discoveryindependence. The resolution of the conflict came out of nowhere. The dialogue started with Mandy's character trying to apologize but was interrupted as if an apology or personal changegrowth was completely unnecessary. The things the husband wanted from the wife to accept in him was actually nothing to do with why he was angry in the first place. She gets interrupted from her apology he asks to be accepted they kiss end credits. She never got the chance to apologize and so that almost says that it was unnecessary superficial. Messages like that are dangerous. Even with the movie being a comedy.I found Mandy's character overall annoyingirritating and given that she felt no remorse for manipulating her parents that she had no soul. I don't think it was Ms. Moore's fault as that has more to do with the script and directing hinting at emotion providing pause reflection etc that the director simply did not provide. These romantic comedies that have such absurd conflict only to end in even more absurd resolution are ultimately dangerous stories of fantasy that even a lighthearted audience should not see. It only can give terrible impressions in a relationship bad example and make relationships more painful and illusive. At least a comedy could teach the viewers something. There was no lesson of compromise of heartfelt communication of acceptance of change of growth etc  the conflict was sudden and the resolution was even more sudden.Normally I don't mind watching romcoms multiple times but i don't think this is enjoyable to watch again. The characters were too irritating to enjoy. It reminds me of the irritation I felt with another Mandy Moore movie License to Wed where the conflict felt so incredibly contrivedoutofnowhere and the helplessness of the characters to augment the ridiculous conflict just made it really annoying. I actually liked her better in Swinging With The Finkels even though in that movie I found the shallow apathetic and loyaltyless husband quite irritating.".

People will be able to delve into the story and follow the lives of the characters portrayed by a fantastic cast. The character of Ava was perfect for Mandy Moore. She and Kellan Lutz had great chemistry throughout the movie. It was nice seeing Jane Seymour playing the role of Mandy Moore and Jessica Szohr's mom. There are some woman out there that are in the shoes of her character. After several decades of marriage to man you love what would you do if you found out that he had an affair let alone fathered a child from another woman? Of course he didn't know about the child until after Ava's wedding but at least he stepped up and tried to do something about it. All in all the movie followed the romantic movie recipe LoveConflictHappy EndingGreat Romantic Movie. For a chickflick I give it two thumbs up. I have seen in 3 times and honestly I would watch it again. Keep making movies like this...there is definitely an audience out there for these types of movies.".

I don't think it will do very well in the cinema because most people don't appreciate a good story for just that. They want to see some action in the film but this film does not have much of that in the physical sensebut maybe in the intellectual  grate movie....".

It may not be action packed but it makes up for this in intrigueit kept me watching and is a must see for genuine movie buffs.The acting at the first couple of minutes had me a little worried but after that i thought the film flowed and it soon eased my worries i am notorious to friends for giving up on movies before they begin.I would not recommend this film for kids it would be more suited to anyone over the age of 25 but hey what do i know you can make up your own mind by watching it in the cinemasOverall i rated this film 910".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie when it premiered at the Rhode Island International film festival. It was the main attraction of a scifi block that I went to without any knowledge of what the file was about save the IMDb plot summary. What I saw was much different than what I expected and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.The film starts very simply with the main character John packing his truck and then joined by colleagues of his who have come to wish him farewell. His colleagues however cannot help but express how puzzled they are about him leaving since he has established himself very well as a professor and is well liked. Each time he is asked John either avoids the question or gives an evasive answer. He eventually responds to them by posing a hypothetical question to the group which by now have been established as Ph.D.s in fields including anthropology biology and history about what a man would be like if he had lived since prehistoric times and had the appearance of the same age for sixteenthousand years. This question starts an innocent discussion but changes in tone as John implies more and more that the situation is not hypothetical. The group all have diverse reactions that become more intense as they pose questions to John regarding the story he has put forth.One of the producers who was in attendance described the film as a science fiction Twelve Angry Men and I found that statement to be very apropos. The focus of the story was the interaction of the people in the situation rather than the situation itself. You will find that as an audience member you are put in a similar position as John's colleagues in thinking about the logistical aspects of living for such a long time and what you would say if a friend came to you with the same story. The writer the late Jerome Bixby did this well by presenting people that could analyze the finer points of the hypothetical situation by being experts in many relevant fields. I highly recommend this film if you enjoy the more human side of science fiction or if you like pondering whatifs.".

I'm glad they could afford those actors. Kudos on the acquisition. But one element of this gem that I hold above all is the storyconcept.One of the things that eludes me as a writer how do you tell a story in one location? I've been trying to come up with a story that doesn't involve epic locations and special visual effects. I have a few ideas for movies that involve the subject matter of this movie but since I am a lowtono budget filmmaker I am concerned with how to express certain topics so frugally. I realize that it has to do with the dialogue and presentation of the story. This movie shows how one can tell a grand story with only one location.The subject matter is controversial. Some will hate this movie. Some will love it. But it is all based on verifiable sources. May be true... may not. However it is good food for the mind if one is open minded that is.It's hard to write a comment about such a movie of this genre that doesn't give it away and still expresses how much this movie has enthralled me! One of the main premises of the movie is What would you believe?. If a friend of yours came to you with information that unfolded your reality would you stick with dogma or have an open mind with what that friend of yours was saying? Could you let go of disbelief based on scientific fact enough to consider what your friend said might be true? I am definitely adding this to my collection.".

	schema:reviewBody "If I could vote for a less than zero this one would definitely deserve it. There is NO and I mean NOT ONE excuse for producing such a bad movie. Was it due to the low budget? I clearly doubt it. Take Christopher Nolan's Following for example and you see what you can get out of 70 minutes and almost nobudget.The story was predictable from the first moment he said that he was 14000 years old. I was kidding with a friend of mine and honestly telling him like Yeah wait up in the end he's Jesus himself. I fell of my chair when he really said that. The Characters are completely thoughtless and pseudointellectual. I am myself a student of psychology  and yes there are some major dorks in that field who still believe in fathercomplexes and childhood dramas as reason for just EVERYTHING  but Dr. Will Gruber is just a bad sketch of a psychologist. The same goes for every other character of this movie  one more stereotypical than the others. On top of that is the crazy Christian conservative  how could it be different  symbolized by an old mean woman. The biologist archaeologist and Tony Todd are also just poorly sketched intellectuals and at times I wondered if Bixby has ever seen a professor in his real life because the character traits are completely stereotypical and made out of thin air.My favorite character is Alexis Thorpe as Linda student hot and obviously crazy in love with her professor  who is just as nuts as everyone else with one exception he drives a bike and looks like a real rocker! yeaaaaah! how awesome is he? At one time at the end when they leave the place you can see Lindas blank ass when she gets up. My favorite moment of the movie.As for the great dialogues and memorable lines from this movieDan I would kill anyoneEdith after Dr. Gruber showed his gun Where did he get that? This Movie takes place in the USA an Edith was not so surprised about the giant crossbow in John's cabin... what the heck?I really do not want to waste too much time on this piece of crap but a few things need to be said.The plot is too transparent. The scientific facts are clearly out of a book and are used out of any context. The pseudointellectual conversations just seem way too posed. The ending is hilarious. As it turns out he is not only Jesus no he is also the father of the psychologist whoms wife died just yesterday and who has an obvious fathercomplex see my irony please and therefore dies too. There are some very uncommon gap fillers containing actions and reactions I have never ever observed at any point in my life from anyone. Another pain in the ass is that the acting is so bad that they really have to speak out every single feeling emotion whatsoever. Good acting makes the vocalization obsolete.In my opinion Bixby made everything wrong that one could possibly be wrong. And i DO NOT hate it just because of all the reasons the people who rate this film high are referring to namely shortness lack of action lack of location variety or intellectual demand because there are many many movies that i love who fulfill these characteristics.You want a low budget film that is great watch Following! You want a one location movie with intellectual demand watch Hard Candy You want a brilliant movie without any action watch Coffee and CigarettesTo all of you who are easily impressed by scientific talk that you may or may not understand watch the film again. keep in mind the stereotypical scientist. think one more time what these people are talking about and if in any rational way a conversation like this could be possible. if you still think yeah it is possible than i truly grief for America's universityelite.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had read the summary A college professor reveals that he is really a 14000 year old cave man. Outlandish premise but we are told that as this movie unfolds we may find it is so thought provoking that it may even seem plausible. Sounds like good filmmaking to me.Well I knew within 5 minutes that this movie was in trouble. In the first scene Cave Man's colleague offhandedly notices a signed Van Gogh painting stuffed between some boxes in the back of his truck. How convenient that he just happened to travel in the same circles as a famous historic figure. Okay I can suspend my disbelief surely a 14000 year old would have had some opportunities to meet some well known characters.You really begin to feel where this movie is heading when Cave Man's decision to reveal himself happens on the spur of the moment. One minute he's about to head out the door and the next he's telling them his secret. How do his friends react? After a few chuckles most of them become angry even enraged. Odd why don't they just laugh it off and leave? Apparently they're already so transfixed by his story which he's been telling for all of two minutes that they're almost convinced of its truth and are hoping for him to just say it ain't so and release them from this new upsidedown reality! Personally I would feel some sadness that a guy I'd known for years had come to believe in this delusion and I don't know many people that would feel different.But the story progresses and he begins to reveal more absurdities. Not only did he know Van Gogh he was on a first name basis with Hamurrabi. He travels to India and hey guess who he ran into? The Buddha whom he spends years studying under. It's so dumb you almost couldn't make this up. The more he tells the more upset his friends become to the point where one of them even calls a psychiatrist friend in the hopes of having him committed. As if you could commit someone simply because they believed in a wild tale not having made any threat whatsoever to themselves or others. They ask him one question after another always trying to hit him from some new angle demanding some shred of proof and rather providing answers he always counters with some can you really prove anything? philosophy. Deep deep stuff here.The big revelation towards the end is so insufferably stupid that it warrants only a pity laugh. This is not even entertaining in a B movie fashion. His explanation of how he learned under the Buddha to slow his metabolism to near the point of death just made me want to groan. These people sitting in the room with him they try so hard not to believe him. These poor college professors don't need much in the way of proofs. But we're not quite done. There's still one more surprise and it's so shocking it causes one of the characters to keel over with a heart attack. Sigh.. I wish that old clich would die of a heart attack once and for all.This movie is not so bad it's good. No it's just so bad. I truly am astonished by the high ratings given to it and I had to create an account just to write this comment. I can't help but think that anyone who finds this to be intellectual fodder is simply lacking an imagination.".

It's possible that it was due to bad direction. I could almost hear the director sayingYou should be really angry here.... Ok that take was good but can you be angrier?. Really bad stuff.

There was no chemistry or connection between the actors and they all seemed like they were desperate to act rather than live truthfully in the given circumstances. Acting 101 was not observed. It's possible that it was due to bad direction. I could almost hear the director sayingYou should be really angry here.... Ok that take was good but can you be angrier?. Really bad stuff. That said I respect anyone who completes a project but I just think that if you're gonna do it do it well.";

But this is like saying that if you built a car perfectly you could reduce its chance of having an accident to zero when in fact the probability of the car having an accident is not a function solely of the car it also depends upon the environment. In the same way the chance of mutation is dependent upon the environment such as ionising radiation and mutagens and thus the mutations could not be entirely stopped by his genome.However many scifi films have shaky scientific basis so we may excuse this. Then there is the fact that he doesn't scar which would have to be unrelated to the previous genome modification but again we can excuse this as it isn't a major issue.The part that really irritated me was when it continued to peddle such misconceptions like that people still thought the Earth was flat at the time of Columbus even though that hadn't been a serious viewpoint since at least the days of Eratosthenes some one thousand years before. At one point he also attributes his fortuitous luck in not succumbing to disease to the idea that the 'Water and food were so much purer back then' meaning neolithic times when this is just patently false and plays to the prejudices of the New Age pseudointellectuals that seem to worship this film. We are much better off today in the age of quality control and water treatment than we were then even if there is the occasional gripe about HFCS or food intolerances.The final straw that proved just how crappy the film really is came when he reveals that he is in fact Jesus and spent time with the Buddha etc. by which point I was seriously wondering whether all the positive reviews of this movie were in fact the work of a Moriarty of trolls.In conclusion the movie had some promise but was wrecked by poor acting and a host of basic scientific and historical mistakes. The movie seems to be popular only because it plays on New Age notions of the 'pure' neolithic times and the apparent simplicity of religion. If you want a good cerebral experience then read a book there must be dozens of scifi stories which explore similar themes but in greater depth and without the patronising attitude. Even some nonfiction works touch on similar themes I would strongly recommend those by Carl Sagan for example.".

And the fact that everything is taking place in a small living room in front of a fire place among a small group of people like in the theatre makes it even more special. It is certainly one of the movies that will provoke endless discussions. Some may hate it due to the controversial issues that it is dealing with but if you watch it with an open mind you cannot but admit that everything is possible. After all what is history and religion other than our current knowledge of what happened thousand of years ago and how it was captured through the eyes and hands of other people. Even the science that we know today is just a way to interpret the natural phenomena with the knowledge that we currently hold knowing pretty well that if the situations change or new discoveries will be made then we will have to discard the old knowledge and adopt the new one. Overall I believe the movie is truly ingenious and mind challenging and I strongly recommend it to those who keep seeking alternative answers to long standing questions that are dealing with history religion science!".

The dialogue is both predictable and unrealistic I've never met people who are so uninterested in themselves they'll spend an entire afternoon at a party without ever talking about their own lives but this bunch obediently behave as an attentive if critical audience for Oldman's story. The film is shot essentially like a stage play most of the action is confined to one room and the actors struggle with the unidimensional roles they've been given particularly the women who seem primarily to act as supports for Oldmanasprophet's rather flaccid and unconvincing claim to virility. The whole narrative unfolds like the scene in an Agatha Christie novel where Poirot gathers the suspects together and reveals the murderer only without the suspense.I have no doubt that this movie will appeal to some  fans of Dan Brown and Carlos Castenada  but viewers who want to see a movie that grapples with the real complexity of human experience or at least entertains be warned this is not the movie for you.".

It is a shame that the writer is not alive to see this this great film. R.I.P. Mr. Bixby. It makes you really think about the meaning of life. What do we really know about ourselves? About God?

	schema:reviewBody "Directed written acted playing the lead role of Mouloud and coedited by Amor Hakkar The yellow house will win hearts anywhere. It is humanistic deceptively simple and uplifting. Having seen the FrenchArabicBerber language film the viewer will leave with one thoughtthere is goodness in all of us whether Algerian or a citizen of any other nation. It is rare to encounter such movies when violence evil and bitterness pervade most films being made these days. Some viewers tend to disparage feelgood films because they tend to be escapist but here is an example where realism rarely goes out of focus.This Algerian film is apparently the second feature film of the director who studied in France. The storyscreenplay written by Hakkar is simple a poor Algerian agrarian family who survives by growing and selling potatoes and vegetables deals with grief following the untimely death of the eldest son in an accident. The filming appears simple too no flashy editing distracts the viewer camera angles are unobtrusive and the viewer's sensibilities are soothed by the delightful strains of evocative oudh a string instrument music. The oudh player Faycal Salhi who provided the music for the film was present at the International Film Festival of Kerala IFFK 2008 to collect on behalf of the Algerian director the deserving Special Jury Award. The movie had earlier won the top award at the Valencia film festival the best actor award at the Osian New Delhi festival three awards at the Locarno festival the Special Jury Prize at the Carthage festival among other honors it received elsewhere.Sociologically the film criticizes the lack of electricity in some villages of the oil rich country and yet commends the quick remedial intervention when lapses are brought to notice of the government. The film is not about economic injustice or government apathy even though these real issues are present in the backdrop. In the forefront of this wonderful film are issues that are more universal strong family bonds between husband and wife between father and children dead and alive. The first half of the film deals with the impact of untimely death of the farmer's eldest son in an accident while serving in the police force and the father's journey to Batna to identify and collect the mortal remains. The second half deals with the husband's quixotic but dogged plan to bring the shattered life of his wife to normalcy with the help of a video recording made by his son before his death.The film underlines everything that is positive about the Muslim world in a charming way that is not didactic. Policemen who have never met the farmer before help the man by providing him with a hazard light as he travels in the night on a threewheeled farm tractor without headlights to bring his son's body home. Taxi drivers go out of the way to help him locate addresses in the city. An official at the morgue instead of taking the farmer to task for stealing his son's body circumventing official procedures takes the trouble to catch up with him on the highway and hands him the signed legal papers approving the release of the dead body. A pharmacist is asked by the farmer for some medicine to cure his wife's depression from the tragedy and the wellmeaning pharmacist who has heard of a cure painting the walls of his house yellow shares this information with the farmer. Ordinary individuals who could easily have been indifferent to a poor man go out of the way to lend a helping hand to man coping with grief. Would such good deeds happen in real life one could well ask. My answer would be that human bonding when we recognize another person's grief or loss is quite extraordinary. What is remarkable about this film is the contribution of one man Omar Hakkar who acts directs and edits a delightful film that does not criticize at any point what is wrong in society and yet presents a realistic canvas of Berbers in Algeria. The farmer might appear simple and poorly educated but the film is intelligently crafted killing several birds with one stone. There is criticism of the economic disparity in the film but it is latent. The film also silently underlines the important supportive roles of young girls in a Muslim family rarely underlined in Arab films.Hakkar's film is one of the finest films to emerge from North Africa in recent years almost comparable to Mohamed Asli's lovely Moroccan film In Casablanca angels don't fly also on the Berber community made in 2004. Hakkar has not just proved his mettle as a director but also as an interesting screenplay writer who is capable of merging tragedy with lowkey visual humor that never goes overboard. Hakkar's dignified performance in the main role seems contagiousevery other character in the film rises above petty minds to lend him a helping hand. The film's screenplay underlines the need for all of us to tackle grief with courage and adopt a positive outlook at life's continuity in all weathers. It is a film that reiterates that one can attain the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow through dogged persistence in life while being gentle and considerate to others.".

There is criticism of the economic disparity in the film but it is latent. The film also silently underlines the important supportive roles of young girls in a Muslim family rarely underlined in Arab films.Hakkar's film is one of the finest films to emerge from North Africa in recent years almost comparable to Mohamed Asli's lovely Moroccan film In Casablanca angels don't fly also on the Berber community made in 2004. Hakkar has not just proved his mettle as a director but also as an interesting screenplay writer who is capable of merging tragedy with lowkey visual humor that never goes overboard. Hakkar's dignified performance in the main role seems contagiousevery other character in the film rises above petty minds to lend him a helping hand. The film's screenplay underlines the need for all of us to tackle grief with courage and adopt a positive outlook at life's continuity in all weathers. It is a film that reiterates that one can attain the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow through dogged persistence in life while being gentle and considerate to others.";

	schema:reviewBody "Against my will I went to the theaters to watch Nias Mal. You know sometimes we guys gotta please our girlfriends. I expected a clichd chick flick influenced by modern problems of teenagers. To my surprise I actually ended up liking it.The movie is fast paced filled with fun scenes and the occasional romantic and gratuitous nudity. So there's something for everyone. I mean this movie should be watched for 3 reasons1 If you are a guy and want to see Martha Higareda naked several times. Yes she goes topless in at least 4 scenes including a brief sex scene. 2 If you are a girl and want to have fun with your friends. 3 If you are in the mood for watching a mindless but entertaining movie. You know the kind of movie that invites you to leave your brain at home. There are many clichs specially on the characters. The only common denominator of the four lead actresses is their high social status and their so believed perfect life. But we have the rebel sexy sassy girl with an attitude Higareda the lesbian cute rocker chick Sariaana the intellectual but sexy and strong girl Sodi the spoiled cocky bitch Adama and the dumb but noble virgin Aura. Each character has a colorful personality and their personality is likable. Expect fresh performances specially from Higareda and Sodi. Both girls will be very important in a near future. My only problem with Higareda is that she gets naked with the minimal provocation. I mean she's hot sexy and everything but her nude scenes are not necessary and do not add anything special to the story. Sariana delivers a fine performance but her father's intention to promote her music career is way too obvious. She's talented and that's what saves her from criticism. Salvador Snchez also demonstrates why he's a versatile serious actor. I like his work. Blanca Guerra steals the show with her performance. The woman is truly an amazing actress. Snchez Navarro Victor Gonzlez and the rest of the cast do what they have to do correctly.The direction is really good for being a movie oriented specific for a young audience. The score is also pretty good and fits perfect with the movie's tone. To be honest some situations are far from reality specially in Mexican society. For example the Institution is extremely clichd and does not even exists. Then the friendship between all the girls is pure plastic to my eyes. But I understand it's only a movie that tries to entertain at all costs. Overall this is a fun movie that will not change your life but surely will make you have a good time. Recommended only if you are in the mood for light entertainment. Otherwise you will get really annoyed.".

There are many problems with the movie but what I objected to most of all was the sorry script. Its story is pretty formula and stretched out past the breaking point. Actually that might have not been so bad had there been plenty of funny gags along the way but that's not the case. For one thing the movie comes off more like a somewhat lighthearted drama than a comedy and when the movie DOES try to be funny the gags are lame and obvious. It doesn't help that the central character is quite obnoxious so there's nothing funny about her. Also I feel I should mention that if it weren't for the occasional uses of nudity and foul language I would have sworn that this was a made for television effort instead of a feature film the movie's low budget is painfully evident throughout. The best I can say for the movie is that it isn't as bad as most of the movies coming from my country Canada.".

	schema:reviewBody "Reasonably good and oldfashioned scary demonic horror from New Zealand The Ferryman occasionally succeeds in combining the claustrophobic atmosphere of Dead Calm with the 'do not even trust your loved ones'suspense factor of The Shining. This film features one of the most solid basic horrorpremises in years as it revolves on the ancient Greek myth of the ferryman who  according to the legend  needs to be paid in order to guide newly deceased souls over to the other side. For centuries already one man always managed to escape death by constantly shifting into the bodies of unsuspecting tourists and seamen crossing the waters surrounding the New Zealand islands. He uses an uncanny old dagger to transfer his spirit into a new host and his unfortunate victims die in the old body. When a tourist yacht with six passengers on board rescues and old and sickly man during a storm they don't realize their lives are endangered as he now has six vital and healthy bodies to choose from. The first 40 minutes of The Ferryman are a bit slow and uneventful mainly because director Chris Graham spends too much time on the overly detailed and slightly redundant character drawings. We're getting rather useless information regarding the three couples' backgrounds and history. A good thing however is that none of the characters is your average slasherstereotype. They're all realistic and likable at least most of them people and not just dumb highschool students on their way to an islandparty or something. As soon as the eerie old man  another great role for John RhysDavis  plants his dagger in the chest of his first victim The Ferryman turns into an exciting and spectacular horror film. Some of the death sequences regretfully take place off screen but others are pretty gruesome and cruel. The titular ferryman only appears briefly at the beginning and the end of the film but he's a traditionally nastylooking monster with a rotting face and a hoarse voice. The inescapable location of a yacht in the middle of the open sea and often stuck in thick fog banks adds a great deal the atmosphere and the photography is beautiful. The last sequences on board the yacht and particularly the ingenious epilogue will undoubtedly please even the most skeptical horror fan. Recommended.".

The Ferryman is an underrated horror movie based on the legend of the Greek mythology of Charon or Kharon the ferryman of Hades that carried the souls across the River Acheron to reach the world of the dead. His payment was a coin in or on the mouth of the dead person. In the introduction of The Ferryman there is a narration in off telling that in ancient times there was the legend of the Ferryman. He took the dead to be judged into the afterlife and his prize was a coin in their mouth. If anyone tried to cheat death they would also be cheating the Ferryman and they could never escape for the Ferryman would hunt them forever. The screenplay combines the foregoing legend with Dead Calm and Fallen and the result is a good gore film. In the end I was surprised since I had the lowest expectations based on the IMDb Rating. My vote is seven.Title Brazil A Vingana do Demnio The Revenge of the Demon".

	schema:reviewBody "I've just got in from watching The Ferryman and felt I had to vent my frustration. This film had the potential to be excellent I think but it's badly let down by quite a few key points. Based on the mythic character of the Ferryman from Greek legend who's only task was to carry people across from the land of the living to the land of the dead was it the river Styx? the premise was that someone who had 'died' and so was bound to 'cross over' had found a way to cheat death and stay on this side of 'the river'. He hadn't in essence paid the ferryman. So far so good and a great setup for a film  the character was essentially on the run from death and had been for hundreds or was it thousands? of years. He could've made a killing on property either way. Anyway the plot device to drive this story though was a dagger that allowed the bearer to 'switch' bodies and thus stay one step ahead of the punting ghoul with the invoice of the title. This dagger had NO connection whatsoever as far as I could see to the Greek myth. Fair enough if you're expecting the audience to buy into one 'fantastical' concept but TWOtotally unrelated ones? Is there a dagger that transfers souls in Greek mythology? I don't know of one... I'm prepared to be corrected though. And don't get me started on where that coin came from either. Or the kid... That's not even my main gripe though. Here's where I think the film really let itself down as the characters stab each other with the knife and so transfer the evil soul from body to body Wes Craven's Shocker? some of these incidents occur off camera. Brilliant idea. So you don't really know which character is the baddie right? Wrong. But it's still a brilliantly tense situation where the audience is thinking 'is she just cracking under the strain of seeing someone get stabbedbeing trapped on a boat in the fognot knowing what's going on?' or is she in fact the evil entity right? WRONG again. The baddie is flagged up every single time cos there's a ruddy great tattoo that appears on their back when they're possessed. Nice one Mr Director. Why not just put them in a HiVis vest with a rotating bowtie? Apart from this the acting from the highmaintenance blonde is titanically bad as is the work from the Maori chap who's as wooden as the decking. The Ferryman himself gets about 5 minutes screen time and seeing as how he's quite a terrifying looking chap that's a Darth Maulesqe waste. The direction in general is not dynamic enough and some scenes linger a couple of painful seconds too long.. reminding me of the classically bad soap opera Sunset Beach... but the music and the performance of the bolshie Cockerney captain were quite enjoyable. All in all if you're after bodyswapping horror go for Denzel Washington in Fallen. That's got better music too... Tiiiime is on my siiide yes it is....".

	schema:reviewBody "I have enjoyed limited movie offerings from New Zealand with the likes of the romantic comedy Sione's Wedding and horror comedy Black Sheep and for my horror double bill this weekend I wouldn't have wanted to miss The Ferryman.In western folklore the Ferryman is the one responsible for transporting the dead to the nether realms where souls would be judged so you'd better start chalking up those brownie points. Ferrymen had been depicted in movies before be they just a background character like in Woody Allen's Scoop or becoming a point of contention in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies with crew of The Flying Dutchman. Think of it as the equivalent to the Chinese folklore characters of Cow Head and Horse Face where they will visit the body at the point of deaths to escort the soul to the depths of Hell for judgement.2 couples two of whom are Craig Hall and Amber Sainsbury whom we will get to see again in 30 Days of Night in which Ben Fransham who plays The Ferryman will also appear signs up for an adventure sail from New Zealand to Fiji where a luxurious spa awaits their tired bodies after their homestay on the sea stint. Before everyone including the captain his wife and their pet dog can get chummy with one another their ship receives a distress signal and the laws of the sea dictates they get themselves into unknown trouble by picking up a survivor from a nonworking vessel. And like all hitchhiker styled movies there's always something strange about the hitcher played by John RhysDavis you pick up especially when the weather's all foggy and he starts to give everyone the creeps.The Ferryman turned out to be a rather interesting concept movie rather than outright horror with shock and awe moments. It doesn't scare nor does it follow the recent trends in gore and with torture porn. What it's more akin to is a good old fashioned thriller with supernatural elements thrown in for good measure. Some might complain that nothing much really happens with the usual hack and slash but I'd argue that it had a very novel take on the theme of longevity especially when it starts to play out in full. While it certainly isn't something new the way it was executed pardon the pun mattered and its ending will undoubtedly leave a wicked smile on your face at what had transpired and the loads of potential should you possess such capability.Not without loopholes though but I thought it could be glossed over given its supernatural slant unless you choose to harp on it especially when it didn't get developed properly. In short The Ferryman still qualifies for an entertaining afternoon matine when ticket prices are cheaper.".

The movie revolts around 2 couples taking a boat trip on the yacht of another couple so you start off with 6 potential victims he he. After introducing the characters with 1 annoying blonde and the angel in form of an exnurse with a back story they stumble across an abandoned boat where they pick up an old sailor who soon starts the countdown from 6 down. By stabbing people with an ancient knife he is able to switch bodies and seems to have done so for a while angering death here of course in form of the ferryman who is implemented into the movie as halfhearted as the nurses past. So the bodyhopping starts pretty fast and the way it is executed is the most interesting thing which keeps the movie entertaining. Its more about that subject than about the kills which happen rather secondary and the uncertainty of who is who and people trapped in other bodies seemed fresh to me.I liked the premise of immortality by shifting bodies. Beside that there was some aspects reminding me of The Fog mixed in with modern TeenageSlasher Films. But as much as I liked the premise there was some real annoying parts in The Ferryman. The different stories and ideas were rather loosely tied together which made the script look like a fast shot. Also the women in this movie were clichd and annoying in their permanent hysterical screaming... since it was both blondes who got that attribute its yet another clich. I think the movie could have gone somewhere especially since I liked the ending but its too halfhearted in implementing its influences from here and there. That makes The ferryman a little more than average since it still manages to keep the attention until the end.".

Congrats to a New Zealand flick the best IMHO since Once Were Warriors.";

But this one was rather good compared to some of the other garbage that I have seen I enjoyed the horror elements even though they were rather brutal and uncalled for at times. The ending was sort of confusing but I liked seeing the face of the real ferryman rather than just a knife through the whole movie.

However the cruise hits problems when they hear a Morse code SOS  in trying to find it's source end up in a huge bank of thick fog eventually they find a stranded boat  a lone surviving Greek sailor John RhysDavies whom they rescue  take back to the yacht. Back onboard the yacht the sailor seems alright  a decent laugh but things turn nasty when he finds out that he has cancer since there is in fact a thousands of years old evil demonic spirit inside the sailors body  since the body will soon die from cancer it needs to find a new body  a way to get back to dry land  have a little fun in the process...This British New Zealand coproduction was directed by Chris Graham  I have to say that I pretty much despised The Ferryman reading some of the positive reviews on the IMDb I wonder both if I saw the same film  just how people's opinions can differ so much. The Ferryman takes several concepts  ideas rippedoff from much better films  throws them all together in a rather boring  poorly written fashion there are elements from The Fog 1980 with the constant fog obviously the basic setup  much of the plot feels like it has been lifted from Dead Calm 1989 with the isolated boat in the open ocean  it's passengers being terrorised  the whole body swapping possession angle feels like it could have come from any number of 80's horror films like The Thing 1982 or The Hidden 1987. The character's are such an unlikable lot that all the development  buildup felt like I was having teeth pulled  the profanity riddled dialogue sounds exactly like a cheap horror flick. The whole body possession angle is totally wasted too in a film like The Thing the tension  mystery elements are pushed to the limit but here the filmmakers always make it clear who is possessed so there's never any paranoia mistrust surprises or twist's which makes the film somewhat of a predictable precession. The socalled plot is also very sparse no background is given whatsoever to the demon or it's origins or even how it was on the boat to start with the eventual solution given to the survivor to defeat the demon is given to her by a ghost girl in her dream for no apparent reason  to add to the ridiculousness of it she pretty much defeats the demon with a lesbian kiss! If this demon was so clever why did it murder  molest people all the time? Surely that's going to attract unwanted attention? Why not possess a body keep it's mouth shut  just wait until the yacht hit dry land? The pacing is slow it felt like The Ferryman went on for hours  I just found it a very unlikable viewing experience.Set almost entirely on the open Ocean on a yacht The Ferryman is a quite boring looking film actually  the dark dull foggy background doesn't help. I mean unlike in The Fog the fog in The Ferryman isn't used for any sort of atmospheric effect. I am not sure why this is actually called The Ferryman is it referring to the Ferryman of Charon from Greek mythology? If so I can't see any specific links the plot plays more like the body possession horror of The Thing rather than a story of a mythological being. There's some blood splatter but not much gore this is only rated '15' here in the UK there's a severed hand a cut open Shark someone is glassed in the face  neck  there are a few quick stabbings. There is supposedly a sex scene here but the guy is clearly seen to be wearing underwear  the girl was wearing a bra so there's no nudity whatsoever.Production wise the film is alright it has reasonable production values but it has a bland look about it. Actually shot in New Zealand. Another aspect of The Ferryman I disliked was the terrible acting there's so much over the top crying shouting  exaggerating it actually starts to become cringeworthy.The Ferryman is a film that I didn't really know anything about going in to watch it  I wish I still didn't know anything about it as it was a pretty painful viewing experience for me although there are some out there who seem to like it for whatever reason.".

The plot is not overused or dull and aside from perhaps a few minor plot holes and dumb typical horror moments like when the older lady talks trash instead of just pulling the trigger on the bodysnatcher for instance it's pretty much devoid of the dreaded modern clich that plagues so many other films today. The women here are attractive well the dark haired girl is at least and the killsthrills are pretty good overall. The ending did not fail to satisfy either. I think the best thing about The Ferryman though is that it doesn't just follow the typical slasher plot of group of kids in the woods getting sliced up by a maniac with an axbutcher's knifemachete. It may not be the best horror film but it's a breath of fresh air and that's just what I needed.I don't think this movie reached its full potential though as there are several things that could be expanded upon  such as the actual Ferryman and the girl's past  but when something is this entertaining its flaws don't matter much. Not everyone will dig this but it's definitely a refreshing change of pace. Recommended.".

	schema:headline " Interesting concept reasonably well executed...";
	schema:reviewBody "The premise of the film is initially intriguing escaping death by swapping your 'self' with the bodies of others. Three sensible adult couples on a romantic cruise to Fiji stumble upon the last survivor of a fishing crew that met with disaster. The survivor wastes no time shedding the knackered body he currently inhabits using an ancient daggertalisman and taking the fittest looking body aboard.From here on in the film races along in an exciting if predictable fashion to it's obvious finale. The horror for the most part is 'felt' more than 'seen' and it is the better for it. SPOILER A good example is the scene where the 'ancient' forces a woman as she is slowly dying 'within' her boyfriend's body to watch her own body masturbating...Good use is made of the limited confines of the small yacht seeming at times to be a lot larger than it is. The tension within and between the couples is realised excellently and Rhys is his usually brilliant but cheesy self. The only real letdown and it is quite a letdown is the script...SPOILER If the ancient had survived for thousands of years you'd think he'd have become a lot smarter than to immediately start terrorising his potential rescuers. Where is the sense in offing what may be the only person who could pilot him out of there? Worse still it seems he has been avoiding the ferryman oh yes there is actually a ferryman in here somewhere who genuinely needs paying to cart you to the 'other side.' Why all the hooha then? Why not just 'not' pay him? I'm sure there was more to both the legend of the ferryman and the reason for the talisman but neither were adequately explained. And where did the child with it's timely solution fit in? Does the ferryman not know about afterlife childlabour laws...?Overall the less than watertight script does not mean the film should be ferried away. It is plenty enjoyable despite it. 710".

Three sensible adult couples on a romantic cruise to Fiji stumble upon the last survivor of a fishing crew that met with disaster. The survivor wastes no time shedding the knackered body he currently inhabits using an ancient daggertalisman and taking the fittest looking body aboard.From here on in the film races along in an exciting if predictable fashion to it's obvious finale.

The film starts with a violent and gory scene fit for the demanding horror fans out there.John RhysDavies what a catch for the movie! He is outstanding as the Greek rescued by the yacht's crew in response to his distress signal. The basic formula soon unwinds as the notsohapless crew is his prey for some great horror scenes offering plenty of ghoulish moments.Echoes of other films will come to mind where demonic possession is concerned. The atmosphere generates the necessary foreboding feeling that draws you into the unfolding chaos and terror of the macabre.Horror fans may have missed this one due to its surprising online reviews that support the contrary on it not being any kind of a masterpiece. But as a horror movie fanatic this movie supersedes most of the crappy teen horror movies and awful remakes hitting your screens lately.

I'm happy to say this is another one that hits a home run when it comes to telling a great story without stripping out real life spirituality something that is integral to most people's life.The film brings us the important story of Christian missionaries killed during their first efforts to meet an isolated band of Ecuadoran native people embroiled in a cycle of violence. End of the Spear tells the story from the perspective of a tribal leader and the child of one of the missionaries that died.I think if you keep in mind this is an independent film shot on a restricted budget you'll be pleased with most technical aspects cinematography sound etc.You'll also love the actors that were just great. Louie Leonardo does a wonderful job portraying Waodani tribesman Mincayani in the lead role. You also have to give credit to young Chase Ellison in his role as young Steve Saint whose pilot father died.The role of religions in transforming culture is a hot button issue these days. This film doesn't take that head on but presents a balanced realistic view and perhaps an alternative aspect that most critics generally don't acknowledge.There were weaknesses in the film also but none that distracted much from the story. There were a few bits that might have been served by further character and story development the son's issues in particular.All in all this is a wonderful film with a great message of reconciliation. I hope we see more like this.".

The Heartland Film Festival is a nonprofit that honors Truly Moving Pictures. A Truly Moving Picture explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life.The film which is based on a true story starts in 1956 in the Amazon basin in Ecuador. Five missionaries are savagely killed by a primitive tribe. But that is the beginning of the story and not the end of the story.The missionaries' wives and children take on the work of their fathers and husbands. They and we the audience are forced to examine violence and how we react to violence and the possibility of forgiving the perpetrators of violence. The missionaries and their families display incredible human traits. They display courage in the face of danger  they are willing to sacrifice a normal life to help others  they show respect and tolerance to primitive people. But most impressive of all they retain their humility and do not look down on others.The cinematography and music are stunning. The Amazon jungle becomes the third character along with the tribe and the missionaries. And all three characters relentlessly attempt to survive and prevail.FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Crystal Heart winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.".

	schema:reviewBody "Absolutely amazing cinematography and storyline and best of all the story isn't made up its a true to life story shown from the tribe's point of view. The quality of the film is superb. The storyline will keep you on the edge of your seat in suspense through the entire movie. There are also some bonus blooper clips played during the credits of the movie. You would not know that director Jim Hanon was a first time director but rather you would think he had been in the business for years. This film will help inspire the way future films are shot and created. This also highlights and shows some insight into the burgeoning film industry coming out of Oklahoma City. This scene is set to take off and provide Hollywood with a new generation of film makers.Reconciliation is the word that best describes this captivating film. Most people can forgive someone but they don't move on or exclude people from their lives. This true to life story gives a glimpse into Steve Saint's life. His father Nate Saint was one of the 5 men brutally killed to death in 1956 by a Waodani tribesman. Today he travels the world with the exact man that killed his father back then. In fact he even considers him family and calls him grandfather. To forgive someone is one thing to show our violent society how to be completely reconciled with one another can rarely be said in today's world. Go see this true story and decide for yourself!!!".

	schema:headline " Five missionaries are brutally murdered by a violent native tribe in Ecuador. One of the wives and a sister then go to live with the tribe to model unconditional love.";
	schema:reviewBody "This outstanding movie tells the story of five missionaries who were speared to death by the Waodani tribe of Ecuador in 1956. It is based on the book Through Gates of Splendor by Elisabeth Elliot and the story featured in LIFE magazine after the incident occurred.The movie traces the event from two perspectives  the Waodani tribe itself and Steve Saint orphaned son of jungle pilot Nate Saint who first made contact. This creates amazing tension as the pain and humanity of the incident is seen through the eyes of people directly affected on both sides of the slaying.One of the most striking features of this film is the participation of indigenous actors. The actual location in Ecuador was too remote for a film crew so the producers were able to locate a remote tribe in Panama that agreed to play the part of the Waodani. Although these people had never even seen a movie before they understood the concept of the incident and were willing to help bring the amazing story to a wider audience.This is the first time the Waodani were willing to tell the story. They were told about Columbine and other incidents of violence. The Waodani leaders apparently said that if the men were willing to come 50 years ago to help them learn not to kill one another that they would do the film in hopes that it would help others learn not to kill. They then became consultants for the film.The cinematography is very good with some striking scenes in the jungle. The actor who portrays the Waodani warriorchief Mincayani is outstanding. The scene where Nate and Steve Saint say goodbye is incredibly moving as both recognize that the father may not return. Steve chasing his dad's plane down the makeshift runway is a serious tearjerker.There are some intense scenes of violence that are probably too strong for younger children although I believe the producers took the high road on showing the actual spearing.The love demonstrated by the women who were willing to go and live with the tribe is simply amazing. They chose to live among the very men who murdered their loved ones in part to prevent the government from going in and wiping the Waodani outand to care for the sick and dying of both the Waodani and their rivals. This showed the tribe that the cycle of revengebased violence they had been living under for centuries did nothing but decimate the tribe itself and that there was a better way.Over the next two years the tribal leaders began to accept that they could live and prosper without murdering one another and be at peace with their rivals. It is said that the murder rate dropped by 90.We were fortunate enough to see this film at a screening and greatly look forward to seeing it again. It garnered two rounds of applause from the audience. Stick around during the credits to see the actual footage from when the real Mincayani came to the US with Steve Saint. Highly recommended.".

The movie websites says it's releasing in 1200 theaters in a week. Maybe the media is biased because part of the story is about missionaries. I don't know about the rest of you but this is the first movie I've been to in a while that is actually worth 9 for a ticket.I think most people might think that loving your father's killer is a little sick but when the movie unfolds and you understand the clash between the two cultures it make sense.If you like The Mission Robert Dinero Jeremy Irons Chariots of Fire or Last of the Mohicans you will enjoy this movie!".

I and 1300 others watched the movie in folding chairs yet we were not uncomfortable at all because the movie is so enrapturing that you just don't notice your surroundings at all. The majority of the audience was college aged students and I've never seen them so moved and amazingly quiet for such a long time.

	schema:reviewBody "What Mel Gibson risked in bringing The Passion of the Christ to the screen so did Mart Green to realize the story of End of the Spear  a truly inspiring mustsee film that outlines the interaction of American missionaries with isolated people in the jungles of Ecuador in 1956. In an era when Americans  and particularly Evangelical Christians  are subject to stereotype and ridicule around the world this movie has another perspective on what is in the hearts of those who follow Christ. I sincerely hope that Mart Green and the rest of the team that worked to realize this true story on film will receive acknowledgment for what they have accomplished. They certainly have my appreciation and respect. See this movie and bring friends particularly people who do not know this kind of faith in their lives. This is a story of transformational love which will not be lost on anyone.Though some mainstream media critics and virulent antiChristians will be especially harsh to a nonHollywood financed motion picture that succeeds in getting its message across please don't be discouraged by their cynicism. It is is true that this movie doesn't have some of the computergenerated nuances of a big budget film. And it is true that an acting performance or two among the cast is uneven. And it is true that this movie would have benefited mightily from a script makeover and a bigbudget editing team. But that is just the point  those very elements of the filmmaking support the raw edgy nature of the setting and plot for the story. My favorite reviewer comment comes from John Niccum of the Lawrence Kansas JournalWorld This generally engrossing Christian parable is the type of film that conservatives will overpraise and liberals will overcriticize. Which is fair comment. And supports strongly the observation that a large number of the public wants many more of these kinds of films  and those that don't acknowledge the power of these stories. So let them carp about imperialism and all else  it will only help draw the fairminded into the theater for their own analysis. End of the Spear will make the point that perhaps they have never experienced about love and redemption. Oh and like everyone else says stick around for the credits!".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is obvious religious propaganda paid for by organized Christian religion. This film is written from a Western point of view and fails to see or even address that other cultures like the Waorani have different cultural beliefs and that these beliefs may also be valid. Why should we homogenize the whole world to believe in God Waengongi and his son? How is this belief relevant to this tribe and their way of life? Does this belief really make them better people? Is the way they are living wrong? What constitutes murder in our culture does not necessarily hold true for all cultures. Our disgust for the Waorani killing each other and our need to save them like they're children is just Westerners once again feeling morally superior to the rest of the world. It fails to address the larger issues at hand here like whether or not the missionaries should be there at all with all their moral superiority. Also the fact that these missions paved the way for the oil companies to come in and steal and devastate these tribal lands. I sat through this whole movie and I found no redeeming value in it at all. In this day and age I would expect more indepth thought from a film.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is a quarter past midnight and I just got home from watching End of the Spear at a local theater on its opening night. It was quite an experience but before I give my reactions let me give you some background on the movie.If you do not already know the film is based on the true story of an indigenous tribe the Waodani in the Ecuador jungle who were known for their brutal murders of each other and any who entered their region. Five missionaries attempted to contact them before the government could wipe the tribe out but all five of them were murdered by the Waodani because of a tragic misunderstanding. Rather than seek vengeance for this some of the families left behind by the slain men went to live with the Waodani and seek to help them in both material and spiritual ways. The story is largely told from two points of view that of the son of one of the slain men and that of one of the Waodani leaders.The film was gripping and moving and held my attention for most of the nearly two hours it lasted. It gave a window into a very different world and mindset than most of us in the civilized western world are accustomed to. If you are looking for great special effects star actors or fun entertainment this is not the picture for you. However if you want a to see a movie that has believable characters in a gripping tale based on a true story then I highly recommend going to see this movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't usually write reviews for movies unless I can give them a ten star rating. This film would have earned ten stars for the message alone even if it hadn't been so welldone. Technically End of the Spear was welldirected on all points. Chad Allen gave an excellent believable performance as Nate Saint and later Steve Saint. Louie Leonardo was simply stunning in his role as Minkayani and made a real impact on the whole movie. This technical excellence though much appreciated was only the icing on the cake. The true substance of this film is in the message that it tells in such a way that it is inescapable and yet draws the world in. Though I don't believe the name of Jesus was ever mentioned the sacrifice forgiveness love and redemption unashamedly portrayed in the story can't be mistaken as anything but a message from God. The story that of the missionaries and of the Waodani is sometimes brutal and it was not softened or minced in any way. The violence was wellhandled and though I wouldn't recommend a young child seeing the movie it could have been far more graphic. Acting music the storyline the scenery everything combined to make End of the Spear one of the most moving films I've ever seen. But there are two scenes that really stand out in my mind. The first is when the missionaries are killed by the Waodani. It is played out in slow motion which makes it very intense and also very effective. I guess what really got me was when after watching his friends brutally murdered the dying Nate Saint tells his killer We are your friends. in their own language of course Then there's the scene near the end of the movie where Minkayani takes Steve Saint to the spot where his father was killed. From the revelation Minkayani's scream I speared your father! to Steve Saint's powerful line You didn't take my father's life... he gave it. It had me in tears. End of the Spear is a film truly worthy of the golden story it tells and I only hope it succeeds in touching the world as much as it touched me.".

	schema:headline " Truth Is Stranger than Fiction Meeting Steve Saint and Tementa son of the Woadoni responsible for the killings";
	schema:reviewBody "It has been 50 years since 5 young men died in Equador an event that was retold for years challenging the hearer to consider if they had any belief that they would be willing to die for. The events since that day are even more amazing. I sat with tears streaming when I realized the substitute speaker standing before me was the son of one of these murdered men and the dark tanned man beside him was a woadoni native the son of the native responsible for killing his dad. Truth is Stranger than Fiction and this movie is well worth seeing if you have ever wondered if dark clouds can possibly have silver linings or violent people can ever become good gentle people. That was my impression of Tementa the woadoni native standing before me and a baby demanded killed by his dying father in the movie Gentle and good. The man whose parental generation would haveand did kill anyone who met them was gentle enough to stand in a stairwell and show my 7 year old boy how to blow a dart at a balloon placed on the wall thru a primitive blowgun..primitive to me but still used in the jungles by his tribe today. I look forward to being one of the first to view this movie as I have been anticipating it for 2 years since I learned of it. Please see this movie. Since it is a limited engagement you may have to travel a little farther to see it.Check out the website at www.endofthespear.com for previews.".

	schema:headline " My biggest regret was the wrongful portrayal of Jim Elliot as a buffoon.";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't expect film media to provide an adequate standalone vehicle for the Gospel. I was however disappointed with EotS's presentation of the martyrs and particularly incensed at the treatment of Jim Elliot.Did I think the Gospel was absent from the movie? I thought it was introduced tardily as in late in the movie partially and blurrily. I would not say it was absent entirely but it was absent in its pure form.Did I mind this presentation of the Gospel? The movie did not really promote another gospel either. There were only snippets of the truth communicated and I think there are valid reasons for that.1. Communicating the Gospel in its entirety was not the purpose of the movie. I admire adherence to truth and I think that the Gospel should be evident and glorified in all we do but film is not the written or preached Word and needn't be judged according to all the standards by which we judge the value of preaching and teaching in the context of the Church. The written and preached Word is God's primary ordained medium for the Gospel.2. The film genre is simply not conducive to a full Gospel presentation since it is a primarily audiovisual fastpaced entertainment venue. A script adaptation even a faithful one emotional soundtrack evocative lighting and poignant camera angles are not God's ordained formula for conveying the Gospel in its entirety. He chose the Word spoken and written to be the primary vehicle of truth.3. Presenting what happened to the Waodani as a change effected by their salvation en masse would not have been a faithful representation of what truly happened and would in fact have undermined the very definition of the Gospel had it been presented as such.4. The focal character during the moments that the Gospel was being communicated was Mincayani clearly an unbeliever at that point in the story. His and his friends' perceptions of the differences they were seeing were filtered through their presuppositions and prejudices. It is only natural and therefore a fairly faithful representation that the Gospel would be all Greek to them. The movie has us viewing the Gospel through their unbelieving eyes at that point.What bothered me most about End of the Spear? Aside from the false hopes and unrealistic expectations that evangelicals apply to the moviesince those are not the movie's fault per seI was particularly incensed the portrayal of Jim Elliot as a selfabsorbed clown. As lighthearted and occasionally reckless as he may have been or seemed he was also deeply burdened highly intelligent and certainly sober when appropriate. I do not kid myself that Elisabeth Elliot's presentation of his legacy was entirely without some natural bias. But to bereave the movie of a rounder treatment of Jim was a disservice I thinka disservice to the truth to the families and to the audience. That Jim's gravity and earnest depth and calculated plans and sensitivity to the Holy Spirit as evidenced extensively in his journals alone was omitted completely as though he was the chain's weakest link is profoundly aggravating to say the least.The movie's bias leans toward the portrayal of a very competent and passionate Nate Saint and justly so. The most attention Roger Youderian receives in the movie is the Waodanis' presumption that he is just a very tall woman with a singing voice like a canary. Ed McCulley gets to dance with his wife and introduce himself on the beach. Pete Fleming offcamera can't find his Waodani language notes when they need them although he does get some screen time as the last man standing in the river quite obviously petrified and mute.All of these men have been idealized and are largerthanlife heroes. Fifty years is a long time for those left behind to process real memories or erect imagined improvements. Does knocking the idealized Jim Elliot down a peg or ten serve any real purpose? These men had different strengths and weaknesses and I think that the families would admit that they had disagreements and differing viewpoints at times. To be human is to differ from one another and to differ graciously and without harm to ministry endeavors is to be exhibits of God's sufficient GRACE. They were all part of the team. They were all committed men growing in grace and they all risked their livesboth deliberately and joyfully. How is it then that every single shot of Jim in this movie portrays him as a thoughtless buffoon? The last line of the movie even alludes strongly to Jim Elliot's own famous words He is no fool who gives up what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose and yet the quote is modified and read by Allen as Saint's character.Credible filmmaking and allegiance to truth go handinhand. I wasn't counting on this movie to preach the Gospel. I wasn't counting on this movie to comprise an allbelieving cast with no personal agendas to promote. I wasn't even counting on this movie to be a flawless unbiased account of what really happened. I wasn't. But I do feel sorry that this movie did not make more of an effort to tell the whole truth. I am glad that more of the big scope picture was brought to light. I am glad that more of the Waodanis' history was explained. I am glad that the less tangible elements timing and providence were highlighted. I just think that more could have been done to flesh out and honor the memory of these men all five of them.I wanted to meet them. I who have grown up in their grandchildren's generation wanted to be introduced to them. I wanted a posthumous chance to know them. I wanted to have been there with them. Perhaps those too are unreasonable demands for any film. I think they may have been.".

	schema:reviewBody "Growing up a Protestant kid in the 80's I tripped over the story of Nate Saint Jim Elliot and the three other missionaries who were brutally murdered by the Waorani people in 1956. It is the tragic story that caused a sensation in the United States. Not because the men died in vain but because the wives of these men reached out to these violent people and changed their lives forever. It's a story that captivated me. In fact when I was eleven I told many people that I one day wanted to make a movie about these very people. To my surprise THE END OF THE SPEAR came along and does just that.SPEAR tells the tale from the vantage point of young Steve Saint Chase Ellison Nate Saints Chad Allen preteen son and Mincayani Louie Leonardo the Waorani leader whom killed Nate Saint with his own spear. It begins as the Waorani people are on the verge of the extinction. Their violent society has the Ecuadoran government ready to go in and kill them all and their warlike ways have made them unable to survive very long anyway. It's only when Saint's wife Cara Stoner and sister Rachel Sara Kathryn Bakker move into the tribe and attempt to reach out to the Waorani women that redemption begin to take hold.I walked into SPEAR with very little expectation. You have to understand I have seen hundreds of horrible Christian films. Most are not worth the film they are printed on. But SPEAR works. Yes it's got some very clunky scenes the dialogue is a tad bit simplistic but it has a dramatic tension I wasn't quite expecting. I was actually moved by scenes. I rooted for characters and did not feel talked down to. SPEAR is not a movie about saving souls it's a movie about characters. It is the kind of movie that if given a chance will spark debate and inspiration. It's motive seems innocent and not heavy handed.The cinematography while simple by Hollywood's standard is effective. The score doesn't get in the way and Director Jim Hannon fills his story with just enough detail that it's believable. He gets performances out of his actors that are simple and understated. It's not Oscar caliber but that's not to be expected. The dialogue works even if the Subtitles seem to rob the Waorani language of any real nuance it's simple and get us from point A to point B as well as it can. There were moments I wanted to movie to explain the motives of it characters a little better. But for what it's worth SPEAR is still effective.My qualms with the casting of Chase Ellison as Young Steve should also be noted. Some heavy scenes fall on this young boy and unfortunately he doesn't have the chops to hold it on his shoulders. A better child actor should have been sought. Casting children can be very hard. But the only scenes I didn't buy fell on this poor kid to vocalize and the poor material stuck out like a sore thumb.I also hated the ending. It hurt the picture. There must have been a more powerful way of ending it. But unfortunately it pushed the story into the melodramatic range. It also introduced a supernatural twist that needed an explanation. We saw the scene earlier and these events didn't occur why now? Hopefully this sour ending will not hurt the rest of the picture for most audiences. I for one was a little disappointed.But all in all END OF THE SPEAR is not a bad film. It has its flaws. But at its heart it's the kind of movie that will inspire those whom let it. It will move those whom allow it to move and hopefully it will open a dialogue about International Missions. A job that has gotten a bad rap by people whom don't understand its importance in shaping the modern world. I'm glad that this story was told and that I had an opportunity to see it.12 out of 5".

Why do they spend all of this money to make such tripe. The plot is weak and obvious. The script could have been written by a monkey. Maybe it was. All of these squeaky clean Christians trying to save these dirty Equidorian natives made my stomach turn. As I look at all of the postings on this site i can't help noticing that they are all first timers. Hmm. Kinda makes you wonder if they aren't' tiring to spin this. When will the IMDb start removing the BS. I read that the film has only made about 8 million dollars to date and I heard that it cost about 10 million to make so you know that someone is losing money. Well you jackasses got my money.

	schema:reviewBody "Like Desperado the film offers nonstop action and a gargantuan body count.  Robert Rodriguez knows how to please his audience and the movie does work for the most part.  As expected in a Rodriguez film the action scenes are very wellchoreographed and all possess a certain slickness and originality.  Johnny Depp steals the show in his supporting role and seems to be having the most fun.  I actually looked at him as more of an action hero than Antonio Banderas.  Then again Banderas seems to be going through the motions.  After all he has played roles of this type many times before and is probably almost bored.  I like how most of the movie is in subtitles. As I heard in the commentary the reason for that was because most of the cast only spoke Spanish.  But I'd rather see Mexican characters speaking in their native language and having to read the subtitles than them speaking in a second language that they obviously haven't mastered totally. Hollywood appears to have a fear of subtitles and it's a stupid fear.  Now onto what I didn't like about the movie...I'm not exaggerating when I say that it has nonstop violence.  I'm not one of these people who gets bothered by excessive violence but after a while all that action and killing can get a little dull.  You just sit there waiting for the next body to fall to the ground.  The story isn't nonexistent but I think if Rodriguez paid a little more attention to developing characters and story his films might be even more interesting.  But altogether I was entertained.  You don't view a film like this in the same way you view a Kubrick film.  So what you see is what you get.  My score  7 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Once Upon A Time In Mexico is good but not as strong as Desperado. Our hero El Mariachi Antonio Banderas barely has any lines. Throughout the movie we forget this talented actor is the star of the movie. The explosive action is incredible and including Sands Johnny Depp is the only thing worth raving about. Depp's role is actually the best part of this movie. Salma Hayek's role has been chopped to flashbacks so there is not a lot of crazy Action and Romance between Banderas and her. You want Antonio Banderas to save the day and he does but this Sequel did not give him that fire. Eva Mendes is in about 4 scenes but does a great job including the rest of the cast Ruben Blades Cheech Marin Mickey Rourke Willem Dafoe and Enrique Iglesias. It would have been nice to hear some hot new songs from Enrique Iglesias for the soundtrack but I am more than satisfied with Salma Hayek's Siente Mi Amor. It is an incredible Spanish track worth watching the entire credits!".

	schema:headline " Femme Fatale  Eva Mendes Movie  Good but not Great!";
	schema:reviewBody "My Overall view after watching this moving was 2 things  One  The Perfect Femme Fatale in Eva Mendes.Two  Antonio Banderas played his role well but the overall movie was worth a 6.0 or 5.8 points rating.As for Miss. Mendes i recommend a second part of the film Cat Women I'd like Halle Berry Or Jessica Alba to play the TopRole in the Movie.With Mendes as her Enemy and with ExOdyssey 5 Star Leslie Silva Or Rosario Dawson as Sidekick to the Evil Miss Mendes.But that for later i was just impressed by her well let's say Striking Way to Outfox Johnny Depp.Although in the end she got what she deserved she impressed me.Depp himself played a very good role setting every body against themselves and running the show but like i said Mendes outfoxed him.As for The Hole Movie The Role Antonio Banderas played was good he took revenge for the death of his Wife Salma Hayek.Enrique Iglesias did OK but i'm not sure whether he should be an actor.Here's my take on the movie The evil Barillo and General Marquez try to take over Mexico and are helped by the military. Barillo's tactical brilliance made his daughter Eva Mendes enter the army and threw that she could help him control the army Mendes ho is using Johnny Depp to get her classified information finds out that he is trying to use her for a scam that will bring Depp a few million dollars! Mendes capture's him and because of Depp saw that Barillo Ho everybody thought was deadwas alive Depp's eyes were taken out Depp seems no treat anymore.. but we all know how that finished!The Ones ho watched the movieAgent Jorge FBI goes undercover to try and get the truth behind what's going on in the MOBBussiness he teams up with exMafia Mickey Rourke ho is wanted in the US Jorge know's that and uses Rourke's desire to get back the US to find out more about Barillo and General Marquez's plans he asks for Rourke's help because Barillo killed Jorge's best friend and Rourke agrees. In the end Jorge get's to deep and finds Barillo's body on a plastic surgery table completely covered with blood! Jorge tries to get out of the Hospital as soon as he can but is stunned when he sees Barillo in front of him Alive in the steps. Agent Jorge then gets Knocked out by Barillo's daughter  Eva Mendes.As the popularity of El Presidente seems to be dropping his adviser advises him to stay as much as he can in the presidential palace leaving the president thinking that the people of Mexico are trying to kill him!The President questions the loyalty of his people but in the end finds out that they are the only ones he can trust!In the end Antonio Banderas shot General Marquez for brutally killing his wife Salma Hayek ho was pregnant Hayek had a relationship with Marquez but then shot him in the head Marquez didn't die and swore revenge. Helped by Enrique Iglesias Banderas gets his revenge on Marquez.Agent Jorge gets a showdown with Barillo the man ho shot Jorge's best Friend and takes revenge.In the end it seems like a movie about the Mexican Liberation with the main thing the plotting of a Coe d'etat.But overall i wasn't overly impressed as i have seen movie's about Mexican Leberations before!

Now there's Once Upon a Time In Mexico a ridiculously overthetop highbudget fun film.The plot here is very knotted and confusing but still very good. As far as I can figure it is about a man who has ruined El Mariachi's life General Marquez and his plan to kill the president. An FBI Agent is out to stop him so he hires El Mariachi and various other people.Now for the cast all were excellent.Antonio Banderas made a thrilling return as El Mariachi. Salma Hayek also makes a fun return as Carolina. Johnnny Depp plays a funny interesting and colorful Agent Sands the FBI agent who hires El Mariachi. Danny Trejo was great as Cucuy Sands' tail on El Mariachi. Cheech Marin was fitting for the part of Belini the informant who gives Sands his intel. Ruben Blades was EXCELLENT as Jorge Ramirez the retired FBI agent brought back to the force by Sands unofficially anyway. El Mariachi's friends Lorenzo Enrique Iglesias and Fideo Marco Leonardi were interesting. Eva Mendes was even notterrible as the agent Ajedrez. Pedro Armendriz Jr. gave a decent performance as the president. And Julio Oscar Mechoso was good as the president's adviser.Now for the bad guys Willem Dafoe gives a very evil performance as Barillo who hired Marquez to kill the president. Mickey Rourke was extraordinary as Billy Chambers Barillo's righthand man. Gerardo Vigil was great as General Marquez as well. The special effects here were 1st rate and came in handy a lot. There were many good action scenes and the comedy was well placed and funny. The music score was decent also.Over all fans of El Mariachi and Desperado will enjoy Once Upon a Time in Mexico810".

And the legend of El Mariachi reaches new heights of adventure. The first two were good but I felt that this sequel wasn't really needed. This film is pretty much plot less as it was just a bunch of different action sequences. The story was weak and it seemed like this film was only run by star power and gory action scenes. It works a little for this film since the actors on screen actually do a good enough job. Not all the actors are strong though but most of the important characters are. Antonio Banderas did a pretty good job which is surprising since I don't really like him. Salma Hayek was pretty good eye candy but gave only a mediocre performance. Johnny Depp gives a really good and funny performance. He probably did the best and he was really entertaining to watch on screen. Eva Mendes isn't in the movie very much and even though she usually is pretty good I couldn't stand her this time. There are also a lot of other smaller roles played by talented actors like Danny Trejo and Willem Dafoe. Robert Rodriguez does a good job of directing really gory action but pretty much leaves out everything else such as character development. The action is done well and its pretty entertaining to watch. The film is very gory well not over the top gory but it sometimes becomes unnecessary. The movie is cheesy as the story is kind of dumb and so is the dialog. The film doesn't really get dull though as the 100 minutes running time feels short. This isn't really a film worth watching but its somewhat of a fun experience. In the end this may be worth checking out on video as long as you don't want a good story but just gory action.

	schema:headline " Sporadically enjoyable but the plot is a total shambles";
	schema:reviewBody "El Mariachi has long quit the gunslinger trade but is offered a chance to avenge the death of his wife and daughter by slightly unhinged CIA agent Sands.  Sands is trying to control a coup by allowing it to happy but then having the victor killed as soon as he takes power.  However the involvement of drug lord Barillo and various other groups soon complicate matters causing bullets to come from all sides.After taking an unlikely trilogy to box office success Rodriguez returns to the film series that basically brought him the success he has today  El Mariachi.  While the first film in the series was a very cheap movie the second and the third swelled with budget and star names.  Here the action is constant and is very stylised.  This is not to say that it is all edge of the seat stuff but if spectacle and bangs is all you are after then this should do the job nicely.  None of it moves slowly simply because it has more than enough going on to fill the time  but that's the problem to be honest.The plot has so much going on but none of it actually fits together or makes a whole lot of sense.  After a while any attempt to put things together in my head became a wasted effort  clearly the point here was that the style and gloss was meant to be everything.  The other downside to this is that some characters are so poorly used that it's a wonder as to why they were even written in.  Some cameos are fantastic and make the film.  I refer to of course Depp who for the second time this summer manages to make a film better by his sheer witty performance.  He owes a lot to the writing of the character but he carries him off superbly and is darkly funny.  However Rouke Blades Mendes Dafoe all have little to do and with some of them are just clutter.  Banderas does his usual stuff with style but his character doesn't have the depth that the flashbacks I think are meant to give him  again this is style over substance.I still quite enjoyed the film but couldn't help but feel it was less the sum of it's parts.  With a budget big names and lots of action I was surprised that the cluttered shambolic plot managed to take away from the fun' as much as it did  but it did.  Quite enjoyable but you need a LOT of style to win compensate for the total lack of substance.".

	onyx:emotionText "El Mariachi has long quit the gunslinger trade but is offered a chance to avenge the death of his wife and daughter by slightly unhinged CIA agent Sands.  Sands is trying to control a coup by allowing it to happy but then having the victor killed as soon as he takes power.  However the involvement of drug lord Barillo and various other groups soon complicate matters causing bullets to come from all sides.After taking an unlikely trilogy to box office success Rodriguez returns to the film series that basically brought him the success he has today  El Mariachi.  While the first film in the series was a very cheap movie the second and the third swelled with budget and star names.  Here the action is constant and is very stylised.  This is not to say that it is all edge of the seat stuff but if spectacle and bangs is all you are after then this should do the job nicely.  None of it moves slowly simply because it has more than enough going on to fill the time  but that's the problem to be honest.The plot has so much going on but none of it actually fits together or makes a whole lot of sense.  After a while any attempt to put things together in my head became a wasted effort  clearly the point here was that the style and gloss was meant to be everything.  The other downside to this is that some characters are so poorly used that it's a wonder as to why they were even written in.  Some cameos are fantastic and make the film.

	schema:reviewBody "With Once Upon a Time in Mexico director Robert Rodriguez returns to his El Mariachi roots  but unlike the prodigal son this particular homecoming provides little cause for celebration. Rodriguez' signature style is visual inventiveness combined with wise guy humor and cartoon violence. The problem is that his films rarely have the depth of content to go along with all that directorial razzmatazz. As a result they tend to become little more than empty cold exercises in style  and Once Upon a Time in Mexico is no exception.The film is obviously intended as some sort of satire on the kind of governmental and political corruption that has plagued that North American country since the Spaniards first set foot on Mexican soil. The messy overcomplicated plot involves a vicious drug cartel's planning to stage a coup d'etat against the current government and a murderous CIA agent's working behind the scenes pulling the strings of all the parties involved. Just trying to keep all the plot lines and characters straight requires a program and a score card. Antonio Banderas heads an allstar cast that includes Salma Hayek Mickey Rourke Enrique Iglesias Cheech Marin Willem Dafoe and Ruben Blades but the only person who gets to do any real ACTING is Johnny Depp as the gringo CIA agent but even he is reduced to selfmimicry after awhile. Moreover the tone of the film is so dispassionate so flip and arch that we find ourselves completely detached from what's taking place on screen.Once Upon a Time in Mexico is one of those films in which the actors spend most of their time winking at the camera to let us know that they're in on the joke and the director performs somersaults with his camera to keep reminding us of just how cool and with it he is. Unfortunately all style and no substance makes Robert a very dull filmmaker.".

It seemed more like a movie done between the Duff sisters for fun. You could tell they were acting not very believable. I'm one of the people who don't normally notice these things too! The plot wasn't that unique and it was so short with nothing really happening and it was predictable. Yuck! I'm sure they had fun making it but I didn't have fun watching it.

It seemed more like a movie done between the Duff sisters for fun. You could tell they were acting not very believable. I'm one of the people who don't normally notice these things too! The plot wasn't that unique and it was so short with nothing really happening and it was predictable. Yuck! I'm sure they had fun making it but I didn't have fun watching it.

In fact we own Hilary's previous movies on DVD and I figured we'd eventually own this one too. Now that I've seen wasted money on is another way to say it this movie I can tell you I will not ever buy this and will never watch this again.The only reason I gave this a one instead of a two is that I genuinely like the Duff sisters. I was looking forward to a movie that my daughter would like and I would enjoy if not just tolerate. I think the sisters should fire their agents advisers producers or whoever put them up to this. It did nothing to enhance their careers. And I'm still not sure who they thought their audience is. Certainly no adults would or should choose to see this movie if they weren't going for their daughters but neither was this movie properly aimed at young girls the Duffs' main fan base. As far as the PG rating I am not a prude  I actually own Mean Girls and I am fairly liberal about what my children watch e.g. we love Friends even though others think the material is not always appropriate for kids but I squirmed in my seat for the moms that had younger children in the audience as well as for my 11 year old daughter. Without going into detail  no spoilers  there were blatant references to adultery gang banging and sex that I did not think appropriate at all. There was some foul language. There was outright prejudice against all sorts of people. Referencing an earlier review yes the comment was about I Love Lucy and not a Hispanic nanny but nonetheless annoying anyway.Most importantly the movie was mindless and it didn't have to be. The Duff sisters aside there were some genuinely talented people in the cast Anjelica Huston Maria Conchita Alonso but the script was so bad that there was no saving this movie. There was a shot at redemption near the end but the screenwriters blew that too. How do these things even become movies? It's almost as if the creators know that this movie won't last but a nanosecond in history as evidenced by the constant mainstream references and advertising plugs. Technically there was bad continuity Check out Hilary's hairstyles  in the beginning there is one scene where her french braid magically disappears with a camera angle change or the lips moving out of sequence with the dialogueand the jarring special effects editing were distracting and juvenile.Like the characters themselves this movie is all form with no substance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Material Girls reviewed by Sam Osbornrating 1 out of 4There's a moment in Material Girls when the infinitely wise and humble lawyer at the Free Legal Clinic bears down on the equally infinite stupidity of Ava Marchetta Haylie Duff and coolly snarls you're all frosting without the cupcake. Granted this oneliner is of no great wit or intelligence it does hold a kind of allencompassing truth about Material Girls. Except in saying Material Girls has as much density as a cupcake's frosting is probably giving the film a world of credit it has no business deserving. The gimmick of Material Girls is in the Duff sisters. Whatever film photographed behind them on the film's posters is immaterial. For all we care this could be Hong Kong Kung Fu Fury just as long as it stars the Duff sisters. So in the same way people go to see Snakes on a Plane just to see some actual snakes on an actual plane people will go see Material Girls only to watch they're adolescent idols bouncing and hopping and giggling about in front of the camera. The quality of the film behind them is irrelevant just a prettily painted canvas for a blonde hullabaloo. But for all those parents goaded into bringing their tenyear old daughter I suppose a synopsis is appropriate. Ava and Tanzie Marchetta Haylie and Hilary Duff are the faces of Marchetta Facial Products. They're glistening socialites in the vane world inhabited in reality by Paris Hilton and her partying cohortsminus the sex tapes. They're father Victor Marchetta passed away two years earlier and the company will soon be left in the girls' hands. But when a cutrate newscaster breaks a scandal on Marchetta products causing cancer the girls' stock plummets and they're left gasp without their credit cards. The girls must unite and disprove the accusations in order to save the image of their father. In the process of course Ava and Tanzie must learn humility and sincerity through the conduit of their loss of funds and fortune. Director Martha Coolidge stumbles in her approach to the material. The film's intention bounces between parody and sentimentality. Sometimes it strives to ooze sympathy for its ditzy protagonists and rolls out the morals by the bushel. But other times Coolidge ravages her characters with a volley of farcical gags. There's a happy middleground between the two intentions that a better director would likely find where the believably clueless socialites learn to interact with the similarly convincing world of middleclass American society. But Coolidge veers more towards the feel of a sitcom sans laughtrack. Without it the jokes fall flat. Neither of the Duffs have a sense of comic timing and the screenplay doesn't bother with helping them along. Material Girls is so woefully unfunny that not even the heaps of twelveyear girls could be heard laughing. Just before the film started I mistimed my restroom break and admittedly missed the opening minute or two of the movie. I asked my girlfriend who'd been kind enough to sit through its entirety what I'd missed afterwards in that opening minute. She explained it to me and I felt a deep sympathy for her. She was subjected to two more minutes of Material Girls and the thought of any more torture was physically painful to me. That's essentially the effect Material Girls has it is physically painful to endure. www.samseescinema.com".

I really sympathize more with their friends fairweather as they may be who I saw as very intelligent rats who were finally blessed with an excuse to desert a sinking ship.The girls decide that dear daddy couldn't have done all those mean things he was accused ofcreating makeup that causes facerotting cancerand set out to prove it. They enlist the help of a hunky young lab technician and a hunky young attorney to clear daddy's name and set out on a adventure fraught with perilpublic transportationand hardshiphaving nothing to wear.This movie might have been tolerable perhaps even enjoyable if it had not been for one major factor the characters have no real motive for anything they do. The girls aren't threatened with destitution they're about to make millions off of the sale of their company. They have all the money they could ever want but it isn't enough for them.

They end up right back where they started with all the money clothes friends makeup and teacup chihuahuas they weren't actually in any danger of losing.The film tries very very hard to provide the characters with some deeper motivation. They're not fighting for the spare change they lost over the scandal no they're fighting to clear their father's name! They're not throwing a tantrum over hurt feelings they're standing up for themselves! The movie tries so very very hard to show the girls learning some lesson about humility or responsibility or some other such teen movie drabble and it fails completely. Both girls get all their money and their boys and the movie comes across as a taunt to the audience. A sort of Ha ha we're so cool. Don't you wish you could be cool like us? Let's go get manicures! And after that shoes! message. In the end this film might entertain Paris Hilton but the rest of us are left wondering why today's society encourages this type of behavior and more importantly why we wasted 97 minutes of our time watching this film.".

Based on those two pieces of eye candy alone I give the two.Without their looks I would give it a 0.If you want to watch a better chick teen flick try Mean Girls.

Subplots appeared out of nowhere and dropped out without explanation. But the worst parts of the movie and there are so many bad moments were the little touches of racism Hillary Duff's imitation of a gangbanger by putting on a bad Mexican accent and the black executive's the only minor character who didn't overact actually breaking out into rap at the end.

	schema:reviewBody "OK so Material girls is awful. It's bland redundant silly clichd but strangely likable. There is just nothing right about this movie. It's all wrong. but it's very likable like it's two stars. Hilary and Haylie Duff are not good actresses by any stretch but they have that something that makes them popular. Barely retaining any talent they managed to stay in the spotlight. As for the movie it's about two sisters that are heads of their late fathers Cosmetics company they're socialites and referred to as the Marscheta sisters. Overnight a scandal takes place and bankrupts their entire company. Leaving them on their own to fend for themselves. There is of course the obligatory corny romances Hilary with hottie Columbo and Haylie with geeky but endearing Haas. Huston plays the villain the head of Fabiella cosmetics looking to buy their company. Although she really isn't much of a villain and Spiner of TV's Star Trek Data stars as their chummy trustee. The film works as you would think it would. There is nothing especially surprising about it. Except that it's just a bit more grown up of a film than you might usually expect from Hilary Duff. You'll finally recognize that her body has filled out and she's not afraid to flaunt it especially her upper half. Recently she became quite emaciated but has filled out since than and looks healthy and good very good. And there is a strange prison lesbian scene with Hilary it's all there upping the awfulness and yet adding to the likability as well. This is a strange movie when it does everything wrong but you just can't hate it. Martha Coolidge directed this likable mess and it's a far cry from her much better but slightly muddled Prince and me. So yes I found myself disappointed but not by much. It's kind of what I expected. there was minimal advertisisng and not a big push for the film. But hey I liked it I think...12 out of four ????".

Yeah I thought so. Both movies are pack rat movies bursting to the seams with exurbanite fashion and huge amounts of blingscreaming and shopping trips. they both also feature a common theme that it is always good to work for your money and after enduring some minor hardships they come out changed people. they also come out with hot boy toys and a greater sense of the world.

You see the sisters character develop into something that teaches teamwork and hardwork you young people. Especially young women might find this good for them. Although it is interesting for me to see that the soundtrack is also done by the sisters. This is no coincidence of course. Hilary in real life is a hard working person for her career which reminds me of her character in this material girls film. This movie reminds me of Madonna's song material girl. I am quite a movie and entertainment enthusiast so I notice small things such as this. Thank you for your time Mikhalt".

Blithely oblivious to anything outside their cocoon of comfort Tanzie Hilary and Ava Marchetta Haylie devote themselves to partying frequently and dressing fashionably when they're not occupied with minimal duties as the ubiquitous faces for the eponymous cosmetics firm founded by their late father.For most of the first halfhour or so the Marchetta sisters come across as insufferable ditzes even during their random acts of noblesse oblige. When a worshipful underling compliments Tanzie's dress Tanzie beams brightly and responds Thank you. Maybe when I'm finished with it I'll give it to you.After a tabloid TV reporter Henry Cho breaks the news that Marchetta products may have disfiguring side effects the company's stock nosedives corporate assets are frozen  and the sisters become social pariahs. So...Tanzie and Ava set out to clear their father's name and reclaim their father's fortune by disproving the reports of disfiguring side effects. A bad situation gets appreciably worse when thanks to their own dimwittedness Tanzie and Ava manage to burn down their mansion and lose their expensive car. They wind up having to rely on the hospitality of their former maid Maria Conchita Alonso while trying to master the workingclass routine of riding the bus applying for jobs and doing really really gross things like washing dishes.While doing so each sibling acquires her very own romantic interest a pro bono lawyer Lukas Haas for Ava a hunky lab assistant Marcus Coloma for Tanzie.My Opinion I haven't watched anything that is more dumbly lacking in subtlety. Never. Stupid meaningless plot crap acting racist comments and so many more negative things. Frankly movies like Material Girls sicken me. Although I wasn't expecting anything more intelligent or professional because of the fact that it got only a 2.0How embarrassing!and I don't like Hil or her sister at all my friend still dragged me to the theaters. PersonallyI couldn't spot anything that was meant to be funny in this movie let alone any talented acting skills.Do not waste your money and time for a raff like this.

The plot is predictable but the main saving grace is Steve Austin as Jack Conrad as he comes across as a compassionate and somewhat likable hero who ended up in this predicament by trying to do the right thing for his country. He does not exactly have to stretch his acting muscle but you do end up hoping he will win through. Although much of the violence is not right in your face in parts it does carry on that bit long although this is used to separate the no morals no borders team from the good guys within the production cast. This movie serves up exactly what it promises but is still an entertaining movie. I would recommend to a friend.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Condemned";
	schema:reviewBody "At first glance the storyline looks like a distant cousin to the Japanese movie Battle Royale. Instead of having sent unruly students to an island and see them finish off one another The Condemned follows the same lines of having 10 death row prisoners from around the world being brought to an island and given a simple rule to kill everyone else in order to earn their survival and freedom. They are similarly rigged with an explosive device which if tampered or if they choose not to participate they too will be blown to bits.But there's where the similarity stops. There's no PA system to tell the scattered involuntary participants just how many survivors there are thus leading to a loophole and there are multiple camera rigs installed on the island for the purpose of entertainment. The Condemned plays on some of our intrinsic nature of wanting to watch gladiatorial styled violence and given that such content will probably never get on the TV networks the fairly scifi turned reality TV over IP concept gets its airtime here. What networks refuse to screen and produce you can given the right equipment and personnel and plenty of computing power.Payperview IPTV using credit cards is the road to riches for the game producer Ian Breckel Robert Mammone who champions the thought of producing content that audiences around the world want to watch. His argument was that these handpicked participants are going to die anyway and here he's giving one of them the chance to live a noble gesture to him. The Condemned mocks today's reality TV format in that sometimes the game can be manipulated to satisfy the producers' objectives and we see that in abundance here.Violence it seems is high on the agenda here  how much can an audience stomach especially if say hypothetically Big Brother type of series allow violence to be met out live unedited and raw. Or are you going to play to those who pay and give in to the demand? There's a constant argument being played out early in the movie about dignity and decency but that gets forgotten fairly easily in a film like this one falling victim to its own preachy statements.Especially so when Sports Entertainment companies like WWE are involved in this one. WWE had its fair share of stars lending their acting talent to Hollywood and I can go as far back as the late Andre the Giant lending his physical presence in The Princess Bride. Then you have Hulk Hogan in various forgettable flicks The Rock in some charismatic roles though some are as cheesy as that in Be Cool and Kane in the horrid See No Evil. Here Stone Cold Steve Austin plays the lead role of Jack Conrad an inmate with an unspecified past who becomes someone more than anyone had bargained for.But the star unfortunately is not Austin as much as he plays the antihero. Vinny Jones as British prisoner Ewan McStarley clearly stole his thunder and injected more personality into his maniacal character. While the format of the game had the prisoners from different parts of the world to allow everyone a chance to root for their home players it was at times ironic that USA had to battle UK so prominently in the movie and that the with me or against me line just brings to mind the many scenarios as played out ever so often. It's rara for the USA in an inyourface fashion with eyeforaneye violence dished out for avenging the weak and wounded and the showing of compassion to those who needs it. The make up of the team of pla yers too is interesting on purpose with female players up against male ones and what happens is such an easy guess and Survivor styled formation of alliances outwitting outlasting outplaying all being key to survival but the story with so many characters dictate that you cannot go beyond what is superficially shown. Of course the leads got a little more background to show for but you find that these happen to be just cosmetics unnecessarily inflating the screening duration.The Condemned tried to be a little deep but ended up tossing its attempts aside to settle for an all out action movie towards the end and what I thought was bordering on the ridiculous at Austin's ability. For action junkies the sequences here might be a little repetitive with its usual big explosions and the extreme closeups of violence using the shaky handheld camera technique just irritates. If the premise still excites you after all the mentioned flaws then The Condemned managed to appeal to you with its inmovie concept  I think you'll pay US 49.95 should there be a channel like this on the internet.".

	schema:reviewBody "The concept is simple 10 vicious felons are put onto an empty island and told that the last one standing after 30 hours will go free. To make their efforts to kill each other weapons have been stashed in various places around the island. To make the effort pay itself off the organizer of this event is airing it over the internet where viewers can subscribe and watch the mayhem. Naturally one of these felons is actually a good guy who's wrongly in prison.As a setup for a testosterone packed action film it is hard to argue that it's bad since it does pretty much what it sets out to do. The whole subplot of violence as entertainment is also interesting enough. Naturally both of these things have been tackled on film before and in better form than this but this by no means makes the film bomb by trying to out run itself and be too smart. Where the film does mess up is with another subplot involving the hero trying to get back to his wife. You see he was a government agent and went to prison to keep his cover as a badguy and this kept him out of contact with his wife. Not only is this the most clichd part of the film it is the least interesting and the least relevant to the message that the main part of the film sets up. Sure there needs to be some audience sympathy for the protagonist in a film like this but it shouldn't interfere with the rest of the movie.Another thing is the shaky cam as it has come to be called. Is this some sort of budget cutting device? The production doesn't use dollies and camera rigs any more to cut down costs? The fight scenes here are pretty good and they should be in an action film but with such messy camera work they are not shown very well. Some films manage to have good shaky cam scenes as they give it a certain edge but many films either get the rhythm wrong or go to far and it doesn't look as good as it could have looked.  610BsCDb Classification 13  violence profanity".

Steve Austin was good giving what he had to work with although to be honest it did not really need any effort as this role is a mirror image of his tough guy persona in WWE  however it was funny watching try to play the silent tough guy who grunts quiet a bit! But the star of the show in my opinion was the proper English hardman Vinnie Jones  he was entertaining! The action was great along with the over the top theatrics which we see in the WWE . My complaints were that it drag on a little longer than it should of done I mean it was filled up in a few dull moments between fight scenes which were not needed and a few parts which tried to show that the characters had depth  that was just silly. To conclude  The condemned is not nearly as bad as people are making out to be its merely a time pass and it should not be compared to anything bigger or deeper like Battle Royale however if you would like to see it then make sure it is on one of your boring Monday nights.

	schema:reviewBody "American Variation on Battle Royale except in this film those put on the island squared off against each other with bomb locks around their ankles are adults..mostly those with a criminal past awaiting Death Row. Stone Cold Steve Austin is a black ops federal special forces agent Jack Conrad who was infiltrating a drug cartel when he was caught and imprisoned in a Central American jail bought and placed into the death tournament on a reality internet game. Vinnie Jones is a psychotic former special ops guy himself McStarley his was for the British government. The collar bombs have a trigger device that will go off if another competitor presses the button. Those handpicked to compete represent various countries and only one can survive with the prize being their freedom. The corrupt mastermind behind the whole operation is BreckelRobert Mammone who looks like a selfabsorbed Harvard grad with an insatiable desire to exploit a selected few to reap millions from those craving real violence..he wishes to put on a good show by manipulating his audience establishing heroes villains and the weak victims who are unable to outlast the stronger more savage foes. We watch as the condemned fight for survival trying to outwit each other as weapons are parachuted to McStarley and his temporary Japanese partner SaigaMasa Yamaguchipurposely by Breckel so that they can gain an advantage as a strategy to make his show more thoughtprovoking and gripping. What Breckel doesn't expect is how intelligent resourceful and cunning Conrad is and how he'll set his sights on getting even with ones responsible for placing him in this difficult dangerous situation. Breckel underestimates Conrad and an even bigger problem develops as his base camp operation is not too far from the action. Also a subplot is those searching for Conrad's whereabouts and attempting to pinpoint where Breckel's operation is located.Those expecting a bloody good time will be sorely disappointed as the frenetic camera work disrupts any kind of thrill the premise might produce. You see a blizzard of blows flash by as the high octane editing process and constantly moving camera remove any possibility of seeing two competitors exchanging real blows in a proper fashion. Stone Cold Steve Austin is a credible enough hero and Vinnie Jones is as unhinged a psycho as ever before but they are undermined by sloppily staged action sequences which will likely give the intended audience a headache or the desperate craving for Dramamine by the time it's over. There's plenty of handtohand combat sequences which could really hum if the director and cinematographer could keep their damn camera still long enough for us to enjoy it. Perhaps the filmmakers didn't have enough faith in their leads to provide realistic combat but it's a shame that burdened by the rather thin storyline it can not deliver on what it's supposed to. Impressive setting with the jungle and dangerous rocks leading to rushing water as Breckel has cameras spread throughout capturing the action as it unfolds..also having men camouflaged filming some action live on the scene. An ongoing storyline has Breckel dealing with the animosity of members of his staff who are finding it hard to deal with the violence that is transpiring. Within the screenplay is an indictment on reality television and the desire for viewing real live bloodshed. Practically everyone's dead by the end of this film.".

The collar bombs have a trigger device that will go off if another competitor presses the button. Those handpicked to compete represent various countries and only one can survive with the prize being their freedom. The corrupt mastermind behind the whole operation is BreckelRobert Mammone who looks like a selfabsorbed Harvard grad with an insatiable desire to exploit a selected few to reap millions from those craving real violence..he wishes to put on a good show by manipulating his audience establishing heroes villains and the weak victims who are unable to outlast the stronger more savage foes. We watch as the condemned fight for survival trying to outwit each other as weapons are parachuted to McStarley and his temporary Japanese partner SaigaMasa Yamaguchipurposely by Breckel so that they can gain an advantage as a strategy to make his show more thoughtprovoking and gripping. What Breckel doesn't expect is how intelligent resourceful and cunning Conrad is and how he'll set his sights on getting even with ones responsible for placing him in this difficult dangerous situation. Breckel underestimates Conrad and an even bigger problem develops as his base camp operation is not too far from the action. Also a subplot is those searching for Conrad's whereabouts and attempting to pinpoint where Breckel's operation is located.Those expecting a bloody good time will be sorely disappointed as the frenetic camera work disrupts any kind of thrill the premise might produce. You see a blizzard of blows flash by as the high octane editing process and constantly moving camera remove any possibility of seeing two competitors exchanging real blows in a proper fashion. Stone Cold Steve Austin is a credible enough hero and Vinnie Jones is as unhinged a psycho as ever before but they are undermined by sloppily staged action sequences which will likely give the intended audience a headache or the desperate craving for Dramamine by the time it's over. There's plenty of handtohand combat sequences which could really hum if the director and cinematographer could keep their damn camera still long enough for us to enjoy it. Perhaps the filmmakers didn't have enough faith in their leads to provide realistic combat but it's a shame that burdened by the rather thin storyline it can not deliver on what it's supposed to. Impressive setting with the jungle and dangerous rocks leading to rushing water as Breckel has cameras spread throughout capturing the action as it unfolds..also having men camouflaged filming some action live on the scene. An ongoing storyline has Breckel dealing with the animosity of members of his staff who are finding it hard to deal with the violence that is transpiring. Within the screenplay is an indictment on reality television and the desire for viewing real live bloodshed. Practically everyone's dead by the end of this film.";

	schema:headline " The Condemned manages to keep you entertained but fails to keep you interested";
	schema:reviewBody "The Condemned has a very straightforward plot. It tells the story of John Conrad Stone Cold Steve Austin who is purchased from a Central American prison. The buyer is a TV producer named Ian Breckel who has purchased 9 others just like Conrad mass murders who are awaiting death penalties in their respective prisons. Breckel has the idea to transport these 10 contestants to an island near New Guinea where they will fight to the death the last remaining person after 30 hours will be set free. But there are catches all contestants have an ankle brace that carries multiple C4 bombs that will explode if the tag is pulled out or if the 30 hour time limit is up and not 9 other contestants are dead.That might sound entertaining and it is. The film is filled with brutal violence that you can't feel guilty about. Another positive is that it doesn't try to become smart it stays at it's level and never drifts away from it's unoriginal plot. The last positive is surprisinglySteve Austin is not half bad as the star. Despite being a wrestler with no movie talent he says as much dialogue as Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry and the majority of his time on screen is him fighting other opponents. I can also say he is much better than John Cena in The Marine. Unfortunately there are undeniable negatives. Including the entertaining violence getting uncontrollably repetitive the abrupt ending and the everything that happens outside of the violence. Whenever the film cuts to the audience or the people running the show the film slows down. That is the perfect time to go to the bathroom.If you were going to see this film wait till DVD. It may look interesting but it's not. It just keeps rambling on with violence and gore and the film never goes higher than an ATTEMPT to make a decent film. When the film begins the WWE films logo comes up and that right there brings it down a few notches and the negative elements don't help it's cause.610".

	schema:headline " The Condemned is the audience";
	schema:reviewBody "It is natural to expect that a product of WWE Films would be hardhitting and action packed. But when the audience cannot properly see and enjoy the action the end result is disappointing. WWE Film's latest production The Condemned offers bountiful opportunities for action fans to satisfy their hunger. But due to the poor directorial work it becomes a tease. Even the star power and fan following of the film's lead former WWE wrestler Steve Austin was not enough could not save this debacle. The Condemned is one big mess that leaves the audience wondering what was the crime they committed to deserve this sentence.On a remote South Pacific island television producer Ian Breckel Robert Mammone has bought 10 death row prisoners for his own deadly game of Survivor. The convicts will fight to the death until there is only one winner who will gain their freedom. Breckel plans on broadcasting the carnage over the Internet in hopes of gaining huge profits for himself. Among the prisoners are the mysterious Jack Conrad Steve Austin and the homicidal Ewan McStarley Vinny Jones. The game is now on for what is literally the fight of their lives.Scott Wiper's direction is the biggest downfall to what could have been a great action movie. With quick cuts accompanied by hard rock Wiper seems to be directing a music video more than a feature film. He does not let the audience fully benefit and appreciate the prisoners fighting oneonone. Instead of using a wide shot to show the convicts going at it Wiper opts to use closeups of the actors who are dishing out the punishment. This severely takes away from the concept of the story and the film. The basis is to show what murderous felons would do when placed on in a life or death situation. By reducing the visual effectiveness the point becomes moot. When the actors are not moving Wiper's direction gets better. He does to a well enough job in showing the more brutal crimes such as rape without having to show the actual deed. The implication itself does more for the audience than the filming ever could.The weak direction is accompanied by an equally weak script by Wiper and Rob Hedden. The story begins decently with the battle of wills between convicts. It is when the story turns into a forced morality tale that it falls apart and makes the audience hang their heads and groan. Throughout the duration of the film the story becomes filled with the standard counterpoint arguments e.g. the convicts are human beings violence is simply entertainment etc. These arguments would have made a more profound impact if they could not have been seen a mile away. If the script makes it known that these prisoners are hardened and remorseless criminals what is the purpose of having empathy for them?

	onyx:emotionText "It is natural to expect that a product of WWE Films would be hardhitting and action packed. But when the audience cannot properly see and enjoy the action the end result is disappointing. WWE Film's latest production The Condemned offers bountiful opportunities for action fans to satisfy their hunger. But due to the poor directorial work it becomes a tease. Even the star power and fan following of the film's lead former WWE wrestler Steve Austin was not enough could not save this debacle. The Condemned is one big mess that leaves the audience wondering what was the crime they committed to deserve this sentence.On a remote South Pacific island television producer Ian Breckel Robert Mammone has bought 10 death row prisoners for his own deadly game of Survivor. The convicts will fight to the death until there is only one winner who will gain their freedom. Breckel plans on broadcasting the carnage over the Internet in hopes of gaining huge profits for himself. Among the prisoners are the mysterious Jack Conrad Steve Austin and the homicidal Ewan McStarley Vinny Jones. The game is now on for what is literally the fight of their lives.Scott Wiper's direction is the biggest downfall to what could have been a great action movie. With quick cuts accompanied by hard rock Wiper seems to be directing a music video more than a feature film. He does not let the audience fully benefit and appreciate the prisoners fighting oneonone. Instead of using a wide shot to show the convicts going at it Wiper opts to use closeups of the actors who are dishing out the punishment. This severely takes away from the concept of the story and the film. The basis is to show what murderous felons would do when placed on in a life or death situation. By reducing the visual effectiveness the point becomes moot. When the actors are not moving Wiper's direction gets better. He does to a well enough job in showing the more brutal crimes such as rape without having to show the actual deed. The implication itself does more for the audience than the filming ever could.The weak direction is accompanied by an equally weak script by Wiper and Rob Hedden. The story begins decently with the battle of wills between convicts. It is when the story turns into a forced morality tale that it falls apart and makes the audience hang their heads and groan. Throughout the duration of the film the story becomes filled with the standard counterpoint arguments e.g. the convicts are human beings violence is simply entertainment etc. These arguments would have made a more profound impact if they could not have been seen a mile away. If the script makes it known that these prisoners are hardened and remorseless criminals what is the purpose of having empathy for them? The point of violence is entertainment is a dispute against the film itself. Wiper and Hedden seem to saying that it is wrong for the audience to be watching this brutal film they have created.Even with a role that seems tailormade for Steve Austin he is not able reach the full potential of the character.

I was really surprised how well this movie was put together. The plot is strong 10 people who are all on death row for various crimes are brought to an island by a rich man. The objective be the last person standing in 30 hours and you will be set free. The entire game is broadcast over the internet. The characters are very well casted. Steve Austin makes a great lead character while Vinnie Jones Juggernaut from Xmen 3 and the many other characters create a real sense of danger and desperation. I would definitely recommend you do not pass this one up. It can be a great movie to watch alone but is more fun to watch in a group. If you're in the movie store pick up a copy. You won't be disappointed.".

The conditions are that the script is intelligent basically logical fairly realistic and the characters reflect real people at least to a healthy extent. Can they do it? They are given a lifetime to complete the goal but can they actually switch on their brains and will at least one of them succeed in coming up with something other than moronic garbage? That's the reallife reality show I wanna watch. And laugh to.I just found out that The Condemned is a remake of a Japanese film with a similar premise with students i.e. perhaps even dumber and am not really surprised. Hollywood has become so decadently lacking in ideas and inspiration that remakes and ideatheft is practically all that's left.TC basically has a wrestler Steve Austin even if you never saw him you'll immediately know he's a wrestler the face the body and the strange linedelivery are a dead giveaway who plays an appallingly dumb exnavy guymarinewhatever. He makes bad decisions CONSTANTLY 1 he refuses the key for his handcuffs in what is meant to show his defiance toward his captors there are much smarter ways to defy someone than by shooting yourself in the foot that's the Bin Laden school of thought. 2 He gets a chance to telephone somebody  not exactly the norm in such a situation  and who does he call? His ex. What do they discuss? Her feelings. Only 5 minutes later does it dawn on him after his ex asks for his location that he should find out the coordinates for the island i.e. help the U.S. rescue team find him. 3 His refusal to kill Vinnie Jones which comes back like a boomerang. In fact the pacifistic aspect of Austin's character is laughable here we have a guy who killed more people than all the other 9 combined and yet he keeps sparing lives of murderers who threaten his own. So what is he an assassinwiththeheartofgold? A wrestlerwiththeheartofGandhi? More like the killerwiththepeanutbrain.There are many farfetched and just outright dumb things about TC. We have a multimillionaire who for some strange reason known only to himself i.e. which he refuses to share with the audience decides to become America's or even the world's mostwanted man by organizing a highly illegal game of Ten Little Indians. Why would he do that? We are told he is intelligent and we are told that he can sell a used chewinggum to a university professor. So why do this? How could he possibly think he could get away with it? Or be in hiding for the rest of his life? The assumption of course is that all multimillionaires let alone billionaires are corrupt immoral swine which is very rich  coming from fat decadent RICH Hollywood filmmakers.The game starts off with the ten contestants being thrown out of a helicopter. WHY??? It's obvious that the organizers went through great pains and spent tons of money on getting all these murderers released a harmless bit of idiocy by comparison so WHY would they want to risk having them all killed before the game even begins!? One of the ten actually does die straight away he is mistakenly thrown on the ground and impaled. Austin the wrestler is thrown on land too and survives because obviously wrestlers fall from 100 meters height every day and live to tell the tale. We've even got two females in the 10. We've even got a married couple! A married couple of serialkillers who behave like a regular nonpsychopathic pair! Full of love and tears for each other I think I'm gonna sob now! Tell you what. I don't even see any moral problem with taking 10 psychopaths condemned to death and letting them fight it out. Actually that would be poetic justice wouldn't it because most murderers are cowards and kill only from a position of physical strength and by surprise. Hence experiencing actual pain as opposed to merely getting hanged and dying quickly would be more just. However the problem in this silly movie is that the convicts do NOT all behave like psychopaths which they should logically be apart from Austin who predictably is jailed wrongly.I also have to address the laughable hypocrisy in the filmmakers trying to make a message you read that right at the end of the movie. The message is violence in society reality shows going overboard bla bla bla. The only problem is that this very movie caters to the public's insatiable appetite for violence as well! Ridiculous and so transparent.One of the most illogical moments in the film is when Young and the Japanese guy decide to fight each other thinkingknowing that they're the last ones left. One question HOW could either of them possibly have known that the others were all dead well apart from Austin?? TC doesn't start so badly has an okay cast of killers Austin can't act but he's likable enough plus Jones is always fun to have and could have been a fun mindless action film if it had stuck solely to the action and if there had been an iota of an effort not to have so much nonsense in it. Like the dull malarkey surrounding the millionaire's filmcrew rebellion against the show.A movie made by idiots for idiots.".

The fights were way too choppy they pretty much have cameras on several angles and constantly keep jumping camera to camera and you can hardly even tell who's winning the fight. So let me get into the plot and try not to give much away.So a TV producer creates an internet show where convicts across the world are sent to an island to fight to the death the winner gets freedom and money. So they spend way too much time on the producer and his girlfriend despising him more and more over the show and his crew turning against him. The convicts have very little to no back story pretty much a few of them have their crimes mentioned and that's all you ever know about them. They spend too much time away from the convicts like they show what Steve Austin's girlfriend is doing despite her never doing anything useful in the entire movie except answer the phone twice and watch the webcast.So again the fights were badly filmed. The kills were very lame. Every convict has an exploding ankle bracelet with a tab if someone pulls the tab then it blows up in 10 seconds. All you see is a cheesy fire explosion without a single drop of blood or even a body. They also try so hard to be shocking and edgy by doing things like having an off camera rape scene where the film crew just sits there and does nothing about. They also do the whole Cannibal Holocaust thing where they try to send the message of if we try to profit for such horrid things then how are we better than them. But they don't do anything shocking in this movie to hit the message home.All you're really left with is just a mediocre ripoff of Con Air Battle Royale and Cannibal Holocaust. Not much blood not enough action very little character development a very predictable plot we all know from the start that the good guy lives and the bad guys don't. They never even try to swerve the audience it's just a very predictable movie that tries to have a message just to attempt to make it look smart. So if you get a free rental at Blockbuster or get it really cheap then maybe you might want to watch it. But I'd rather you just get The Running Man Con Air Battle Royale or just play the video game Manhunt. All of those will satisfy you in ways this movie never can.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wrestlers tend to achieve success mostly within the squared circle some use that circle as a way to jump into other forms of entertainment such as TV and cinemas not many succeed. Dwayne Johnson seems to be an exception to the rule as he has proved himself as a great action star and has good range. Since then the WWE has been trying to jump start other wrestlers into the spotlight through their own movie studio WWE Films and their box office results show that movies starring WWE wrestlers are a tough sell. It's understandable it's hard for anyone outside the wrestling scene to take a movie starring a wrestler seriously. But fan or no fan nothing stops you from checking out this movie. Personally I've seen all the WWE Films made so far See No Evil was a fairly good horror movieit also happen to star one of my personal favorite wrestlers Kane The Marine on the other hand could have so much better if the director wasn't so busy trying to figure out what story he wanted to tell in The Marine. The Condemned turns out to be the best of all the three movies so far. For those who don't know The Condemned is a story about 10 convicted felons who must fight to the death in a remote Pacific island and the last man standing walks away a millionaire by the production company who streams the event to all Internetpaying costumers making it a genuine bloodsportsnuff film bombs are attached to their ankles and are set to explode within 30 hours they also explode immediately if they are tampered withyeahit does sounds a little too much like The Running Man or the Japanese thriller Battle Royal.

Note His terrible line from that movie I'm the Juggernaut b! still echoes in my mind. And Nathan Jones who has gotten roles in recent Kung Fu movies such as The Protector aka Tom Yum Goong. Stone Cold plays a part he's most accustomed to a foulmouthed trouble maker and I can't say his range is the best but much like Kane in See No Evil this movie suits him just fine. The action is featured through quick cuts and always moving camera it makes it's more energetic and adds more suspense but it also makes people feel a little dizzy it has become fairly common on lots of movies today but in the case of Condemned it works kinda off. They could've been less shaky that's one complaint. The moral dilemma in the movie is also fairly wellplayed and it focuses on a popular urban legend subject which is snuff films. How far will you to be entertained? What are the standards in this area? What and where are the boundaries? Though the movie is sorta sending a mix signal because we can look at it as this way the movie's a giant mess of recorded violence and it's telling us in a way not to see it...but OK we get the message people who watch convicts killing off each other deserve some form of moral judgment or so one of the distressed reporters says somillions of people paying 50 bucks to watch live murder...what a scary thoughshudders. The movie also doesn't paint alternative mediasuch as blogs message boards and chat rooms in the best light as the villains pretty much use them to generate awareness for their payperview show again scary. The Condemned is pretty good for all it's worth it doesn't need a complicated plot it delivers the bare essentials as far as action movies go perhaps closer to the ultraviolent movies of the 80's and 90's then what The Marine was trying to accomplish. It's also far more mature then The Marine some scarce oneliners is pretty much all the humor you'll find in this movie. Give it a chance it's worth seeing it in the movie theaters at least once.".

	onyx:emotionText "Wrestlers tend to achieve success mostly within the squared circle some use that circle as a way to jump into other forms of entertainment such as TV and cinemas not many succeed. Dwayne Johnson seems to be an exception to the rule as he has proved himself as a great action star and has good range. Since then the WWE has been trying to jump start other wrestlers into the spotlight through their own movie studio WWE Films and their box office results show that movies starring WWE wrestlers are a tough sell. It's understandable it's hard for anyone outside the wrestling scene to take a movie starring a wrestler seriously. But fan or no fan nothing stops you from checking out this movie. Personally I've seen all the WWE Films made so far See No Evil was a fairly good horror movieit also happen to star one of my personal favorite wrestlers Kane The Marine on the other hand could have so much better if the director wasn't so busy trying to figure out what story he wanted to tell in The Marine. The Condemned turns out to be the best of all the three movies so far. For those who don't know The Condemned is a story about 10 convicted felons who must fight to the death in a remote Pacific island and the last man standing walks away a millionaire by the production company who streams the event to all Internetpaying costumers making it a genuine bloodsportsnuff film bombs are attached to their ankles and are set to explode within 30 hours they also explode immediately if they are tampered withyeahit does sounds a little too much like The Running Man or the Japanese thriller Battle Royal.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film last night with my nephew and chose it simply because the title was interesting and it was playing at the local art house so I gave it a shot. As I am a bit disillusioned by the Oscars these days I don't pay much attention to them I was unaware that this film was a huge success in Japan and received a Best Foreign Film nomination. What I received in return for my curiosity was one of the best foreign films that I have seen in a long long time.The crux of the film is the relationship between personal honor and social honor. Iguchi is indeed a most honorable man. He truly loves his children and his senile mother and sacrifices his dignity and station to care for them. He works from dawn to dusk attending his duties with the court by day and working on his farm by night somehow finding time to also sell handmade insectbird cages just to help his family get by. He does all this even though it soon becomes apparent that he has no equal as a swordsman and in that right alone deserves the respect of those who deride him. We come to understand that selfless sacrifice is the single greatest act of honor especially when one can still consider himself a blessed man. However the personal honor that Iguchi wields even more skillfully than his sword becomes at odds with the social honor that his status as a samurai calls for. This conundrum is the heart of almost every scene in the film and reaches its peak as the story moves toward its climax. Though Iguchi tells his best friend that he would gladly surrender his status as a samurai to become a simple farmer he finds himself unable to resist his call to duty under the code of the samurai. He knows that to be honorable in his duty as a samurai he must compromise his honor as a man. How can he kill a man to fulfill the unjust motives of his clan especially when the man he is fighting is so much like himself?The direction of the film is beautifully impressionist. Yamada crafts pictures of everyday life which gives us an inherent understanding of the life of Iguchi. In one scene he sits dejectedly on his doorstep after coming home in the rain lamenting the holes in his socks while his squire stands outside in the downpour. In another he quietly applies his perfectionism to the construction of his cages in his dark and dirty living room while his family sleeps. In yet another he shares a meal with his family as they laugh and enjoy each other's company. Yamada's eye for imagery in combination with his patient and subtle storytelling are reminiscent of great impressionist directors such as Ozu Tarkovsky and Malick. There are many other memorable images in this film many of which depict the duality of nature. In one scene we see soldiers learning to fire rifles under the spring buds of a lotus tree. In another we see men fishing along a sapphire blue river with golden fields behind them and a stunning snowcapped Mount Fuji on the horizon and the bodies of starved peasant children floating down the river.This is a great film. See it.".

The structure and plot turns of the story are simple but fascinating to watch unfold and it is perhaps the simplicity and novelistic grace of the narrative that makes the film so remarkable. Seibei works as a scribe with his fellow samurai and always has to rush home after work to attend to his duties as a father. He lets hygieine slowly slide into second priority resulting in rather unkempt clothes and socks but in general he doesn't seem to care his two daughters he treasures above all other things. When a woman named Tomoe a childhood friend that Seibei was particularly fond of suddenly reappers into his life Seibei makes certain decisions that he ultimately ends up regretting later. The rest of the story is full of very interesting plot develoments playing with the audience's expectations especially with the relationship between Tomoe and Seiebi and although the film is not a traditional samurai film in that it does not have alot of action scenes the composition of the tale and its storytelling invocation one of the daughters narrates is good enough to keep you watching.Hiroyuki Sanada playing Seibei is really a marvel to watch he adds a very sensible depth and modesty to the character and infuses it with some understated comic acting as well. At the end of the film after the climatic final battle Sanada is able to make the character of Seibei resonate with a very unconventional but nonetheless strong and beautiful heroism. Sanada is really a very talented thespian and in this film you may get to sample the sheer range of his great technique. For the worldclass acting work he did in this film he won a Japanese Academy Award and the film also got noticed by the Oscars nominated for Best Foreign Language Film 2004. If there's a chance your able to catch this film in a local theatre usually it plays at Landmark do so you won't regret it. You'll be able to watch an excellent story unfold and also see some of the finest acting in world cinema today.".

Nominated for best foreign film the same year that the Hollywood film the last samurai got a few nominations it is impossible not to compare the two. While I enjoyed the Last Samurai and it's message of questioning western cultural imperialism Twilight Samurai is a film on whole different level.LS is a bloated Hollywood epic that delivers intense battles with huge numbers and a unrealistic unsatisfying bullshit love story. Do we really believe that the woman who lost her husband to Tom Cruise the smelly drunk white would fall in love with him?Twilight Samurai is the opposite in everyway and in everyway it is a better film that is bound to move to tears the hardest of yall out there. It is the story of a petty samurai who after the long lingering death of his wife finds himself become a devoted father.When Twilight comes and the other samurai go out to drink he rushes home to clean the house tend the field and care for his daughters. He has lost track of his imagine he smells and all he cares about is what is best for his daughters.When his childhood crush returns and revolution looms this petty samurai is forced into confronting his status as a samurai. Unlike last samurai the small battle between two samurai's at the end is more emotionally involved that any CGI enhanced battle could ever be.

	onyx:emotionText "Twilight SamuraiI don't have a top ten list of all time favorite films but if I did Twilight Samurai would be on it. Nominated for best foreign film the same year that the Hollywood film the last samurai got a few nominations it is impossible not to compare the two. While I enjoyed the Last Samurai and it's message of questioning western cultural imperialism Twilight Samurai is a film on whole different level.LS is a bloated Hollywood epic that delivers intense battles with huge numbers and a unrealistic unsatisfying bullshit love story. Do we really believe that the woman who lost her husband to Tom Cruise the smelly drunk white would fall in love with him?Twilight Samurai is the opposite in everyway and in everyway it is a better film that is bound to move to tears the hardest of yall out there. It is the story of a petty samurai who after the long lingering death of his wife finds himself become a devoted father.When Twilight comes and the other samurai go out to drink he rushes home to clean the house tend the field and care for his daughters. He has lost track of his imagine he smells and all he cares about is what is best for his daughters.When his childhood crush returns and revolution looms this petty samurai is forced into confronting his status as a samurai. Unlike last samurai the small battle between two samurai's at the end is more emotionally involved that any CGI enhanced battle could ever be. The romance in the film is so sweet tender and believable that is makes the film special.This could not be as special as it is without excellent acting direction and above all writing. Holy crap see this movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "I had been waiting a very long time for this movie to be released in my area so when the time came I was fairly excited. Often when I expect a lot out of a movie I am disappointed and end up hating something that may not deserve it. In this case however it lived up to and exceeded my expectations. The story line character development framing pacing and action were all absolutely topnotch in my opinion. The film stands as a stark contrast to many other movies set in the same time period in Japan and beyond that it also possesses a very universal appeal. It reminded me of other good dramas in its tone at times even a bit like the film In America and it had funny moments as well as heartwrenching sadness throughout. It was effective without being too melodramatic and did a wonderful job of enticing the viewer to empathize with the main character. From a martial arts standpoint I thought that the techniques used were very realistically applied and not at all outside of the realm of what samurai in this time period would have been doing. The fights were tense but very realistic. The last duel was stylized to a greater degree reminding me of certain moments in Kurosawa's films and by extension certain Kabuki influences. All in all it was a very strong film. It's deep enough that it could stand up to repeated viewing and in the way of subtititled films it would actually get better each time. Even if the story doesn't interest you it would be worthwhile to see it for the natural beauty of the location and the shots anyway. One of the finest films about feudal Japan that I have seen and one of the best films I've seen at all.".

Seibei raises alone his two daughters the five yearold Ito Erina Hashiguchi and the ten yearold Kayano Miki It and his senile mother Reiko Kusamura in a simple property and has a debt of 20 koku due to the expensive funeral of his wife who died of tuberculosis imposed by her family and can not afford to have another wife.

Seibei reencounters Tomoe for whom he has been in love since he was a child but Tamoe is member of a family of 400 koku and Seibei believes their difference of classes makes their marriage impossible. When Kouda challenges Iinuma to a duel Seibei accepts to replace his old friend and needs to use his skills of swordsman again.Tasogare Seibei is a masterpiece from the director and writer Yji Yamada who is unfortunately unknown for me. I am not sure whether other films of Yji Yamada have been released on VHS or DVD in Brazil. The humanistic story takes place in the period of the Feudal Japan and discloses a totally different samurai who has a heart full of love for his daughters and mother. I believe that persons like my daughter that has a deep knowledge on the rich and beautiful history of Japan will appreciate this gem much more than me since they are aware of the social system and code of honor of this period. Nevertheless I loved this film that exposes the end of an era using many metaphors and which is in the level of Akira Kurosawa or Yasujiro Ozu production. My vote is ten.Title Brazil O Samurai do Entardecer The Twilight Samurai".

	schema:reviewBody "Twilight Samurai Tasogare Seibei is a domestic drama and romance set in a very specific historical and cultural setting amidst civil strife recalling Cold Mountain.As in much of the crossfertilization of samurai movies and Westerns such that one can easily imagine a Westernized version the opening situation recalls Unforgiven where a retired gunfighter just wants to be left alone to farm and raise his children and tries to resist pressures to stop putting his fighting skills under a literal grubby basket.  Hiroyuki Sanada gives a superbly nuanced performance as a rebel against the expectations of being the lowest of a high class in a rigidly caste society by embracing the sarcastic titular sobriquet. He is painfully reluctant that he is ever so circuitously revealed to be much more.  World weary yet still proud he gropes for words to explain to his shocked patriarch why he as an indebted widower prefers to come home straight from work to see his daughters grow up day by day than follow the family's dictates and anguishes to his best friend about his marriage prospects.  Gradually surprising people around him are revealed to be as equally complex and frustrated with the roles their society insistently demands even as small step by suffocating step political and social webs inexorably ensnare them tighter and tighter. The flashes of their assertions of their individuality in unexpected moments make for quiet gripping moments of tension and relief.  As his returning childhood friend Rie Miyazawa has a beautiful spirited feminity that makes Sanada seem even more of a macho hunk in contrast.  A kind of Jane Austen action flick it is the kind of movie where antagonists' stares make you hold your breath in suspense and the touch of a hand brings forth your tears.  The translator made a policy decision of just transliterating many traditional Japanese terms from sensei to various styles of swordfighting etc. rather than try to find English equivalents.  While their meaning can be pretty much inferred from context it did help that post Kill Bill I've been making up for a benighted education that lacked samurai movies and Japanese history.  I found the voiceover narration by the younger daughter a bit schmaltzy and unnecessary.  The closing song seemed jarringly periodinappropriate if it wasn't a Japanese cover of Bob Dylan's To Make You Feel My Love then it was a real close imitation with the only clue in English that it was used with permission of EMI.  This is the first of novel adapterdirector Yoji Yamada's 77 films that I've seen and I certainly now want to see more.".

However what really impressed me was the way the main part played by Hiroyuki Sanada grew through the film. At the beginning of the film he seemed physically smaller his whole demeanour and features were weak and insignificant. Having never seen him act before I felt I was going to struggle to relate to this man as a lead role. It was incredible to see him partly through acting and partly through subtle directing grow into the figure we see at the end he's taller with wide shoulders and strong features yet remains a gentle and humble man.

The acting is likewise engaging with a minimum of staged swordplay with flashing blades. The focus of the story is on the characters' lives each of which reflects a personal tragedy yet not without some degree of hopefulness. The widowed father deemed the twilight samurai because of his marginal existence is a devoted family man who loves his daughters intensely and struggles to balance a heavy debt load and a meager income. Circumstances place him in a different light when his colleague vassals learn of his skills as a fighter which in turn permit him to revive a long held childhood love for a friends sister. Yet he feels unable to pursue it due to his dire economic circumstances much to everyone's dismay. His confrontation with his love interest's abusive husband enhances his mystique as a fighter winning him great respect from his colleagues but opens a glimpse of a possible encounter with one of the higher ranking vassals. With typical modesty he brushes aside the challenge by declaring himself an unworthy opponent.This chance encounter with this shadowy samurai comes to a head when he is ordered by his superiors to kill him for political reasons. His refusal is rejected and he is compelled to carry out the orders. As he make arrangements for his death and the care of his family he summons Tomoe to help him prepare only to find out that she has accepted another proposal. He swallows his disappointment and goes out to seal his fate one way or another.His confrontation with the rogue samurai is in a sense a battle with himself as both men reveal themselves to be victims of a cruel and often capricious system. The resolution in the long run is tragic but with a bittersweet irony as the daughter who recounts the narration reassesses her father's fate.As a tale it is classic Japanese as it deals with honor duty and saving face. For Westerners the frustration at not declaring emotions openly may seem daunting but when taken as a story unfolding at an explosive time in Japanese history it works and works well.An awesome film.

Downtoearth touches like one of the kids taking gran to the toilet or the corpses of starved peasants found in the river add to the sense of gritty realism. The language of the dialogue was also excellent  enough dialect and archaism to convey a sense of time and place without overdoing the archaism and without making the dialect too impenetrable.Also it was great to see Miyazawa Rie in action one of my alltime favourite Japanese actresses from the time I first saw her in TV dramas in the early 1990s. It's wonderful to look at how she has matured through the struggles she has had in her life.".

However in the case of Twilight Samurai we have a perfectlypaced film exploring the plight of a humanist samurai in the late Edo period. Sanada a favourite of mine ever since his portrayal of the flawed highschool teacher in the TV drama 'Koko Kyoshi' gives a careerbest performance as the impoverished retainer. One minute he has you laughing as he explains his contentment at being a single father to his uncomprehending uncle the next you are choking back tears in the marriage proposal scene. The lives of the characters are compelling enough but there is also the allegorical element of Japan itself about to undergo change from an isolated warrior nation to an international leader advocating pacifism. This is a film that works on every level and will not disappoint.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rarely can films make any influence on our lives and change our attitudes and opinions. We are bombarded with mainstream Hollywood production which consists mainly of sequels prequels and remakes of previous box office successes. It seems that world is full of superheroes who save the world at least twice a week. With some rare exceptions such as Terrence Mallick Thin Red Line Michael Mann Heat Paul Thomas Anderson Magnolia and Brian De Palma Carlito's Way there are no authors in recent US production who can scratch the surface and go really deep with exploration of human soul. However in other parts of the world films appear from time to time that possess such credibility that are able to shake our hearts and minds and force us to reassess our moral values and priorities in life. This is one of such films. What to say after seeing such a masterpiece. An ordinary viewer used to usual parade of attractions and special effects attacking all his senses but leaving his soul untouched is probably in a small shock after realizing at the beginning of this film that director Yoji Yamada neither will nor has any intention to indulge viewers with low taste and turn this melancholic and philosophic film into a superficial actionpacked soap opera. Instead of superhero warrior we can see Seibei Iguchi widower lowclass samurai with even lower income in a struggle to ensure existence to his two daughters and senile mother. And when his graceful female friend from childhood comes and viewers expect light at the end of a tunnel for Seibei he rejects her without explanation although he has strong feelings for her. Actually he thinks that with his low income he can not offer to her quality of life that she deserves. As film progresses to its end we realize that he is not a pathetic loser as he might look from the viewpoint of the Westerner but a real hero. Exposed to the twists of fate finding out that life is not a rose garden he embraces what destiny brings to him with fatalistic patience influence of Zen Buddhism is obvious knowing that there is only one thing that he can not afford to lose his honour. Led by starry sky above me and moral law within me Seibei Hiroyuki Sanada is a larger than life character not because he is supernaturally strong brave or perfect but because he is not and yet he sets for himself so high standards that few men would be able to achieve. He has his doubts and yet he does what a man has to do. We feel that such people with high moral standards although rare do exist among us even in these modern times when virtue seems to be just a burden and that fact gives us hope.Yamada's direction is subtle and brilliant as well as acting camerawork and music. Film is full of memorable scenes. Modesty patience honour for many of us have become just meaningless words unfortunately completely detached from real life. See this film if you want to find out about their real meaning.".

If you do you will not be disappointed.The filming is good and unobtrusive with no lack of creativity in choice of position lighting and movement. The sets are wonderful fully enmeshing the audience in the timeperiod without a thought. The fight scenes are few but the gravity and importance of each one makes them all the more enthralling. And coming from an old samurai movie buff and Aikido student I have to say the quality of the fights are topnotch. Of course you may encounter something that displeases you something that doesn't suit your tastes in this movie but the sheer quality of the production cannot be ignored. So again go see it.".

But there is so much more to this film. Yamada turns the classic tales of the samurai on their head But its more than just an inversion it separates itself from other antisamurai films like Sword of Doom or Sword of the Beast. The cinematography is bleak and brooding less like 21st century Japanese cinema and more in the style of Dogme 95 or even earlier Scandinavian filmmakers.

Cruelly nicknamed twilight because of his reluctance to join fellow workers at the local sak house he joins his family not to wallow in selfpity but to be the contented proud and lucky father that he knows himself to be. Directed and screenplayed from the late Shuuhei Fujisawa novel by the then seventyone year old Yji Yamada. His work here is of majestic beauty beauty as in the sense of selfworth and that nothing else matters except the heart and the home that it resides in. This suburb movie reflects the extreme hardships of the single parent and the repercussions that it can deliver such as the loneliness of bringing up a family in 19th Century Japan. Trying also ones best to retain ones own pride and selfrespect with the constant struggle with the malicious Leaders and seemingly prejudiced villagers that one has to cohabit along side. Yji Yamada here has made the connection between the life of the lonely family man and the human need to reach out and feel for the necessity for companionship once more. Done with a wondrously timeless and seamless feel a pace that has you also connecting with poor Seibei and his family we are invited into his home to join them to have a clear and concise insight of a very muchloved husband son and father and his unfortunate predicament.

It really is no surprise for The Twilight Samurai is a beauty to behold with the green rolling landscapes to the majestic and proud snow tipped mountains and hills this is a land of vast magnificence beauty and vigour with its panoramic backdrops to the perspective views of deep focus this cinematography is both extremely rewarding and colourful. To perpetuate this image of both natural grandeur and story telling through its directorship is a partnership that has delivered one of the most stunningly picturesque and sentimental accounts of early Japanese cultural society. Along side Mutsuo Naganuma's splendid work The Twilight Samurai has also had to accept numerous other rewards besides from Awards of the Japanese Academy such as Best Actor Actress Direction Editing Film Music Score and Screenplay Sound Supporting Actor then Best New Comer of the Year for Min Tanaka. Nominated too for Best Foreign Language Film Japan at the 2004 Academy Awards. The Awards do not stop here for The Twilight Samurai has a universal appeal winning the hearts and minds of counties such as Germany Hong Kong Hawaii Italy Spain and the USA and with several Japanese trophies well and truly giving The Twilight Samurai the respect it deserves. The Twilight Samurai is a marvellous story of love lost and love needed and love found the story telling of a great man who has nothing who lives the simple life but has the love of his daughters mother and his childhood friend Tomoe.

As a result he has been placed within his clan's stores and accounts department working long days with little time outside to care for himself. As the pressures mount just to get by Iguchi focuses on his tasks and neglects his skills. The light presence of childhood friend Iinuma Tomoe at his home one day starts a relationship with her that he dares to hope could be more however once it is apparent that it could be he feels unworthy and withdraws from her.Those expecting a blazing sword thriller will very quickly catch on that we join our samurai in essentially a dead end accounting job where he slaves to make enough to keep his family going and that honourable deaths and such are far from his mind. Likewise with the film although there are two fights in it the focus of this film is the man Iguchi. Using a flashback narration from his daughter we see him at the loss of his wife and onwards. It is rarely exciting but the script is delivered well with a suitably restrained air that engaged me without ever gripping me. However for what it is it works well and I enjoyed the look at a man staying in his place perhaps hurt by things in his life but most likely just unwilling to aspire beyond where he believes he is. If it sounds dull then it might be because it isn't the fastest film I've ever seen but the gradual character story is worth staying with.A big part of this is a solid performance from Sanada in the lead role. He understands the character well and does well to portray a man restrained in his place but not to bring out a modern sense of bitterness that some performers may not have been able to do. He exists in the past but has enough about him to still engage me as a modern viewer. Miyazawa is equally as good with a lively performance by the films standards that does inject light into the home as her character is supposed to. She deals just as well with the flip side of her character as well. Yamada's direction is good and he benefits from a wealth of talent working alongside him. The sets and costumes easily capture a sense of place and period while the cinematography gives the whole film an inky effect that although it is dark it tends to be a rich darkness rather than a murky one.Overall this is a slow but engaging film that succeeds because of a good character in Iguchi and a strong performance from Sanada. It looks great and moves slowly forward with several themes coming together to form a solid central story. It will require patience and those seeking action should just not bother with it but it is quietly rewarding if you know what you are getting into.".

Incredibly engaging performances by the modest lead Hiroyake Sanada his in the film lifelong friend and romantic interest Rie Miyazawa his children and the supporting cast. This movie defied all the stereotypes of samurai films portraying the gritty day to day details of staying alive during the tumultuous years composing the decline of Japanese feudalism while explaining the overriding cultural tradition of filial piety and duty engendered by their class ridden society.Only two sword fights made all the more powerful by their realism and restraint. As a former student of martial arts my adrenaline was really flowing during the scene where H. Sanada warms up in preparation for his first sword fight in many years. That scene's verisimilitude was quite genuine and powerful in it's depiction of his sudden reversion from being a struggling farmer to the samurai he'd previously been.I could go on at length but the previous comments by others quite succinctly captured the essence of the film.However I feel compelled to address the spirited portrayal by R. Miyazawa of a prefeminist woman. Her independence and bravery in repeatedly breaking free of societal strictures was a good foil for H. Sanada's similar behavior. This making all the more poignant their ultimate submission to forces beyond their control.By the film's end which thankfully defied my expectations I was weeping due to my overidentification with the protagonists. The only discordant note of the whole film was the horrid kareoke song played over the final credits.I'll admit that I'm prone to perhaps be overly taken in by truly three dimensional characters who experience the expected joy and tribulations of life... All I can say is Tom Cruise go suck an egg.".

Both of these films deal with the same issues the end of the Samurai era and the influx of gunpowder into the Japanese feudal system. But unlike The Last Samurai Yamada's film has a much more human side and a more affecting story enough to make the period backdrop seem insignificant.Hiroyuki Sanada maybe more famous for his role in Ring is brilliant here as Seibei a lowly Samurai regularly humiliated by his peers more concerned about looking after his two daughters and senile mother than working for the system he serves. He struggles with his own feelings for the woman he loves and if it would be socially right for him to marry her as they both wish. Ultimately Seibei's dedication to his own emotions and his status as a Samurai has tragic consequences.Everything about this film is first rate and it has little to no flaws. The photography and direction are amazing every shot is perfectly taken and the scenery and set pieces are beautiful to behold and it all works flawlessly with the restrained score. But unlike The Last Samurai the human and emotional side of the story isn't sacrificed for the technical aspects. Those expecting massive Samurai battles will be severely disappointed however this paints a more informative picture of the Samurai way of life than Tom Cruise waving a Katana.Overall this is essential viewing for any Samurai fan and will appeal to any fan of Kurosawa or Okamoto surpassing even some of the work of these masters in terms of human drama. It's also a Samurai film you can safely show to your mother.".

But this film has several parallel plots as more of today's novels should which I won't describe. I don't wish to spoil anyone's fun by overdivulging. My DVD version came with a choice of English and French subtitles. Of course for the Polish scenes Spanish ones are automatic. It is not necessary to know Spanish to love this film but try to appreciate the tone and style of the Martians' speech. This film is a delight! Wonderful! It's rated I believe suitable for all audiences  at least all Spanish audiences. There is sexual humor however and some death black humor  indeed there's about every sort of noncrude humor ever devised. Still I would hesitate to show it to young children.".

The question is is your local cinema a place for such a film?The thing is I came I saw it I laughed a lot and I left.  It was a good way to pass a couple of hours.  After all isnt that what cinemas about entertainment?  And P.Tinto certainly entertained.  It is a witty observational view of the world if a little warped.  The cinematography is excellent and it takes pains to replicate the atmosphere created by other classic films the opening sequence set in the psychiatric hospital is a good example as is the parody of E.T..So come on Spain  stop worrying about the intellectual impact of the movie and see El Milagro de P.Tinto for what it really is a bloody good laugh.".

Surreal things are everywhere for example one of the dwarf Martians gets converted to Catholicism and becomes a priest !There are no 'bad guys' and 'good guys' basically everything is so twisted that such tags will make no sense at all. There are more than one spots where one thinks that the movie is ending... but not!BTW don't miss the soundtrack!rating 1010";

	schema:reviewBody "Funny flick plenty of offbeat characters  haunting moodpieces  slapdash fun scenes  Kafkian situations and sense of style . Entertaining picture fundamental for lovers of absurd humor and it has a high budget for its spectacular digital special effects . It deals with Wafer factoryowner P. Tinto Luis Ciges and his spouse blind Olivia Silvia Casanova  both of whom really wish a son of their own more than anything else in the world . Years of trying  however  have left them with nothing but a couple of strange extraterrestrial midgets Javier Aller  Emilio Gavira living in the spare bedroom . A series of disconcerting events result in an escaped adult mental patient who fled from an asylum ruled by a nasty director Pepe Viyuela  he is called Joselito Pablo Pinedo and suddenly arriving at their door . P. Tinto and Olivia accept this without question and welcome him in as their wanted child .This entertaining film packs amusement  slapstick  thrills  comic situations  tongueincheek  surrealist comedy including conventional pitfalls and many other things . Sitting in a strange middle ground between the completely absurd and the stylishly cool . This is a fast crazy movie with lot of fun situations  antics  bemusement and with a bunch of very hilarious roles . Sensitive film full of good feeling  offbeat characters  haunting moodpieces  diverting scenes and sense of style but not totally satisfactory  including some flaws . Wonderful protagonist couple  Luis CigesSilvia Casanova  an enjoyable marriage who become involved into problems when they decide to try adoption then take place a series of misroutings and rare encounters . It turns out to be pleasantly fun that offers no intellectual stimulus whatsoever  an exercise in pure amusement in which entertainment and fun are guaranteed . The amusing characters are quite odd  grotesque and weird and the film races on at incredible speed . It is a light  wistful comedy  easy to watch  and easier to love . It is as beautifully filmed as it is written and acted . The actors faithfully represent their characters and not to leave out of place the viewer at any time . Exaggerated accidents in a nonsensical world created by the writersdirector  JavierGuillermo Fesser brothers  embarrassing situations  miracles  shaking  falls and other highlight sequences  all of them through some breathtaking special effects . In addition  a spotless pictorial cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe and a willingness  almost perfect of the elements of each shot  every sequence  every space  being filmed in La Revilla Burgos Castilla y Len . Aguirresarobe subsequently would make a prestigious career in Hollywood such as Fright night  The twilight saga eclipse The road  The others and many others . And an evocative musical score by Suso Saiz  adding songs of the 50s and 60s  including Eurovision Festival. Suso had composed nice soundtracks for films as Juego De Luna Africa and Detectiva y Muerte. The picture achieved some prizes and nominations  as it won Goya Best Special Effects  Flix Bergs  Nominated Goya Best New Director  in Locarno International Film Festival 1999 Won Special Mention Javier Fesser for the movie's style humor and originality  in Pescola Comedy Film Festival Won Best Cinematography  Javier Aguirresarobe and Won Best Director and Sant Jordi Awards 1999 Won Sant Jordi Best First Work  Javier Fesser . The film was well produced by Jose Luis Garci and Enrique Lopez Lavigne  a great producer who has financed national and international hits as 28 weeks later The intruder Lucia y el Sexo and Lo Impossible. The motion picture was compellingly directed by Javier Fesser  as he shows us a surrealist and absurd humor applied to the characters  however he overdoes the same premise  P. Tinto's ingenuousness . WriterActorDirector Javier Fesser was born in 1964 in Madrid . Javier is a writer and actor and along his brother Guillermo Fesser forms the Radio comical group Gomaespuma  both of them have written and directed some amusing films  such as  The great adventure of Mortadelo y Filemn 2003  Cndida 2006 and the best movie  The miracle of P.

One of the problems is that ''dad'' never told ''son'' about the flowers and the bees and when ''son'' heard it through the grapevines he got everything wrong. The couple move to a lonely place where the train passes every 25 years. Pray to God for a miracle and one day they get it. Two cute little martians arrive at their door and they take them as their own. Now they're happy but could be happier so they write to the African Embassy in order to adopt a little orphan from over there. I need to stop here.

Once Sergio and Gerardo are a couple Jonas begins to long for Gerardo again and in the final scene they've gotten back together.Broken Sky is more like a poem or an opera  or most of all a dance  than a conventional film. It's a different experience. The mainstream audience would never put up with all this gay sex without dialogue or plot. Not every gay man will have the patience to watch these amorous comings and goings for the full 140 minutes either. I'm not sure that the poetic voiceovers were necessary and a third of them are lost to non Spanishspeakers because the whiteonwhite subtitles are illegible. They are a bit too poetic and general. The boys are too specific to be so generalized by the language. Needless to say the real world is beyond the range of Broken Sky. But there's no denying that Broken Sky in its own way is unique and beautiful. The director achieves what he was clumsily groping for in his first one. He is using cinematic language in a way that it rarely is any more  he achieves the instinctive identification and emotional directness of the silent film. Broken Sky makes you think about the unspoken element in any relationship the things that can never be communicated in words in short the world of eroticism and feelings. Hernndez contributes to the effectiveness of his visual poem through excellent use of various musical accompaniments a few notes on a clavicord a string quartet  above all a sweet pop love song  the lyrics of each lovingly translated in subtitles. It's as if Gerardo and Jonas were trying to live a pop song. And I guess that's what moony young gay guys do a lot of the time. There's even a coloratura operatic aria considering the operatic tone of things the filmmakers exercise great forbearance in using only one. Maybe this is a new cinematic language as was said of Antonioni's L'Avventura. For a while one can savor it admire the naive sweetness of it. But can anyone read it? And can it say more than one thing?".

	schema:reviewBody "I guess it's not surprising that this film received mixed reviews. I knew when I saw it that it would not be for everyone. I have to say though that I really loved this film and would gladly see it again particularly to share it with someone I care for. I think you have to just sit back relax and let this film wash over you. The best way for me to describe it is as a beautiful poem about love particularly young love. It conveys all the thrill and excitement the confusion and pain the jealousy and longing...really all the emotions one experiences from first love. Rather than words however this poem is composed of pictures and music and ambient sound. Like a poem it isn't always straightforward you don't always understand every moment but the feelings that it evokes are strong and genuine and it captures universals in a way that a more specific narrative film never could. The director has said that the reason there is so little dialogue is that the moments he chose to capture were the ones between the dialogue before the characters felt the need to speak and after they had said all there was to say. What's amazing is how illuminating those moments are when one chooses to pay attention to them.In the context of this film I'm not sure what the phrase gratuitous male nudity means. Although I know it never happens in the U.S. in other countries people get naked. It's part of life. It's certainly part of the relationship that this film is all about and to show it unceremoniously as part of the fabric of a life and a relationship can hardly be described as gratuitous.I guess the best compliment I can pay this film is to say that I am still thinking and talking about it weeks after seeing it. The camera work the composition the use of sound and music and the contribution of the young stars all contribute to the film's success. If you enjoy filmmaking as an art form I'd highly recommend you seek out this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "'El Cielo dividido' BROKEN SKY is a daring experimental film from Mexican writerdirector Julin Hernndez and as such it is bound to polarize audiences. Some will fault the film for selfindulgence while others will praise the bravery of a film of this topic to come from a country not exactly known for its flexible social attitudes.Julin Hernndez focuses on the history of a first love and without using dialogue he tells his story simply with silent actors minimal narrative comments which serve as program notes music and ravishingly beautiful photographic composition. Gerardo Miguel ngel Hoppe opens the film a solo youth wandering what appears to be the streets of Mexico City finally ending up in an open amphitheater where his eye glimpses another lone youth Jonas Fernando Arroyo sitting staring into space. Gerardo wanders over to him sits beside him gains the courage to touch his shoulder Jonas responds glowingly  and love begins. Through the next scenes we find the couple making love both in bed and in unexpected public places including the stacks of the library of the school where they both are students and where another pair of eyes enters Sergio Alejandro Rojo watches longingly as Gerardo and Jonas kiss and display an aura of passion Sergio obviously longs for.The new couple share many experiences all bathed in love until they eventually go to a disco Jonas dances with an enchanted Bruno Ignacio Pereda and a trace of chemistry is generated a fact that Gerardo watching the boys dance senses and is disturbed. A crack is created in their bliss and that crack only widens as they each have mixed responses to what they perceive is escaping. Gerardo encounters the winsome Sergio and the two bond physically a fact that forces Jason to reevaluate his initial feelings for Gerardo.All of this story is told without dialogue of words but with a very strong dialogue of eyes. Director Hernndez seems to want to share how love is an internalized emotion only demonstrated with physical intimacy but fragile as a newborn in its vulnerability to wounds. Cinematographer Alejandro Cant finds stunning settings and lighting and sensitive explorations of love making that never exceed tasteful states. His manner of showing time elapsing is to pan walls within a room that serve as flashbacks and flashforwards as a means of carrying the story forward. Film editor Emiliano Arenales Osorio uses some very creative techniques to keep the viewer guessing as to whether we are observing fact fantasy present or past. And the musical score by Arturo Villela deftly maintains the minimalist stance with simple phrases by cello harpsichord and violin saving the passion expression for the use of Dvork in Rusalka's 'Song to the Moon' as ravishingly sung by Rene Fleming All of those praises being said the major reason this film doesn't retain an audience base is its length it is 140 minutes long repetitive and would have been much more powerful had it been cut to 90 minutes at best. It is far too visually stunning a piece of work to step beyond the patience of an audience happy to see the birth and blossoming and challenges of a first love between two beautiful young men. The actors are indeed a pleasure to watch but in this case less is more. One wonders what Julin Hernndez will create next. He deserves applause for this experimental film but hopefully will learn from its tendency toward selfindulgence. Grady Harp".

You don't understand the reason for the tedium until well into the picture and by then it's too late. The first 40 minutes of film is something of a slow piece of Mexican soft porn and unimaginative soft porn at that. Later in the film the style of the first 40 minutes starts to makes sense but it's too late because by then the audience is lost. There is some nice location shooting at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. I've often wondered why more films aren't shot there. The campus is built on the edge of lava fields that lend the campus a very otherworldly feel. My biggest problem with the film is that the directorwriter has made the film the way he wanted to see it without regard for how a viewer who doesn't know the story will view it.

The director seems to understand the dilemma surrounding gay relationships but fails in the use of an expressive formal language to communicate the narrative elements. Movements and gestures were the basic conductors in this story but in order to keep intensity of emotions within the public actors seem to have troubles while expressing them due to whether a bad direction or lack of experience. At some point the film appeared to me as a choreography set up for stage and to be performed by dancers. It lasts more than 2 hours which I consider very long and exhausting for people to keep attention on it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a work of art on several levels. But art is intended to stir some emotion and it should be fairly obvious that what stirs one person's emotions will often leave another person searching for the exits. I'm pretty sure that in order to be stirred by this movie the minimum requirements would be that you are gay and that you have an attention span longer than that usually available to the proverbial gnat ... the latter requisite might prove an insurmountable hurdle for many younger viewers who tend to prefer reality shows MTV and mirrors.I know I would be unable to sit through over two hours of nothing but a small number of women interacting intimately no matter how beautiful they might be or how passionate. I very much doubt most heterosexual men and maybe a majority of women would be able to genuinely enjoy this film. That doesn't reflect negatively on the artistic merit of the film or the intellect of those reduced to fidgeting in their seats. I don't know much about art but I know what I like at least the second part is not always the signature line for cretins. No one should tell us what art we must like or that what we enjoy isn't really art.While I lack the technical vocabulary to gush very meaningfully about the photography I considered the use of varied backgrounds light  shadow focus color and movement in this film to be amazing. Either the time  effort that went into the photography were monumental or the director and photographers are extraordinarily talented ... probably both.But the acting was the real art. Over two hours with virtually no dialogue sounds like a recipe for disaster but quite quickly you realize that words would just get in the way and dilute the emotional impact. Every movement every bit of body language and every facial expression spoke far more eloquently than words would ever manage. At times I was reminded of a ballet where music and movement not spoken words can express emotions so elegantly.And at one point I definitely thought of opera not least because Renee Fleming was singing an aria from Dvorak to accompany a beautifully photographed scene that might have gone well in Carmen or even Madama Butterfly.I've seen a lot of gaythemed films that had no shortage of pretty much standard Hollywood onesizefitsall emotion passion sex and intimacy copied from the hetero romantic mold and played out as you would expect ... heavily reliant on dialogue and histrionics... but in this movie every nuanced hesitation misgiving conflict indecision fear selfdoubt and most importantly the driving force of love faultlessly and consistently performed by these actors registered in my gut. Their chemistry amongst themselves and with the viewer was amazing.For some people this movie will evoke goose bumps tears and smiles. For others not so much but then the same thing can be said about most works of art.My first viewing was on my computer monitor but I've ordered the DVD so I can see this several more times on a somewhat larger platform ... although I suspect it might lose some of the intimacy and passion if shown on a much larger theater screen.".

I was deeply moved with such a wellthought portrait of loneliness and its rhythm has been smartly solved excellent production and music and you can tell someone with experience has set up this piece. Once Julian Hernandez decides to skip the obvious superficial dialogs the plot is nurtured by long periods of silence which reveal a given need for them even by conveying that the characters are split apart as well as when they communicate with each other through their inner monologues. Broken Sky solves itself out though it leaves an interesting watermark by not yielding to stereotypes and for instance by demystifying the Mexican gay ghetto. This opens a magical ground for the given and missed encounters when as a viewer one can dress up the character's egos and hearts placing from one's mind the thoughts and insights for them to fill up such apparently void mute spaces. Then you are taken by the hand of the splendid traveling and panning shots to the very edge of existential cliffs theirs yours ours for that sake. Broken Sky feels like a sequel to A Thousand Clouds... and leaves me yearning for more. I need this mirror again. For a moment I felt taken into Skolimowsky's Deep End judging from the Alejandro Cantu's palette or even sequences that seem like a tribute to Fassbinder. Therefore I cannot dare to stick Broken Sky in a regular category. It's been a while already since Dona Herlinda and Her Son double standard or the first homosexual kiss in A Place Without Limits. This is not a gay movie per se. This is an honest effort here.".

It is a different film in many ways so it is refreshing but its slow pace and long sequences of quiet may put some viewers to sleep.That aside this film takes those stereotyped notions of gay sex being raw primal rough and unemotional and tosses them out the window. This is one of perhaps 4 films containing gay sex that is certainly graphic but also very erotic. For me erotic is sexually explicit AND emotional. Sex without emotion is not erotic.For what the film lacks in dialogue it makes up for in nonverbal communication between the 2 main characters and the third character in the lovetriangle. The endless pleas for touch embrace and kiss are very powerful and the pain and confusion and longing when a lover is rejected by the other who has suddenly lost interest are very communicative to the viewer who has been sucked into the story.It won't appeal to everyone but it is different and refreshing.".

What you are left with is an opportunity to appreciate the depth of malemale feeling while simultaneously being held powerless to use dialog to relate that private intimate meaning to public life.I was so scared when Sergio kissed Gerardo at school but then I realized the film had removed the possibility of fear and had done so without giving any explanation or opportunity to understand. My fear had been obviated and I received a kind of emotional shock a positive shock to be sure but still a shock.I think the key to this film is to allow it to push you past your limits.

	schema:reviewBody "The unique film Broken Sky is an invitation to a different world a quiet and dreamlike place where only love seems to hold any importance. The characters Gerardo and Jonas inhabit this private world and no one else matters. Filmed in beautiful gold and brown shades the two Mexican boys fall in love at first sight. The two are so in sync with each other that they barely need words to communicate their feelings. It seems things could not be more ideal for these two guys until outside influences and doubt threaten to destroy their perfect untainted love. El Cielo Dividido is not really a mainstream film there is virtually no dialog and the production moves along like a slow hypnotic dance rather than the typical fast pace of todays cinema. There has rarely been a film that so effectively creates it's own world and it is a world filled with beauty and romance and sadness a world that i personally was reluctant to leave at the film's end. Actors Miguel Angel Hoppe and Fernando Arroyo are both beautiful and utterly believable as the confused lovers overwhelmed by intense feelings that are so new to them. Unique especially for gay cinema is this film's subtlety. The nudity and sexuality is not aggressively splashed across the screen to shock or titillate the viewer. It is simply there and it is all a part of this private world of the two lovers. Best of all Broken sky manages to recreate the feelings of first time love and sexual awakening like few films have managed. This is far from the typically flashy and garishly silly style of most gay films. Thankfully there are no gay stereotypes to be found here this is a film about love and nothing more. Broken Sky is a unique and beautiful film.".

Other than that I really liked the film so I'm hoping perhaps someone associated with the production reads this and maybe incorporates some sensibilities into the placement of text and font colorsand type faces used in future productions with the intention of promoting communication  which is what movies should be about anyway.

	schema:headline " Ultra rare Mario Anime";
	schema:reviewBody "Super Mario Bros The Great Mission to Save Princess Peach is a childrenoriented anime film made in 1986. It was directed by Masami Hata who also made stuff like Ringing Bell and The Legend of Sirius.However this film is pretty hard to find. It was only released in Japan at the time it was made. It has not been released in the US at once making this anime ultrarare.Short about the beginning The film begins with Mario playing some video game until the beautiful Princess Peach suddenly pops out of the TV only to be kidnapped by Bowser in front of Mario's eyes. So it's later up to the Mario brothers to save her.The film stays very true to the Mushroom Kingdom Princess Peach's famous homeplace as well as the iconic savetheprincessplot. The popular enemies like Goombas Kuribo and Lakitu Jugem are also portrayed well. The only things which bugged me a little bit is the fact Luigi is wearing yellow not green as he usually does. The characters generally are much better drawn than they were in the US cartoon version made by DIC. And Princess Peach is just so CUTE in this film compared to how she was in the later cartoon series as Princess Toadstool. These are the reasons for me saying this anime being a lot better than the US cartoon series The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! made by DIC three years later.It was also interesting to know that Mami Yamase who voiced as Princess Peach also sung the touching closing song I Love You.As I said first in this review this film is pretty hard to find as it was only released in Japan in 1986. Even in its homeland Japan this anime is a hard find. If you ever get to find this film then you are lucky. ".

	onyx:emotionText "Super Mario Bros The Great Mission to Save Princess Peach is a childrenoriented anime film made in 1986. It was directed by Masami Hata who also made stuff like Ringing Bell and The Legend of Sirius.However this film is pretty hard to find. It was only released in Japan at the time it was made. It has not been released in the US at once making this anime ultrarare.Short about the beginning The film begins with Mario playing some video game until the beautiful Princess Peach suddenly pops out of the TV only to be kidnapped by Bowser in front of Mario's eyes. So it's later up to the Mario brothers to save her.The film stays very true to the Mushroom Kingdom Princess Peach's famous homeplace as well as the iconic savetheprincessplot. The popular enemies like Goombas Kuribo and Lakitu Jugem are also portrayed well. The only things which bugged me a little bit is the fact Luigi is wearing yellow not green as he usually does. The characters generally are much better drawn than they were in the US cartoon version made by DIC. And Princess Peach is just so CUTE in this film compared to how she was in the later cartoon series as Princess Toadstool. These are the reasons for me saying this anime being a lot better than the US cartoon series The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! made by DIC three years later.It was also interesting to know that Mami Yamase who voiced as Princess Peach also sung the touching closing song I Love You.As I said first in this review this film is pretty hard to find as it was only released in Japan in 1986.

	schema:reviewBody "The very first Japanimation of the Super Mario Bros. hits the big screen!!! This short 60minute movie was released to theaters on July 20 1986 in Japan. The title translated as Super Mario Bros The Great Mission to Rescue Princess Peach pretty much outlines the plot. This film was never released outside of Japan and therefore has no English translation or subtitles. It is by now outofprint and extremely difficult to find. In the opening segment Mario and Luigi Luigi's color scheme is different the first and only time this is shown are employees at a grocery. Mario is seen holding an emerald necklace which we are lead to believe belongs to Princess Peach. The Princess' name in Japan was always Peach later changed to Toadstool while the games were being marketed in the U.S. While he and Luigi discuss the value of this gem some weird little creature walks in and steals the necklace. Mario and Luigi are seen giving chase until getting sucked into a Warp Zone. Once they arrive in the Time Warp they encounter the Mushroom Hermit who tells them that Princess Peach has been captured by King Bowser Koopa. The rest of the movie shows the Bros. on their journey to save the Princess. One of the highlights is when Mario is asleep and Luigi looks for food before being tricked by two goombas into eating wild mushrooms. These of course turn out to be poisonous mushrooms causing Luigi to become hysterical. Another incident is where Mario is asleep again and dreams about Princess Peach and him dancing together.The music that plays in the background is simply called I Love You the remaining lyrics sung in Japanese by Princess Peach voiced by Mami Yamase. All in all the movie is quite tastefully done. It is full of laughs as well as romance. The scenes of Mario and the Princess together are very touching. I have only seen a few clips of this movie on a website. I highly recommend it to be viewed by all Mario fans. This is a truly revolutionary piece of Mario history!!!!".

But for only 60 minutes long there's so much more they could include in this movie.Sadly this is the only existing Mario Bros. anime. And I think it wouldn't hurt to make another one that's done with newer animation. I mean if Pokemon can have a successful anime. Why not the Mario Bros there's so much value that can make a highly interesting based off of a video game anime.I didn't see this movie till most recently. And it's never been released outside of Japan at all. An English dub is out of the question as very few anime distribution companies would never dub anything this old and out of date animation.The only way it would ever be released is to get it on a subonly DVD and get permission by Nintendo in doing so.".

In its seedier side to paraphrase from another movie weed is the currency openly passed around in nacho chip bags. This movie ditches the idyllic moments to peer beneath the veneer of hell on Earth instead.I like movies which have many characters each with their own objectives but being led by unseen forces as they relate to one another and events bring them to within striking distance. They might belong to distinct story arcs but given the geographical proximity their lives their decisions and the consequences all become intertwined.There are three clear arcs in the movie but the characters involved flit seamlessly from one arc to the next. You have the corrupt businessmen looking to escape the law at Miami an affair a daughter who hooks up with drugs and the wrong company a sly thief of sorts two star crossed lovers a hot headed brother good friends and gangsters. On its own they could be short stories. But when narrative style takes on the fragmented non linear approach to spice and disguise an ordinary story that's what you get in Frank E. Flowers' Haven.Perhaps what will put bums in seats is the presence of Orlando Bloom though the M18 rating would have restricted his girly groupie fans here from seeing their cinematic idol on screen in a role which is similar to what Tom Cruise did in Vanilla Sky sort of. He plays the role of the Romeo in the starcrossed lovers arc as Shy son of a fisherman still figuring out the meaning to his life and having a lack of ambition which worries his girlfriend Andrea Zoe Saldana. Parental disapproval gets into play and the rest is a spiral downwards for both lovers and their relationship. Some say Bloom's role is intense but there isn't enough room for his character to justify that.And sadly that was just about the better story amongst the three. In reality all three could have been extremely short as the scenes though intercut with each other and had some overlapping moments don't really contribute much to the characters or stories. You could have cut off half the fat and still the story would hold water. One saving grace would be the score and soundtrack though accentuating the illusion of paradise.But this is not to say Haven's a really bad movie. It just had enough story elements to cruise along in autopilot and in the process offer nothing groundbreaking stylistically or earth shattering in having any twists and turns to the plot. Breaking up and juxtaposing a linear plot does not disguise the fact that it inherently needs a lot more oomph.".

The movie threads together multiple story lines and shifts back and forth through time. Bill Paxton has a great performance as a shady business man who escapes with this daughter to the Cayman Islands. Orlando Bloom's character is the most endearing. I found I could relate to his character the most. Shy Bloom was the classic boy from the wrong side of the tracks who is completely in love with the rich girl Andrea Zoe Saldana. Zoe Saldana has a great performance as well. Her character goes from a sweet girl who makes a complete 180 turn to a druggie how to put this politically correct very easy girl.Overall I really enjoyed the movie. Frank E. Flowers did a really great job with his debut. The story was really intriguing and the setting was beautiful. A really well done film.".

Bill Paxton has a great performance as a shady business man who escapes with this daughter to the Cayman Islands. Orlando Bloom's character is the most endearing. I found I could relate to his character the most. Shy Bloom was the classic boy from the wrong side of the tracks who is completely in love with the rich girl Andrea Zoe Saldana. Zoe Saldana has a great performance as well. Her character goes from a sweet girl who makes a complete 180 turn to a druggie how to put this politically correct very easy girl.Overall I really enjoyed the movie. Frank E. Flowers did a really great job with his debut. The story was really intriguing and the setting was beautiful. A really well done film.";

Every actor involved in Haven was perfectly chosen and held their own with spectacular performances.

I did think that the film was a bit choppy which was mildly distracting but that the overall ride was great. In following up his critically acclaimed short 'Swallow' with 'Haven' his feature film debut Frankie Flowers proves that he is more than capable of writing and directing a full length film.While it is a difficult task to jump back and forth in a timeline from sub plot to sub plot while keeping an audience interested entertained and able to follow I believe that Flowers has done a splendid job despite sacrificing some of the continuity for stylistic shot making. Tarantino has tried despite box office success somewhat in vain in this regard for years. Movies such as Magnolia have come along and disappointed and perhaps the only film in recent years to truly excel in this style was Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's '21 grams'.With strong performances from an ensemble cast of well known Hollywood stars and unknown local talent 'Haven' is well acted from start to finish. Orlando Bloom leads the way with an excellent performance as the going nowhere fast 'shy' and proves that he can portray a modern day man between timepiece and fantasy blockbusters. Dare I say he would be better off from an acting portfolio sense taking on more of these roles.I highly recommend 'Haven' especially in this age of over the top special effects no plot movies. I hope that Flowers continues to be given opportunities to hone his craft and I look forward to his next piece.".

	schema:reviewBody "First let me explain my ratingsystem. I consider a 5 a movie that's somewhat watchable a 6 is already a good movie. I gave Haven a 3 because the soundtrack was good and the acting wasn't horrible. Now over to the bad stuff...I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. Usually in my reviews I try to say something like 'this movie isn't recommended for people who don't like slowdeveloping plots' or 'it's not for people who want the plot wrapped up neatly in the end'. But I can honestly and objectively say this movie was just one of poor quality. The biggest problem is the plot itself. The storyline is multilinear characters are being followed and they're all supposed to be connected in one way or another through an event or multiple events. Examples of brilliant use of this method is seen in Amores Perros 21 Grams Crash and Magnolia. In these films the story lines have similar prominent themes and the characters are all connected physically. Every character adds more elements to the story until we have a complex web of story lines constantly crossing paths and having effects on one another. I know this sounds confusing but watch Amores Perros and Crash and you'll know exactly what I mean. Haven makes one fruitless attempt after another to be clever until all we end up with is an unsorted mess of scenes thrown together in a wannabe movie. That's the best way to describe Haven it wants to be a lot of things but ends up being rubbish.The thing that irritated me even more then the gimmick mentioned above was the chronologically scattered framework that was used. I feel like they realized the plot and characters of their attempted intelligent film were overly simple and they tried to jazz it up with a chronologically scattered framework to fool people into thinking they're watching something clever. I heard the story was chronological at the premiere of the Toronto film festival and then they reedited the whole film to create the flashbacks. That's not the way to write a story with a scrambled up chronology. You have to actually write the script like that with chronology switching from the start of your story or the storyline will be a mess. The storyline has to flow naturally even if you use chronology like that. A prime example a brilliantly written script that uses the same technique is Memento. The technique used actually adds something to the suspense of the story.Nope don't waste your time on this. I usually only write IMDb reviews for films I like but this film was just too dreadful for words I felt it was my duty to stop another human being from seeing it. I don't see why anyone should see this movie. It's certainly not to be entertained and I hardly think anyone would be enlightened after seeing a film like this.310 and I'm being generous.".

	schema:headline " Writing Directing Acting all Shine in Haven";
	schema:reviewBody "I attended a press screening of Haven on August 24 2006. Here is my review Producer Robbie Brenner after reading the script for Haven told Frank E. Flowers writer and director I'll quit my job if you let me produce this movie. Many people couldn't believe the person who had written Haven was only 24 years old. Orlando Bloom cast as Shy was so taken by the script that he signed on to produce as well. He didn't however sign on to portray Fritz the role he was initially offered. I loved the script but the role I most responded to was the character of Shy who at the time was written as a young Caymanian kid about 15 years old recalls Bloom who was reluctant for Flowers to change the integrity of the script but curious to see how he could do it. I was amazed. In literally 48 hours Frank came back with another script in which Shy had redeveloped into a character I could play. I knew right then that if he could do something like that I wanted to work with him. At the time only 27 years old himself Bloom also made his first foray in the producing role. It was exciting to start at the bottom of a film and work your way through it to really roll up your sleeves and get involved he said. It really made me emotionally connected to the movie so much so that it became part of me. After seeing the movie tonight I too was astounded that such a complex story was so well told by such a filmmaker and a produceractor both of whom were still a few years shy no pun intended of 30.Let me state up front I didn't attend the initial screening of Haven in 2004 at the Toronto International Film Festival so I'm unable to offer any comparisons of the earlier version of the film to the 98 minute version screened tonight. I've heard there's been some possible retooling and editing done since 2004. If so the result is a tight fastpaced multiplot film replete with irony and more twists and turns than the complicated financial system of the island.Flowers says he doesn't consider himself a historian or a sociologist but he does know his way around the islands and a great deal about the rich texture of its culture. That knowledge and experience is evident when watching the film as we're shown various locations around the islands from glitzy vacation villas to smoky food vendor stalls along unpaved roads to the party spots where wealthy offshore visitors come together with the island's underground drugcrime royalty to party to a dusty schoolyard to the humble home of a fisherman.The film is classic nonlinear multiplot. The two stories one a love story the other a crime story wind their way around each other in space character and time. While it would appear at first glance that Andrea played beautifully by Zoe Saldana and Shy the main characters of the love story have nothing in common with Carl Ridley played well by Bill Paxton and Mr. Allen played by Stephen Dillane with a brilliant sense of wit and whitecollar villainy one discovers as the story progresses that they as well as other supporting characters in both stories are all flawed broken people. Even though they are surrounded by the beauty of a tropical paradise the refuge they seek appears to be just beyond their grasp.What attracted me to the story is that all of the characters in it are broken and subject to the tragic consequences of their actions observed Saldana. They all had flaws and whether they were victims of circumstances of because of the choices they made they were very real because of their imperfections. The movie's cast is a refreshing combination of Hollywood veterans and local Caymanians who were recruited auditioned and trained for several supporting roles in the film. This resulted in a delicious infusion of local Cayman culture into over 30 speaking roles.The role of Shy provided Orlando the opportunity to show new freedom and depth in his craft perhaps to a degree never before seen. Certainly being liberated from the restrictions of working with a sword helped. He does have two other contemporary films under his belt The Calcium Kid shot before Haven and Elizabethtown shot after Haven. While both films were delightful I still think he brings more passion and spirit to this film. We see a wider range of emotions from tender love and hope to humiliation and shame emotional withdrawal rage confusion and despair to name only a few. It is acting in its purest state and he shines in it.The film in my opinion is gripping edgy hip tragic complex beautifully scripted and wonderfully acted. The nonlinear time shifts that Flowers employs may be perplexing to some. However I found it served only to keep my eyes riveted to the screen. It's the kind of movie that requires your full attention. You'll want to put down your bucket of popcorn so you don't miss anything.".

There is no promise from this film  no new actors nothing to carry this film even to be a hasbeen it is a neverwas.Hopefully we'll see no more work from the makers of Haven.";

When Andrea's father sails in a fishtrip they have a night of love at Andrea's home however they sleep and are surprised by the arrival of her family in the morning. Later Andrea's brother Hammer Anthony Mackie throws acid on the face of Shy and spends four months in prison. In Miami the dirty businessman Carl Ridley Bill Paxton is chased by Federal agents and escapes with his teenage daughter Pippa Agnes Bruckner to Cayman Island trying to reach his lawyer Mr. Allen Stephen Dillane. Pippa meets the small time thief Fritz Victor Rasuk sleeping in her room and he invites her to go a party. Before leaving the condo Fritz sees Carl counting lots of money. Fritz owes money to the dangerous drug dealer Richie Rich Razaaq Adoti and tells him about the fortune Carl has. Along a Friday 13th night their lives entwine in a chain of tragic events.Haven is an entertaining movie with a complex nonlinear screenplay with many characters that have their lives entwined. There are many credible subplots and considering the running time of 99 minutes the situations and characters are very welldeveloped. The direction and acting are great there are many beautiful locations but the screenplay is really topnotch. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Haven".

The acting is strong and the entire film has a distinctive atmosphere.The crowd seemed to love it but then again the entire cast was present and the audience was quite excited especially by Orlando Bloom.

The Fact that movie was made in 2004 impresses me the most because of its very contemporary style and techniques. Movie is a plain Scamthriller and goes about its job of presenting it in an extremely interesting way. The story line is quite simple but presented in a very slick way. You never feel that movie slows down at any point of time and its quite nicely stitched till the very end. Except for some average acting from lesser known actors not Orlando bloom in the movie i cant find too many defects in the movie. I am really looking forward to Trespasser the next from Frank.

When he finds the gun it looks like he is almost a burglar as opposed to a legitimate cleaner.Maybe the DVD will have another version and other features to let viewers judge for themselves.Morristown Fan".

The plot is really tight  ending is concluded very smartly. every character has played their parts perfectly.i also would like to add that at the beginning i was not getting the feel of this movie but after 1014 minutes i started enjoying the movie.. please don't expect any hardcore action stuff from this movie because it is not about the action alone it has a hidden meaning who will force you to think..!! a very out of league Chinese cinema which i have never imagined existed!! certainly a decent effort from director Wuershan.

	schema:reviewBody "Movie reviewers invited to screenings usually see it as their job to sit through a movie no matter how bad it is. However during the media screening of this film many reviewers walked out after 10 minutes. More walked out before halfanhour into the screening.It could be because they do not understand the film as there were no subtitles at the screening but I get the feeling that those who walked out just couldn't stand watching such trash. Stoically I stayed on.The plot is purportedly about a mystical blade which looks like an old chopping knife. As it passes through the hands of the titular characters each with different motivations it shapes their destinies. The Butcher Liu Xiaoye is a fat slob in love with a beautiful courtesan Kitty Zhang but is rebuffed each time he approaches her. The Chef Masanobu Ando is a loner bent on seeking revenge for the slaughter of his family. The Swordsman Ashton Xu the son of a legendary warrior is consumed by the desire to eclipse his father in both power and fame.Their stories intertwine as each man takes possession of the mystical blade and discovers the power and the danger it brings.I am sure there will be some smart alecs who will see this as a work of a genius but it was sheer torture sitting through this unholy trash trying to figure out what is happening and why. The scenes are so devoid of logic and interest that the movie would make the puerile eyecandy flick Sucker Punch look like a classic art flick of epic proportions. The actors seem to have been selected for their weird circus sideshow looks than for how well they can act. There are curious looking midgets in the cast and even one made up to look like Jabba The Hutt.Director Wuershan who used to shoot adverts fails miserably at trying his hand on a feature film. He throws in all sorts of crazy pop culture stuff and even repeating an aria from Puccini's Tosca in a bid to lend style or a sense of art to the scenes. But it turns out to be more of an unintentional comedy  or a tragicomedy. The few sequences that look interesting enough are those dealing with food. Makes me wonder what sort of hallucinatory drug Wuershan was on when he made this film. limchangmoh.blogspot.com".

With nowhere to go and the cops closing in on the hotel fast he wanders into Suite 16 in a fit of despair. Inside a handicapped and wheelchair bound Glover Pete Postlethwaite is held captive for the evening once discovered by Chris.However things change the next day when Glover informs Chris that the woman he slept with is now dead and that he surely will be sought out for her murder. Lonely and bored Glover offers to shelter Chris for awhile while the cuts and bruises from the previous nights escapades have time to heal.Without much of a choice Chris agrees......and our twisted tale of indulgence begins.Doting on the boy with his money Glover feeds Chris offers him up plenty of booze and cocaine...and lavishes him with hookers at his whim to meet his every sexual desire.All the while Chris treats Glover like a handicapped gimp verbally insulting and abusing him during the process. After Chris realizes that his sexual encounters are being taped and watched by Glover in the next room....Chris threatens to leave much to Glovers dismay.So Glover makes a deal with Chrishe will pay him to stay and be his own personal porn starwhile he watches every encounter from the room afar. Since Chris has dreams of starting his own club in the Carribbean this offer sounds to good to be true....and he gladly accepts.However Glovers demands on what he would like Chris to do in the sack grow increasingly more disturbing masochistic and bizarre. Finally after having enough Chris tries once again to leave.But this timeGlover offers him ALL the money he will need for his club once he leaves IF he performs just one sick and twisted act of murder for him.Will Chris do it? What will be the consequences of such a high stakes game of cat and mouse? Suite 16 is a very good movie with some heavy handed material. However it is quite intriguing and compelling for mature audiences and the chemistry of Glover and Chris is quite fascinating to watch as it develops throughout the film.The DVD transfer isn't all that great actually it sucks  but as a viewer without heavy expectations on ratio aspect etc...the annoyance fades rather quickly.All in all  if you can get your hands on it..stop in and check out Suite 16.Highly recommended!".

This movie is strictly for thinkers.....and for those who gave this film bad reviews...what were you watching??? Like I said this is only for thinkers! The writing is incredible and should be noted as much as the directing and the acting should....if it wasn't for those three elements this movie would never have got my vote as it would never have sustained it's detail.

If you are one of those people that love to watch action packed movies with no meaning behind them that don't make you think DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM! IT IS NOT FOR YOU! This movie is strictly for thinkers.....and for those who gave this film bad reviews...what were you watching??? Like I said this is only for thinkers! The writing is incredible and should be noted as much as the directing and the acting should....if it wasn't for those three elements this movie would never have got my vote as it would never have sustained it's detail. Excellent Film!";

For Suite 16 Deruddere had the opportunity to work with a bigger budget and some important names here and I fear that's what caused him to deliver a seemlyunfinished film. Some good dialogues and interesting content can't prevent this film from being a tedious and uninteresting social portrait. The plot introduces a young crook Antonie Kamerling on the run for other villains and he ends up in the suite of the wheelchaired manipulator Glover. At first Glover appears to be a sad and frustrated impotent guy from whom Chris can easily take advantage of but it's actually the other way aroundor something. There are absolutely no exciting moments in this film and the young Dutch actor Kamerling suffers way too much from his ego. The film is stuffed with sex sequences but they're not exactly interesting or meaningful Glover constantly hires prostitutes to make Chris stay. Suite 16 is very boring and not at all controversial although it obviously tries to be. I advise you to skip this one and go straight for some of the other film's on Deruddere's repertoire.".

Boy was I surprised when I saw this film! First off I'll review the acting which I thought was pretty decent throughout. At first I mistook Kang Ji Hwan's acting as overacting. However I soon realized that was his way of acting comically. After getting used to that his actions and reactions were simply quirky and cute. I loved his highpitched screaming. Usually the foreigners who act in Korean filmsdramas are downright awful. I have no idea why it just is. In Chilgeup Gongmuwon they were mediocre which was a HUGE relief because I did not have to cringe whenever they were on screen.Next the action and plot. The action was probably the worst part of the film. It was not terrible. It just needed some or maybe a lot of work. Some of the stunts were too unrealistic and poorly choreographed. i.e. the jet ski fencing thing... The plot maintained a great speed. Like the action the one turning point of the plot suffered from being a bit questionable. However do not let these faults turn you off because the comedy makes up for it entirely.Finally the comedy. The film starts off right away trying to get the audience to laugh. And it succeeds. Some scenes are predictable. Yet it is still hilarious! My family and I laughed at all the scenes meant to be laughed at. Overall Chilgeup Gongmuwon is a movie purely for laughs and should be watched lightedheartedly. It succeeds in the comedy but fails in the action. You will not get any meaning from this film but it is sure to entertain you until the very end. So if you are lucky enough to have a theater near you playing it I recommend you go see it.Notes The subtitles in my theater made me laugh. They used cuz instead of because which made me think that the translator instant messaged too much or something. Instead of spicy rice cakes it was translated to dumplings a completely different food. But I guess it is easier for a nonKorean audience to understand.This film is NOT RATED. However I would give it a PG13 rating. There was a comedic kissing scene light action sequences and some uses of sht.7 out of 10".

	schema:headline " Mr.  Mrs. Smith for South Koreans";
	schema:reviewBody "7th Grade Civil Servant is a quite entertaining action comedy movie with some curious spy flick passages and a romantic love story. A female agent loses her boyfriend because she can't tell him the truth about her real job as a special agent. Three years after the two heartbroken and unique characters meet again. The boyfriend still doesn't know anything about his big love's career and has become a special agent for a different section of the state. His girlfriend realizes quickly that he is now also lying to her but she's emotionally furious and blind for the truth. In a case involving the transfer of a deadly virus from a scientist to a gang of Russian criminals they have to figth against each other and sometimes work together without knowing it which leads to many hilarious sequences until the final revelations.By only reading my introduction you can easily see what this film is worth. The movie's two biggest flaws are that the story is nothing really new at all and heavily predictable at some points and that many comedy moments get a little bit too repetitive and silly from time to time.On the positive side we have two convincing main actors with the beautiful hyperactive and tough Ahn SooJi that is incarnated by Kim HaNeul and a clumsy courageous and naive Lee Jaejoon that is performed by Kang JiHwan. They have a good chemistry and perform very well together both in the harsh and the romantic parts. The supporting actors are also very funny and only the main villains remain a little bit faceless.The slapstick moments in this movie are rather comparable to the Japanese and Hongkong cinema of the eighties and nineties and fail to have the same unique brand of brilliance as recent South Korean flicks as Save The Green Planet! for example. Sometimes you rather feel as if you were in a Jackie Chan flick. If you like this kind of more accessible Asian humour you will really feel at home with this flick but I think that there's a little bit too much comedy in it against its own good. The movie could be more unique and lacks of something really outstanding.It's though a very entertaining lighthearted and sympathetic flick that is worth a watch but in the end nothing more than a good average flick with solid comedy moments and average action scenes that are saved by a very good acting.".

	onyx:emotionText "7th Grade Civil Servant is a quite entertaining action comedy movie with some curious spy flick passages and a romantic love story. A female agent loses her boyfriend because she can't tell him the truth about her real job as a special agent. Three years after the two heartbroken and unique characters meet again. The boyfriend still doesn't know anything about his big love's career and has become a special agent for a different section of the state. His girlfriend realizes quickly that he is now also lying to her but she's emotionally furious and blind for the truth.

	schema:reviewBody "If one should read the premise and have watched the trailer the film most steeped in its reference comes to mind and that's Hollywood's Mr and Mrs Smith starring the It couple Brangelina. This is sort of a Korean reply to that film and starring two hot good looking stars in Kim HaNeul and Kang JiHwan who knows if there could be as much sparks flying in real life as in the reel as well.But tabloid fodder aside My Girlfriend is an Agent seemed more aligned to True Lies rather than the Smiths by virtue of the extreme lengths taken in concealing one's true occupation from one's loved one and that they don't quite get at each other's throats at least not with intentionally deadly force anyway. Kim HaNeul stars as SuJi whose cover is a travel agent with a hardtoplease Japanese clientle while in fact she's one of the top clandestine agents Korea has. The introduction's set action sequence establishes that and throws in the dilemma her occupation being a roadblock to a successful love life with the geek JaeJun Kang JiHwan who decided that enough is enough and boards a plane essentially breaking her heart with an absence and communications silence.Fast forward to three years later and SuJi accidentally bumps into JaeJun while in the midst of a mission and sparks fly of a different sort. What she and us the audience don't know is that JaeJun is an agent as well albeit belonging to a different agency but have the same enemies in their gunsights. And it is this interplay of a long long romance now returned and an opportunity for revenge needless to say while concealing both their respective identities from each other that lead to natural comedic situations as well as setting action sequences up for double the whammy given two skilled agents in the field now.It's easy to dismiss this as just another hack on the Hollywood film but it's easy to identify with the underlying issues that My Girlfriend is an Agent poses. We aren't agents but it plays on the fact that we have different facades that we put on in different aspects of our life and sometimes these concerns come clashing with one another leaving us in a dilemma on what to do and which decision to take when faced with a fork in the road. Honesty is probably the best policy when it comes to relationships but sometimes you wonder if a white lie could in fact spare the other some pain physically or emotionally and for cases like these super spies likely to be more for the physical protection of their loved ones. Not everyone can operate like a James Bond who's probably the worst secret agent out there with practically a useless cover with such a persona well known.Kim HaNeul and Kang JiHwan share some comfortable chemistry whether they're up against each other or rekindling their feelings. Their television star status should ensure that fans everywhere would hit the cinemas to support their stars in their big screen outing you should see the response during their whirlwind tour of our city state. While HaNeul probably had it easier ramping up the sexiness of her role JiHwan is no pushover with his endearing bumbling agent that personally I thought was the more interesting of the two.The English title may sound tacky but don't let that stop you from enjoying this lightweight romantic comedy with action sequences that are a throwback similar to what Hong Kong films in the 80s have done.".

Just about everything about this movie is predictable but I give it props for being clever time to time although not original. Even for a comedy the character decisions can be awkward at times and doesn't seem to make any sense when a weapon is threatening to kill a lot of innocent civilians but the agents go off and do goofy stuff. Which I can't really blame cause there doesn't seem to be another way around it and if there was they needed to change a lot of scenarios around. I also found this comedy to be boring at times despite the actors and actresses doing the best they can with what they have. But overall like I said I found it to be a bit boring but it was somewhat enjoyable as well.6.810".

	schema:reviewBody "My Girlfriend Is an Agent is only a very ordinary action movie and doesn't work well as a romance either. The premise that the two stars are both secret agents who must constantly lie to each other to protect their covers is certainly a good plot device to keep them apart until the final reel but it also makes us wonder what they see in each other in the first place. If that were all there was to the movie I would say don't bother watching it.But forget about action forget about romance this is a comedy movie first  one of the funniest Korean comedies I've seen. It's a little slow getting started. The introductory scene with Ahn Sooji Kim HaNeul on a jet ski chasing bad guys in a speed boat isn't funny. And I didn't like Lee Jaejoon's Kang JiHwan first failed attempt as a field agent either. Foolishly responding aloud to the voice in his earpiece while the bad guys are in the same room is just dumb not funny.Fortunately it doesn't take long for the comedy to hit its stride and from then on things really get rolling. All of the characters are earnestly trying to do their best to save the country from a deadly biological agent but their efforts seem in vain as scene after scene goes awry in the most creatively improbable ways.I see that many of the other reviews compare this movie to Mr. and Mrs. Smith. I can see the superficial similarity of characters and plot but to me this movie has a lot more in common with the Pink Panther movies. There's serious work to be done and the stars are trying as hard as they can but are only rewarded with one uproariously funny failure after another. For real secret agents that wouldn't be good enough but for us movie watchers it's more than enough reason to tune in to My Girlfriend Is an Agent.".

This AGENT film grabbed me by the funny bone in the opening scenes when the NaNeul appears as a model in wedding dress a toilet cleaning maid and a Japanese speaking travel agent. I loved the recurring dialog Who trained you? from the higher ranking NIS agents.The scenery was great  I loved in Korea for a year Aug. 1996Aug. 1997 and miss those days but thanks to Netflix I'm back home there again in my mind.".

	schema:reviewBody "The opening to My Girlfriend Is An Agent is certainly one that will not be forgotten in a hurry. Ahn SuJi Kim HaNeul is a brilliant spy who spends her life undercover unbeknownst to her boyfriend Lee JaeJoon KangJiHwan who doesn't need to be a rocket scientist to realize something is amiss. Later when the film explores the history of their relationship the layers of lies that Lee was able to discover add to the hilarity of the situation though at the beginning he only wishes to escape.Unable to get Ahn on the phone who as he is venturing towards the plane that will take him far from home is on an assignment he viciously blasts her voice mail. When Ahn eventually completes her mission she rushes to the airport only to discover that Lee has already left a situation that is as emotionally involved as it is humorous. Although the film often combines more than one emotion into many of its scenes despite the well executed delivery by the actors the romantic storyline is produced in the most perplexing manner.Three years later Ahn has discovered love in the arms of another man however this relationship is about to enter dangerous terrain. Though Ahn continues to be employed as an agent little does she realize that Lee has over the course of his time abroad become an agent as well  albeit not a very good one. In fact to call him a terrible field agent would be an insult to all terrible field agents.Much of the humor comes through his inability to complete a mission to the professional standard a number of uniquely humorous occurrences providing several refreshingly comedic scenarios. However his shocking skills as an agent become even more unprofessional when he and Ahn unfortunately bump into each other unwittingly working the exact same case from different angles. Her immediate reaction which is repeated over the course of the feature is well to call it 'rage' would be a bit of an understatement.Finding themselves in such close proximity time and time again the feelings they once held for each other begin to plague the case. Lee often appears hypocritical having left Ahn for failing to provide him with the truth yet he is unable to do the same to her expecting their relationship to simply begin once more even though he initiated the breakup. Ahn on the other hand who as aforementioned has found love with another suitor appears emotionally unhinged her inability to restrain herself from pursuing Lee contradicting her unflinching professionalism.Constantly they find themselves in awkward scenarios and eventually even begin to suspect one another as been enemy agents their mixed feelings reflecting unbridled passion one minute and utter loathing the next. Forcing them into situations that often leads to ensuring violence does allow the audience to feel more attached to the characters for at any moment tragedy could strike its chord.Although both actors are as humorous as they are entertaining in their roles it is often Lee's boss WonSeok Ryoo SeungRyong who is the most effective character of all. A well respected macho man who is forced to continuously suffer Lee's inadequacy's out in the field his attitude and facial expressions are a joy to watch though beneath all of this bravado is a truly honorable character.The opening of the film prepares the viewer for a truly entertaining experience and despite a unique blend of humor action and characterization been applied the rest of the film occasionally feels as though it is unable to live up to the potential exhibited at the beginning. The film's conclusion moreover feels as unnecessary as it does awkward as though the creator's were unsure where else to situate it. This aside My Girlfriend Is An Agent will surely entertain a wealth of audiences though if the movie were in fact a cake by the end you may in fact be hungry for something a little easier to swallow.".

This is shown by the richness of dialogs and curious anecdotes which constantly make you wonder which parts were completely true and which sprung from the author's vivid imagination.Apart from the richness from the story and how the storytelling evolves smoothly throughout the film the production design makes you feel completely Mexico in the 1930s. The costumes are great also.The direction is almost perfect. Roberto Sneider takes you by surprise first at about minute 20 then slowly and smoothly hypnotizes you and never lets go.Much credit goes to the lead Ana Claudia Talancon whose good looks and very well developed character arc make you fall at first for her beauty and innocence and later for her humanity courage and cleverness.Daniel Gimenez Chaco's performance deserves praise also. He captures the Mexican Macho Persona perfectly his cynical viewpoint of things and comments bring humor to a character who would be otherwise despicable.Second characters like de Tavira's and others feel a bit underdeveloped but in the end all actors do great jobs with their little screen time and their contribution suffice.The drama never falls for the temptation to go overly melodramatic and dialogs are kept smart enough  even ironic at times  to make this movie a fresh and satisfying take on the Mexican way of life. It actually feels so accurate that deep thoughts of nothing has ever changed really do spring a few times.The music and editing are very well done also.Congratulations to everybody involved!".

Here we go again in EnglishFirst two strong statements I have not read the book and I'm from Puebla the city where the story takes place.I don't know how good of an adaptation this movie is but as a cinematic product Arrncame la vida works just fine. The leading actors as well as the rest of the cast offer solid performances. Gimnez Cacho as always portrays Andrs Ascencio very nicely. He depicts a son ofabitch general who despite this characteristics or because of these is highly enjoyable. The macho humor that this character uses gives movement to the story. On top of that we have Ana Claudia Talancn the astonishing Catalina Guzmn. I'm not the biggest fan of her but I have to say her performance is flawless.The references to the poblano factor poblanez gives a proper setting to the actions of the story which mentions a lot of local moments and characters of the 30's and 40's. However the universal value of the movie and the novel I guess remains. Caciques corruption and battles over power exist everywhere not only in Mxico but all over the world.About directing and production again flawless. With a nearly 7 million dollar budget Arrncame la vida is the most expensive movie in Mxico to this date. However it has the quality of any Hollywood picture that surely would need way more than that to achiev the same results. The cinematography and the powerful music give the final touches to a production which I'm sure the audience from Puebla enjoyed and related to their own experiences and long time memories. Some nervous laughs could be heard in a packed premier at Puebla with members of the finest families of the region. You go guess what they thought of this portrait...Despite of that people would be satisfied with the story from what I could see and hear.Summing up I strongly recommend this picture. It is not the biggest Mexican picture but no doubt is a solid project with high production values. I've never read any of Mastretta's books but now I want to start.".

	schema:reviewBody "Angeles Mastretta's 1985 novel Arrancame la vida was a huge success in Mexico as well as in many Spanish speaking countries. The title which can be translated as tear out my life was also the title of a famous Mexican song which is heard at the end of the film sung by Tona La Negra one of the best Mexican singers of all times.The narrative centers around Catalina Guzman. As the story begins she is a young woman that is dazzled by a much older man Andres Ascencio. They get married much against her father's objections. Catalina is not prepared for what her life will turn out with her new status. Andres an ambitious and well connected man in Puebla decides to run for governor of the state. Before getting married Catalina had consulted a seer to see what her future will be and the fact she wanted to 'feel'. The woman's advice is a blunt one she will use her sex in order to fulfill herself. A prophetic omen indeed.Right after Catalina and Andres have their first child he comes in with two other children he had sired with another woman. Catalina who is inexperienced plus having to rear her own infant is confused and resentful of the strangers that are thrown into her lap a new responsibility she didn't count on. Andre a womanizer will bring another daughter into the household.Andres decides to take the family to Mexico City where he will be closer to influential people as he wishes to run for the presidency eventually. Walking into the Bellas Artes auditorium one day Catalina watches a rehearsal of the local symphony orchestra. The director Carlos Vives gets annoyed with her presence. He wants her to step to the rear of the theater where she will not distract the players. That meeting will mark a turning point in Catalina's life. Unfortunately Catalina doesn't realize how her amorous involvement with Carlos will change her life as well as cause his death.This epic account of Ms. Mastretta's novel was written and directed by Roberto Sneider. The film gets the basic points of the novel in cinematic terms resulting in an engrossing story that although predictable up to a point doesn't prepare the viewer for the way Catalina's resolve will free her at the end.Ana Claudia Talancon who we first met in El crimen del padre Amaro makes an excellent impression with her Catalina. Ms. Talancon goes from a young woman to a sophisticated society lady effortlessly. Equally good is the Andres of Daniel Gimenez Cacho a wonderful actor that always delivers. Jose Maria De Tavira appears as Carlos Vives the orchestra leader that falls in love with Catalina.Javier Aguirresarobe's cinematography takes us to places in Mexico that are overlooked by most of his fellow cameramen. The music by Leonardo Heilblum and Jacobo Lieberman does wonder for the picture. Roberto Sneider an actor turned director shows he has a talent that needs to be seen.".

But unfortunately not all actors in this movie are good I'm talking of the horrible work that Jose Maria de Tavira does in this movie its a bad acting work but it looks like garbage compared to his coworker Gimenez Cacho. The screenplay its a great adaptation of the books written by Angeles Mastretta this screenplay was done by the author of the book and the director Roberto Sneider. The movie takes a theme that reminds you of La Ley de Herodes so it portrays the old fashion politicians in Mexico which still exist. The directors work is a good work which makes you try to remember his name i personally hadn't seen any of his previews works but now that I've seen this one I'm sure gonna see his next work he directed Dos Crimenes with Pedro Armendariz Jr. and Damian Alcazar. The movie is worth seeing and you enjoy it a great deal thanks to the acting of Gimenez Cacho i hope to see more lead roles from him. So i hope you enjoy this one and it has been already released so i don't know why it is shown as in production still.".

The directors work is a good work which makes you try to remember his name i personally hadn't seen any of his previews works but now that I've seen this one I'm sure gonna see his next work he directed Dos Crimenes with Pedro Armendariz Jr. and Damian Alcazar. The movie is worth seeing and you enjoy it a great deal thanks to the acting of Gimenez Cacho i hope to see more lead roles from him. So i hope you enjoy this one and it has been already released so i don't know why it is shown as in production still.";

	schema:reviewBody "In my opinion this is by far the best and most important Mexican movie since La Sombra del Caudillo. A movie also made from a novel in 1960 that was seized by the army and never released and was done in the same style of using fictitious names. After I heard that this movie was filmed in my home town Puebla I'm a US citizen now living in LA and a candidate for a nomination for best foreign film I rushed for the book and read it. It didn't take too long for me to realize who and what she Angeles Mastretta was talking about and I loved it. So I rushed for the DVD and couldn't find it but somehow I saw the movie. In the version that I saw I noticed an important and brief episode from the book among others that was missing in the movie almost at the end. I'm referring to a serenade performed by the best and most popular artists in those days Pedro Vargas and Agustin Lara there's a statue of Lara in a park in Los Angeles that ended in a clean fist fight won by the kid with the motorcycle that the young daughter of the general loved and who mysteriously died a few days later in a motorcycle accident ?. Who was the rich kid? Well who could afford to take these artists to Puebla for a simple serenade? But who wants to be an enemy of the media anyway. I wonder if the richest man in the world whose name appears at the end in the credits as contributor to the movie also contributed to the omission of this episode or if it was not filmed at all that I don't know. But anyway that is not too important compared to another character that is almost invisible in the book and movie by the name of Don Mike Heiss. If you find out who he really was then do a simple research like I did and visit the archives of the New York Times. You'll be surprise of these articles from 1917 the year Zapata was murdered1919 Villa was murdered a few years later when USA was about to invade Mexico again just to liberate this special agent Heiss from a Puebla penitentiary. HEISS became the richest man in Mexico and probably in the world after Rockefeller and was the partner of all the richest man in Mexico at the time with the help of General Ascencio who was in charge of making offers nobody could refuse. After Ascencio died Cienfuegos became one of the richest men in the world during the six years he was president. All this just proves that unfortunately there is nothing to celebrate next year on the centennial of the revolution the 18th day of November 1910 with the exception of remembering Aquiles Serdan the first martyr of the unconsummated and socalled revolution initiated also in my beautiful home town of Puebla de Los Angeles Mastretta?. The acting in this movie is the best I've seen in many years. Thank you Ana Claudia Daniel and Roberto from now on you are my favorite actors and director. Please don't go to Hollywood you all are more needed in Mexico.".

It leaves you confused and unsure who to root for. I also love when actors can pull of playing very young to mature and have you believing it. Entitlement is a universal theme where the very rich takes advantage of the poor.

	schema:reviewBody "Arrncame la Vida is a story from the perspective of Catalina Guzmn. At 16 she marries Andrs Ascencio and at 30 becomes his widow. He is a political machine always looking to rise within the ranks of politics the way he did in the military ranks during the Mexican Revolution. There were several omissions in the movie. Honestly I believe that this is why the movie fell flat in a lot of ways at least for me. I never thought I would be one of those people who says it wasn't as good as the book but it really was not as good as the book.In the book you begin to like Andrs for various reasons as you continue reading because even though he had moments of misogyny and murder he was teaching her how life works and how people can be. He was teaching her to defend herself and survive all the Bull that people shovel your way especially when they see you alone and vulnerable. After a while you really don't find Catalina all that charming. For a grown woman she behaved very immaturely. It seemed as though throwing temper tantrums were her fort. When he does die he does point out that he hurt her and he does it in a very direct way. They made light of that in the movie but it wasn't a light moment in the book. He also does not tell her he left her everything until he calls in the attorneys and changes his will in front of her. He says he leaves her everything of his own accord in front of witnesses so that no one can contest the will. She is peeved because now she has to determine how things get distributed. The thing with the tea was open ended in the book because you don't know if she killed him or if he became addicted to the tea. According to the book if you drank it in large amounts it could kill you. He was drinking it every day in large amounts in the book. She lets him know before he drinks the last of the tea that it would be best if he not have anymore but he insists. Reverse psychology? maybe.The other thing that they left out was the lesbian scene that Catalina has with Andrea Palma.Then the funeral. It was in the home during the wake that Rodolfo comes at her with offering to help her with the will. She tells him to stay out of it because she has it under control and does not need his help. He does not respond because he doesn't know how. He goes over to the casket and pretends to look heartbroken but the boredom sets in. Then there was also Rodolfo's desire for Catalina. She remembers when his fat ass chased her in a red dress Andrs had bought her in NY and she threatens Rodolfo with telling Andrs about his behavior. Rodolfo was interested in exploiting Andres's death to get into Catalina's pants and gain access to the fortune Andrs had amassed. He didn't think she was very smart or that she was a quality woman the way they inferred in the movie. The movie did not show Doa Herminia either. It also did not fully explain the story concerning his first wife. The movie did also not talk about Virginia. There was more to it than was inferred in the movie. The other thing was that he was going to be buried in Zacatln. In the book it was raining which is significant. If you are going to watch this movie read the book afterward. I think you will enjoy the book more than the movie.".

Ms. Pickford delivers kicks to various backsides among them Reginald Denny's and Margaret Livingston's and gets kicked herself. Twice Ms. Pickford is seen falling on her rear end.

She really is the only amusing thing about this film playing a character of such outlandish personality that you really find it easy to get annoyed with her even if you don't totally dislike her.This is best remembered for a sequence where Pickford in a man's tuxedo totally screws up a big production number by getting distracted when producer Reginald Denny appears at the side of the stage. She screws up all of the chorus girls and the leading lady and the musical number results in pandemonium. This gag was repeated with similar laughs in Star! with Julie Andrews and Funny Girl with Barbra Streisand.".

This was a stage play not really suitable for film without a change. The stage productions earlier success was grounded on deliberate stage over acting. So it is not surprising it didn't suit film that well. The film without Pickford would have been irritating it is Pickford that saves it and makes it watchable.But we should also remember that at this time studios were still struggling with Sound and this made direction and acting quite difficult.Mary could have easily taken this onto the stage and had a big hit with it she was a veteran stage actor.If anything this movies shows Pickford to be versatile and willing to step out of the box.".

Pickford's French accent may not be as good as Marion Davies' in Marianne but she's wonderfully funny in this role. It's a talkie extension of all the great comic parts she played in silent films.Pickford was a great comic and proves she had what it takes to make it in talkies. KIKI is a terrific comedy and she's better in this than in her other three talkies. KIKI was based on the Norma Talmadge silent film which was based on the Broadway play. Oddly I just read in the Valentino biography that he had seen Lenore Ulric in New York and then Gladys Cooper in London in the stage versions.The film opens with a LONG panning shot of backstage doings all in time to the song the chorus girls are stomping away to. Pickford gets fired but insinuates her way back into the chorus via the producer Reginald Denny. On opening night she makes a shambles of the big number starring Margaret Livingston as the vain star. Pickford is hysterically funny.Not realistic at all but great fun. Costars include Joseph Cawthorn Phil Tead funny as the butler Edwin Maxwell and Fred Walton.The sets for the apartment are atrociously ugly. Not to be believed! An explosion of Victoriana and Art Deco.Mary Pickford was definitely one of the greats!".

	schema:reviewBody "In the 1910s and 20s Mary Pickford was the biggest actress alive. Her movies were adored and when she and husband Douglas Fairbanks toured the world they were the toast of every nationincluding not just the UK and France but even the Soviet Union. And although a Canadian she was given the title 'America's Sweetheart'. Folks loved her in all sorts of filmsespecially ones where the actress played little girls and teenagersthough she was WAY too old to be playing such parts. It didn't matter...EVERYONE loved her. Because of this I can only assume that either she thought the public would like her in ANYTHING so let's make a pile of crap film like Kiki or perhaps she simply was trying to commit career suicide. All I know is that I adore most of her films...but think that Kiki is among the most annoying films I have ever seen! I wonder how folks back in the day thought of it? Well considering she only made a few sound films it possibly could have been that folks finally were tiring of her.The single biggest problem with Kiki is that the film was VERY dated. As a silent picture it might have workedmostly because you wouldn't have had to LISTEN to Pickford and her horrendous French accent. To say it was broad and overboard is a great understatement. She is to French accents like Jethro Bodine was to country accents in The Beverly Hillbilliesit was THAT strong and over the top. Heck Pepe le Pew seems far more restrained than she did in the film. And like in her films where she played children her Kiki is often petulant and childishwhich worked fine in 1918 or 1920. Here though she just seems like a....well IMDb won't let us put the Bword in our reviews! Oddly she's supposed to be cute...she certainly isn't! Because of these things it's difficult not to thoroughly hate her or the sound of her voice. Oddly however Reginald Owen's character is inexplicably drawn to this demanding annoying and selfish woman in the film. Why? I have no idea...but can only assume his character was meant to be insane! And equally insane is the audience in the film that watch her stage performance and adore her histrionics. None of this makes any sense and it seemed that the character is about as onedimensional and dislikable as any I can recall. Overall this is a truly horrible filmnot just because Pickford was so bad but because it builds up so much illwill in the viewer! I have long adored her films and would place her films like My Best Girl Suds and Daddy Long Legs among the best silents. But try as I might I hated Kiki and never want to see this awful film again! Loud brash unsubtle and annoying...all adjectives you'd never think to associate with 'America's Sweetheart'!".

As a modern audience who has lived through horror films we expect a Nazi or a monster to slip into the frame in the background but it never does. KANAL truly is a horror film but what's unbearable to us and the sturdy group of Resistance fighters isn't the Nazis above the sewers or the metaphorical monster but it is the solitude and emptiness that drives them to insanity death or a bitter end.KANAL is Andrzej Wajda's dirty bloody valentine to the heroes of the 1944 Warsaw Resistance as the film follows the last hours of a band of heroes in their ultimately futile attempt to escape the Nazis through the labyrinth of underground sewers. We are first introduced to them as strong willful humans trying to survive in a world that's falling to ruins One could also argue that Andrzej Wajda also created the first postapocalypse film.

After they enter the sewers we expect and want them to come out even more strongwilled than everhow many people can face dead bodies floating in the water of a dirty sewer with the same calm defiance? But as time goes on and the group gets separated it becomes more and more inevitable that these heroes are not meant for a Hollywood's movie's happy redemptive ending.Andrzej Wajda like Roman Polanski was a real survivor of the Nazi invasion of Poland during WWII and both became filmmakers who brought their experiences to films as Polanski did with Oscarwinning THE PIANIST. However Polanski's film though absolutely profound doesn't have Wajda's eye for detailsthe scenes of ruined Warsaw for example seem almost CGI'ed and it's obvious that he's trying to go for more while Wajda will focus solely on the dirty ground the debris blowing in the wind or the flames of a burning building in the background. With Wajda less is much more effective. If there is a situation more dirty awful lonely scary or haunting than these people making their way through the labyrinths I have yet to see it.".

My suspicion that this got past the Party censors as a Dantean allegory about the worker and peasant struggles with each character and episode exposing some lesson.

Wajda seems to suggest this by quoting Szczepanski1944 ... But know this from our tombstones A victorious new Poland will be born And you will not walk this land You Red Ruler of bestial forces! 1 Indeed the resolution suggests the Stalinist Inferno is far from over. Those who have tried to bring light to the world suffer a Promethean fate.What seems remarkable to me is the positive spirit humor and love of life that most of the characters display in the face of their passage into the underworld. There is additional irony humorous to me for example that the composer attempts to play a particularly patriotic Chopin but is then ordered to play something with feeling an inane dance tune. By the way the Beckstein piano that the composer tries to protect was made by a company that provided Hitler with crucial early support.It is also remarkable that such a dark almost antiheroic view of combatants was made only 12 years after the event. It is not so far from the spirit of Ernie Pyle and just think how long it took to make Band of Brothers.1 Interview on www.wajda.pl".

The first portion of the film is set in crumbling buildings and the nobility of the cause is apparent. However the vast majority of the film is set in the sewers hence the title Kanal and the characters over time lose some of their nobility and just ache to survive. The film is intensely claustrophobic and the filth they move about in literally looks like raw sewageso as the characters fight for life and in most cases give up hope you find yourself being pulled into their world and their terror. A great though intensely awful film to watch. So it comes as no surprise that I would not recommend this film to children or people afflicted with claustrophobia.PSif the musician seems familiar it's because Wladyslaw Sheybal also known as Vladek Sheybal is one of the Bond Villains in the movie FROM Russia WITH LOVE.".

And while there were plenty of British and American war films made in the 1950s it was perhaps easier to turn our story into the blackandwhite banality of heroic fable besides which we could also make movies without communist censors looking over our shoulders. Wajda here chooses to fashion a tale centred on the collapse of the Polish resistance to the Nazis the last survivors take to the sewers the Germans pump gas down and you know as soon as the film starts that there will be no happy endings even for the survivors. It's a tale whose laconic nihilism would be remarkable in any era I was reminded of the much later BBC nuclearthemed drama 'Threads' another tale of underground life facing extinction while the dialogue stoical in the face of impossible fate offers more direct echos for it made me think of the films of another Polish master Krystoff Kieslowski. The most remarkable things in this film are the poetically bleak sequence of scenes that end it it's biggest failing is the score that as with many films of this era feels the need to describe the plot and not merely to complement it. Occasionally other aspects of the movie also give away its age but what's much more notable is the modernity and hopelessness of its approach to its material.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a movie that can be appreciated more than enjoyed. It is a story dating to September 1944 at the end of the Warsaw uprising. A company of Polish resistance fighters is followed in their last hours. As the company walks by the camera in an initial scene the voiceover is These are the heroes of the tragedy. Watch them closely for these are the last hours of their lives. This is a risky way to start the movie since it takes away any sense of hope that might be had for these people but the effect is to accentuate identification with their fate.The film is divided into two parts the first part taking place in a bombed out house on the outskirts of Warsaw. The fighters know their fate if they stay there and fight against the overwhelming German forces. The leaders are agreeable to fighting to the end but the command comes from headquarters to retreat. The retreat is to be through the sewers to a liberated part of the the city. The second part of the movie details the slog through the noisome cavernous sewers. If this sounds rather grim be advised that it is. Many times throughout the ordeal I kept saying to myself Just hang in there you can get through this. Dante's Inferno came to my mind before the sensitive musician in the company delivered the lines Thither we come and there down in the moat I saw a people smothered in a filth that out of human privies seemed to flow.So what are the rewards of seeing this through? For me there were two learning a bit of history and appreciating the film as a work of art. From having viewed director Wajda's war trilogy A Generation Kanal and Ashes and Diamonds as well as the later Katyn I have learned a tiny bit about Polish history. More than I would probably have known otherwise since I doubt that I would have sought this information out on my own. It is estimated that over 200000 people lost their lives in the Warsaw uprising so Wajda has done his part in insuring that this grave event will not be lost in the mists of time.As a piece of filmmaking this ranks highly. I am not sure whether the filming in the sewers was done on sets or in actual sewers. I suspect the former but the result seems real enough and I have to believe that getting the lighting right was a challenge. Wajda takes full advantage of black and white photography to accentuate faces and silhouetted figures capturing the emotions of the characters as well as their claustrophobic conditions.When the unrelenting bleakness started to seem overplayed and onerous I reflected on the fact that I was getting about a 0.001 hint of the real experience. The Criterion Collection DVD provides an excellent print especially given that this film is over fifty years old. The DVD extras are well worth a watch. There is a half hour interview with Wajda and another half hour interview conducted by Wajda with Warsaw uprising survivor Jan NowakJezioranski. This latter interview is informative offering some details on the complexity of the big picture like how the Soviets halted their advance toward Berlin in order to let the Germans finish off the Poles paving the way for Soviet postwar control. But the delay prevented the Russians from capturing Berlin before the Allies. I wish there had been more background details in the actual film like just where the company was initially and how far away from their destination they were.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a movie that can be appreciated more than enjoyed. It is a story dating to September 1944 at the end of the Warsaw uprising. A company of Polish resistance fighters is followed in their last hours. As the company walks by the camera in an initial scene the voiceover is These are the heroes of the tragedy. Watch them closely for these are the last hours of their lives. This is a risky way to start the movie since it takes away any sense of hope that might be had for these people but the effect is to accentuate identification with their fate.The film is divided into two parts the first part taking place in a bombed out house on the outskirts of Warsaw. The fighters know their fate if they stay there and fight against the overwhelming German forces. The leaders are agreeable to fighting to the end but the command comes from headquarters to retreat. The retreat is to be through the sewers to a liberated part of the the city. The second part of the movie details the slog through the noisome cavernous sewers.

The number of Nazi dead was counted in thousands  the Polish dead in hundreds of thousands . It was a testimony to Polish courage and Soviet cynicism Andrzej Wajda's KANAL tells part of the story . Certainly the Polish courage is well represented . It wasn't just the Polish underground resistance army who took part in the uprising . So did intellectuals  old men  woman and children and this film represents the diverse cross pattern . Armed only with small arms they fought off battle hardened SS divisions who had aircraft  tanks and heavy artillery . What the film sadly doesn't mention is the role the Soviets played by stabbing the Poles in the back . It's understandable when communist Poland was still under Soviet influence . Nikita Khruschev had started his  deStalinism  program but such a change was like replacing Nazism with fascism so while there was some benefits to this new regime it doesn't stop the downside of the fundamentalist dictatorship That said Wajda has made a classic European film . I remembered it from 20 years ago and when I tracked it down I wasn't disappointed by it . It's a mix of styles with the scenes above ground mirroring the Italian NeoRealist movement with the scenes set under the eponymous sewers  Kanal being Polish for sewer  being inspired by German Expressionism . The characters are people you can believe in from Lt Zadra the courageous patriot in charge of the company to Daisy  a morally ambiguous  A prostitute ?  woman . The director doesn't make the mistake like many film makers of showing what a sewer is . More often than not they're just a cosy film set . Not here . It's a sanitation system full of faeces and urine and dangerous gases and the characters have to crawl through it . This reality combined with a haunting mood muzak by Jan Krenz makes KANAL a riveting film There are a couple of flaws to it however . The lack of any mention to the Soviets is forgivable as it's understandable . What isn't so forgivable is that the time frame is rather confusing . Many of the characters succumb to madness but considering they've fought off the Nazis for 56 days would a few hours in the sewers cause something Nazi shells were incapable of ? It's never stated how Daisy would know the layout of the sewer system and if she's so important why not let her lead the party . There's also an unlikely need for characters to spout existentialist dialogue at unlikely times . There's also the irritating lack of consistency where matches not working in one scene only to have them working a few scenes later and characters telling their comrades not to shout in case the Germans hear them only to have the same characters shout in the following scene These are minor flaws despite being noticeable . KANAL is a film that will stay with you and scenes will burn themselves in to the memory such as a soldier asking a young  pretty woman lying on a stretcher if she's unwell only to see the blanket fall away revealing her right leg has been amputated above the knee . You'll also be able to remember long after seeing it who gets killed in what order . This might mean it doesn't have the same impact upon repeated viewing but it's a film everyone should see at least once".

However Kanal presents Poland during wartime. A disturbing claustrophobic vision of madness told through the eyes of various Home Army resistance fighters in the dark sewers of Warsaw.

Genuinely haunting made more so by the eerie classical soundtrack and superb performances especially from Vladek Sheybal as Michael the artist who eventually succumbs to insanity and mournfully wanders the disgusting tunnels playing a haunting melody on an ocarina as he does so.

Andrei Wajda's Kanal follows Lieutenant Zadra and his band of battered resistance fighters as they lick their wounds and struggle to stay alive.Wajda opens his film with a wonderfully complex tracking shot which serves to introduce us to Zadra and his company of men. We're then treated to several short sequences some of them traditional skirmishes with German forces gun battles others less so. Consider a brief scene in which a soldier telephones his wife. She frantically tells him that the Germans are clearing her building. The line then goes dead. Another scene features a second in command Lieutenant Madry sleeping with a woman in a bombed out building. Who can blame them? They die hours later.Though filmed a decade after the conflict Wajda shot his film in Polish locations still massively affected by WW2. Much of the film takes place in Poland's Mokotow district which had all but been reduced to rubble. This lends the film a degree of authenticity atypical of the genre every frame packed with dilapidated buildings bomb craters funnels of smoke pulverised concrete and wreckage strewn streets. These were real sites of combat which Wajda often intercuts with documentary footage of the same sites taken by Polish crews during the tail end of WW2.While the film's first half takes place above ground in wideopen wartorn spaces its second half plunges below ground. Surrounded by the enemy Zadra and his followers retreat into Warsaw's sewer system disappearing into the watery labyrinth of canals that trace the city's underside. When the Germans dump poisonous gas into the sewers and systematically block manhole exits and entrances with machine guns bombs barb wire and traps our brave resistance fighters find themselves caged like rats. Some attempt to surface but are machine gunned to death. Others tempt booby traps but to no avail. The survivors disappear further into the canals attempting to outpace the Germans above ground. But Wajda's tone is unrelentingly grim. One by one the men go crazy lose their lives suicidally shoot themselves or turn on one another. Those who escape the canals are apprehended by Germans and executed Wajda would go on to document the Katyn massacre in 2007. As Kanal progresses its mood steadily moves from desperate to fatalistic from expansive to claustrophobic Wajda systematically darkening his shadows shrinking his locations and squeezing every inch of life out of his band of resistance fighters. The film is precisely separated into two halves above ground and hopeful below ground expressionistic and hopeless Poland's metaphorical death and descent. Final shot a man lowering his slimy mud encased body into a cramped manhole disappearing under the streets like a slug. It's not only that Wajda completely deglamourises the archetypal notion of a noble brave romantic patriotic and valiant resistance fighter but that the film itself encapsulates the defeatism of postwar Poland. The Warsaw Uprising was a total failure the Allies largely refused to help Poland and the country as a whole  the very country which WW2 was supposedly waged to protect  was promptly sacrificed by the Allies to the Soviets to whom they made a devil's pact. Many of Wajda's war films during his early career were intensely critical of the Polish government andor are drenched in a mood of complete hopelessness. Only in 1989 would Poland regain full Sovereignty. Only in 1993 would all Soviet forces leave her soil. Today Poland is still the West's whore the site of a massive missile defence shield and advanced radar network when it comes to cash cows nothing moos like a theatrewide antimissile missile defence system the bigger and bolder and more ambitious the better designed to put pressure on Iran and Russia. Poland agrees to these things because it lets her pretend to be a big boy in NATO.8.910  Worth one viewing.".

	schema:headline " A Metaphorical Poem of Modern Hell";
	schema:reviewBody "Kanal was the second feature by Andrzej Wajda who is remembered as the master of Polish new wave and the second film in his 'war trilogy' in between of Generation and Ashes and Diamonds. Kanal tells the story of the desperate Polish uprising against the Germans in 1944 and the tragical failure of it. Not only film scholars but the people in 1957 saw Kanal as a political statement. They saw it as a description of the bitterness Polish people had for the Soviet troops who didn't help them early enough to beat the Germans. But Andrzej Wajda has said that he didn't want to get mixed up with political nor social backgrounds. He wasn't interested in making a film with a direct message or to point the finger at the ones responsible for the tragedy of the uprising. He only wanted to tell the story of a resistance group whose withdrawal grew out to be a modern parallel for Dante's hell.The screenwriter of Kanal Jerzy Stefan Stawinski took part in the events of 1944 and through that brought a realistic touch to the film which probably meant a virility test of some kind for him. His approach to the subject was mature and brilliantly balanced. His sympathy was clearly for the soldiers but he offered a contrast  another side there is clearly strong skepticism for the desire and price of the soldiers' heroism.The film is divided into two separate acts and the division is precisely considered. In the very beginning this division is made clear to us the realistic prologue of the battle on the ground is instantly followed by a long surreal sequence in the sewers. It is a metaphorical poem a combination of realism and fantasy.

	onyx:emotionText "Kanal was the second feature by Andrzej Wajda who is remembered as the master of Polish new wave and the second film in his 'war trilogy' in between of Generation and Ashes and Diamonds. Kanal tells the story of the desperate Polish uprising against the Germans in 1944 and the tragical failure of it. Not only film scholars but the people in 1957 saw Kanal as a political statement. They saw it as a description of the bitterness Polish people had for the Soviet troops who didn't help them early enough to beat the Germans. But Andrzej Wajda has said that he didn't want to get mixed up with political nor social backgrounds. He wasn't interested in making a film with a direct message or to point the finger at the ones responsible for the tragedy of the uprising. He only wanted to tell the story of a resistance group whose withdrawal grew out to be a modern parallel for Dante's hell.The screenwriter of Kanal Jerzy Stefan Stawinski took part in the events of 1944 and through that brought a realistic touch to the film which probably meant a virility test of some kind for him. His approach to the subject was mature and brilliantly balanced. His sympathy was clearly for the soldiers but he offered a contrast  another side there is clearly strong skepticism for the desire and price of the soldiers' heroism.The film is divided into two separate acts and the division is precisely considered. In the very beginning this division is made clear to us the realistic prologue of the battle on the ground is instantly followed by a long surreal sequence in the sewers. It is a metaphorical poem a combination of realism and fantasy. The realism of the filthy sewers and the faces of the soldiers soon turn into surrealism of obscure sounds suggestive music and figures walking in the mist.These are the tragic heroes watch them closely in the remaining hours of their lives. A company is desperately fighting against the Germans but soon gets an order to retreat to the center through sewers. The moment when the soldiers move down from the hell above to the hell beneath is very important the soldiers go through their final battle of life and death love and heroism.

The existence of the three groups of people in this putrid setting is like a descent into the darkest depths of the human soul.This was the second installment of Wajda's War Trilogy after A Generation and before Ashes and Diamonds. All three serve to not only show the horrors of the Nazi occupation of Poland but also show how the people push through even in the most desperate situations. In an interview Wajda noted that the scene where Daisy and Korab find the bars represents the time that the Soviet army presumably across the river was approaching Warsaw but waited for the Nazis to actually depart the city so that it would be easier to take. The movie is as much an indictment of Stalinism as it is of Nazism.Anyway it's definitely a great one. I recommend it.".

Having not grown up in India it's not surprising that I only began watching Indian films in the last 10 years or so. That's because they just weren't readily available here in the States. But because so many wonderful films are made in India it's not surprising that sooner or later they'd make their way over here.Veer Pratap Singh is the beloved lord of his town. As the film begins the townspeople are having a HUGE party to celebrate the lord's birthday and to thank him for his benevolence. However a young man interrupts the party and announces that Singh is a tyrant. At first you think the guy might just be a nut as EVERYONE loves the lord. However as the film progresses you see more and more signs that the master of the town is indeed a total jerkfaceand not only is a crook and liar but he mocks the gods. And again and again you think as you watch 'this guy is gonna get his real soon....but it sure takes a while. In the meantime the hatred of the wicked lord has spread slowly and only five men one woman who the lord has impregnated and an odd character who is a mystical brother of Singh stand up against them. What's to happen? See the film.I enjoyed watching Hum Paanch very muchit kept my attention from start to finish. However at the same time I can understand its very ordinary current rating of 6.0 as the film has a couple problems compared to the more modern Indian films I have seen. The most obvious is when the characters sing. Compared to the more modern Indian films the sound quality is horrible and sounds literally like they are singing into tin cans! It sounds very fake and there isn't a lot to enjoy about these interludes. Normally I really LIKE the songshere in Hum Paanch I didn't. Second the story took way too long to resolve itself. While you knew what must happen in the end this ending just took too long and had too many diversions. Now I know that at a little under three hours Hum Paanch is actually shorter than most Indian films today but in most of these longer ones I've seen the film maintains its momentum. Here it dragged a bit. Enjoyable but far from a mustsee.".

Angelique marquise des anges  Translated as Angelique the marquise of angels aka Angelika Markyza Andelu is the first of a five part historical epic and might be considered to be the best of the series. The entire saga is about 10 hours long so it's close to impossible to summarize the plot in one sitting however you can take my word for it  This one is really worth it. Although historic and a classic period piece this is NOT your typical Jane Austen style. While based on a novel and set in 17th century France this really does have it all. There is politics intrigue royal scandals murder betrayal blackmail torture Satan worship and rape. However in the word's of Baz Luhrman it's about FREEDOM BEAUTY TRUTH and above all LOVE. Move over Romeo  Juliet Angeligue and Jofrey de Peyrac are timeless lovers with what the French call a certain ... I don't know what. The character of Angelique herself is unlike much we have seen in modern cinema. Not really categorized as a chic flick nor does it promote feminism in a in your face kind of way but take my word for it  This is one tough broad. Being blessedcursed with flawless beauty the woman has been to hell and back but she just keeps on going. You cannot beat her. And those who have tried have failed. For interest this splendid story has recently been turned into a magnificent musical adaptation here in Prague. Naturally I have seen it  Breathtaking. So to sum up if you can find it make the effort  It's different. Michelle Mercier  You go girl. Think of Barbarella in a Baroque gown and without the vacant expression and the questionable visuals. The art directions and costumes are enough to take your breath away. Oh I must mention this. The fact that this film was not honored with an Oscar for its musical score is just ridiculous. I can guarantee you this film has the most magnificent film music you have ever heard anywhere. As much I worship Jerry Goldsmith John Williams James Horner Alan Silvestri or Hans Zimmer MICHEL MAGNES deserves to be immortalized for writing this score. See for yourselves and then let me know if I was right or if I was right. academyaward8293gmail.comVIVA France".

For me as for person who loved this drama story is hard to say much about movie and book cause i can say just its wonderful. One of most important thing is that its not only a love story.

	schema:headline " Quite enjoyable...";
	schema:reviewBody "I must admit at the outset that I have never read the Anglique books so I cannot compare this movie to the original character in the Anne and Serge Golon stories. My review is simply that of an American who knew nothing about the films and watched Anglique Marquise Des Anges because one of my students is French and she said these movies are her favorites. Well after seeing this first film I can see why. The film was quite adventurous and romanticexactly the sort of film a teenage girl would probably enjoy. Once I have seen the other four films in the series I will post reviews for them as well.The film begins with the vivacious Anglique innocently running about the countryside with her sweetheart. However you soon learn that Anglique is an aristocrat and the young man is just a poor peasant and their love is doomed. In fact soon after the film begins the girl is married to one of the richest men in France and she has very little to say about this arranged marriage.At this point in the film in some ways you like Anglique and in some ways you don't. She is sweet and bravehaving saved the king's life by stealing poison meant for the royal family. On the other though she is rather immature and can't stand her new husband because she is disfigured as a result of his many adventures. While he is a very good and amazing man all she can see are his huge facial scars and limp. As for this Marquis he is really coolsort of an action hero and adventurer. Believe it or not he's like a 17th century version of 'Buckaroo Bonzai' or 'Baron Munchausen' without the lying and actually having lived these adventures. Fortunately over time she learns to love the man underneath and you see her grow as a character. Heck I too thought he was a terrific guy.Their now ideal lives are interrupted now by the kingwho in this film is seen as a rather cruel and scheming man not far from the true Louis XIV. Anglique's husband is imprison on trumped up charges of witchcraft and you eventually learn that the poor Marquis is being persecuted in order to get to his sweet wife. Despite this Anglique tries her best to get her husband released from prisononly to nearly get killed in the process herself. In the end it looks like both Anglique and her beloved are going to die. However given that there are four more films in the series you know that somehow it works outthough NOT the way I expected!! Though sad I liked the twists at the endsome may not.The film has a lot going for it. There is a nice blend of romance adventure action and intrigue. All are nicely done and the film definitely keeps your attention. Michle Mercier is excellent as the title character and she is definitely a tremendous beauty but also did a nice job of acting. I have very few complaints about the film though because of the nudity a lot by 1964 standards not much by today's it probably isn't a film for young audiences.Overall a wellmade and quite enjoyable film. I can't wait to see the next one in the series.".

After some time of peace and happiness coming events cast their dark shadows before. The Holy Inquisition mistrusts Peyrac's scientific experiments and the couple also makes enemies at the King's court. Peyrac is accused of sorcery. Can Angelique do anything to save him at the trial?Classic costume drama which spawned no less than 4 sequels though none of them exceeded the qualities of the first part. One reason for its success is most likely that it had a female lead character whereas other movies of the genre from Robin Hood to the 3 Musketeers usually had male stars. With a good deal of love story added it appealed a lot more to a female audience in the 1960s but the action scenes are also well paced and directed. I voted 86766 for the 5 movies of the series.".

To all fans of the Angelique films I pose this question There was during the Seventies a French TV show based on this character. I cannot track it down as all my efforts boomerang towards the Michelle Mercier movies and the Anne Golan novels. I distinctly remember that while Angelique was being auctioned off at the slave market there was this heinous auctioneer and a big burly guy was banging a drum. Now I have thoroughly watched my Angelique DVDs and this scene does not appear so it is not as if I am confused by some reedited TV version. No it was a TV series which I saw dubbed into Afrikaans South African Dutch  during the early Eighties there was something like a shortlived New Adventures of Angelique French TV series. My lament is that I do not know the titles of these or the names of actresses sweet nothing! I doubt if I could find them on DVD anyway but first order of business is to track down their specifics. Anybody out there who can help?Oh and the movie this site is about? My apologies for being a bit offtrack here as I'm just barging in with a related question but speaking for the entire series of movies as a whole it is quite something else. Controversial to the extreme there are obviously people who wouldn't want to even hear about it yet the majority of the fan base is bound to be women who would clearly see the slave market nudity and the sexual scenes in the proper context. This is the original bodiceripper saga and many a young girl of yesteryear remember it fondly. And not just in France. Please try to leave your helpful info on the site.".

Of course not all can be according to the book but that is a minor set back in this historical drama. Michele is wonderful but her acing skill is poorer than the others and Robert as a Joffrey de Peyrac is great. I must admit that Joffrey is one of my favorite male fictional characters and had shed tears learning he was killed which of course was not true.

That same year Hogwarts is hosting 'The Triwizard Tournament' a magical tournament between three wellknown schools of magic  Hogwarts Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. The contestants have to be above the age of 17 and are chosen by a magical object called Goblet of Fire. On the night of selection however the Goblet spews out four names instead of the usual three with Harry unwittingly being selected as the Fourth Champion.

	schema:headline " They got Dumbledore all WRONG!! and lots of other stuff too";
	schema:reviewBody "First the good news  The special effects and the music in the this movie were the best yet! The underwater scenes especially were very well done. The thing I disliked most about the movie is that Albus Dumbledore is not portrayed as the calm wise old wizard he is in the books. Instead he is portrayed as a stormy confused old man that doesn't have much of a clue what's going on. The character of Dumbledore is just WAY off. In one scene Dumbledore grabs Harry around the neck and shakes him what's THAT about? The very thought of Albus Dumbledore being physically violent with a student is Absolutely ABSURD!! THATS NOT IN DUMBLEDORE'S CHARACTER!! Real Harry Potter fans all over are going to be outraged by this portrayal of Dumbledore. That pretty much ruined the movie for me. Another thing I didn't like about this movie was that so much of the real story was left out andor changed. I guess i'm just spoiled because I'm so attached to the books... I know it's impossible to fit that whole story in a 2 12 hour movie but there was some pretty good stuff that was left out.If you're interested Some of the things that weren't included in the movie that stuck out in my mind areThe scene where Dudley eats the tontongue coffee and has an enlarged tongue. The Dursley's aren't included in this one at all.Weasley's Wizard Weezes are not mentionedThe character Ludo Bagman is left out altogetherWinky isn't in the movieS.P.E.W Society for the Protection of Elfish Welfare the Elfrights activist group formed by Hermione is left out altogether. And i thought this added a lot to the story throughout the bookHagrid's humiliation at being exposed as a Halfgiant is left out and so of course is Harry Ron and Hermione coming to comfort himno BlastEnded ScrewtsHermione never catches Rita Skeeter in her animagus form a beetle as she does in the bookThe scene in which Draco Malfoy is attacked on the train near the end isn't in the movieThe money Harry wins from the tournament and gives to Fred and George to go toward starting their joke shop is left outThe discussion with Fudge about Voldemort's return and his refusal to accept it is left out. I don't know how they're going to reconcile this one because Fudge's refusal to accept Voldemort is crucial in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.Sirius coming to Hogwarts to see Harry after the Third Task is left outI'm still ticked off about Dumbledore... I'm starting to think that the people who make the movies just don't even read the books because Dumbledore was SO out of character it made me angry. That bothers me more than anything else. I wouldn't rush to see this movie wait until it comes out on DVD. Besides the good special effects and music the movie was really bad. I Hope this review has been helpful.".

In one scene Dumbledore grabs Harry around the neck and shakes him what's THAT about? The very thought of Albus Dumbledore being physically violent with a student is Absolutely ABSURD!! THATS NOT IN DUMBLEDORE'S CHARACTER!! Real Harry Potter fans all over are going to be outraged by this portrayal of Dumbledore. That pretty much ruined the movie for me. Another thing I didn't like about this movie was that so much of the real story was left out andor changed. I guess i'm just spoiled because I'm so attached to the books... I know it's impossible to fit that whole story in a 2 12 hour movie but there was some pretty good stuff that was left out.If you're interested Some of the things that weren't included in the movie that stuck out in my mind areThe scene where Dudley eats the tontongue coffee and has an enlarged tongue. The Dursley's aren't included in this one at all.Weasley's Wizard Weezes are not mentionedThe character Ludo Bagman is left out altogetherWinky isn't in the movieS.P.E.W Society for the Protection of Elfish Welfare the Elfrights activist group formed by Hermione is left out altogether. And i thought this added a lot to the story throughout the bookHagrid's humiliation at being exposed as a Halfgiant is left out and so of course is Harry Ron and Hermione coming to comfort himno BlastEnded ScrewtsHermione never catches Rita Skeeter in her animagus form a beetle as she does in the bookThe scene in which Draco Malfoy is attacked on the train near the end isn't in the movieThe money Harry wins from the tournament and gives to Fred and George to go toward starting their joke shop is left outThe discussion with Fudge about Voldemort's return and his refusal to accept it is left out. I don't know how they're going to reconcile this one because Fudge's refusal to accept Voldemort is crucial in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.Sirius coming to Hogwarts to see Harry after the Third Task is left outI'm still ticked off about Dumbledore... I'm starting to think that the people who make the movies just don't even read the books because Dumbledore was SO out of character it made me angry. That bothers me more than anything else. I wouldn't rush to see this movie wait until it comes out on DVD. Besides the good special effects and music the movie was really bad. I Hope this review has been helpful.";

	schema:reviewBody "The movie ran as if it were a series of highlight clips from an actual film representation of the fourth harry potter novel. Details were thrown in haphazardly if for no other reason than to bring a feeling of recognition from readers. If the viewer had not read the book but only seen the previous two movies she would not have understood the movie. The screenwriters created no semblance complicated plot but rather the rather singleminded story of the three tasks in the triwizard tournament. All new characters were hardly introduced and remained quite onedimensional which is unfortunate even old favorites got the shaft in this one. There was no time for more than two short scenes with either Malfoy no magical lessons and Dobby the house elf was completely absent. Crouch never disappeared but his body was found dead. The cinematics in this case were atrocious Harry appears in Dumbledore's chambers in the scene immediately after discovering Crouch's body but then proceeds to tell him about his scar hurting and dreams rather than Crouch's discovery. There was no magical map no latenight encounters with Moody no discussion of Snape and Karkaroff's relationship nor of Dumbledore trusting Snape. Seeing as this relationship will rise to be the single most prominent issue in the entire series I was very disappointed to find it was ignored in favor of large and ineffective theatrics such as a hedge maze without any traps only shifting walls and evil roots an extremely obnoxious modernized yule ball and a pointlessly drawn out dragon chase scene. Dumbledore's lines and the directing of his acting made him look like an old bumbling fool rather than the clever mostpowerfulwizard on the planet the only person of whom Voldemort is afraid. The writers decided to add Crouch Jr. into Harry's dreams completely removed the second houseelf and the invisibility cloak from the quidditch world cup and had the audacity to explain that Crouch Jr. had been sent to Azkaban but never explained his escape. Finally the movie ended with Crouch Jr. being sent back to Azkaban. The Minister of Magic never showed up with dementors to kill Crouch Dumbledore never argued with him about the verity of Harry's claims and the potential for an amazing cliffhanger conclusion with Dumbledore in all his might giving orders to Hagrid and others as a general before the final battle was instead replaced by a horrible attempt at a eulogy combining direct quotations from the novel with poor scriptwriting to make Dumbledore out to be a poor speaker as well as incompetent wizard. I shudder to think how the next movie will have to deal with all of these plot gaps and how Dumbledore can hope to maintain any semblance of respectability when he trusts Snape and continues to avoid Harry in the fifth movie. Much better would have been to stick with the original idea and make two movies. This movie didn't feel like it had any plot one did not become attached to the characters and spent the movie groaning or laughing at the contrived immaturity of it all. Some acting by Harry and friends was good but it was overshadowed by a terrible attempt to fit everything and nothing into the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before I review the film let me start off by saying that I am a fan of the Harry Potter films and have liked all of them up to this point. I'm not going to compare the movie to the book because as most people know they are two completely different animals. There is no way in heaven hell or on God's green Earth that a book the size of Goblet of Fire could appropriate EVERYTHING that happened in the novel. I'm going to go by what I saw up on the screen.What I saw up on the screen was a completely pedestrian effort that made no attempt at contributing style substance or character development to a series that was getting better and better with each progressive film. Scenes start and stop with no explanation. The big action scenes especially the fight with the dragon just begin with no buildup whatsoever almost as if you've stumbled upon someone playing the new Harry Potter video game. There is no sense of the passage of time at all. The TriWizard tournament consists of only three challenges yet the competition seems to last the entire school year. Ron and Hermione have a blowup at the Yule Ball because of his misplaced jealousy yet six months go by the last day of school and NOTHING MORE is ever said about it? She even tells him that he made a mistake by not asking her out and he lets SIX MORE MONTHS go by without saying a word?!I can forgive the fact that a lot of these things are just glossed over because of the time crunch but I can not forgive situation after situation that has something happen only because the lead character needs to live. In the aforementioned fight with the dragon Harry ends up hanging from a ledge 100 stories above the ground trying to reach his broom which is nearby. The dragon lands on the building and begins crawling down to him slipping and sliding peeling away shingles as it goes and it suddenly hit me. Harry is hanging from a ledge defenseless and the dragon is CRAWLING toward him. He is dealing with a creature who spits fire and who can FLY. One flap of its wings and a quick belch and Harry is crispy. The ONLY reason it doesn't is because Harry has to live. And for that matter no one in the film acts or reacts to a situation because it's in their nature to do so. They react in a certain way because that's what the script demands that they do even if it completely goes against their character and everything that we know about them. When Hermione blows up at Ron it seems to come out of nowhere. She seems to be mad because Ron didn't ask her and she wanted to go with him. But if this is true why is she so happy about being there with a competitor from a rival school? And I don't just mean happy I mean she is absolutely BEAMING when she arrives with him. And at one point Dumbledore grabs Harry and shakes him violently demanding that he answer a question. My reaction to that was WTF??? Has Dumbledore ever shown that he's a violent person or that he would grab a STUDENT yelling in his face? Of course not but he does it because the script says he has to. At one point in the film a particular curse is brought up that allows you to control another being. That's kind of funny because it seems like every character in this film is being controlled by the screenplay even if it means going completely against character.But I guess the biggest disappointment for me was the confrontation between Harry and Voldemort. For someone who has been built up to be the devil he sure is beaten easily at the end of this film and by a quartet of ghosts no less which took cheesiness to a new level. The appearance of Voldemort is obviously supposed to be chilling but in actuality he looks like a hairless rat wearing a cape. The great Ralph Fiennes does everything he can but part of the appeal of this character is NOT seeing him in closeup in full daylight. He shows up when he wants and manages to let Harry live because he'd rather talk him to death instead of just cutting off his head while Harry is pinned down. But of course that's because Harry has to live and this final confrontation again seems ridiculous in retrospect.The entire TriWizard tournament seemed a little offkilter to me. You perform tasks that test your abilities and try to do better than your opponents but to what end? The final test consists of entering an everchanging maze and the first competitor to find the trophy wins the tournament. So even if you finish DEAD LAST in every other challenge if you're the first to find the trophy you win anyway. So I ask you WHAT'S THE FRIGGIN' POINT OF EVEN COMPETING IN THE OTHER CHALLENGES?????? Why put yourself in harm's way three times when you only HAVE to do it once? Looking back I just realized that you could completely skip this film and move right on to number five without missing a beat as long as you had someone to tell you two things about the film  Harry's interest in Cho and Voldemort being back sort of. Here's hoping Order of the Phoenix doesn't follow the same path.".

Perhaps Alphonso Curon would have done a better job of cohesion but there really isn't much more that could have been done in the time and the script would have been essentially the same.

	schema:reviewBody "I have to say I'm really disappointed in how this film turned out especially in comparison with how great the book is. In my humble opinion studios have to face up to the fact that two and a half hours is no longer sufficient to capture the scope and power of J.K. Rowling's universe.In this film Harry is forced to enter the Triwizard Tournament when someone unknown puts his name into the Goblet of Fire a magical artifact that serves as the selector of competitors from each participating school. The special effects as always are spectacular but they seem to be a cover for a lack of effort not the results of a work of love.All of the highlights of the book are shown the Quidditch World Cup Harry's battle with the dragon the underwater world of the merpeople and the enchanted hedge maze are all done in exquisite detail. But this only seems to point up the movie's shortfalls. Michael Gambon has none of Richard Harris' quiet dignity or unflappable demeanor as Dumbledore instead he seems to jump at every shadow and constantly be lost in the situation. The worst example of this is when he almost tackles Harry and desperately interrogates him on whether he put his name in the Goblet of Fire.The movie skips from one event to the next with very little shown of the intervening time action is held up as a replacement for character development and plot. Draco Malfoy the cruel bully everyone loves to hate is only shown twice through the whole film. MadEye Moody beautifully portrayed by Brendan Gleeson is given little to do other than push Harry along. Nothing is explained of the backstory between Barty Crouch and his son nor of Snape's past or what Dumbledore intends to do in the face of Voldemort's return.Along that line Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of Lord Voldemort suffers in much the same way Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore does. Instead of the patient cunning Dark Lord I'd come to expect from the first two movies he is easily angered and has no control of his emotions or reactions much less the situation. The scene should look hopeless but it is obvious right from the start that Harry is more than Voldemort's equal. In the same scene Timothy Spall seems almost bored in his portrayal of Wormtail reacting to the loss of his hand with as little pain or emotion as one would scratching an itch. He literally doesn't seem to feel it.I could go on but I think I've made my point. Don't go expecting the magic of the first three films it's gone and only a severe rearrangement of cast director and editor will bring it back if this franchise hopes to survive. If you must see it in a theater and for all its faults I recommend doing that at least once see it in a matine or better yet wait until it's in a dollar theater.".

	schema:headline " Good though rushed";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on one of the best books of the Harry Potter series the film adaptation of 'Harry Potter and the Goblet' had a lot to live up to and I think it succeeded. As Potter fans will know in GoF Harry is now fourteen and in his Fourth Year at Hogwarts. When an ancient tournament between Hogwarts and two other European wizarding schools is held that year a Seventh Year contestant is chosen from each school to compete but things go dramatically awry when Harry three years too young to even be entered in the dangerous and challenging tournament is somehow also chosen after his name is mysteriously nominated. GoF is a sharp turning point in the books as the tone darkens considerably and the characters themselves change from being rather wideeyed innocent children to adolescents thrust the turbulent uncertain adult world where being 'good' or even an innocent will not guarantee your survival. This shift is also reflected in the film which was rated 12A PG13 for Americans the first of the HP films to be rated so high.I have to say I did enjoy this film although Prisoner of Azkaban remains my favourite of the four. Unlike the first two films this did not attempt to condescend as much to small children in the audience. The tasks of the Triwizard tournament captured most of the thrills of the book particularly the second waterbased task where the merpeople were suitably creepy now we know why none of the kids go swimming in the summer term! but the first task overran for a minute or two more than needed. Light romance was touched upon yet wasn't overemphasised and the Yule Ball will please those who enjoyed the scenes in the book but audience members over the age of sixteen might find teens ogling each other a tad dull Hermione is very outofcharacter and the scene does drag.The acting of the adult cast is of course exemplary as always. Alan Rickman's Snape may only have had four or so scenes but he definitely made his presences known while Maggie Smith really captured the essence of McGonagall. Many people do miss Richard Harris' Dumbledore but I found that Michael Gambon has done an excellent job of moulding the role to make it his own. In GoF Dumbledore feels very human in the way he carries the weight of the wizarding world on his shoulders and though he struggles at times his concern for his pupils is paramount. I finally felt the close rapport between Dumbledore and Harry in this film that was missing in the previous three HP flicks. However the prize has to go to Brendan Gleeson for his scenestealing depiction of MadEye Moody. Gleeson clearly enjoyed illustrating Moody's dangerous feral edge.The younger cast have also grown into their roles improving from their previous outing. Rupert Grint usually used to playing a comical and stupid Ron had the chance to cut his acting teeth and show Ron's darker bitter side and he did well. The Phelp twins have also improved dramatically. No longer do they come across as wooden cutouts just reading from a cuecard and instead they are able to show the mischievous spontaneity of the Weasley twins. And I look forward to seeing more of Matthew Lewis who was great at showing Neville's sensitive side without making him too klutzy. Out of the younger cast though Dan Radcliffe is the one who has progressed the most. In PoA he was awful in the 'he was their friend' scene so he seems like another boy in the harrowing graveyard scene and the aftermath depicting Harry's anger feelings of vulnerability and grief. He still stumbled on occasion in other scenes but I at last have faith he might be able to do the Harry of 'Order of the Phoenix' justice when the time comes.The film did lose points on a few issues. Although most of the young cast have expanded their acting skills as they have gone on Emma Watson is waning. She has a tendency of overenunciating her lines and being too melodramatic which worked in 'The Philosopher's Stone' when Hermione was condescending and childishly bossy but is just annoying by this point. She spent most of the film sounding as if she was on the verge of tears or in a hormonal snit even in scenes which were not remotely sad or upsetting. There was also a choppy feel to the film as if Steve Kloves struggled to properly condense the book into a twohour film. Those who haven't read the books will have missed quite a bit and those who have read the books will feel the film is very rushed. Molly Weasley and the Dursleys were also missed especially since I think Julie Walters would have been exceptional in the MollyHarry interactions that take place aftermath of the graveyard scenes of the novel as the film didn't round off in a manner that reflected a boy had died and Harry would be traumatised by what he saw.I think most Potter fans will enjoy this although they will remark that it could have been better. Nonfans will also get something from this film as I imagine it is hard not to be captivated by the many action and dramatic events but they may find themselves muddled by the story. I would recommend that parents of young children either keep away or at the very least check out the film firstly before deciding if their child is old enough to cope with it. When I went to see it there was a small lad of four or five being dragged along and in the middle of a particularly fearsome incident the silence of the moment was cut by a wee voice crying 'Mummy I'm scared' so parents be warned.".

	onyx:emotionText "Based on one of the best books of the Harry Potter series the film adaptation of 'Harry Potter and the Goblet' had a lot to live up to and I think it succeeded. As Potter fans will know in GoF Harry is now fourteen and in his Fourth Year at Hogwarts. When an ancient tournament between Hogwarts and two other European wizarding schools is held that year a Seventh Year contestant is chosen from each school to compete but things go dramatically awry when Harry three years too young to even be entered in the dangerous and challenging tournament is somehow also chosen after his name is mysteriously nominated. GoF is a sharp turning point in the books as the tone darkens considerably and the characters themselves change from being rather wideeyed innocent children to adolescents thrust the turbulent uncertain adult world where being 'good' or even an innocent will not guarantee your survival. This shift is also reflected in the film which was rated 12A PG13 for Americans the first of the HP films to be rated so high.I have to say I did enjoy this film although Prisoner of Azkaban remains my favourite of the four. Unlike the first two films this did not attempt to condescend as much to small children in the audience. The tasks of the Triwizard tournament captured most of the thrills of the book particularly the second waterbased task where the merpeople were suitably creepy now we know why none of the kids go swimming in the summer term! but the first task overran for a minute or two more than needed. Light romance was touched upon yet wasn't overemphasised and the Yule Ball will please those who enjoyed the scenes in the book but audience members over the age of sixteen might find teens ogling each other a tad dull Hermione is very outofcharacter and the scene does drag.The acting of the adult cast is of course exemplary as always. Alan Rickman's Snape may only have had four or so scenes but he definitely made his presences known while Maggie Smith really captured the essence of McGonagall. Many people do miss Richard Harris' Dumbledore but I found that Michael Gambon has done an excellent job of moulding the role to make it his own. In GoF Dumbledore feels very human in the way he carries the weight of the wizarding world on his shoulders and though he struggles at times his concern for his pupils is paramount. I finally felt the close rapport between Dumbledore and Harry in this film that was missing in the previous three HP flicks. However the prize has to go to Brendan Gleeson for his scenestealing depiction of MadEye Moody. Gleeson clearly enjoyed illustrating Moody's dangerous feral edge.The younger cast have also grown into their roles improving from their previous outing. Rupert Grint usually used to playing a comical and stupid Ron had the chance to cut his acting teeth and show Ron's darker bitter side and he did well. The Phelp twins have also improved dramatically. No longer do they come across as wooden cutouts just reading from a cuecard and instead they are able to show the mischievous spontaneity of the Weasley twins. And I look forward to seeing more of Matthew Lewis who was great at showing Neville's sensitive side without making him too klutzy.

	schema:reviewBody "There are a lot of things wrong with this movie and the part that's really wrong are the characters. 1000 words aren't enough to explain everything so I'll have to be brief. The worst character is Dumbledore. What version of him Kloves  Newell see I have no idea.. I mean have they read the books at all? Would Albus Dumbledore one of the greatest wizards alive manhandle one of his own students especially his favorite student? I should think not. Would he use Harry as bait to lure Voldemort out of hiding? Same answer as above NO. Gambon can't play him to save his life Richard Harris could he had the twinkle in his eyes... something that makes Dumbledore so special. Gambon just comes off as a lunatic.If it isn't broken why change it? So why change the first task? Why is Harry getting attacked by the dragon as soon as he leaves the tent? In the book he get's on his Firebolt first... he doesn't run around and almost die for 5 minutes. But then finally he's in the air and I thought they'd stick to what's in the book but no. There is a chain instead of the dragon being a nesting mother protecting its eggs. Instead of Harry luring the dragon to get airborne by gently guiding it upwards teasing it tempting it we get this chain that breaks What happened to the new security measures? and a stupid dragon that forgets it can fly and has to climb instead.The second task. This is where a part of me died inside. When Harry get's pushed in by Moody and doesn't resurface at once Neville goes South Park. Oh my god I killed Harry Potter!. I'm sorry but Kloves Newell or just about ANYONE involved in the making of this movie how on earth could you let him say that! South Park quotes although hilarious and one of my absolute favorite shows of all time has no right to be in a HP movie! Didn't you think we'd notice!? exhale calm down The third task. What happened to the Sphinx? What about the Acromantula we do know they exist thanks to Chris Columbus why couldn't Harry help Cedric out there instead? So you skipped the BlastEnded Screwts but you could have at least given us one of the other two...The graveyard. This scene is very right and very wrong at the same time. Wormtail Who was just awful in PoA is just as bad here and what is wrong with the other Death Eaters? Wormtail including the others are terrified that Voldemort is actually back! One of them flings himself onto the ground crawling towards Voldemort while begging for forgiveness and kissing his robes and get's tortured in the book. I think Ralph does a good job of Voldemort since the make up or whatever they used makes it hard for him to really use his face which is basically the real problem. Where are those red slits for eyes? They're what really makes him creepy in the book... but then again Yes Kloves  Newell I'm pointing at you where is his thirst for repayment of his 13 lost years? I didn't see it at all. There is also a BIG problem with the name Voldemort. It is said out loud at the QWC after the Death Eaters have had a go at the tents but no one shudders? They don't even use YouKnowWho they actually say Voldemort? Where's the gasps when Dumbledore says Voldemort in front of the whole school? This is something established so early in the series did you actually forget it?Why is Harry wearing the newest Levis jeans... what happened to him wearing Dudleys old castoffs? Perhaps Hermione has done some shopping for him since she apparently has taken a liking to pink clothes.. what was wrong with the blue dress she had in the book? Is blue a more expensive color to make a dress in or something? Or is it because we have to see her girlie side in GoF? First you took her bushy hair... now the pink dress.. I don't even want to know what's going to happen to her in Order of the Phoenix. Also who the hell was Nigel? Why not use Colin or Dennis Creevey? They're already established characters for gods sake! What happened to Filch? When did he stop being bitter evil and quite frankly a real bastard? He's the caretaker that wants to whip students hang them from their ankles in the dungeons dammit not some idiot jumping around and firing off cannons... and why on earth is McGonagall teaching them how to dance? Would she order a student to place his hand on her waist? I don't think so... even if you haven't read the books you must have noticed that she'd never do that.I think the only good thing about this whole movie was Ginny. She showed me that she can act She just didn't get much screen time in Chamber of Secrets even if she was very promising that she's sweet and has a temper! Finally a character that's actually working! Although I really did miss the moment where Ron suggests that she can go with Harry to the YuleBall. Sure there's action there's cool special effects but it's just not what the STORY is about and the story is what makes Harry Potter special something more then your regular Hollywood script action movie. It just like PoA get's an extremely well deserved 1.".

I must say that I think that the fourth book is perhaps the weakest in the series but it is still a good read. The movie however was by far the worst yet. So many important details were left out the movie raced along trying to fit as much plot into two and a half hours as possible. Of course there was excitement funny momentsand talented acting. But overall the plot moved so quickly that one barely felt any connection to the characters involved other than what has been built up from the last three movies and the book. The Yule Ball was ridiculous and Hermione Emma Watson was overly dramatic. The challenges in the TriWizard Tournament were rushed through and the other competitors characters were not built up. You barely know yet alone feel anything about Viktor Krum Fleur or even Cedric Diggory. The special effects were great but could not make up for the loss of the magic felt in the books and other movies. The final scene with Voldemort was welldone. Scary suspenseful exciting. But I must say I will not be seeing this movie again in the theaters as I have the last three.".

The acting of the trio was well above what it has been previously. Especially in the case of Emma Watson who was initially terrible but has improved with each movie. Bravo i say! Rupert Grint is always a joy to watch. he really is Ron Wealsey for me despite that fact that hes the same height as Radcliffe. speaking of Radcliffe i was exceptionally impressed! he was brilliant for the most part but especially during the scenes with Voldemort in the grave yard and when he returned to Hogwarts. However credit given to those i have to say that Alan Rickman as Snape is the best! This isn't just because he is my favourite character but i genuinely thought that he was brilliant particularly during the scene when Harry and Ron keep talking. dumbledore on the other hand was atrocious. I'm afraid this is where my commentary moves onto slaughtering the adaption.Since when exactly has Dumbledore ever lost control and shaken Harry. If this is how he reacts to harry's name being entered what the hell is he going to do when Harry destroys his office in The Order of the Pheonix. Michael Gambon may be a fine actor but he just isn't Dumbledore.and is it me or did the film lack certain key elements that made the book? such as the fact that Harry has a parent figure now? when the Thing with Sirius happens in OOTP the audience wont know anything about him. And the scene with the Dursleys at the beginning was one of the best in the book! I understand that for the obvious reasons such as time management certain elements have to be omitted but this really did take the biscuit. Why alter scenes which arnt vital to the book such as the way that the first task played out and then cut what makes the books great. The two things that really wound me up were the way that Sirius appeared in the fire why the hell they did it like that ill never understand and the change in who gave Harry the Gillyweed. Those changed really were pointless.When viewed as a movie in its own right the Goblet of Fire is as enjoyable thrilling and down right scary as the book is but as an adaption to be quite honest it was a let down.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the worst conversion of book to screenplay in the whole series. From the first scene where there are characters in the movie scene that are not in the book scene to added scenes in the storyline to radically changed scenes in the triwizard trials this screenplay bares only a passing resemblance to the book. The book was fine and had plenty of drama and excitement at the needed times. there was no need to rewrite the story only trim it down for runtime.I was very disappointed watching this and surprised to see that it was the same screenwriter as the first three films since this was of such substantially lower quality.And the director completely wasted Brendan Gleeson as Moody. This is an incredibly talented actor and should have been an anchor of the movie. instead he's almost nothing like the character in the book even going as far as substituting a metal leg for the wood one. he's practically a footnote to the whole movie.And the final showdown in the graveyard felt incredibly rushed. there's been four movies and 1500 pages of book building to this scene the scene were everyone finally sees Voldemort in the flesh and watches him duel with Harry. this should have been a powerful climax yet is over almost as soon as it's begun.bottom line get a new director and a new screenwriter for the next one. if the climax at the Ministry of Magic is as bad as the climax of this movie the series will lose a lot of fans.".

From the first scene where there are characters in the movie scene that are not in the book scene to added scenes in the storyline to radically changed scenes in the triwizard trials this screenplay bares only a passing resemblance to the book. The book was fine and had plenty of drama and excitement at the needed times. there was no need to rewrite the story only trim it down for runtime.I was very disappointed watching this and surprised to see that it was the same screenwriter as the first three films since this was of such substantially lower quality.And the director completely wasted Brendan Gleeson as Moody. This is an incredibly talented actor and should have been an anchor of the movie. instead he's almost nothing like the character in the book even going as far as substituting a metal leg for the wood one. he's practically a footnote to the whole movie.And the final showdown in the graveyard felt incredibly rushed. there's been four movies and 1500 pages of book building to this scene the scene were everyone finally sees Voldemort in the flesh and watches him duel with Harry. this should have been a powerful climax yet is over almost as soon as it's begun.bottom line get a new director and a new screenwriter for the next one. if the climax at the Ministry of Magic is as bad as the climax of this movie the series will lose a lot of fans.";

	schema:reviewBody "At the time this film came out I was convinced that it indicated that the longer the Harry Potter book the worse the film. Now with Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix out I am relieved that this isn't the case  instead I now fully comprehend how thoroughly bad this picture is.It starts out good enough with a dark scary and well directed scene where Voldemort feels immensely more menacing than he is at the end of the film. Then we cut to our beloved protagonist squirming in his bed at the Dursl no wait a minute that's the Burrow! Damn I think Newell weaselled no pun intended me out of seeing my favourite nasty relatives. Oh well at least I'll get to enjoy the weirdness of the Weasley home for a whil no strike that apparently they're heading straight to the Quidditch World Cup.I think you see The Goblet of Fire's main flaw. It lies not in the acting as usual carried out by Britain's finest nor I don't think in the screen writing as Mr. Steve Kloves acquitted himself well enough in the three previous outings. No  it's the directing. It's as if firsttimer Mike Newell weighed the sevenhundred page book in his hand and said to himself oh how will I ever fit all this into one film?. The film jumps at a maddening jerky pace that makes you want to cry out but I wanted to see that! Case in point Harry and the Weasleys barely have the time to find their seats at the Stadium before the game's over and we're inside their tent again. Mind you I wasn't exactly a fan of the Quidditch game in the book but at least a glimpse of it  a teensy little montage? A minute of Death Eaterinduced panic later and we're on the Hogwarts Express. Half a second of Cho Chang later and we're at Hogwarts seeing the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang schools arrive  apparently on the same day. What on earth they're doing there so early is anyone's guess since the Triwizard Tournament still doesn't seem to start until Halloween which would allow for nearly two months application time to the Goblet of Fire. And on it goes. The only really good scene apart from Hermione like all the women in the film acting like a frail damsel in distress in which the students have their first DADA lesson with MadEye Moody passes by all to quickly and then we're jumping and jerking about the plot again. Harry has a falling out with Ron signified by Rupert Grint dramatically lowering his eyebrows down to his cheek bones. Big deal. Harry kicks the living crap out of a dragon. Wow. Harry and Ron make up. Happy to hear it.And then suddenly Newell hits the brakes. The Four Weddings and a Funeral director sees in the Yule Ball semifamiliar ground and he seems intent to squeeze all the juice there is out of it. Harry and Ron talk about girls learn to dance and behave like unbelievable prats to both the Patil twins. Meanwhile Hermione strikes up a relationship with Viktor Krum Hagrid woos the plussize Madame Maxine and we are then treated to the musical stylings of a wizard rock band telling us to boogie down like a unicorn which the probably imperiused crowd subsequently does. It's all very cutesy all very nonPotterish. Hermione and Ron are especially egregious in this part of the movie  Harry just seems oddly vacant.The movie trudges along occasionally giving reason to hope only to quickly dash it again with a mindboggling jump. Finally we reach the ending where the maze is nowhere near as challenging as it was in the book and where Voldemort's rebirth is strangely anticlimactic and unfulfilling. Cedric Diggory dies impostor Moody is exposed Ron and Hermione exchange some glib remarks that trivialise the whole ending and that's the film.Now a lot of people like this film. Rotten Tomatoes ranks it higher than its successor Order of the Phoenix. This to me is inexplicable. Sure a lot of things have to be scrapped to fit any novel into a twohour movie. But a good adaptation such as Order of the Phoenix does that without you noticing it. Instead Goblet of Fire rather seems to be making a point out of making omissions glaringly obvious. Even nonPotterians would probably surmise that the book covered the Quidditch game even though the film didn't because the cut is made so quickly that Newell seems to hope that viewers will just think they dozed off during the game. Actually all it does is leave us with a nonsensical disjointed mess that will make you long for the comparative greatness of Chris Columbus. At least he knows how to do an establishing shot.".

Many things are left unexplained such as Neville's fear of the Cruciatus sp? curse and what exactly happens to Barty Crouch senior. Of course if you have read the book you know exactly what is going on but as an innocent moviegoer who has never even glanced in the books you are left wondering.

All houseelves are not mentioned at all. S.P.E.W. is gone though despite it being a interesting subject in the book it wasn't particularly important to the story. And it is Neville who gives Harry the gillyweed instead of Dobby. Of course that still works quite well as Neville is so good at Herbology. But did anyone think that Voldemort was far too jolly? Or is that just me? 'Oh Harry I'd almost forgotten you were there!' Can you honestly picture that coming from the great Dark Lord's mouth? There were many other examples during that scene it was extremely annoying. As for the Dark Mark appearing in the sky it comes too late. The tents are set on fire where are the people suspended in the sky? and everyone is running. Yes that's reason to be scared but surely the Dark Mark appearing is far better. So after everyone has left who should come along but Barty Crouch Jr. Then he fires the Dark Mark into the sky and the producer thinks 'Oh good. We've got that in the story people shouldn't complain.' Nope wrong. He fires it a bit too late. After EVERYONE has left he brings out what should have started the terror. How stupid. And it was also disappointing when they only made one comment that might suggest who won the World Cup. I'm Irish I would have been very pleased if they had made that a bit more apparent. While we're on the subject of Barty Crouch Jr. I will bring up that his character totally changed. Instead of being this sniveling scared young man who calls out to his father in desperation only to have Barty senior say You're no son of mine we have him as a weird explosive monster who comes up and licks his lips at his dad and is all Nyehehehe. Hello Father. The 'son of mine' line only works if you make Barty Jr. a proper terrified misunderstood boy. And Sirius. Gary Oldman makes no actual appearance how do we even know that it was him who was talking to Harry? And that was done horribly. Instead of Sirius's head appearing in the flames we have a grotesque thing that did not look anything like Sirius popping out of the embers. And also when Harry sends off his letter to Sirius at the beginning it is clearly marked on the front to go to Sirius Black. But how ridiculous! His letter could have been intercepted and then everyone would know that Sirius was somewhere nearby and that someone if they weren't one of the people who knew either Harry's handwriting or Harry's owl was in contact with him. But as for the acting and the special effects it was all fine.".

And I can say even with the fourth instalment the excitement is never reduced.Plot Harry Potter is selected by the Goblet of fire to compete in the Triwizard Tournament making him the youngest ever to compete much to the chagrin of everyone.Story and direction This is the first film in the series not to have the first scene at Privett Drive. I thought it was the right move considering the film has many things going on. During the first fifteen minutes or so the film feels quite fast paced. I didn't get the understanding as to what his happening. If the makers would have given a little importance to the beginning I guess the film would have worked wonders. But after those initial minutes I was totally engrossed in the movie. There were some new characters to look out for and I can say all of them impressed. Also some of the VFX work in this film is incredible especially the broom scenes which have greatly improved. With that being said I would add that the tournament scenes were well directed. There is always a sense of tension in the atmosphere during the scenes as you care for the safety of those characters. The film also brings another aspect of the trio's friendship into light which was very nicely handled. This is the first film also not to feature John Williams as score composer. But I can very well say that Patrick Doyle did a spectacular job as composer. The film do marks the very first appearance of Voldemort and I can say that he is terrifying. With his appearance and the buildup that has beenmade you can say that this man means business and also that he is ruthless and would harm just anyone who comes his way. Performances If I had to pinpoint I had to say that this was by far Daniel Radcliffe's best as Harry Potter. The emotional side had never been explored until this film as it was great. As for new characters Ralph Fiennes just nailed it as Voldemort. He just looks as the villain you predicted. Brendan Gleeson brings his charm to the screen and that just lights up the scene itself. Robert Pattinson also justifies his performance. Timothy Spall and David Tenant gave good support. As for rest of the cast always just do justice to their roles and never have they given me a single reason to complain.Favorite Scene It would be the Yule Ball scene where the boys after the initial dance just sit at one side and are jealous of Hermione seeing she is having a lot of fun unlike them. This very well depicts the teenagers who are at that age.Verdict Thanks to Mike Newell and Steve Kloves we have got another griping chapter to the series. Except for the first fifteen minutes I enjoyed the entire film.I am going with a 910.".

	schema:headline " Entertaining but too short and too many omissions";
	schema:reviewBody "What summed this film up for me was the comments of my nonHP book reader wife and friend. Didn't really understand it.The JKR books are full of tells and explanations with subplots taking on great significance later on. The book of Goblet of Fire is central to the denouement of many of these  and in the main they are left out of the film version in favour of action and CGI.That said it was not all bad so I'll highlight what I liked first! The teenagers' awkwardness as they explore their relationships and the way this was handled in the build up to and the actual Ball scene. Hermione in particular was well portrayed and Ron and Harry sitting like wallflowers while the rest of the school dance the night away was well done. The look on McGonagall's face when she sees Ron's dress robes  priceless. The Moaning Myrtle scene in the Prefect's bath is excellent funny and well acted. Mad Eye Moody was excellent convincing and menacing. The opening scene showing the splendour of the Quidditch stadium was breathtaking. The graveyard scenes at the end were well done and close to the book. Ralph Fiennes was excellent if a little too strong to be credible so soon after his rebirth.What did they do badly? Quite a lot actually. I realise how hard it must be to condense this long book into a 150 minute movie but overextended scenes could have been shortened and 20 minutes extra to cover some key current and future story lines would have been time and money well spent. Dumbledore is mad! What has Gambon done to him? Would Richard Harris have grabbed Harry by the neck and shaken him shouted at him? Would Harris be mumbling and doubting of his abilities such that there is now almost no credibility that Voldemort should ever fear him? No. And neither does the Dumbledore of JKR. No muggle taunting and no house elf in the Quidditch world cup scenes meaning no explanation of the purpose of the riot and burning of the tented village and no setup of Bartie Crouch Senior as a key character. No mention at all of SPEW. The dragon fight scene is ridiculously long and ridiculously expensive. Harry flies right out of the stadium chased by the Norwegian Horntail on a trip to demolish large parts of the castle roofing tiles. The dragon can fly for goodness sake  why would it spend 2 minutes climbing across rooftops to get to Harry when it could fly out and blast him from the air? The characterisation of the new characters is poor  Fleur Viktor and Cedric are all just cardboard cutouts for Harry to battle against. The omission of almost all the interaction between Harry and Sirius so crucial to the next two films. Make you wonder whether the film makers have actually read all the books. The absence of any reference to Hagrid's halfgiant heritage subtly alluded to in one scene with Madam Maxime but only if you know what you're looking for which is so important to his role in the next film No mention of the Minister For Magic's denial of Voldemort's return nor his act of bringing the dementors to kill Bartie Crouch junior before Snape can use Veritas serum to make him confirm Harry's story  both key to Dumbledore's flight in the next book and setting up for Umbridge to wreak her havoc. A messy treatment of the SnapeKarkaroff relationship and history again failing to set up the future doubts we have about Snape who is still mainly just portrayed as a nasty teacher rather than key character of the 6th book. The acting. Sad though I am to say it I thought most of the acting was poor in this film especially from Emma Watson who I've always thought was the best of the young actors and Rupert Grint. To be fair this is probably more due to their hugely diminished parts in this film but that aside I feel Hermione is portrayed more as Harry's mother figure rather than the superclever heroine who Harry can always rely on to get him back on track. The Rita Skeeter storyline is shallow with no setup for the essential article in support of Harry and no mention of her being an illegal animagus and thus no capture and blackmail of her by Hermione.

	onyx:emotionText "What summed this film up for me was the comments of my nonHP book reader wife and friend. Didn't really understand it.The JKR books are full of tells and explanations with subplots taking on great significance later on. The book of Goblet of Fire is central to the denouement of many of these  and in the main they are left out of the film version in favour of action and CGI.That said it was not all bad so I'll highlight what I liked first! The teenagers' awkwardness as they explore their relationships and the way this was handled in the build up to and the actual Ball scene. Hermione in particular was well portrayed and Ron and Harry sitting like wallflowers while the rest of the school dance the night away was well done. The look on McGonagall's face when she sees Ron's dress robes  priceless. The Moaning Myrtle scene in the Prefect's bath is excellent funny and well acted. Mad Eye Moody was excellent convincing and menacing. The opening scene showing the splendour of the Quidditch stadium was breathtaking. The graveyard scenes at the end were well done and close to the book. Ralph Fiennes was excellent if a little too strong to be credible so soon after his rebirth.What did they do badly? Quite a lot actually. I realise how hard it must be to condense this long book into a 150 minute movie but overextended scenes could have been shortened and 20 minutes extra to cover some key current and future story lines would have been time and money well spent. Dumbledore is mad! What has Gambon done to him? Would Richard Harris have grabbed Harry by the neck and shaken him shouted at him? Would Harris be mumbling and doubting of his abilities such that there is now almost no credibility that Voldemort should ever fear him? No. And neither does the Dumbledore of JKR. No muggle taunting and no house elf in the Quidditch world cup scenes meaning no explanation of the purpose of the riot and burning of the tented village and no setup of Bartie Crouch Senior as a key character. No mention at all of SPEW. The dragon fight scene is ridiculously long and ridiculously expensive. Harry flies right out of the stadium chased by the Norwegian Horntail on a trip to demolish large parts of the castle roofing tiles. The dragon can fly for goodness sake  why would it spend 2 minutes climbing across rooftops to get to Harry when it could fly out and blast him from the air? The characterisation of the new characters is poor  Fleur Viktor and Cedric are all just cardboard cutouts for Harry to battle against. The omission of almost all the interaction between Harry and Sirius so crucial to the next two films. Make you wonder whether the film makers have actually read all the books. The absence of any reference to Hagrid's halfgiant heritage subtly alluded to in one scene with Madam Maxime but only if you know what you're looking for which is so important to his role in the next film No mention of the Minister For Magic's denial of Voldemort's return nor his act of bringing the dementors to kill Bartie Crouch junior before Snape can use Veritas serum to make him confirm Harry's story  both key to Dumbledore's flight in the next book and setting up for Umbridge to wreak her havoc. A messy treatment of the SnapeKarkaroff relationship and history again failing to set up the future doubts we have about Snape who is still mainly just portrayed as a nasty teacher rather than key character of the 6th book. The acting. Sad though I am to say it I thought most of the acting was poor in this film especially from Emma Watson who I've always thought was the best of the young actors and Rupert Grint. To be fair this is probably more due to their hugely diminished parts in this film but that aside I feel Hermione is portrayed more as Harry's mother figure rather than the superclever heroine who Harry can always rely on to get him back on track. The Rita Skeeter storyline is shallow with no setup for the essential article in support of Harry and no mention of her being an illegal animagus and thus no capture and blackmail of her by Hermione. The Maze is transformed from testing puzzles and magical scenarios that the 4 Champion's could reasonably expect to figure outdefeat to a series of menacing hedges and roots that becomes the entirety of the final test. The winner just needs to be luckier and faster than the others  leaving no avenue for true Wizarding contest nor for Moody's sabotage of Fleur and Viktor's efforts.

Why did Mike Newell extend the dragon scene but leave out key characters?  because mistakenly Hollywood thinks that such exciting CGI is more important to the fans of the books than expanding characters and plot details. Wrong. But we will go and see the movie anyway.I felt the movie was chopped up. The Quiddich World Cup while fascinatingly done in the movie was over so quickly that it barely seemed to be a part of the plot. Mr Crouch is suddenly dead but it is just left dangling. Why bother to have Sirius in the movie at all his brief scene in the fire was really disappointing his head should have been fully out of the embers as in the book not part of the embers. He was barely recognizable as Sirius. What a waste.No Ludo no Winky and Dumbledore looking like a bumbling idiot rather than the world's most powerful wizard. Most importantly the whole end of the book is gone where he has a parting of the ways with Fudge and the Ministry of Magic because of Fudge's refusal to believe that Voldermort is back. This whole scene sets up the next book.So where does this movie adaptation shine? In the script and the impeccable casting. Despite what some have said about Daniel Radcliffe he IS Harry. From the first movie his sweet innocence to how he has grown into the part he remains the face I see when I read the books. Emma Watson needs to tone down her overacting a bit she was near perfect in the first movie but hasn't really developed her character much. Rupert Grint really shines in this movie his face is handsome and funny and full of expression he is the perfect Ron. The Phelps boys as Fred  George really come into their own in this movie although how they are to start their joke shop without Harry's Triwizard winnings in film 5 is a question since it was entirely missing from the movie. And it was nice to see Neville getting a bigger more important role even though all of his key info was left out of the movie. And now I've read book six Snape takes on a whole new meaning to me and again Alan Rickman has been the perfect Snape in all of the movies.The question as to whether the three main characters should remain on after the release of the 5th movie in summer 2007 seems a dumb question to me. Since when has Hollywood ever cared about the age of an actor and the part he or she is playing? How often have we had 20 somethings playing teenagers! There comes a time when the age of Daniel Emma and Rupert will not matter to the audience. Personally I hope that they play in all of the movies.They say that JK Rowling has a big say in what stays in and what is left out of her books because she alone knows what happens and how each piece of the jigsaw fits. She must have been on holiday when decisions were made for this movie. Perhaps the Director's Cut DVD will explain that also...".

If you've seen the trailer you have pretty much seen the movie. Much of the Plot involving Rita skeeter was cut i think we only saw her twice which i find very disappointing as it sets up the fifth book and the harry is crazy look at what was said about him in the prophet last year plot. One surprise for me though was Madeyemoody after seeing the trailers and photos i was dreading him being played as a joke character with his mad eye but i was very impressed with his character and performance although i did notice the lack of CONSTANT VILIGANCE. Overall i think this movie could be used as a 'look what i can do with my computer' movie.

	schema:headline " Pretty darn good";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all I must mention that Goblet of Fire is my favourite Harry Potter book and so I expected great things from this movie. And great things I did get but they were entirely unexpected.The movie starts off with Harry being shaken awake by Hermione in The Burrow. This itself gives us a glimpse into Mike Newell's thought process. Mike Newell and writer Steve Kloves seem to be HarryHermione advocators to a small extent. It's not so much as the fact that they show Harry and Hermione to be better friends than Ron and Hermione which isn't really true to the books it more the fact that they've made Hermione tag along or take care of Harry in several scenes.As the subject matter of the Goblet of Fire book was too vast many scenes in the movie have been sliced so that it deals with action rather than explanations. In a way this works. On the other hand Potter fans will surely expect some more details and this I predict will be the main negative response to Newell's work. The end particularly requires an explanation. Newell leaves things a bit up in the air. But this doesn't mean the movie is bad or disappointing. At least not for me. It is filled with laughoutloud moments thrilling action sequences and a few new surprises that will captivate you. Truly It has some wonderful scenes which seem like they've been plucked from your imagination. Voldemort's rebirth for instance.And speaking of Voldemort I must say Ralph Fiennes has done a remarkable job. The make up artist and computer animation guys must have worked hard too  Voldemort looks just as evil and scary as he should! This is one of the reasons that the movie has received a PG13 rating. The highly suggestive yet hilarious scene in the Prefects bathroom as well as a few very suggestive dialogues here and there also explain the rating.The movie's casting has been tastefully done. The new actors have managed to remain true to the characters that they play and are very believable. Miranda Richardson makes a fantastic Rita Skeeter. Stanislav Ianevski Krum and Robert Pattinson Cedric are well cast and play their roles well. Clmence Posy makes a good Fleur Delacour but Mike Newell should have let her keep her hair down.Unexpectedly Matthew Lewis and Brendan Gleeson gave very good performances. Matthew Lewis although he has grown out of his short and pudgy firstmovie form and has become tall and slim has nonetheless managed to keep Neville alive and kicking. There are many funny scenes as well as scenes that can only be described as 'cute' involving him. As for Brendan Gleeson I didn't think much of him as 'MadEye' Moody when I saw the trailers and the teaser pictures. But he makes a great Moody crazy loud and sometimes scary.There was much debate about the casting of Frances de la Tour as Madame Maxime as many seemed to think that she didn't fit the part. I can see their point since she isn't the best Maxime they could have got but she wasn't too bad. Pedja Bjelac also known as Predrag in case you're wondering made a wonderful Karkaroff.As for the carryover actors from the last movie into this one I have to say that I am most impressed with Emma Watson's performance. and of course Matthew Lewis whom I have already mentioned. Emma manages to capture the essence of 14yearold Hermione quite well. Rupert Grint gives his 100 Ron. Sometimes it's hard not to imagine Ron as Rupert while reading the books. Daniel Radcliffe the 'star' himself has greatly improved in terms of acting since Prisoner of Azkaban and although his performance is uneven he still manages to be a convincing Harry. The Phelps Twins are remarkable as Fred and George and entertain with their hilarious banter and excellent screen presence. Bonnie Wright Ginny has a bigger role in this movie than in any of the others. She has almost no dialogue but is present in many scenes here and there which is something. Tom Felton too has a very small role. In fact he's only present in three scenes one of which I am pleased to announce involves Professor Moody! But enough about the talented actors that have been a part of this magical movie. What about the scenes everyone has been waiting to see? Are they well done? What has been kept? What has been cut? I'm afraid you'll have to see the movie for that. If I begin to dissect this movie into what was well done and what wasn't this review will probably be 8 pages long. All I can say is that this movie will make you feel happy sad anxious and surprised at the same time. It will make you laugh out loud jump in surprise and gasp all at once. Prepare yourselves for a ride filled with mixed emotions. It's advisable to be prepared  This ride can get very overwhelming!".

	onyx:emotionText "First of all I must mention that Goblet of Fire is my favourite Harry Potter book and so I expected great things from this movie. And great things I did get but they were entirely unexpected.The movie starts off with Harry being shaken awake by Hermione in The Burrow. This itself gives us a glimpse into Mike Newell's thought process. Mike Newell and writer Steve Kloves seem to be HarryHermione advocators to a small extent. It's not so much as the fact that they show Harry and Hermione to be better friends than Ron and Hermione which isn't really true to the books it more the fact that they've made Hermione tag along or take care of Harry in several scenes.As the subject matter of the Goblet of Fire book was too vast many scenes in the movie have been sliced so that it deals with action rather than explanations. In a way this works. On the other hand Potter fans will surely expect some more details and this I predict will be the main negative response to Newell's work. The end particularly requires an explanation. Newell leaves things a bit up in the air. But this doesn't mean the movie is bad or disappointing. At least not for me. It is filled with laughoutloud moments thrilling action sequences and a few new surprises that will captivate you. Truly It has some wonderful scenes which seem like they've been plucked from your imagination. Voldemort's rebirth for instance.And speaking of Voldemort I must say Ralph Fiennes has done a remarkable job. The make up artist and computer animation guys must have worked hard too  Voldemort looks just as evil and scary as he should! This is one of the reasons that the movie has received a PG13 rating. The highly suggestive yet hilarious scene in the Prefects bathroom as well as a few very suggestive dialogues here and there also explain the rating.The movie's casting has been tastefully done. The new actors have managed to remain true to the characters that they play and are very believable. Miranda Richardson makes a fantastic Rita Skeeter. Stanislav Ianevski Krum and Robert Pattinson Cedric are well cast and play their roles well.

	schema:reviewBody "This just goes to show that these films are merely based!!! on the brilliant series that is the Harry Potter books. Again Fair play to the actors they have matured and acted better than ever in this film and i thoroughly enjoyed Rupert Grints portrayal of Ron for me it was him who somehow kept me in the cinema and reminded me of some of the brilliant scenes in the book. The first problem with this film is that almost the whole film is dark and disturbing like the last half hour of the prisoner of Azkaban. there are hardly any light fun moments any that were were cut from the film. for example Dudley's huge tongue after eating Fred and George's sweet prototypes for their future joke shop.Harry's feel good Two weeks of summer at the Weasleys house. The immense full length Quidditch world cup match and the two teams comical cheerleaders.When Harry fights the dragon he actually starts to enjoy himself by being back on his broom flying and being free again.Rons comical new owl Pigwidgeon.There are many more but if you want to know you'll have to read the book. The other huge problem with the film is the total miss interpretation of Albus Dumbledore Fans of the books will know that Dumbledore is a kind gentle patient wise true powerful wizard who commands respect by every full grown wizard around him and he never shows any sign of fear anger hate and doubt or depression in the film however he has almost none of his good qualities and all of the bad for me the first two films' Richard Harris had Dumbledore to a tee and i was devastated by his passing away he showed a true compassion for Harry and the following films were meant to show a ever growing bond between them sadly there is hardly a friendship between them and how Dumbledore got angry at Harry and showed fear was terrible and when he showed hopelessness at the situation after Harry looked into the pensive really lost the confidence in Dumbledore. I am not having a dig at Michael Gambon as i believe him to be a brilliant actor but the direction he was given obviously didn't work for his role. the film lacked a huge substance unlike the book which leaves you on tenterhooks and anticipation for the next one scenes that truly needed to be in the film were discarded by added ones that didn't need to be there like the learning to dance for the yule ball. I would have much rather seen some integral scenes instead of these added extras. for example The Weasleys comic arrival by Floo powder at number four to pick Harry up for the rest of the summer.The feel good two weeks at the weasleys house was a delight to readThe amazing world cup match.there was no Dobby or Winky in the film which will need explaining in the fifth film.There was none of Hermiones elf aid S.P.E.WNone of Hagrids Blast ended Skrewts which should have been a challenge in the maze as was the sphinx and the giant spider and the mysterious Myst that made everything upside down.The trio never met Sirius in Hogsmeade which cancelled out the growing of Harry's and Sirius's relationshipYou never found out in the film that Hagrid and madame Maxime were descendants of giantsHardly any Severus Snape in the film why? hes turned out to be one of the most important characters No Ludo Bagman in the film made the film lack storyline.No Bertha Jorkins in the film which ruins how Wormtail found Voldemort and also how Voldemort found out about the tournamentHardly any info was given on Barty Crouch and his son and also no explanation of how Barty junior escaped azkabanPercy weasley was meant to take over the judging in the tournament after the death of his bossNo Mrs Weasley at allNo bill or Charlie weasleyThe graveyard scene which should have been the highlight of the film lacked many important bits and Harry hardly fought Voldemort in the book there is a much more satisfying fightThe most important scene to the whole film was completely left out it is when Harry is recovering in the hospital wing and everyone is there here is where the order of the phoenix is meant to begin to regroup where Sirius reveals himself to the rest of the weasleys and how Dumbledore forced Snape and Sirius to shake hands and put their pasts behind them and also mentions Snapes secret mission which he agrees to do. also Harry is meant to give his thousand galleon triwizard winnings to Fred and George for their joke shop how they'll explain that i do not know. The Goblet Of Fire is by far my favourite book and i was sooo looking forward to the film sadly its left me angry and disappointed but its still a Harry Potter film and though lacking immense loads its still watchable. All in all this film has left out a lot meaning also that the next film is going to leave out a lot its in all honesty that if you want to experience the true magic of hogwarts and see a bigger relationship between the trio and others and a much huger and fuller satisfying storyline go and buy all of the Rowling books and read them from start to finish it will leave you completely satisfied and craving more I only hope the next director can somewhat redeem these films and deliver a brilliant Order of the Phoenix.".

	schema:headline " A great movie yet completely surpassed by the book";
	schema:reviewBody "When I first walked into the movie my expectations were not very high. The first two movies I thought were the best of the series mainly due to Richard Harris' deadon portrayal of Dumbledore and screenplays that closely followed the original books. Though the third and fourth movies were very artistic and dramatic I couldn't really connect to them in the way i had with the books. They glossed over many of the little things that made the Harry Potter series so magical in the first place focusing on a select few plot lines and limiting dialog to only what was necessary to further the story. As a result they've felt more like a collage of scenes a series of puzzle pieces thrown at the viewers faster than they can piece together just leading up to a final confrontation. Pacing has certainly been an issue leaving fans feeling disjointed and those new to the series confused as to what exactly is going on. In this respect Order of the Phoenix was very similar to the previous two movies. As a Hollywood film it deserves praise bringing this amazing world to the big screen telling a compelling tale and keeping the viewers glued to their seats for the duration of the movie. However to the die hard fans of the books you will undoubtedly be disappointed. Many scenes that one would think invaluable to the story have been cut replaced by the hasty filling in of plot holes. And while it pains me to ignore some of my favorite scenes from the book being left on the cutting room floor St. Mungo's Harry's Quibbler interview the Quidditch fight etc. I realize that yes not everything could be included in the movie. But in this watered down version of the book there seems to be something missing. We still have all the drama and excitement but some of the magic just seems to be gone. Aside from Evanna couldn't have made a more perfect Luna the kids give simply average performances never really reaching the full potential put forth by JK Rowling's writing. The same goes for Gambon who seems to have ignored the calm all knowing endearing idea of who Dumbledore is in favor of a more erratic yet powerful headmaster. Sure this works well in the more dramatic scenes specifically the final battle but otherwise his performance falls flat lacking the eye twinkling charm we came to love from the late Richard Harris. Thankfully Imelda Staunton more than makes up for this in an amazing portrayal of Dolores Umbridge one of the more fully realized characters of the movie. As for the rest of the cast it's largely hit or miss determined by how each scene is written. Overall I would certainly recommend the movie for everyone fan or not as it really was a well made movie despite a few wooden actors and some bad dialog. But when looking at the books one really can't help but think how much more potential this movie could've had.".

	schema:reviewBody "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the first Harry Potter movie directed by David Yates. Some fans love Yates and his different style but there are people who don't like him myself included. Sure he's the one responsible for my favourite half of the series where Harry is growing up and everything is darker. But in the movies the characters aren't as deep and the darkness feels more like a colour scheme than a change in the story telling.Yates's style chooses action over the story  which makes no sense when considering what the novel was like. Order of the Phoenix had very little action but it explored wonderfully for example Harry after seeing Voldemort returning and seeing Cedric Diggory being brutally murdered. In the movie you can see it bothers Harry he is incredibly angry but that's that. If you haven't read the book it only seems like Harry is having his puberty and therefore a bit moody even if you could claim he has a case of PTSD. There are many emotional scenes in the novel that weren't included in the movie. They were completely forgotten or replaced by something really really weird apart from few that were important to the plot  they saved the scenes that were important when looking at this one movie but ignored the story as a whole and they seemed to figure character development was not that important. Harry Potter series is not seven separate stories it's one story in seven parts. At this point it's clear the filmmakers didn't care about the story as much as making the movies and making fans watch them and just get through the whole series. But it's lovely to see the film allowing few characters develop properly like Neville during the DA. They tried to fake Ginny developing as well by only showing us that she is indeed amazing with spells. Still the filmmakers have forgotten to give her any sort of personality. I love her in the books but in movies she's just an empty husk  skillful of course but she's not as interesting as in the books. ' Order of Phoenix is oversimplified and is trying to force a story into a film form in the easiest way possible. Yes sure they didn't have so much time to focus on the stories individually considering the stars were growing up but still this is ridiculous.".

I love her in the books but in movies she's just an empty husk  skillful of course but she's not as interesting as in the books. ' Order of Phoenix is oversimplified and is trying to force a story into a film form in the easiest way possible. Yes sure they didn't have so much time to focus on the stories individually considering the stars were growing up but still this is ridiculous.";

	schema:reviewBody "OK. Yes stuff was left out. Yes some things were inaccurate. And yes at times the story jumped around. But I'll tell you what if that's the price to pay for being able to see fantastic literature on the bigscreen...I'll take a few inconsistencies any day.For having the task of taking 870 masterful pages and turning them into a 2.5 hour movie David Yates did one heck of a job. This movie is a mustsee no matter how you look at it. For bookreaders sure you notice the absence of certain parts but you finally get to see what you've imagined in your head for years take place in reallive motion on the screenand you know what those few things left out help you gain a better understanding anyway because you have already read the inbetween stuff. Then in the same breath this is a great movie for nonbookreaders as well. For those HP fans who take the lighter approach of skipping the books and simply following along by the moviesyou won't know what you're missing anyway. The biggest complaints about this movie will be from bookreaders who wanted a 10hour long wordforword recreation of the book. Other than that there is nothing to complain about. Acting was great storyline was great and the special effects were flawless.Slight Spoiler In This Paragraph Being a bookreader I knew heading in that I would have to be prepared to accept substantial cuts from all that takes place in the book. However the parts that Yates chose to focus on were by far the most important ones and the way in which he did it left me speechless. Yates was clearly at his best at the movie's climactic ending. When reading those last few chapters when Harry is at the Ministry and there is the great battle the book reads like a whirlwind. Everything is happening at once deatheaters here deatheaters there Sirius finally getting the chance to fight Moody kicking ass Ginny going on a tear and straightup owning people. And you try to picture in your head what all this would look likea million things going on at once and trying to picture how wizards and witches really fight each other. Somehow someway Yates was able to create that fastpaced actionpacked confusion and then all of a sudden like an orchestra going flat after their last booming note Sirius Black is gonejust like in the book. This was the hardest part for me to swallow when reading the book as tears ran down my cheeks not only because Sirius was my favorite character but because you go from such a high of seeing the Order save the day to the unbelievable low of seeing Harry's godfather simply fade away. This is an emotion and thought process which was excellently portrayed in the film. Ironically enough Yates was only warming up.As for the DumbledoreVoldemort showdown I don't think that it could have been done better. In a Star Wars type fashion Harry is being tempted by Voldemort to release his anger to have his revenge on Bellatrix Lestrange to have a taste of the dark side. And as we sit there fearing for confused helpless Harry we see a green fire of hope and more like Master Yoda than any other fictional character Albus Dumbledore appears and engages Voldemort in a wizardduel that puts Gandalf and Sarumon to shame.The way the movie engaged the audience and got their emotion kicking is a great filmmaking talent not found in many movies anymore. Think of the way Yates made you HATE Umbridge just like the book. The way you felt bad for Snape when you saw his hidden past just like the book. And think of the best two lines of the movie where you felt comfort confidence and safety on Harry's part. The first of these lines was Sirius Black to Lucius Malfoy when the deatheaters are overwhelming the kids Sirius appears behind Lucius with a firm get away from my godson. Then once again when Harry is alone with Voldemort Dumbledore appears and almost as if to initiate the duel says It was a mistake for you to come here tonight Tom. Overall the movie was fantastic. The best of the fiveby far. You just have to put aside the gaping holes of chapters that were left out and look at what was done well. For the bookreaders imagine if you were forced to take only 400 of the 870 pages out of the bookyou would take the most important ones that relate to the plot. So as much as the prefect storyline and the HarryCho drama and all that other stuff is a great read the big screen simply doesn't allow enough time for it. As for the nonbookreaderspick up the books and get busy. Because as great as a job that Yates did with the moviethe woman he got the story from Ms. Rowling might just be one of the greatest authors of our time.Now go spend 10 bucks and enjoy the show!".

	schema:reviewBody "I have read and enjoyed all 7 Harry potter novels and I watched and enjoyed the first 2 films Azkaban and GOF were OK but not good. This however was awful and when I say awful I really mean awful. I was genuinely on the verge of walking out of the theatre after about 30 minutes the only reason I sat through this was because of my wife.I will say that Dolores Umbridge and Sirius Black were really good. Harry Potter however was dreadful. Daniel Radcliffe seems to have forgotten how to act on his way through puberty. I mean he was excellent in the first two films so why was this so awful? He spent two hours literally panting and moaning it was like he had been told to tense every muscle in his whole body and stay like that for every scene.Then there was Dumbledore and trust me Michael Gambon cannot do Dumbledore. After Trelawny is fired and he tells Umbridge quite calmly that she can stay in the castle he then proceeds to shout at the students Don't you all have studying to do? that was one of my biggest wtf moments.Percy doesn't speak at all and Malfoy has literally one line in the whole film. How about explaining that Umbridge was the one who set the Dementors on Harry in the first place and then they actually changed how the Dementors looked I mean film 3 got it spot on. Then there was just ridiculous stuff like a Dementor strangling Harry so he stabs it in the eye with his wand? Then there was Fred and George leaving Hogwarts the whole reason that they caused a big scene and commotion was so that Harry could use Umbridges fire in her office and find out about Sirius. How about Kreacher lying to Harry? How about revealing that Snape DID go and find out about Sirius and was merely pretending to be ignorant to Umbridge? My biggest disappointment however by far was the end fight scene's between the death eaters and the Order of the Phoenix in particular Dumbledore and Voldemort. Bellatrix does not kill Sirius with the Avada Kedavra curse she stuns him into one of those weird curtained doors and then he disappears. The fight between Dumbledore and Voldemort was basically a giant light show where the cgi people were probably told Go to town let your imagination run wild.How about Dumbledore taunting Voldemort by calling him Tom all the time and avoiding his killing curses rather than fighting back? How about Dumbledore being shown to be far more powerful than Riddle and choosing for reasons that I can't remember now not to kill him? The other thing about Dumbledore as well is that he appears to dissaparate from Hogwarts which Hermione says repeatedly throughout the books is not possible.I probably haven't covered everything but these films definitely went downhill big time after Chamber of Secrets. You leave the cinema feeling like all you saw was lots of clips strung together and that loads of things were missing and it all happened in a massive rush you don't get that sense of satisfaction that you should get after watching a good film. Whether you've read the book or not I would say avoid at all costs and if you haven't read the book then buy the book and read it it will give you infinitely more pleasure that the torture you have to suffer to watch this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "For those of you looking for a faithful adaptation of Order of the Phoenix this film isn't it. How director David Yates got the go to direct completely baffles me. Not since Chris Columbus' stilted pacing has a HP film disappointed me. I realize that in a book as rich in detail as the HP series something is bound to be left out in the film version but the direction and editing of this film leave much to be desired.The film opens in Little Whinging with the dementor attack on Harry and Dudley. Mrs. Figg happens across the boys as if by accident just after Harry defeats the Dementors with his Patronus but is never outed as a squib. The Dursleys were more worried than horrified and never threatened Harry with expulsion from their house. The sheer vileness that audiences last saw in Prisoner of Azkaban was notable absent leaving the view to wonder what happened to bring us the weak and whimpering version of the Dursleys that appears in this film.When Harry is brought to the Order's headquarters very little is made of the fact that the Noble House of Black was once a bastion of pureblood fanaticism. Kreature makes a very weak appearance and the simple existence of Regulus Black R.A.B.? was never even touched upon.Fred and George remain the comic relief but the ever developing character of Ginny Weasley is ignored. Even more upsetting was the notable absence of Mrs. Weasly's growing concern for her family's safety. I thought that one of the most touching moments in the book was the chapter in which Mrs. Weasly attempts of banish the boggart only to have it continually morph into the horrifying visages of various dead loved ones. Bill and Charlie were also not mentioned leaving the viewer to wonder if the film franchise plans to reduce the Weasly family from 9 to 7.As excited as I was with the casting of Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge I felt that Yate simply did not do her justice. Yes she was vile but not in the bureaucratic evil way Rowling depicted her in the novel. She simpered but I just did not get the feeling that she took malicious pleasure that she should have in what she did as the High Inquisitor.The rumored St. Mungo's scene while it may have been filmed was disappointingly absent with the film jumping from Mr. Weasly's attack in the ministry although why he was in the Deapartment of Mysteries was never addressed to Christmas dinner at the HQ and a lame Here's Daddy! from Mrs. Weasly.Even more disappointing was the depiction of the Department of Mysteries. I entered the movie hoping for some wicked effects and bizarre magical elements and was left with just the Hall of Prophesies and the mysterious doorway. To add insult to injury the relationship between Sirius and Harry was never developed to the point where Harry would naturally feel devastated by the loss of his godfather. I felt as though their relationship was more vague friend of the family then Harry beginning to look to Sirius as a surrogate father figure.Over all the continuity of the film felt too rushed and disjointed as opposed to the more fluid Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of fire. Relationships between the characters felt forced which I found odd considering the fact that the cast has been working together for 7 years or so. If any of my personal suspicions and predictions for the future of Harry are accurate this film has left out numerous key elements. That being the case then films 6 and 7 will have to scramble to make up for what this film lacks. As Yates is slated to direct the next installment I can only look to it with a feeling of dread wondering how he will mangle the HalfBlood Prince.".

	schema:headline " Too Short Too Little TOO LATE!";
	schema:reviewBody "THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!! CAUTION!!!Fist off I must admit that I have watched the previous movies too many times to count Since I watched the last movie I have read the books I had not read them before this movie. This book was the turning point for me in the whole Harry Potter series. In my opinion the story goes from good to excellent in OOTP. With that said I had some pretty big expectations for this movie some of which where realized.The high points of the movie where seeing the fruition of some of the more lovable elements of the book such as Weasley's Wheezes Tonks Askaban Kretcher and the OOTP Head Quarters. It was fun to see the characters but it was hard to see such main characters like Tonks totally be ignored by the story. I mean I had such hope when she was pulling faces at the dinner table then after that nothing. The movie really just cut too many corners to the point that it did not look as amazing as it could have been. I mean the ministry of magic looked like a hallway and that's it Sirius' family apparently lived in the connectahouse projects and Cho was border line illiterate! I don't think that movies have to follow the books exactly for example I think Lord of the Rings did an awesome job at condensing one of the most complex and awesome stories of our time into 12hrs of movie. But the movies do have to make sense.I asked my wife after the movie she has not read any HP books if it made sense because he continuity and backstory of the movie was not easy to follow for me and she said yes. I just worry that the movies are so out of control at this point that peeves Hermione  Ron's Prefect Status Percy going bad Quidditch the Dursley's Trelawny etc All those stories are now so corrupted and twisted by screen writes and directors that they can not in my imagination be reasonably recovered.My Suggestions1. If your going to make us wait two years between movies at least put in enough film to cover the subject. Why not do a 2 part or dare I say 3 part movie. If you need help spending your production time wisely see Peter Jackson. Really I know that this would never happen but hey 2. Try and get the story back on track. Some how. 3. Lets see the actors! Really Lupin Snape Hagrid McGonagall did you have another gig? Were where they?".

With that said I had some pretty big expectations for this movie some of which where realized.The high points of the movie where seeing the fruition of some of the more lovable elements of the book such as Weasley's Wheezes Tonks Askaban Kretcher and the OOTP Head Quarters. It was fun to see the characters but it was hard to see such main characters like Tonks totally be ignored by the story. I mean I had such hope when she was pulling faces at the dinner table then after that nothing. The movie really just cut too many corners to the point that it did not look as amazing as it could have been. I mean the ministry of magic looked like a hallway and that's it Sirius' family apparently lived in the connectahouse projects and Cho was border line illiterate! I don't think that movies have to follow the books exactly for example I think Lord of the Rings did an awesome job at condensing one of the most complex and awesome stories of our time into 12hrs of movie. But the movies do have to make sense.I asked my wife after the movie she has not read any HP books if it made sense because he continuity and backstory of the movie was not easy to follow for me and she said yes. I just worry that the movies are so out of control at this point that peeves Hermione  Ron's Prefect Status Percy going bad Quidditch the Dursley's Trelawny etc All those stories are now so corrupted and twisted by screen writes and directors that they can not in my imagination be reasonably recovered.My Suggestions1. If your going to make us wait two years between movies at least put in enough film to cover the subject. Why not do a 2 part or dare I say 3 part movie. If you need help spending your production time wisely see Peter Jackson. Really I know that this would never happen but hey 2. Try and get the story back on track. Some how. 3. Lets see the actors! Really Lupin Snape Hagrid McGonagall did you have another gig? Were where they?";

Lord of the Rings... ring a bell followers of the book... did it stray as much from the books as OOTP did? Now for serious talk whoever decided that Grawp should look like a 20' middleaged man with Down's Syndrome should be tortured for the rest of their life. Not only did Grawp look slow but behaved moved and got the audience's sympathy NOT how the book describes him at all. And how about entire chunks of the book thrown away for a cheap but likely profitable movie? How about being 34 through the book in 60 minutes? How about Kreacher 2 scenes? How about Sirius' mother's portrait? How about Quidditch? How about the Patronus charm being very advanced magic yet the director felt every character needed an animal? How about classes wizard clothing Diagon Alley... is Hogwart's set in London now for some reason? How about Harry is the only one that does lines in Umbridge's office so as to isolate him further from his friends in his loneliness? How about Firenze taking over Divination showing that it is not a lost art and course? How about Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes the twins' decision making the money Harry gave them to open up their shop? How about knowing the names of the escaped convicts was it going to cost too much to PRINT 10 names of the villains who are in the finale on the Prophet? I realize this is a film based on the book but to be able to say that the movie should reflect at least 50 of the book if the craptacular disappointment duo of YatesGoldenberg sign on for Half Blood Prince I hope I am not alone in wishing them to buy a few extra letter openers for the angry mail they will certainly receive. If another duo appears my advice is to stick to the book even Mel Gibson did that...To Ms. J.K.

The experience was lousy but the film was good...IF you take it as a separate entity from the series of books. If you separate the film from the book you won't be disappointed.For the negative...there were of course MANY things that were omitted from the film. As a huge fan of the books I still must be realistic. I knew there would be a lot of information left out. There were a few things that I felt could have made the story richer if they had been included but I won't go into detail so I don't give away any of the film's changes. There were a few changes that made me frown at times but as the story played out it did make the film flow well. One of their worst casting decisions Michael Gambon was actually tolerable in this one for the most part. I am NOT a fan of his portrayal of Dumbledore but I guess he worked for this film simply because for the majority of the story he is supposed to be acting somewhat aloof towards Harry. That worked for him. I miss the subtlety that Richard Harris brought to that role and while he wasn't dreadful in this one I still believe that there are countless other well known actors in the UK that could have done this role better justice. There wasn't enough Molly or Hagrid for me though. I love both of those characters.On a positive note the special effects were very well done. The thestrals were marvelouseerie but strangely peaceful creatures. Evanna Lynch could not have been more spot on as Luna. Her voice mannerisms and demeanor were amazing. My only complaint about her was that she wasn't on screen enough. o Imelda Staunton as Umbridge and Helena Bonham Carter as Bella have to be two of the BEST casting decisions that they have with regard to these films. They were SO incredible. I was actually quite impressed with Dan Rupert and Emma as well. They have come quite far in their acting abilities. They have finally achieved the art of saying a lot without necessarily opening their mouths. The scene in the common room following the kiss between Harry and Cho was hysterical. Kreacher and Grawp were great additions to the films. Fred and George's exit was very well done albeit slightly different. The film if taken by itself was really good. Unfortunately it's a lot different from the book. But as I'm doing a film review and not a comparison I'll give it 8 out of 10 because I was highly entertained.Our sneak preview was interrupted in the middle due to a problem with the film and I think we still missed some of it. We lined up 3 hours before the movie was supposed to begin it started late it was interrupted in the middle for over 30 minutes we were wanded for metal and electronics every time we went in or out...I think we'll just wait until opening week next time. It's crowded but a lot less trouble.We are actually going to see it again.".

Always there is Snape the middling Hogwarts employee who is not clearly good but not clearly bad but capable of both until fate forces his hand in Book 6.J.K. Rowling doesn't let anybody off of the hook of responsibility for their choices. But she does present the internal struggle for goodness and justice for the mess that it can be.

	schema:reviewBody "Within the first 5 minutes you can tell the series has undergone a dramatic tone shift and I have to say I think thats appropriate since Voldemorts return at the end of Goblet of Fire means that it's time to put aside childish things. The big bad men are here and they don't care about hurting children. it's time to get nasty.Gone is the frivolity of the first couple of movies where magic was cool and everything in this new and magical world was just wonderful to behold a la World of Disney. The new director has taken some risks with style and approach and they've paid off brilliantly. Order of the Phoenix is probably the darkest of the five movies we've had so far even more so than Azkhaban which was a step in the right direction for where the series would eventually be heading. There's very little fun in Phoenix and you can see why. The Dark Lord is back it's no laughing matter and this movie actually sells that fact.This in the movie world at least is where Harry Potter crosses the line from kids movie to grown ups movie.Harry now has some serious mental scars as well as his actual one of course since the events of the previous movie which while lighter than Azkhaban followed on well from that movie. The Ministry of Magic is in denial about Voldermorts return and are trying to control the flow of rumour stemming from the events of Goblet. To this end we have new teacher and Ministry stooge Dolores Umbridge. Pink and fluffy on the outside crunchy and evil on the inside. She makes no qualms about reordering the law at Hogwarts putting the kybosh on anything even remotely fun and making the students lives a complete misery. What she put Harry through in detention was simply pure evil.She wasn't quite how I pictured her from the book but Imelda Staunton played her with a deliciously bittersweet twist all charming and proper in her righteous delusions with that stab you in the back thing going on. She was a nasty piece of work.It is a shame that a lot of the content of the book was missing but it was a big book and although I can't put my finger on what wasn't in the movie I read it a while ago now it does sometimes feel that there should have more substance to a few areas mainly the characterisation of some of the characters. Most of the major bits I remember from the book were in the movie. There's a pace here we haven't seen before a new musical approach also puts a new twist on things and I think Harry Potters world seems to fit it's new clothes well. I'm eagerly anticipating what's next as I hear David Yates is also directing the Half Blood Prince last I heard anyway and since that book has zombies in it I think the new dark style will suit it awesomely thank you very much.The characters all look much older than they're supposed to be in Phoenix but it also kind of works in it's favour. They all look like they have a bit more history and life experience behind them they're coping with stuff that will age any kid and it shows. That's also testament to the acting as well. Here mostly all the acting is pretty good Ron Harry and Hermione all put in good efforts obviously having gotten the hang of the whole acting lark. Gambon is good as Dumbledore but I do miss Richard Harris and keep playing what might have been his versions of Gambons scenes over in my head. When I read the books it's Harris I'm picturing. Helena Bonham Carter gives a kooky insane kind of air to Bellatrix Lestrange must get that from hubby Tim Burton who was a pretty good character. One thing about this film though is that the actual Order of the Phoenix isn't in it all that much really. A flaw that wasn't in the book. The line about Snape being in the order if you missed it you wouldn't even know he was in the order at all and a subsequent scene later on might seem confusing.Kreacher was well done I though coming across as a real miserable old bugger which was appropriate. The producers apparently weren't going to put him in the movie at all but JK Rowling said they'd be stuffing themselves up for the final movie if they did that.All in all I think Phoenix is the best so far of the five movies followed by Azkhaban Goblet then the other two in no particular order.Now I've just got hold of The Deathly Hallows and although it's quarter past five I'm off to bed so see you later....".

	onyx:emotionText "Within the first 5 minutes you can tell the series has undergone a dramatic tone shift and I have to say I think thats appropriate since Voldemorts return at the end of Goblet of Fire means that it's time to put aside childish things. The big bad men are here and they don't care about hurting children. it's time to get nasty.Gone is the frivolity of the first couple of movies where magic was cool and everything in this new and magical world was just wonderful to behold a la World of Disney. The new director has taken some risks with style and approach and they've paid off brilliantly. Order of the Phoenix is probably the darkest of the five movies we've had so far even more so than Azkhaban which was a step in the right direction for where the series would eventually be heading. There's very little fun in Phoenix and you can see why. The Dark Lord is back it's no laughing matter and this movie actually sells that fact.This in the movie world at least is where Harry Potter crosses the line from kids movie to grown ups movie.Harry now has some serious mental scars as well as his actual one of course since the events of the previous movie which while lighter than Azkhaban followed on well from that movie. The Ministry of Magic is in denial about Voldermorts return and are trying to control the flow of rumour stemming from the events of Goblet. To this end we have new teacher and Ministry stooge Dolores Umbridge. Pink and fluffy on the outside crunchy and evil on the inside. She makes no qualms about reordering the law at Hogwarts putting the kybosh on anything even remotely fun and making the students lives a complete misery.

I realize that Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was a very long book but so was The Goblet of Fire and I enjoyed it's movie adaptation a lot. In this movie seemed as though the director merely had a check list of scenes that he needed to but in the movie put no thought into connecting them. The speed and choppiness of the movie took away from the characters. It was just events and there was hardly any character development at all. Which was a shame because the young cast continues to get better and there were some amazing acting veterans Gary Oldman Ralph Fiennes Helena Bonham Carter etc. In my opinion if the director had slowed everything down only a little he could've added a lot more character development humor fluidity However despite by prier comments the movie was not terrible. It did have it's good moments but I think it could have been done a lot better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well I just saw OotP and the only actors I would keep would be Jason Isaacs Helena BonhamCarter Gary Oldman George Harris Brendan Gleeson David Thewlis and Alan Rickman.The rest just plain sucked.Daniel Radcliffe had better buck his ideas up if he thinks that acting is a career. Wooden just wasn't the word. In the book you can sense his anger frustration and pain. The only pain I sensed was having to put up with another scene with him in. As an example his line 'Get behind me' sounded more as if he was standing in a lunch queue at school. Where oh where had his feelings for Sirius gone? By the time he was getting on the train to go home it was like he had never even met him. Weird. He will be the next Mark Hamill or Macauly Culkin. No talent.As for Emma Watson well she managed to deliver the lines but that was about it. Where was the feeling and understanding when she describes how Cho was feeling to Harry and Ron? It came across so well in the book she managed to make it really dull and uninteresting. Radcliffe's response of 'wet' was hurried and forced out as though lunch had just been called and he wanted to be first in the queue.Rupert Grint actually has started to show a bit of character but was given too little to do. I think the only thing he really mucked up was the 'Who are you? and what have you done with Hermione Granger?' line. Having said that the response from Emma Watson was limp. Mind you he was the pick of the 'students'.Matthew Lewis as Neville will never get a job outside this franchise on the strength of that performance. The Phelps twins were OK but again had too little to do. Same for Evanna Lynch. She looked like she knew something about acting and was actually believable as Luna but she had far too little to work with.Ralph Fiennes was as malevolent as a tea cup and Imelda Staunton was about as frightening as wet paint.Michael Gambon sucks as Dumbldore he has never had the quiet calm that comes over in the books. He would be better as the sorting hat.Natalia Tena needed more lines..... She never had a chance with the material she was given and seemed to be there because she was in the book and to give the CGi guys some more chances to show off. More pointless window dressing.Maggie Smith had an indifferent outing as McGonnagall. I've come to expect better of her.As did Robbie Coltrane. He never came across as Hagrid like the first films but he must have had ooh nearly five minutes on screen.Richard Leaf was just plain rubbish as Dawlish. He looked like a used car salesman. I was fully expecting him to try and sell Dumbledore a used Ford. I know he had hardly any screen time but.....As for Grawp I thought I had gone into Shrek the third by mistake. Where did the ugly brutal giant go? I half expected Donkey or Princess Fiona to appear...There was much talk of the film being darker. Well darker sets would have covered it the characters were as frothy as ever hardly ever showing any of the strain that is apparent in the books.Except for David Thewlis he looked excellent as the haggard Lupin and performed his 'down at heal' role very well.Alan Rickman shone out again as Severus Snape except they had cut out some of his better lines from the book.Gary Oldman was better than I expected but could have done with more screen time. He never got to show brooding Sirius nor did he get his best one liner either. 'Come on cousin you can do better than that!' Jason Isaacs again led from the front he is the very epitome of the elder Malfoy and exudes a sinister feel that makes his character very believable. He should have been given the Lord Voldemort part. I could actually believe I was going to die if he was Lord Voldemort. Ralph Fiennes well I think I just ordered a Latte didn't I? First time performers Helena BonhamCarter was exceptional but again needed more screen time.George Harris was excellent as Shackbolt he had confidence and presence something that so many lacked. His costume and manner were perfect and his voice just brilliant.Brendan Gleeson again impressed me with his over the top Moody. He seems just as bonkers as the character in the book.Overall the film was less than impressive if that is the best David Yates can do he should not take the next film.I try to go to the movies at least twice a week. This was one of those films where I found myself looking at my watch halfway through thinking is it nearly over yet? I would have to say one to one and a half stars at best. Overhyped and now full of overpaid teenagers who just cannot act. You could excuse the first two or maybe three films but now they really should be starting to show some craft and talent.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all i want to comment on the high points of the movie. I think the acting was great the characters looked great and the way they played out their parts were great. I like how Bellatrix looked and acted it really gave you the feel for the type of character she is. On another note the parts they cut out were parts most people were probably excited for. The circular room not being there? Honestly why cut out one of the most interesting parts of the movie? The brain room and the other rooms were important keys to the excitement of the movie. Also the fact that none of the children were hurt like in the book was a little overrated. Yes this is a child's movie but including an unconscious Hermione Neville's broken nose Ron being attacked by the brains and Ginny's broken ankle wouldn't have been too disgusting. Also the fight at the end between Dumbledore and Voldemort was cheap because it did not happen like it should have in the book. Neville and Harry should have been the only people in the veil room when the Death eaters were threatening for the prophecy and Bellatrix didn't even use Crucio on Neville like she does in the book to get the prophecy. The prophecy wasn't supposed to be heard till the 6th book. It was supposed to say the prophecy when it breaks. Siruis' death went way too fast Harry didn't even mourn it. And what was up with the absence of the two way mirrors? That was such an emotional important part of the story. Knowing that if he would have used the mirror instead of rushing out. Why was there no Marietta? In the book Cho never told Hermione jinxed the list to put boils on the persons face. There was no dating between Harry and Cho. There was no DA coins to tell of the meetings. How are they going to do the 6th movie where Malfoy says i used Grangers idea with the coin like the DA used to talk with the death eaters without being intercepted if there was no coins! And Harry breaking into Snapes mind instead of dipping his head into the penseive was stupid. Not to mention they cut the memory way too short. And didn't even have Lily stick up for him. It was cheap. They changed too many things it made the movie not worth buying. They had at LEAST an hour of time left to add things in. I would have rather have sat there for another hour for a more detailed movie. They jumped around too much. Not only that they need to keep ONE director instead of switching like every movie.

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw the previews for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix I was giddy because i actually thought that OOTP would be magical amazing and actionpacked. How ignorant i was. Now i know it is a 870 page book but if a fantasy movie based on a book is going to be done right it calls for a longer movie or the possibility of doing a part two. Trying to cram all this information in two hours makes the audience member feel incredibly stuffed and congested. The cameras were too fast actors spoke their lines too fast. Probably the greatest example is the scene where Severus gets his pants pulled down by James. A great scene in the book but turned into five seconds of incoherence in the movie. Uncle Vernon is a yeller plain and simple. He did not shout once in OOTP. And when did Dudley become a gangster? Why did Flitwick who looked normal in the first two films become a guy with black hair and moustache? That's not Flitwick and his arm pump is not something he would do although i must admit it was hilarious. George and Fred deserved a bigger finish. Sure the fireworks were OK but in the book how the were cornered and they grab their brooms talk to peeves and escape. That was a finish. Now i understand that the films are becoming darker and more sinister and stuff. And because they're so creative they make the set and the movie more visually darker to convey this metaphor. However as an audience member i want to see the faces of the actors and set. Having the centaur scene with no lines and unable to see things clearly makes it look disorientated and confusing. Actors and actresses that make a grand appearance in the book would get more time in the movie. If i didn't read the books and saw Tonks doing her pig and duck thing i would seriously be like WTF? Seriously people who are not diehard fans need to be explained things. You would think they would explain the prophecy a bit better with Neville and all but no they couldn't take the time to do that. They just made silly mistakes. Poking a dementor in the eye when it is choking you? Seriously now. And what happened to Quidditch? It was action packed and amazing in the first two films but yet again they succeeded in taking away the magic that made the first two films fabulous. I believed the final battle would be breathtaking but was I robbed on that notion. Like the movie the prophecy room was tight and overcrowded. No brain room? And it wasn't avada kedarva that killed sirius. However i grow tired of complaining about this movie. Hopefully people will just read the book instead which unlike the movie is good.".

I would have loved to see Lockhart and Neville's Parents.After the Dementor attack they should have filmed the howler for Aunt Petunia. The bit with Voldemort possessing Harry what was with that. I'm sure I didn't read that in the book. They didn't show Ron and Hermione getting Prefects After the Fight Dumbledore didn't tell Harry all about the prophecy. That was a big mistake. How are they going to explain why Voldemort went after Harry and why Prof. Trelawney is such an important Character But most importantly what about the Quidditch. About how Ron gets on the team. This obviously means they don't plan to do Quidditch again. They can't unless they find a way to write Ron in. The thing I missed most were things like the classes especially Hagrids. It had no sense of time. It was like they had just taken out bits of the main plot and stuck them together. Where were the exams especially the practical exams.Now for the good things Luna She was perfect. It was a shame she got more screen time than some of the main characters though. Newspaper Montage It was awesome. They shouldn't have done it as many times though. Kind of wrecked the effect of it. Umbridge wasn't what I expected but she was greatAll in all I hated this movie. I even talked my mum into reading the 870 page book. David Yates did a really bad job. The should bring back Chris Columbus. The first 2 were way better than the last 3. Prepare for a bad Movie 6 because David Yates it directing it. I am seriously considering not going!".

	schema:headline " Yet again the movie disappointed me";
	schema:reviewBody "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix surpassed even my lowest expectations for the film. The movies have been steadily declining since the third movie. It's not that they're bad just standing alone but as they are based on the phenomenal books by J K Rowling they should at least try to stick somewhat close to them. This however almost never happens it's as though the director just wants to make his film and get his money it doesn't do the books justice in the least. I left the theater fuming because of all the changes made to the books. I'm not naive I understand that a lot must be taken out to fit the time length but good God they could have shortened the 10 minute broom ride in the beginning and used it to make the confrontation in Dumbledore's office a little more accurate or they could have added the rest of the rooms in the Department of Mysteries which were noticeably absent. Those were the 2 parts of the films that I was actually looking forward to seeing but was yet again disappointed. Instead of hexing every person trying to take him to Azkabanas is written Dumbledore simply grabs Fawkes the phoenix and disappears...ooh wow wonderful...God! Also the Department of Mysteries was almost a joke in itself...apart from the missing rooms the fight between the studentsOrder and the eaters was also sub par. I just saw flashes of wands as the people just flew around attempting to kill each other it was an incoherent mess. There are other major flaws in the movies but i don't have to time or patience to discuss them at the moment. If you are going to see the movie and haven't read the books or aren't extremely familiar with them then the movie will probably be very good to you however if you are like me and have read the books multiple times lower your expectations for the film and grit your teeth you'll probably leave disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "For the avid Harry Potter reader the whole suspense leading up to HP Order of the Phoenix can be summed up in the word how. How are they going to translate a nearly 900 page book to the screen how are they going to tie together a storyline that in the 5th book breaks into dozens of streams like a mighty river coming to its delta.This seemingly impossible task is well accomplished by astute summation of plot and concentration of action. Also the heart and soul of the book i.e. the thematic spirit of the story and Rowling's shining gift for characterization are given the fullest support in this film more so than in any previous HP movie.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix basically involves Harry being persecuted by the government for telling a truth they refuse to believe all while dealing with the same feelings of teen angst and emerging love that any ordinary teen finds stressful and consuming. Only through the love and dedication of family and especially friends does Harry come across the means to fight back against the government elude his enemies and make some sense of his emotional turmoil.Most reader's will come out of the theater saying I wish they had shown this or that. However all will leave satisfied that they have been treated to a faithful rendering brilliantly acted and directed. All the HP movies are a good watch but in this one we get a great movie.We have the advantage of going to our HP movies with a nonreader and she was to say the least blown away and pronounced it a near classic. My daughter and myself have read and reread the books many times over and came out limp from exhilaration our keen anticipation very much fulfilled.A few highlights The acting is best ever. The three principles push themselves to a new level. My favorite new characters were Imelda Staunton as Delores Umbridge excellent you'll love to hate her and Natalia Tena as Tonks. Natalia is sheer delight. She is the penultimate punk rock witch girlthink Dead Milkmen here. And Helena Bonham Carter is in her medium she played the witch Morganna in the movie Merlin as the dangerous and demented Bellatrix LeStrange.Battle scenes breathtaking. Commraderie The only HP that actually caused me to get teary so heartfelt are the portrayals of friendship and family.See the film knowing that unless you want a 10hour movie some things are going to have to go. Leave having enjoyed a film that takes the beans and water and instead of a nice large coffee treats one to a perfectly concentrated most artfully brewed and extremely tasty espresso. It has been said before but truth is truth BEST YET!".

While quite a bit of detail was lost in the movie how can you really expect a three hour movie to capture what takes Rowling hundreds of pages to explain? This said Yates did a great job capturing the spirit of the book and he had me on my seat from the first scene all the way through the end of the movie. I cried I laughed and I am pretty sure there were a few times where I couldn't breathe from the tension.What really made the movie for me was the talent of the actors. As expected the older cast members deliver some of the best acting England has to offer. Sidenote there is something about Emma Thompson where every time she cries in a movie I start tearing up myself. I was especially impressed with how much Daniel Emma Watson and Rupert have improved their acting since the last movie. Having come from seeing Daniel in Equus two weeks ago I was expecting a lot from him. Even after seeing him display more intensity than I thought possible on stage he surprised me in Phoenix. His emotions were so raw and genuine that I literally got goosebumps.Well done to the cast and crew! I can't wait for the next one!!".

The acting was a touch better and the effects were up to their normal standard but the complex involved plot that the novel provides was completely butchered on screen. I do understand that they cannot include every detail of an 800 page book but certain obvious details such as Lily Evans in Snape's memory any mention of Neville's inclusion in the prophecy the twoway mirror from Sirius the locket in Grimmauld Place Regulus Black...these details are important to future plots. They SHOULD make an appearance. The story doesn't make any sense without them. The memory itself my favorite scene in all six books so far is all of twenty seconds and the only characters you see clearly are James and Severus. Bellatrix says Avada Kedavra to kill Sirius. There is a reason JK Rowling did not specify the name of that jet of light that killed Sirius and by putting the noreturnspossible Avada Kedavra on it squashes any sort of believable return from him in future. While still visually appealing and though it hurts to type it the film is overall terrible. You can't make excuses for the plotmoving details that were left on the cutting room floor.".

	schema:reviewBody "Any Harry Potter movie is a special event so we chose Washington DC's finest movie theater the UPTOWN with its giant Cinerama curved screen and superior stereo laid down our 8 per ticket and expected the best.My guess is that when J K Rowling saw this movie she might have said Oh! God! No! What have they done to my book? The screen version is a mess from A to Z beginning with having no definable story wooden acting and throwing Rowling's message of GOOD vs EVIL in the trash.Lord Vandermort is still alive you see and Harry knows this but before he can convince others to take action a new teacher takes charge of Hogwart's throwing traditional school values away such as confronting evil. She reminds us of today's liberal teachers who hammer their agenda at the kids and deal with dissent via detention and other Nazilike decrees. Such a character cries out for a faceoff and rejection by the students but the plot is so poor that.........Harry Hermione and Ron lead some of the brave students to the Order of the Phoenix  which is no more than a secret room at Hogwart's lined with bookcases full of old books but devoid of any defined Code of Honor or any such thing to tell what Phoenix was all about.The acting is wooden and dreadful beginning with Dumbledor but is pervasive through the entire cast. I have a long standing crush on Hermione as played by Emma Watson but Miss Watson is given almost no opportunity to portray Hermione's strong character instead reduced to A Teamlike walks alongside Harry and Ron. Her dialog is way shorter than my review. Rupert Grint  I don't recall Ron as having a word of dialog. Harry kisses an Asian girl with Hermione and Ron watching. We get no indication whether Hermione cares or whether she and Ron are now a pair.By using waytoofamiliar tricks such as swooping zoom lens swipes and a wall of noise style musical score the film tries to convey that a story some sort of conflict is going on but nothing is happening.Another thing is the magic  which is undefined in terms of purpose or limits. Whenever the filmmakers lose confidence in their plotstarved storytelling they rely on suddenly smashing glass and other noisy nonsense  in no way like other Potter films where you knew the how and why.Finally I don't believe for one second that 11500 moviegoers input a score of 10 for Order of Phoenix. Too often recently it's obvious of studio meddling to spoil honest input to the IMDb website. Studios have been buying good reviews in newspapers for decades it just makes sense they'd corrupt input to this site. Order of the Phoenix is a dreadful trashing of J K Rowling and no real Harry Potter fan would score this mess a 10. As a Security person I have no idea how to prevent studio feed into these ratings  still allowing you and me access but shame on them.".

This film should have been the Empire Strikes Back of the series with a few great bits of action and lots and lots of set up with a OK pay off that left you counting the days till the next film. Instead we get a VERY VERY VERY watered down version of the story with changes so people with a short attention span don't have to remember anything about this film for the next one. At least with the last 4 films the story was the underscore to the action or special effects with this one none of that came across. This film turned into a disjointed grouping of odd scenes with nothing really to 1. set the time line of the over all film and 2. does nothing to forward the ongoing story of good vs. evil.The basic story is Harry is a whinny 15 year old who no one believes does not listen to anyone and wants to be all EMO about it till he screws up and leads everyone into Voldemort's trap. While in the actual book all of this is about 250 of the 900 pages but in the film version it is turned into about 10 minutes of a 2 hour 18 minute film. The key scenes from the book are some what included in some way even if the story that should have been told as part that scene is put some place and some time else. The wrap up which has been done very well in the last 4 films at the end with a slap in the face to help everyone understand what they just saw is done in such a haphazard in the very start of what should have been a great battle that you don't even remember what was said.The only 3 things I would say that did help this movie were 3 of the new characters which were all very under used. Dolores Umbridge who is done perfectly in this film as the condescending new DADA teacher which they really missed out on not going deeper with her which I am sure is because she is only in this one book because she could have stolen the film. Luna Lovegood who to my surprise did come across almost better then she did in the books as the out there 4th year Ravenclaw but was used as a narrative character to explain plot holes and be background filler with Neville and Ginny rather then be one of the stand out characters that they all should have been. But the character that made the best transition from book to film had to be Kreacher which falls right behind the story as my biggest let down in the film because he was so under used only 2 scenes and was never really explained to the audience of what his reason for being was. Those 3 almost make up for the complete loss of purpose for characters such as Tonks Bellatrix Lestrange and even Grawp. But can not even start to make up for the rest of the film.If you are a fan of the book DO NOT SEE THIS FILM!!!! If you have never took the time to read the books and only see the films take my advice READ THE BOOKS!".

	schema:headline " The first milestone. Sinister mystery of Hogwarts.";
	schema:reviewBody "... The magical power that came to Joan Rowling from a different world pulls for itself and the book is read in one breath.Book Review December 18 2000The second book about the adventures of the young wizard Harry Potter world waited impatiently. And finally he waited. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets appears before the reader's eyes with a bright and original work. Of course it relies on the first book but it remains individual. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  a darker and more terrible book unlike the first. So became the film. But the film and the book have not lost their charm and easy immediacy. It's still the same kind of fairy tale about the fight between good and evil where good will certainly win.The magical world of Harry Potter has not changed. All the same oblique streets of London the splendor of Hogwarts the Forbidden Forest with its secret inhabitants The slanting alley the eerie Lute Lane the unfriendly Rattling Willow the huge school yard the stunning quidditch. All this was preserved and was moved by magic wave in the second film only slightly transformed. Hogwarts is a bright and active participant in all events. This castle which became home for Harry is no less important character than our young hero. Hogwarts carries in itself tying knowledge and great wisdom. This huge majestic building knew a lot in its time. And all its secrets its architecture and attract the eye.In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets we meet the amazing and frightening creatures of the magical world. Dobby's elf is very cute and funny. In such a small frail body is hidden a wide soul suffering in vain. He does his best to protect Harry from danger. But Harry Potter like a magnet attracts them. Favorite animal Hagrid turns into an unpleasant monster  a giant giant spider Aragog. He is wise old but does not inspire confidence. And on top of everything the mighty dangerous serpent Basilisk appears on the screen. There are many legends about this snake and Joan Rowling decided to add it to her epic. And in principle not in vain. He inspires reverence and horror but at the same time a frank desire for Harry to finish him off quickly. Another amazing character in the film is Phoenix Fawkes. Amazing bird flown from the pages of the book to the screen. She is an ancient mythical creature dying and rising from the ashes. It reminds us of the eternal cycle of life and death.Special effects in the film in other ways as in the first not at altitude. But even seeing a few implausible spiders and a snake you believe everything that is happening on the screen. The magical mysterious magical and frankly amazing world of Harry Potter draws and you just do not want to return to reality. Chris Columbus who became the director of the Potters for the second time could not lose the charm and atmosphere of the first film. Just the movie Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets became more sinister frightening and full of dangers.Characters have not changed. Bright alive emotionally embodied on the screen of their heroes magnificent English actors. The cold and tough Potions master Severus Snegg performed by Alan Rickman the same adamant Minerva McGonagall the wise director of the Hogwarts School Albus Dumbledore the eternal memory of Richard Harris who died three weeks before the premiere of the film the kindhearted forester Hagrid. Pleased with new characters. Lucius Malfoy performed by Jason Isaacs is cruel adamant. It just blows something negative and extremely unpleasant. Zlatopust Lokons is the lifebuilder reclining on the laurels of others. He turned out to be too sugary pretty I would even say sugary. And undoubtedly the actor Kenneth Bran is on top. His character or rather his performance is very ironic.The unchanged trio of the main characters remained the same. Harry Potter is the star of the magical world the orphan boy who grew up in disgusting muggles displays remarkable courage desperation and determination. The one with which courage he rushes into battle you can just envy. I'm torn by internal contradictions his similarity with Lord Voldemort his knowledge of the snake tongue. He is afraid of all this. And Harry desperately tries to understand himself. But when you need to become a hero he is ready for this because he is a hero in the full sense of the word. He is ready to give his own life for others. Is this not the highest manifestation of heroism? But Harry does not boast of it. And this is a huge plus to his character.I'm sure that Mr. Potter will always be there to save us.  Certainly.Lucius Malfoy and Harry Potter.Ron Weasley remained absolutely the same except for the character. He transformed becoming better. His behavior towards Hermione when she was insulted by Draco calling her a Mudblood his courage in the Forbidden Forest among not one hundred spiders whom he fears until his death causes respect and approval.Hermione Granger is still the same smart girl with a lively mind and a great intellect. She is very natural and sincerely wants to help others. With her character there are certain metamorphoses. Hermione clearly ceases to be such an avid guardian of order.We are badly influenced by it.Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.Tom Narvolo Reddle is the past of the cruelest magician of the magical world of Lord Volan de Mort. This character is interesting with his striking resemblance to Harry. They are like halves of one whole. Harry has collected all the good and positive in Voldemort everything is bad and negative. They are very similar but they are very different. The choice. That's what makes Harry the way he is and distinguishes him from a dark magician. Choosing Harry to live the life he wants. His choice.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  a magical mysterious full of magic amazing and terrible creatures canvas director Chris Columbus. For the second time we stepped into this unique world full of mysteries and terrible discoveries. Music Gothic entourage Hogwarts and unchanging heroes in the fight against evil welcome to the magical world of Harry Potter created by the hand of a fabulous storyteller Joan Rowling.".

I don't know about you  but I HATE it when movie makers change the storylines add or remove characters and do it for the sake of the art. I think they do it because they are too lazy to create their own storys so they rip off other peoples ideas and crush them to make it more comfortable... If a book is loved by millions of readers there must be a good reason for that. Chris Columbus has captured the essence of the book on screen. So after philosophers stone he delivered again!When reading the book I always envisioned Michael Crawford playing Gilderoy Lockhart. His broad smile and clumsiness  la Frank Spencer would have been perfect for the role. But instead we get to see Kenneth Branagh so of course you won't see ME complain. The great find of the movie is Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy. In his short scenes onscreen he makes your blood freeze. And again all the casting is brilliant. Every character just feels right  even if you imagined something different when you read the book. There also has been talk about the young actors getting older. Well let me remind you that this also happens in the books. In every book Harry Potter and his friends are one year older. So there's no excuse to take the roles away from Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. I couldn't imagine someone else playing their parts.Go see the chamber of secrets.

Ron's father Arthur and the mysterious Dobby the house elf fortunately he isn't anywhere near as annoying as other CG characters in other movies but I won't name any names... coughJarJarBinkscoughThe movie sticks closely to the novel but as in the last movie we miss some of those scenes where we start to learn a little more about the characters especially the hatehate relationship between Harry and Professor Snape who was seriously underused in this movie!All in all it's definitely worth checking out the running time of 160 minutes may seem a little long but it doesn't seem that long when you're watching it.

There's a darker atmosphere this time around and more characters are introduced including Gilderoy Lockhart hilariously played by Kenneth Branagh Draco Malfoy's father Lucius a great performance by Jason Isaacs exactly how I imagined the character from the books! Ron's father Arthur and the mysterious Dobby the house elf fortunately he isn't anywhere near as annoying as other CG characters in other movies but I won't name any names... coughJarJarBinkscoughThe movie sticks closely to the novel but as in the last movie we miss some of those scenes where we start to learn a little more about the characters especially the hatehate relationship between Harry and Professor Snape who was seriously underused in this movie!All in all it's definitely worth checking out the running time of 160 minutes may seem a little long but it doesn't seem that long when you're watching it.

I chose to read it to them so we could ALL enjoy it...and we did!  Naturally the kids were excited when the movie came out.  However when I saw the first Harry Potter I was terrified it was going to be butchered like most books to movies are but was pleasantly surprised by the relatively stick to the book script it displayed.  Sure some things were left out undoubtedly due to time constraints but overall it conveyed the story well.Chamber of Secrets did this even better.As an avid reader I am quite hesitant to see my beloved books displayed on screen only to have the directors do them no justice.  However with both Harry Potter movies the visuals were spectacular the acting well done and the characters almost perfectly matched.  The set design for Diagon Alley and the Weasley house was fabulous!  How wonderful to see these places come to life outside of our imaginations!  This stays true for nearly every aspect of Hogwarts...from the greenhouse to the moving staircases the dorms and Dumbledore's office.  Daniel Radcliffe Rupert Grint and Emma Watson do superb jobs of playing Harry Ron and Hermione.  The movie undoubtedly draws you in and makes you forget that this isn't real...quite an acheivement!Of course not all moviegoers will enjoy this one.  It is not for the diehard action fan the horroronly fans or those that dislike a bit of magic imagination and fantasy.  But for the rest of us Chamber of Secrets accurately depicts what until now only our imaginations could see. Children will love this for the wizardry and magic the struggle between Harry and his foes the friendships that abound and the simple fun of it all while adults will love it for bringing them back to a time when magic was indeed real.All in all I give this a 5 out of 5...fantastically done.  Of course I would have liked to see a bit more scenes from the book added but I understand time restrictions.  Great film and a definite must see!".

The 1st hour is pure laugh out loud fun the adults in my Cinema audience were shouting with laughter!.

This film is not about 'Oscars'  Acting despite the fabulous performances by all the adults it is about enjoying the overall effect of the film this being to give the viewer a long lasting buzz. Brilliant! The staging is very theatrical in it's minimalism yet extravagantly arty in visual specifics. In the not to distant future I see fans going to a regular weekend slot at their local cinema for Audience Participation fun. Wands swords sorting hat spiders mandrakes  crucial ear muffs as standard props! Lots of gaps for us to shout out funny quips. A Rocky Horror Show Audience Participation Show for kids! Long overdue.My Rating 810. Not a masterpiece of cinematic potential but such jolly good fun that no one should be denied the joy of a Bloody Marvelous frolic. A film for the child within us adults. Go see it with a predominantly adult audience if you want to experience the real buzz of unfettered emotion. Only three children were present at the Preview I witnessed and they were silently spellbound whereas the adults evoked emotion noisily throughout and then stood up cheered and applauded at the end! I shall never forget this truly magical experience.Richard Harris you can not be replaced you will always be Dumbledore and hence Omnipresent.

	schema:headline " Not the target of this movie...but still enjoyable.";
	schema:reviewBody "Not being a fan of the Harry Potter Movies I toddled along to the first showing of this movie at my local UGC Cinema and sat down and thirly enjoyed this movie but not in the way that I would enjoy something like the Lord of The Rings or SpiderMan. Of course Harry Potter's target audience is of a younger age so I can see how I might not have enjoyed it as much as a slightly younger audience but to say the least it is a lot better than some of the crap that is fizzled out these days. Crap this is not and a year on the main characters are a lot older taller and voices broken. Many of the original cast return and a few new characters appear in this such as Kenneth Branagh and Jason Isaacs. Kenneth Branagh plays a wonderful part of Gilderoy Lockhart who seems to think he's adored by all and quite frankly he is adored by women for his charm and bravery. He was one of the better bits in the movie as was Jason Isaacs who played Lucius Malfoy father of Draco.  Jason sports a nice long wig and plays the evil fathervillian down to a T.  He plays it much like his villian in The Patriot. I was sometimes phased by Rupert Grint's Ron. He isn't that great an actor but he could play his part satisfactory. He could have done better but then again I have not read the book so I would not know how Ron would have behaved. I guess the scenes he played a scary person which was quite a lot in weren't convincing enough for me but kids should get a good laugh out of him more than I did. I suppose you can't hold it against the kids who aren't up to par because they're just young and learning the actors trade but for those who play their part well they should get a pat in the back. The SFX were impressive especally the character of Dobby. He was well great. I couldnt tell he was CG by his bad creation but through the fact there was no way they could have done it otherwise. In fact the CG character of Dobby is very similar looking to Gollum in Lord of The Rings and the CG Asgard in television series Stargate SG1 speaking of textures which which speaks well for Stargate SG1 if it can do just as good as a top movie like this...and top it is. The CG Spiders were incredibly creepy and realistic looking. Not being too scared of Spiders they kind of made me jump. I felt by body tense up as the gave case to Harry and Ron which is a good thing because not often do I find myself doing this in movies. The person I had sat beside seemed pretty scared of the spiders as well.John Williams score was very much like his original score with old themes returning and some of the music sounding like music from his Indiana Jones scores. I found myself whistling the main theme of Harry Potter for most of the night and on occasion not realizing I was doing it until someone else pointed it out to me.  This movie certainly had better action sequences and a lot more action geared than The 1st Potter movie. I found myself clenching up at points as they were really tense. The story wasn't too difficult to understand from a nonpotterfan point of view and the film was a lot shorter than I expected. I had thought it ran for three hours when it was more like 2 12. In some cases I found that you had to have seen the 1st movie to understand some of what was going on but that was mainly due to the back story of he who shall not be uttered and some of the gags. The only thing that annoyed me was that the cues in the Foyer were too long and I couldnt get an ice cream and there was some little toddler crying down the front row for a few minutes midway. Why bring a toddler who's going forget about the film by next week? You may ask this yourself.  If you're not a madpotterfan then I would suggest you wait a few weeks so that you're not over run with humans who stand 4 feet tall...ie. CHILDREN! I'm not talking about DwarvesI'd give it 8.510. But I am not a huge fan of these movies and I am not the target audience.  That's a good thing in case you were wondering.".

However their growing up along with the physical blossoming of their friend Hermione the perky and smart actress Emma Watson seem mark a general growing up of the whole Harry Potter series.  This one is more for grownups  the first one hooked the kid demographic and no doubt they will still be enraptured by Chamber of Secrets.  This is the film however that hopes to attract a whole new audience in the parents of those kids.  It is darker and has more layers. The explanations about wizardry are less cursory and the acting seems stronger.I have never read the books so I bring an outlook to the films that is free of personal bias toward the quality of the adaptation or the faithfulness to Rowling's words.  One thing this film does do that the first one did not is it made me want to read the books.  I was more drawn in in a literary sense to the world to the stories and particularly to the characters. Whereas the first film was a passable introduction to everything Harry Potter is about this seems like a deeper riff on some of the same themes that the first one only glossed over.However I might not have enjoyed Chamber of Secrets as thoroughly if I had not first seen Sorcerer's Stone.  It gave me and Chris Columbus' production team a framework that invited expansion.  Without the background of the first film I might not have been as emotionally invested in Hagrid Robbie Coltrane or have understood the mechanics of Quidditch or even have cared about the tenuous future of Hogwarts School for Wizards.In a word the performances are marvelous.  I read somewhere that Rowling wrote with a Dickensian sense of character and that seems to carry over to the film.  Robbie Coltrane as the affable Hagrid is still my favorite. Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman are woefully underused in this film but I can only hope they will resurface in the others they can still steal their scenes with the tiniest pursing of the lips or eye flickers.  As a side note  Outside of Coltrane's Hagrid I find Rickman's Professor Snape the most interesting and multilayered character across both films.  Richard Harris is suitably noble and wily in one of his last roles.  And Kenneth Branagh as the egomaniacal new Hogwarts professor and author of wizardry books is perfectly cast and very funny.  One thing this film does is allow room to explore these characters in a full sense and give the audience time to get under their skin.Chris Columbus has been called a tactless director and I can see where some of his scenes particularly the action ones are played so broadly that they lose all semblance of meaning.  He is not particularly adept at handling the young actors who come across as pretty bland and uninteresting Rupert Grint as Ron is sort of annoying overplaying the stuff that was likeable at first.  Likewise he is unable to invigorate some of the scenes the car scenes the spider scene and even the final encounter between Harry and the Chamber of Secrets' monster come off as overlong and particularly flat. The running time of 2 hours and 41 minutes is a bit exorbitant  To me it just suggests that Columbus doesn't have the necessary audacity to deviate too much from Rowling's source material.  I know that he has to maintain a certain level of faithfulness to the books but to be honest what is exciting on the page does not always translate well onscreen.  Perhaps Alfonso Cuaron slated to direct the new film will have a better snappier sense of how to energize the action scenes without losing the obvious positives of sticking to the novels.However the movie did energize me enough to want to go and read the books. The scope the palette of yes Dickensian characters and the intertwining of stories makes me want to see how Rowling fits it all together.  Then maybe I'll be able to talk more intelligently about faithfulness when Cuaron releases Prisoner of Azkaban.'  Maybe I'll undergo a massive reading program this holiday season.".

Or are there? A mysterious house elf named Dobby seems to think so as he repeatedly tries to prevent Harry from returning to school and keeps asking him to leave when students start being attacked by a supernatural unknown foe.

He has also made interesting choices when it comes to the new faces in the adult group Branagh is very very funny as the egofueled Lockhart a role originally intended for Hugh Grant but the most interesting addition is Jason Isaacs whom I can't wait to see again in the fourth film as Lucius Malfoy an intriguingly sinister wizard who is as racist and arrogant as his son Harry's archnemesis Draco. As for Dobby a CG creature voiced by Toby Jones he is interesting at first but rapidly becomes annoying his masochistic antics being repetitive and a little dull.Finally a special mention for Chamber's best element Richard Harris who sadly passed away a few weeks before the movie's premiere. He was and is incredibly good as headmaster Dumbledore and despite a worthy replacement Michael Gambon in the purists' hearts he will always be the one and only greatest wizard of all time.Verdict good but they could have done better.

It got even better with the third installment which has been my personal favorite of the four I've seen now.I don't buy into all the occult baloney and black magic stuff just enjoying the specialeffects that go with it with these stories. It also was interesting to see how the three young stars  Daniel Radcliff Harry Emma Watson Hermione and Rupert Grint Ron have physically matured since the first movie. All of a sudden the boys have reached puberty and their voices are changing. Ron squeaks half the time he talks!As with many modernday bigbudget films the visuals the specialeffects and the surround sound are all astounding. Definitely entertaining for all ages with no worries about language.".

The acting from Daniel Radcliffe was criticised by some in the first film and still others are bleating on about him now. Give it a rest say I. He was excellent.Hogwarts itself really comes to life largely due to the camera shots sweeping in through a window or over the castle  it feels a lot more 'rounded' and the Quidditch match benefits from a makeover and improved SFX.Unlike some other fantasy films the CGI is not over used and doesn't smother the screen.If you've read other reviews you'll know Kenneth Branagh is wonderful as Lockhart and you have to stay to the end credits to see what happens to himJason Isaacs is great as Lucius Malfoy and overall the film is scarier and darker then the first film and there is a very touching moment involving Hermione and Ron which was performed with wonderful understatement by Rupert and Emma.Throughout the whole 2 hours I don't think I stopped smiling. The Whomping Willow the flying car the duel between Draco and Harry  every scene was a joy to behold.To those critics who keep on comparing Potter to Lord of the Rings and finding the former wanting one person even laughingly suggested Christopher Columbus was ripping it offbear in mind that Philospher's Stone is the second biggest film of all time behind Titanic  beating Rings. I use this only to illustrate the popularity and success of Harry Potter as so many people seem to find it inferior. I for one was left cold by Rings and was thoroughly bored by it  it was the least magical fantasy film I had ever seen.

	schema:headline " You're bland Harry...";
	schema:reviewBody "The second in the Harry Potter franchise 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' was clearly intended for small children. While this approach did work with 'The Philosopher's Stone' as the happy Disney esque atmosphere reflected Harry's idealism of a wizarding world that was perfect a slightly moody and mature tone would have been far more suitable for CoS since this is when our Boy Who Lived starts to realise the darker side of being a wizard and being a hero. In this film twelveyearold Harry is now in his Second Year at Hogwarts when the school is subjected to mysterious attacks that leave Muggleborn students incapacitated. Harry Ron and Hermione quickly learn a creature is stalking the school a monster that lives in a secret chamber and was once responsible for the death of a child.The quality of the child acting still leaves much to desired with Rupert Grint and Tom Felton shining out above their weaker contemporaries. It is left to the adult cast to provide the solid performances which they do to a marvellous degree. Maggie Smith as McGonagall and Alan Rickman as Snape seem born to play their roles bringing their characters to life in a way the child actors just can't do. Kenneth Branagh is a treat as the conceited campy Lockhart and the scenes where he and Rickman's Snape play each other off are the best in the film. Jason Issacs also deserves a mention since he was deliciously evil as Lucius Malfoy. He and Tom Felton not only look like father and son but in a minutelong scene they were able to portray Draco's heroworship of his father and Lucius' impatience with his son.The main problem with the film is that it has been produced in a very dull bland manner. Instead of focusing on Harry's uncomfortable realisation that the wizarding world has problems and his shock at how quickly the school turn against him at the barest of evidence scriptwriter Steve Kloves and director Chris Columbus seem intent on making the film a magical version of an Enid Blyton boarding school where kids merrily skip around solving problems. The vain attempts to make the film threatening such as the overlylong flying car scene as if anyone thought Harry was going to fall out and the trudge through the Forbidden Forest are flat and weak. The final battle between Harry and his unmasked enemy are also lacklustre with no spontaneity and drag on for too long. Character development hasn't improved much either with Ron continuing to be dumbed down for comic relief while we have Hermione getting Ron and Dumbledore's lines and in the case of the latter it just sounds odd hearing words of wisdom said by an powerful elderly wizard in the book being uttered by a child of twelve in the film.CoS also drops a number of points in my mind for the crass cheesy overlysentimentality of the ending. Steve Kloves must have been in Hollywood saccharine mode when he thought that pupils in British high schools would honestly clap for teachers especially ones who have done nothing to warrant such praise and kids hugging teachers in front of everyone. Harry would have been beaten up and bullied for being a boy of twelve who cuddles into his teacher like a wimpy little girl. And the preceding scene where Lucius confronts Harry was also cavityinducing with the modest hero of the novels coming across as an arrogant smug little brat. Kloves not only needs to reread the book but he should spend more time with real kids at high school if this is how he thinks they conduct themselves.While CoS was enjoyable enough it was still a mediocre take of the novel. It was evident that it was produced to keep little kids happy rather than a love for the series or to please the actual fans. I did like it but I still feel so envious of the LotR fans who get an epic film trilogy that matches up to the excellence of books and I wonder if HP will ever be that great.".

	schema:reviewBody "Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets is the type of movie that will be around forever. So far the two Harry Potter movies have been excellent movies in which spirit of the books by JK Rowling has been captured and expanded upon. Chamber of Secrets is about Harry Potter's Daniel Radcliffe second year in Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry and something is attacking the students. The fact that these students are of mixed parentage one being a mugglenonmagical and the other being a witch or wizard leads to a very unstable environment at Hogwarts. Directed by Chris Columbus and written by Steve Kloves this movie packed with the details that Rowling weaves throughout her book. The score by John Williams is excellent and well suited to the movie. Roger Pratt's cinematography is amazing. There is flashback to an earlier time at Hogwarts by way of a magical Diary that is brilliantly lit and shot in a sepia tone that looks just like the color of old paper. Kenneth Branagh gives a great performance that should have gotten more attention at award time. Jason Isaacs owns the role of the villainous Lucius Malfoy. His costuming and look are very well matched with that of Draco Malfoy a nemesis of Harry's. Shirley Henderson as a ghost is also very good and steals her scenes. Returnees Maggie Smith Alan Rickman Robbie Coltrane and in particular the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore are very good. Christian Coulson does a good job as the  mysterious Tom Riddle.Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson Hermione and Rupert Grint Ron are very good in this movie and have their characters down. Watson in particular is excellent. Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets in an underrated movie that is a must see.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was one of those people that read Philosopher's Stone after I'd seen the film. Enjoyed it so much I read the other three books all excellent. Problem is though because I'd seen the film first the pictures you conjure up in your mind while reading the other books all tend to follow the faces and locations that you have seen in the film you simply adapt it to the new plots and locations. Chamber of Secrets is pretty much exactly as I pictured it when reading the book. In fact as the closing credits rolled I felt like I had seen it before...This isn't a criticism at all the filmmakers have done a great job of translating this book to the big screen far more thoroughly than Philosopher's Stone. With this film there isn't too much that's left out. Whilst I know Chamber Of Secrets is gonna get and is already getting loads of fantastic reviews I have to say I found it a bit flat. I thought the first film was great fun and quite magical although I'm afraid I disagree that the acting was great. Personally I thought the 3 children leads were pretty poor especilly Emma Watson as Hermione the way she delivers some lines made me cringe! People often passoff child performances as well they're only children but watch Natalie Portman in Leon or Haley Joel Osment to see quality child acting! Not much has changed here although it is amusing to hear Harry and Ron with newly acquired broken voices... they'll be shaving next!Apart from a larger part for Richard Harris excellent as Dumbledore  will be sadly missed it seemed that Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and the wonderful Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall hardly had any screen time in this one. Perhaps it was that way in the book can't remember. Shame though...Was disappointed in the Quidditch match here. Being one of the best scenes in the first film I expected a fullon assault for Chamber Of Secrets. We join the game towards the end it consists mainly of Harry and Malfoy flying round and round underneath the seating stalls and is over way too quickly.Kenneth Branagh seemed a very strange choice for the hilarious Gilderoy Lockhart. I always imagined a character like Terry Thomas when reading the books. I never thought I'd say this about Kenneth Branagh but he actually seems to underplay the part rather than wallop it with a sledgehammer like he usually does. One thing that did bug me... the soundtrack. The Philosophers Stone was great. Another classic John Williams score. Problem is rather than write a new score that kept the main spirit of the original which John Williams did brilliantly in the Star Wars trilogy they seemed to have lifted entire bits of music used in the first film particularly the dramatic parts that you associate with a certain scene from Philosophers Stone and transplanted it into Chamber Of Secrets! Couldn't help thinking... cheap... cheap... cheapThree of us went to see this film at a preview screening last night and chatting afterwards we all felt basically the same way. Good film good fun but lacking the spark that made the first film so magical. Maybe because part of the fun of Philosopher's Stone was being introduced to this strange quirky new world and its characters. In Chamber Of Secrets we are now familiar with this so the story takes centre stage and at the end of the day... it aint that strong.710".

	onyx:emotionText "I was one of those people that read Philosopher's Stone after I'd seen the film. Enjoyed it so much I read the other three books all excellent. Problem is though because I'd seen the film first the pictures you conjure up in your mind while reading the other books all tend to follow the faces and locations that you have seen in the film you simply adapt it to the new plots and locations. Chamber of Secrets is pretty much exactly as I pictured it when reading the book. In fact as the closing credits rolled I felt like I had seen it before...This isn't a criticism at all the filmmakers have done a great job of translating this book to the big screen far more thoroughly than Philosopher's Stone.

Frankly I don't care if the scriptwriters left this bit or that bit out it is simply impossible for all parts of any novel to be completely included in a film without turning it into an epic of a minimum of seven hours which is ridiculous.  That is the nature of a film much over twoandahalf hours and the theatres are only going to be able to show a limited number of screenings which will of necessity limit the profit to be made on the filmand the bottom line of any film project is How much of a profit will it make?.  And of course how many people are going to be able to sit through it without multiple bathroom breaks?  I had to run out myself once cursing just when they were about to follow the spiders...I found the casting to be clever and appropriate of special note is of course the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore and I wonder if they will make the obvious choice to replace him in the next movie with Max von Sydow who could be made to look and sound exactly the same? as well as the return of Robbie Coltrane and Alan Rickman.  Both of these actors can actually act as opposed to simply being screen personalities.  The visual effects are stunning although just a little too obviously digital in more than a few cases.  The story is easily followed which is more than I could say for the original books.  The pacing was almost perfect I only looked at my watch twicemy measure for a movie in which I am immersed.  Both times occurred I might add when I was distracted by Rupert Grint's voice obviously crackingthey're going to have to do something about the fact that their stars are definitely more than a few miles down the road of adolescence.This movie of course is raking in the cash.  Deservedly so it's not by any stretch of the imagination a movie of any deep and lasting meaning but it gives good value for one's entertainment dollar and at the scandalous prices that movie admissions are reaching now that is certainly a ringing endorsement.  It was able to take me away from the insanity of a stressful holiday season and for that reason alone I was completely satisfied.  See if it can do the same for you.".

It has an appeal for the whole family as does the first one and it has some charm and excitement in its Quiddich battle scenes but it isn't really always the sort of material that might stay with you long after it's over unless of course you're a hardcore fan. It works at best in the form of the atypical sequel same characters that like Potter just as much his closest friends Ron and Hermonie and those that don't like Snape and Malfoy. Although the filmstory does set up hewhomusnotbenamed in a good and ambiguous way this is more in hindsight of the more recent Potter stories where that is made much more clear and sinister. It does have some rousing bits in there as I recall John Cleese is particularly good as Nearly Headless Nick basically plopping a Monty Python performer in the midst of it all which is the case and there's always Richard Harris as Dumbledore I still prefer him over Gambon even though the latter is still good. But a lot of it seems much too clich even coming from the decent lot of Rowling subversions and the whole bits with the character Dobby is just really cheesy. In short it's the only one of the Potter movies I don't have a desire to see too soon and if I ever do read the books I only anticipate it can only go up from here in quality.".

I'm sorry to report that he definitely has not.There are so many things wrong with this film and almost nothing to recommend it. More than twoandahalf hours are spent rolling around in pure tedium  only the REALLY easily pleased will be entertained. The story has a slightly harder tone than the first but there is nothing on display that will discomfort anyone of any age.Harry is being mentally tortured and starved by his muggle family during the summer holidays. He longs to go back to Hogwarts but a JarJar Binks lookalike elf called Dobby turns up in his bedroom and warns him that terrible things await him there. It's six of one and half a dozen of the other for Harry as the Dursleys can be just as evil as anything the chamber of secrets has to offer.Once Harry gets to school  by means of a flying Ford Anglia  his fellow pupils are frozen with fear at the slightest glimpse of something evil. Harry hears voices in the walls that no one else can. And he suffers from the incompetence of the new Defence Against The Black Arts teacher Gilderoy Lockhart Kenneth Branagh totally miscast who is not as funny as in the book.Five minutes after we are reintroduced to the students and teachers the film slips into a clumsy mishmash of poorly staged scenes and bad acting. First time around it was easy to turn a blind eye to the amateurism of these kids. But there's no excusing it now. They've had a year to study their performances and see what was right and wrong  I know I know they're only kids. Trust me none of them will be thanking the Academy anytime soon which makes most of their scenes difficult to watch. Even with the support of such talent as Richard Harris Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith  Robbie Coltrane is seriously underused  they cannot handle the weight of the material. Their acting seems a few seconds behind the adults and any scene with them together has big contrasts between veteran and novice.Steven Kloves' screenplay tears out many pages and cuts so many corners from J.K. Rowling's book  once again Rik Mayall is completely left out  in order to keep a tight pace. Yet the film still manages to be dull and boring. Nothing REALLY happens. And there are far too many pauses and silences in dialogue scenes  an absolute crime in a film of this length. With the exception of the chamber of secrets  which holds precious few secrets I might add  no part of Hogwarts is explored. Almost the entire movie is shot in a generic corridor and you can bet your bottom dollar that for the other locations Columbus just shot the same set from a different angle. The lighting is conveniently yellowcandlelit when he wants it to be mysterious or comfortable and green or blue when it should be menacing.Some credit should be given to the director for trying to make it a little bit darker than before. There's nothing visually disturbing but the sight of a petrified Hermione and the angles he uses for the film's many and lengthy dialogue scenes echo film noir rather than tame family friendly blockbuster.Aside from one quidditch match and the final showdown there is nothing of interest. The mystery is very weak and straightforward. There is too much talk and not enough action. It doesn't bode well for the rest of the series which has so far been equally as dull.All the best elements that made the original entertaining are not here. Hagrid has less than five minutes screen time and Columbus exploits our disappointment by giving him a big applause at the end. This did not happen in the book and he only does it because that's his style to force the audience to cry Home Alone Bicentennial Man.".

But Dudley''s character portrayed extremely well by Harry Melling is more atrocious and hateinspiring than ever.Dobby was a most endearing if rather buggering addition to the cast of characters this time around. We thoroughly enjoyed the Dobby effects perpetrated by the CGI technicians. His character while wholly nonhuman was quite sincere and entertaining.I don't have the problems with CGI in the movie industry with which many seem to suffer...I see that some parts cannot be portrayed by human actors therefore CGI enriches this final product in such a way that the lack of CGI actually would create a total loss of effect in the movie.This year is Ginny Weasley's first year and she has the crush of her young lifetime on Harry Potter.She's been talking about you all summer. Rather annoying really. Ronald Weasley to Harry Potter.This time Harry and Ron can't seem to get to the platform for Hogwarts Express and time is quickly wasting. If they are late for the opening ceremony it is entirely possible they will not be allowed to attend Howarts this year. What to do? What to do? Good thing for Harry that Mr. Weasley is a tinkerer or Harry and Ron would be in a world of trouble. But wait...it seems their only way to school is the flying car created by Ron's dad. And when they get to the castle grounds they discover they ARE in trouble. Big trouble.This movie is just as entertaining and well done as the first. Again directed by Chris Columbus who STILL neglected to do his homework and put that pumpkin patch and such where they needed to be the screenplay done as a joint collaboration between Rowlings and Steven Kloves as in the first and the same lovable and hateable actors in our favorite Worst Witch reincarnations.As sequels go this production is quite wonderful though not quite as excellent a sequel as was the original literary work. While there were as many changes in dialog and such it is quite well adapted and extremely well perpetrated although it does lose a bit in the process.There are secret whispers unheard by all but Harry himself mysterious magical books and a conjured beast of Dragonkind!This is a wonderful story not just the piece of commercial sequellistic fluff I expected. More secrets of Harry Potter's mysterious past are revealed and you get a good rumination of the back story.The addition of some of new teachers was a wonderful step and as in the first Rowlings creations are applied to this production with an inspired intelligence and creativity that it seems as though she herself is of magic. Absolutely wonderful.The message that prejudice is horrid comes through loud and clear in Malfoy's treatment Hermione. It made me want to tie his ears together and hang him up by the other end. While hatred itself is wrong if you must hate someone hate them for WHO they are their personality and the choices they make not for WHAT they are their lineage bloodline race or religion.Only when the heir of Slytherin house has returned to Hogwarts can the Chamber of Secrets be reopened and the evil within set loose.I was happy to see the inclusion of Dumbledore's Phoenix Fawkes. We did not get enough of him in the first movie. I enjoyed this movie just as much as the first. This is awesome as a sequel but it can also stand alone. It does not rely upon the first installment yet does not repeat the same information we learned in the first. While it was as faithful as it could be it as did the first failed to capture the atmospheric darkness and overall feeling of the novel. It was almost as if the faithfulness was more important than the ambiance which is a common mistake made in this industry.I must also add that the trio has shown some great improvement over their initial forays not that they needed it. It gets a 710 from...the Fiend .".

In the street a storm. The little boy lies on the floor of his room in a small shack and draws a finger in the sand with an inscription Happy Birthday Harry!. The cry of the soul he knows that no one will congratulate him no one will affably caress the top of his head. In a minute he will be eleven. Ten seconds ... Nine ... You can wake Dudley  just for laughing ... Three ... Two ... One ... A loud knock at the door there's no knock just a crash. There was someone behind the door and he was obviously going to come in.

Joan Rowling created an amazing magical world thanks to her millions of boys and girls began to look for a scar on their foreheads and with impatience and hope to wait for their 11th birthday. And I'm certainly happy about how Chris Columbus embodied this idea on the screen the fairy tale turned out to be absolutely childish very bright joyful and for some reason the word Christmas comes to mind although there is not so much Christmas there.Children's dream came true.

	schema:headline " The Magic Comes To Life!";
	schema:reviewBody "Once upon a time and not that long ago in the vivid fertile imagination of author J.K. Rowling a character was born  A boy.  A young boy named Harry who was destined to become one of the most beloved characters to emerge from a work of fiction in a long long time and was quickly embraced by young and old alike in all corners of the world.  And now thanks to the magic of the cinema Harry and his companions fairly leap from the pages of the novel to the silver screen in the phenomenal motion picture Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' directed by Chris Columbus and written for the screen by Steve Kloves.  Indeed Harry Potter is a boy but not just any boy because Harry Daniel Radcliffe just happens to be a wizard.  But orphaned as a baby Harry has been raised by his Aunt Petunia Fiona Shaw and Uncle Vernon Dursley Richard Griffiths who never let him in on the fact that he was well what he was.  It seems that Petunia didn't approve of her own sister Harry's mother because she was a witch nor of Harry's father because he too was a wizard.  When Harry turns eleven however the secret is out of the bag when after some strange goingson a giant of a man named Rubeus Hagrid Robbie Coltrane shows up at the Dursley's door to collect Harry and take him off to Hogwarts' a school for wizards and witches and all who would perfect the gift with which they were born  The gift of magic!  And from the moment Harry boards the train from station platform nineandthreequarters that will take him to his destiny the magic is alive for Harry and for the audience as well and it's a journey you will never forget.What a monumental undertaking to even think of attempting translating and transferring this passionately beloved work from novel to the screen. Because to millions of people Harry and his companions are so much more than merely characters in a book these are characters for whom people have made a special place in their hearts which puts a great burden of trust upon the man who would attempt to bring them to life.  And Chris Columbus it turns out was the right man for the job.  More than rising to the occasion and with some magic of his own and a lot of help from an extraordinarily talented cast and crew Columbus has delivered a film that is not only true to the story but true to the very spirit that makes Harry Potter so special.  The special effects are absolutely beyond astounding and Columbus with a keen eye for detail and without missing a beat keeps it all on track and moving right along at a pace and with a sense of timing that makes this an absorbing thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable experience from beginning to end.  From the opening frame you get the feeling that you're about to have a singular experience and you're right. Because you've just entered the world of Harry Potter.  And it's magic.Even having the best special effects do not a great movie make however and this film is no exception what catapults this one to the top are the performances beginning with Radcliffe whom you quickly forget is an actor playing a part.  And that about sums up what kind of a job this young man does here.  Without question he IS Harry Potter physically and emotionally and when he waves his wand and does what he does you believe it.  A wonderful performance by a gifted actor who has a great career ahead of him without question the perfect choice for the role of Harry.Also turning in excellent performances are Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley and Emma Watson as Hermione.  As with Radcliffe the casting here could not have been more perfect.  Grint is Everyboy' with that special glint in his eye and a manner that makes him especially endearing.  And the spunky Watson adds some real sparkle to the film as Hermione the one with the sense of urgency and the wherewithal to get things done a real role model for young girls everywhere.It's obvious that a lot of care went into the casting of this film and it's a big part of why it is so successful.  Richard Harris as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander Ian Hart as Professor Quirrell.  Exceptional performances from one and all with two that stand out as especially memorable  Robbie Coltrane who readily conveys the fact that Hagrid's heart is of a size that matches that of the man and Alan Rickman as Professor Severus Snape deliciously droll while demonstrating menace through the fine art of articulation.  The additional supporting cast includes John Cleese Nearly Headless Nick Warwick Davis Professor Flitwick Julie Walters Mrs. Weasley Zoe Wanamaker Madame Hooch Tom Felton Draco Malfoy Harry Melling Dudley and David Bradley Filch.  From Rowling's imagination to the written page to real life albeit via the movie screen Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a triumph many times over a unique film of truly universal appeal the likes of which is as rare as well a sorcerer's stone.  A film in which adults and children alike will rejoice because it speaks to the heart in a universal language of life love experience and imagination a film that states unequivocally that magic exists as long as there's a single child with a single dream somewhere in the world and real wizards like J.K. Rowling Chris Columbus Steve Kloves and every member of this wonderful cast and crew around to bring it to life as they have here.  An instant classic in every sense of the word this is truly a film for the ages.  A remarkable achievement this IS the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 1010.".

	onyx:emotionText "Once upon a time and not that long ago in the vivid fertile imagination of author J.K. Rowling a character was born  A boy.  A young boy named Harry who was destined to become one of the most beloved characters to emerge from a work of fiction in a long long time and was quickly embraced by young and old alike in all corners of the world.  And now thanks to the magic of the cinema Harry and his companions fairly leap from the pages of the novel to the silver screen in the phenomenal motion picture Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' directed by Chris Columbus and written for the screen by Steve Kloves.  Indeed Harry Potter is a boy but not just any boy because Harry Daniel Radcliffe just happens to be a wizard.  But orphaned as a baby Harry has been raised by his Aunt Petunia Fiona Shaw and Uncle Vernon Dursley Richard Griffiths who never let him in on the fact that he was well what he was.  It seems that Petunia didn't approve of her own sister Harry's mother because she was a witch nor of Harry's father because he too was a wizard.  When Harry turns eleven however the secret is out of the bag when after some strange goingson a giant of a man named Rubeus Hagrid Robbie Coltrane shows up at the Dursley's door to collect Harry and take him off to Hogwarts' a school for wizards and witches and all who would perfect the gift with which they were born  The gift of magic!  And from the moment Harry boards the train from station platform nineandthreequarters that will take him to his destiny the magic is alive for Harry and for the audience as well and it's a journey you will never forget.What a monumental undertaking to even think of attempting translating and transferring this passionately beloved work from novel to the screen. Because to millions of people Harry and his companions are so much more than merely characters in a book these are characters for whom people have made a special place in their hearts which puts a great burden of trust upon the man who would attempt to bring them to life.  And Chris Columbus it turns out was the right man for the job.  More than rising to the occasion and with some magic of his own and a lot of help from an extraordinarily talented cast and crew Columbus has delivered a film that is not only true to the story but true to the very spirit that makes Harry Potter so special.  The special effects are absolutely beyond astounding and Columbus with a keen eye for detail and without missing a beat keeps it all on track and moving right along at a pace and with a sense of timing that makes this an absorbing thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable experience from beginning to end.  From the opening frame you get the feeling that you're about to have a singular experience and you're right. Because you've just entered the world of Harry Potter.

	schema:headline " Wonderful adaptation but missing the satire of the book";
	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed this movie immensely. But like The Phantom Menace I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie my continuing thought was How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen? rather than How entertaining is this film overall? I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.Critics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book and perhaps I'd have had an easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed many classic children's movies like The Wizard of Oz and Mary Poppins are so successful partly because they're so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions in my experience most children's movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which they're based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children's book without a movie accompanying it has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of diehard fans any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. That's why it's easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.As a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a twoandahalf hour period the movie is beautifully done. I don't have a single complaint about any of the actors who successfully bring to life with the aid of costume design and special effects the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character the giant Hagrid is played by Robbie Coltrane and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It's as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape for some reason I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film Adventures in Babysitting Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances but I just don't. The remaining adult actors including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore are as good as they possibly could be and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role but that's exactly how the character is portrayed in the book modest unassuming and laidback. The kids who play Harry's two best friends are flawless.I had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of overthetop slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children's delayed reaction to a giant threeheaded dog they encounter and Harry's swallowing the quaffle ball there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire. Indeed I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors' faces at certain times. Overall however his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.But much is left out. Harry's caretaker Uncle Vernon a prominent character in the book is given less attention in the movie than some of the bit characters. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School aren't in the movie at all. We never see the ghostly history teacher who died several years back but kept on teaching. Lines like the followingProfessor McGonagall watched her students turn a mouse into a snuffboxpoints were given for how pretty the snuffbox was but taken away if it had whiskersfind no equivalent in the movie. The movie does include platform nineandthreequarters though the way the kids disappear into the wall isn't as mysterious as I had visualized and the sorting hat is there minus the great poem explaining the differences between the four schools.Not that I'm blaming the movie for omitting some details. Some things from the book would not have translated easily to the screen and it would have been very difficult to stick everything in. Had Columbus done so and allowed the film to be as long as necessary eight hours maybe? like a BBC miniseries the film might have been a masterpiece but few kids would ever have had the patience or attention span to sit through it.The problem is that the amusing details are much of what make Harry Potter such a special story. A whole universe is created in Rowling's series in which a magical society exists within our own ordinary muggle world and is kept secret by a bureaucracy with its own rules history and politics. The way magic is treated in her books not as something medieval but as very similar to the way our own contemporary world works is a large part of their charm. Take away these details and you're left with a fairly conventional tale of a young wizard fighting an evil sorcerer.Although the audience I was with broke into applause as soon as the movie ended something I've never seen happen before though I don't go to the theater that often some people have complained about the movie dragging at certain points. I didn't have that problem but as I said I wasn't really trying to get involved in the movie's story. After thinking about it it does seem like parts of the movie fail to convey a sense of urgency. Why should this be? I never felt that way when reading the books and this is without a doubt the very same story.The answer I think is that the books portray much of Harry's anxiety in trying to succeed in school for if he's kicked out he'll go straight back to his horrible uncle and fit in with the kids there. The movie doesn't tap into these anxieties enough so why should we care whether he wins the Quidditch match other than that he survives in one piece and gets through the school year? The only real suspense in the movie after he arrives at Hogwarts comes from the story of Lord Voldemort returning which in the book is almost secondary. Harry's adventures getting along in the school are fun and interesting but as they are presented to us in the film there isn't enough tying them all together.What we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful children's series but it doesn't entirely succeed in standing on its own. Perhaps it should have diverged from the book just a little to compensate for the difficulties in translating some of the book's delights to the screen. In its current form it's almost like a preview of the book. Its lack of fullness and its dependence on the book might actually increase the popularity and endurance of Rowling's series by making those who see the film yearn for more which they can get from the real thing.".

	schema:headline " Valiant successful attempt to bring the magic to life";
	schema:reviewBody "We live in a world where economics is hard. This forces practical limitations when making a movie. Time and money are sadly finite cinema owners need to be pleased as well as fans and computer animation ain't perfect. Given these limitations this film is about as close to human perfection as it is possible to achieve. However it's extremely clear what an immense challenge it is to turn Philosopher's Stone from book to film.Two and a half hours is not long to explore a wonderful magical world. Furthermore the directors have bowed to the inevitable temptation to show us things that cannot be communicated so effectively in a book. The consequence is the feeling of a slightly breathless sprint in places.It also means that the movie has to stay true to the spirit of the book rather than to the letter of it. There are omissions and there are changes. The changes that were made capture and maintain the spirit of the story really well indeed there are places where the story is more clearly and straightforwardly told in the movie than in the book. Some aspects of the story are fleshed out on screen and the additions are delightful completely in keeping with the flavour of the world.The humour of the movie is inevitably more visual than that of the book no belly laughs but a lot of smiles. Some punchlines have changed but the reasons why the jokes are funny remain the same. Not knowing exactly what's coming next is a good thing! It's all kept tasteful classy and above the belt there's nothing to cringe about.The voice acting is almost uniformly brilliant. However there are occasions where some of the actors are required to convey high emotions and are only given a second or two of face shot or headandshoulders shot to do so. This isn't as much freedom as they need and they fall a little short. The blame here must fall on the decision to give the actors too much to do too quickly not on the actors themselves.Other than these rare jarring instances the physical acting is frequently excellent and seldom less than completely adequate judged against the highest of targets set by the book's clear emotion descriptions.Dan Radcliffe has the look the mannerisms and the charm of Harry down pat. His strongest expressions are the bemusement that must be inherent at entering a world where science does not rule alone and the bravery that Harry shows in his achievements. Emma Watson possibly slightly overplays Hermione but does so in a fully endearing fashion. There's one scene which gives her too little chance to truly express panic otherwise her performance needs no changes.Rupert Grint has comic timing way beyond his years hitting Ron's lines perfectly. Tom Felton makes a stylish Draco Matt Lewis' Neville character suffers from the acceleration so the finale does come as a slight characterisation shock.The Phelps brothers' Fred and George are distinctively cheeky rather than proactive pranksters Chris Rankin imbues Percy with genuine authority. Sean Biggerstaff shines his Oliver Wood is likeable and an ideal Quidditch team captain.Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid is the single dominant adult character with maximum laughs extracted at every step. The movie changes strongly exaggerate one side of Hagrid's nature though probably inevitable considering how much plot exposition his character has.David Bradley has a vicious Argus Filch John Hurt's Ollivander is an eccentric treat giving a wonderful introduction to the Wizarding World. The professors are uniformly excellent though Richard Harris' Dumbledore comes off as disappointingly flat until the end.The most ambitious point of the movie is the computer generated imagery. The stills are wonderful but the fastest animation is restricted by the limitations of realworld technology. The book makes extremely stringent demands of the CGI sometimes their overall effect in the movie is merely good rather than insanely great. Some of the magic spells and effects look awesome others don't capture the imagination nearly so much.The world cannot yet completely convincingly animate human beings doing inhuman things which serves as a clear reminder that you need fictional magic to make the impossible possible. The Quidditch scene is the most demanding of them all while the sequence is actionpacked and goodlooking disappointingly it's not a total success. Perhaps some of the scenes would have been better with more conventional special effects? For instance the lowertechlooking Sorting Hat scene is one of the most delightful of them all.The set looks gorgeous. However it may not stand up to detailed analysis. It's fairly obvious that things are shot in many disparate locations rather than one big Hogwarts School near Hogsmeade.The score is absolutely wonderful. The soundtrack may rely too heavily on The Famous Bit but it's clear that the balance and mixture of things in the finished movie are exactly right.The feel of the whole movie is everything fans could have hoped for. The dialogue is intensely measured the colouring is suitably epic the selection of what to leave in is really tightly considered. You get chills in your spine at the right places you feel the triumphs as allencompassing endorphin highs. It's clear that the production have thought long hard and lovingly. They are true fans of the story they are the right people for the job it all bodes very well for the second film.So it could never have been the film that the hyperliteralists were hoping for then but it is as good as the practicalities of the real world could possibly permit. Don't expect miracles and you'll love it. I look forward to watching it again and again.810 at the very least. A really satisfactory film!".

	onyx:emotionText "We live in a world where economics is hard. This forces practical limitations when making a movie. Time and money are sadly finite cinema owners need to be pleased as well as fans and computer animation ain't perfect. Given these limitations this film is about as close to human perfection as it is possible to achieve. However it's extremely clear what an immense challenge it is to turn Philosopher's Stone from book to film.Two and a half hours is not long to explore a wonderful magical world. Furthermore the directors have bowed to the inevitable temptation to show us things that cannot be communicated so effectively in a book. The consequence is the feeling of a slightly breathless sprint in places.It also means that the movie has to stay true to the spirit of the book rather than to the letter of it. There are omissions and there are changes. The changes that were made capture and maintain the spirit of the story really well indeed there are places where the story is more clearly and straightforwardly told in the movie than in the book. Some aspects of the story are fleshed out on screen and the additions are delightful completely in keeping with the flavour of the world.The humour of the movie is inevitably more visual than that of the book no belly laughs but a lot of smiles. Some punchlines have changed but the reasons why the jokes are funny remain the same. Not knowing exactly what's coming next is a good thing! It's all kept tasteful classy and above the belt there's nothing to cringe about.The voice acting is almost uniformly brilliant. However there are occasions where some of the actors are required to convey high emotions and are only given a second or two of face shot or headandshoulders shot to do so. This isn't as much freedom as they need and they fall a little short. The blame here must fall on the decision to give the actors too much to do too quickly not on the actors themselves.Other than these rare jarring instances the physical acting is frequently excellent and seldom less than completely adequate judged against the highest of targets set by the book's clear emotion descriptions.Dan Radcliffe has the look the mannerisms and the charm of Harry down pat. His strongest expressions are the bemusement that must be inherent at entering a world where science does not rule alone and the bravery that Harry shows in his achievements. Emma Watson possibly slightly overplays Hermione but does so in a fully endearing fashion. There's one scene which gives her too little chance to truly express panic otherwise her performance needs no changes.Rupert Grint has comic timing way beyond his years hitting Ron's lines perfectly. Tom Felton makes a stylish Draco Matt Lewis' Neville character suffers from the acceleration so the finale does come as a slight characterisation shock.The Phelps brothers' Fred and George are distinctively cheeky rather than proactive pranksters Chris Rankin imbues Percy with genuine authority. Sean Biggerstaff shines his Oliver Wood is likeable and an ideal Quidditch team captain.Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid is the single dominant adult character with maximum laughs extracted at every step. The movie changes strongly exaggerate one side of Hagrid's nature though probably inevitable considering how much plot exposition his character has.David Bradley has a vicious Argus Filch John Hurt's Ollivander is an eccentric treat giving a wonderful introduction to the Wizarding World. The professors are uniformly excellent though Richard Harris' Dumbledore comes off as disappointingly flat until the end.The most ambitious point of the movie is the computer generated imagery. The stills are wonderful but the fastest animation is restricted by the limitations of realworld technology. The book makes extremely stringent demands of the CGI sometimes their overall effect in the movie is merely good rather than insanely great. Some of the magic spells and effects look awesome others don't capture the imagination nearly so much.The world cannot yet completely convincingly animate human beings doing inhuman things which serves as a clear reminder that you need fictional magic to make the impossible possible. The Quidditch scene is the most demanding of them all while the sequence is actionpacked and goodlooking disappointingly it's not a total success. Perhaps some of the scenes would have been better with more conventional special effects? For instance the lowertechlooking Sorting Hat scene is one of the most delightful of them all.The set looks gorgeous. However it may not stand up to detailed analysis. It's fairly obvious that things are shot in many disparate locations rather than one big Hogwarts School near Hogsmeade.The score is absolutely wonderful. The soundtrack may rely too heavily on The Famous Bit but it's clear that the balance and mixture of things in the finished movie are exactly right.The feel of the whole movie is everything fans could have hoped for. The dialogue is intensely measured the colouring is suitably epic the selection of what to leave in is really tightly considered. You get chills in your spine at the right places you feel the triumphs as allencompassing endorphin highs. It's clear that the production have thought long hard and lovingly. They are true fans of the story they are the right people for the job it all bodes very well for the second film.So it could never have been the film that the hyperliteralists were hoping for then but it is as good as the practicalities of the real world could possibly permit. Don't expect miracles and you'll love it. I look forward to watching it again and again.810 at the very least. A really satisfactory film!";

	schema:reviewBody "To millions of children of all ages November 16 has been more eagerly anticipated than Christmas as the longawaited film version of J. K. Rowling's beloved novel Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone hits the screen.Each of Rowling's four Harry Potter books have been critically acclaimed worldwide bestsellers turning a generation of videogame playing children into avid readers.In translating Rowling's world of wizards and magic to the screen the film makers claimed to be intensely aware of the fans' high expectations and had sworn to be faithful to the book.Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone is indeed the most loyal film adaptation of a book that this fan has ever seen.It's the story of an orphaned boy who discovers on his eleventh birthday that his parents were wizards and that he is in fact a famous and powerful wizard himself.Released from the clutches of his desperately ordinary and nonmagical Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia  and their deliciously obnoxious son Dudley  Harry takes his place in the wizarding world as a first year student at the venerated Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.A great deal of Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone is an introduction to this fantastic and dangerous world and its richly drawn characters. There's not only a lot of plot to cover in this film but an entire world to create.At two and a half hours long hit the restroom before it starts the film includes the book's most memorable scenes bringing many of them to life with pure cinematic wizardry.The Quidditch match a soccerhockeyrugby thing played on broomsticks is much more exciting on the screen than on the page as is the bathroom battle with an enormous mountain troll and the largerthanlife game of wizard's chess.The frightening aspects of the book are in full force in the film and its PG rating for some scary moments should be taken seriously.Screenwriter Steven Kloves Wonder Boys has done a fine job of streamlining Rowling's tale while maintaining its spirit. Director Chris Columbus Home Alone makes good on his promise to be faithful to the book. But at times the film is a bit too reverent you want the actors to cut loose and have a bit more fun.Columbus clearly understands that fantasy works best when it's played most real. Across the board his fine ensemble of actors are so perfectly cast that they appear to have literally stepped out of Rowling's book.In the title role Daniel Radcliffe pulls off the very difficult task of playing an introverted hero who spends most of the movie reacting to the amazing sights and events around him. He beautifully captures the deep soul and untapped potential of Harry Potter. And when this kid smiles the screen lights up.Rupert Grint is delightful as Harry's sardonic buddy Ron Weasley and Emma Watson nearly steals the film as their overachieving friend Hermione Granger. Three cheers to the film makers for giving three unknown child actors the top billing they deserve.The strong cast of veteran actors includes Richard Harris as the wise Headmaster Dumbledore and Robbie Coltrane as the lovable giant Hagrid. Alan Rickman is wonderfully villainous as Professor Snape and Zoe Wanamaker has just the right touch of girls gym teacher as flying instructor Madame Hooch.As the strict but just Professor McGonagall Oscar winner Maggie Smith seems born to play the role  and is ready for another Oscar.John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick and Julie Walters as Mrs. Weasley have alltoobrief cameo roles but if the next film Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets remains true to the book we'll be seeing more of them.In addition to being highly engaging the film is a marvelous thing to look at. From the bustling wizard street Diagon Alley to the magnificently gothic Hogwarts School to the dark and misty Forbidden Forest the film breaks new ground in imaginative production design.To paraphrase the film's tagline let the magic and box office records begin.".

The sets were stunning  the actors were first rate  the effects were breathtaking.  The film flowed quite smoothly in it's transition from page to screen never tripping on the awkward conventions that other books on film have struggled with.   The screenplay by Steven Kloves stripped away all unnecessary elements to get to the root of the story.  Though many events from the book were excluded the essential ones made it to the film. And it makes for one smooth story and very enjoyable moviegoing experience.Many kudos to Chris Columbus and the rest of the Harry Potter castcrew for not turning this movie into what it easily could have become  a 2 and a half hour commercial advertisement for action figures and collectibles kid's meals and fast food tieins soft drinks and snack products etc. and instead focused on bringing J.K. Rowling's story to life as accurately and as lovingly as it deserves.  There has been much speculation on whether Columbus was the correct choice for the first two installments of the series and I say to that Yes.  I feel that he accomplished what most would have failed.  He has proven at least to me that Diagon Alley truly exists  if only I could find the right brick to tap on.  The world of Harry Potter is no longer fantasy to me but instead a place where any of us mere Muggles could hope to visit one day.One of my favorite moments is what I'm going to refer to as the Adrenaline Sequence.  By Adrenaline Sequence I mean the sequence in a movie that for all intents and purposes doesn't necessarily propel the story but gives the audience a huge theatrical payoff ala the Pod Race sequence in The Phantom Menace.  The Adrenaline Sequence for this particular movie is the Quidditch sequence.  I was very happy to finally see the 'hockeysoccer hybrid on a broomstick' come to life.  The Quidditch Sequence is by far my favorite sequence in the whole film.  The scene is dizzying in it's violence and it's one breathless moment after another.  My hat goes off to Columbus and his team for succeeding in making this scene as memorable as it should be.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fantastic movie for children of all ages.  Fans and nonfans alike will enjoy this colorful story of good versus evil and the friendships that endure.".

	schema:reviewBody "HARRY POTTER  2001  out of fourHere's a method of evaluating a movie based on previously published material ask yourself if the film makes you want to read the material from which it is based?  Before the release of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone I was one of the few remaining souls who had not read J.K. Rowling's fantasy book series. After screening the first film installment I did want to read the book. Borrowing the novel from a family member I briefly skimmed over the chapters. The book's intelligence and similarities with the film really surprised me.  With over 100 million copies sold in over 46 different languages J.K. Rowling's bestselling series of books has become a worldwide phenomenon. Naturally with soaring expectations abound the filmmakers felt great pressure to create a faithful adaptation. They have. This film is essentially a visualization of the words in the novel with very few differences. That said the film does run into a few conflicts with the book's story. The middle of the movie has nowhere to go. It's like a false second act almost nothing of major significance occurs in this period of the film. The young characters wander from scene to scene with nothing much to do and nothing much to say. We're left with a grand display of eyepopping special effects.Harry Potter certainly dazzles us with a solid beginning and an engaging final act however. We first meet a young wizard boy named Harry Potter Daniel Radcliffe. Soon after the film opens the boy discovers he has magical powers. He's then thrust into an enchanting world of sorcery magic and witchcraft. He's sent to a school for young wizard children where he meets new friends learns about magic and participates in fun competitions. But someone at the school doesn't like Harry as mysterious events begin to occur. Harry soon finds himself in the middle of a diabolical scheme of revenge. Who is the culprit and what do they want with Harry?The film asks some involving questions. Too bad it doesn't give enough depth to the side characters or subplots. We don't really care about the mystery because we don't know enough about the suspects. The movie does conclude with a twist but it doesn't encourage another examination of the movie. It lacks a foundation altogether. The story spends so much time foreshadowing the villain's identity it is pointless for the story to abandon its proceeding plot points and develop a new villain at the end. The book gets away with this the movie does not. After his gentle Home Alone and sweetnatured Stepmom many questioned the ability of director Chris Columbus to bring a sense of darkness to the storyand for good reason. Harry Potter contains charming likable characters and a rich pallet of lush inventive images. Unfortunately the film lacks an edge. It's missing the dark atmosphere Rowling's novel so vividly brought to life. Columbus does construct some memorable sequences but the individual scenes themselves are much better than the movie as a whole.Despite it's childish story and preteen characters many define Harry Potter as a film for all ages. While that's debatable during my screening adults were plowing through the isles every five minutes. Going to the bathroom? Getting drink refills? Buying concessions? Who knows? But not a single child budged from their seat. Their eyes were glued to the big screen. Conclusion It's a surefire experience for children especially if they've read the books. But adults may not encounter the same enticement as kids. Then again if I had nothing better to do than to count the people leaving the theater why am I recommending the film?".

The story spends so much time foreshadowing the villain's identity it is pointless for the story to abandon its proceeding plot points and develop a new villain at the end. The book gets away with this the movie does not. After his gentle Home Alone and sweetnatured Stepmom many questioned the ability of director Chris Columbus to bring a sense of darkness to the storyand for good reason. Harry Potter contains charming likable characters and a rich pallet of lush inventive images. Unfortunately the film lacks an edge. It's missing the dark atmosphere Rowling's novel so vividly brought to life. Columbus does construct some memorable sequences but the individual scenes themselves are much better than the movie as a whole.Despite it's childish story and preteen characters many define Harry Potter as a film for all ages. While that's debatable during my screening adults were plowing through the isles every five minutes. Going to the bathroom? Getting drink refills? Buying concessions? Who knows? But not a single child budged from their seat. Their eyes were glued to the big screen. Conclusion It's a surefire experience for children especially if they've read the books. But adults may not encounter the same enticement as kids. Then again if I had nothing better to do than to count the people leaving the theater why am I recommending the film?";

	schema:reviewBody "I have in all my life as a lover of both literature and the cinema hardly ever come upon a piece of work more unimaginative more ugly more uninteresting more lacking in suspense more lacking in charm more greedy more incoherent... Okay okay. I'll stop with the superlative negatives. Surely there have been worse and yes off the top of my head I can think of many that are worse. However for a book that over 125 million people have read and for a movie that cemented the record for the biggest opening weekend in history and also for a book that has had not only kids but critics singing its praises and also for a movie which one particularly fatheaded critic called the Wizard of Oz of its generation I am more than severely disappointed. I know that had it not been so overhyped it would have been just as bad. Now however my anger for it is completely hardened and it's going to be a passionate battle for me for years to come.I go into an in depth criticism but it would be impossible for me to keep to 1000 words. There is hardly a piece of it that I liked. As a film it was poorly edited poorly acted by most poorly filmed. The only really memorable scene is the troll in the bathroom although the payoff to it makes no sense whatsoever. The Quidditch game which has been hyped to all heaven is completely boring and poorly created. It looks like the FX guys created it with photoshop. When the chess game looked like it was about to be the most exciting sequence in the film Christopher Columbus who I must say lives up to his reputation completely begins to edit furiously. I heard afterwards that this was done to avoid a PG13. My immediate thought is that the filmmakers didn't trust their young audience to enjoy watching a chess game no matter how exciting it might have been. I'm still not sure which story to buy.But the person I really want to tear into is J.K. Rowling. What a hack. Never has the word hack been more fitting. A former waitress her idea of imagination is to call things by weird names. Only in the mind of a psychopath or idiot could the name Draco Malfoy or a Cerberus clone named Fluffy be considered clever. Writing children's literature is not difficult but this is simply awful. She's clearly ripping off Raoul Dahl like there's no tomorrow especially in the exposition. The game of Quidditch which seems to be a drawing point of some sort is absolutely nonsensical. As a preteen I invented much more interesting games with much less interesting playing pieces. Quidditch is a game where people score ten points at a time unless someone catches a special type of ball which ends the game immediately. So theoretically the game could end in thirty seconds. And all the other forms of scoring matter not at all. And let's talk about the surprise climax. Really anyone could have been standing in front of that mirror at the end. It is tremendously unclever. And the penultimate sequence where the crown is awarded to the best dorm is anticlimactic and just rude to the children of Slytherin We only hate one of them so why should we be happy that the award at first goes to them and then is cruelly snatched away. And what about Hogwart anyways? If you're not supposed to use magic when you're away from Hogwart why the heck would you want to be a wizard anyways?Friends you're well on the path to making your children drooling morons. If they want a great series of books about sorcery and magic creatures make them read the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis. This is the most soulless garbage imaginable. And I thought Shrek had taken that title. 310".

Cruelly he died just a couple of weeks before its premiere in London in 1962. I made up for it however by seeing it four days running. At the time just about as exciting as films got it was an enormous box office smash and vindicated the studio's decision to sign Connery. Fleming in fact had wanted Roger Moore for the role who was then riding high with THE SAINT worldwide and was unavailable for filming. Connery who's only claim to fame at the time was as a part time male model and bitpart actor his biggest role having been as a truckie in HELL DRIVERS three years earlier.Of course DR NO is dated now  its 40 years old! and deserves to be looked at from that standpoint The action sequences were raw in parts pretty good in others. Sure the car chase scenes in Jamaica with the laughable backprojections are a cackfest now but none of this matters. The sets were imaginative the fights good stuff Ursula Andress enough for any young man's wet dream and Wiseman as DR No himself probably the best villain of them all despite his very limited screentime. Very imaginative sets for the time and pyrotechnics to please. When it came to my hometown I took several days off college and watched it with fellow students. This was way better than Latin and calculus!".

Connery who's only claim to fame at the time was as a part time male model and bitpart actor his biggest role having been as a truckie in HELL DRIVERS three years earlier.Of course DR NO is dated now  its 40 years old! and deserves to be looked at from that standpoint The action sequences were raw in parts pretty good in others. Sure the car chase scenes in Jamaica with the laughable backprojections are a cackfest now but none of this matters. The sets were imaginative the fights good stuff Ursula Andress enough for any young man's wet dream and Wiseman as DR No himself probably the best villain of them all despite his very limited screentime. Very imaginative sets for the time and pyrotechnics to please. When it came to my hometown I took several days off college and watched it with fellow students. This was way better than Latin and calculus!";

	schema:reviewBody "Bond. James Bond. One of the most wellknown cinematic icons of all time Agent 007 has lit up the silver screen and wowed audiences for over 50 years and this franchise shows no signs of slowing down. The character first appeared in author Ian Fleming's 1953 novel Casino Royale but he's best known for the longlived film franchise by Eon Productions. James Bond has since been ingrained as a major component of popular culture redefining the film industry upon the release of the early films. Audiences hadn't seen anything like it at the time and they couldn't get enough of it. Bond has since blown up on a global scale and it all ties back to this first film Dr. No.Despite being the first film in the series Dr. No is actually based on Fleming's sixth novel in the series. As the inaugural Bond film director Terence Young had a blank slate to work with. The clichs and archetypes that are instantly connected with the franchise today had not yet been established. Fleming wanted David Niven to play Bond but the studio ultimately went with Sean Connery who played a major role in defining what the popular view of Bond would become. He simply exudes confidence through his voice appearance and attitude. From that genre defining first moment where we're introduced to Bond he instantly slips right into the character. It's no wonder people often cite Connery as the definitive Bond because his performance laid a lot of that groundwork for future incarnations. He's easily one of the best aspects of the film.The film sends agent 007 on a mission to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of a fellow MI6 agent Strangways. While there he teams up with CIA agent Felix Leiter Jack Lord a native fisherman named Quarrel John Kitzmiller and eventually a woman named Honey Ryder Ursula Andress to investigate the goingson at a mysterious island called Crab Key owned by the sinister Dr. No played with an eerie calmness by Joseph Wiseman. The plot itself is relatively standard Bond fare by now but Dr. No makes for a satisfying villain his plan is suitably evil World domination. Same old dream and his affiliation with the criminal organization SPECTRE leads to their recurring involvement in subsequent installments.Dr. No has a unique naive quality about it. There's no tongueincheek selfawareness here this is the first glimpse that audiences had to all the different tropes that would develop in the series and they're done supremely well. I've already gushed enough about how perfect Connery is as Bond but his supporting cast is also suitably talented. Ursula Andress sets the bar high for all subsequent Bond girls that would follow suit and to this day she's still one of the best. The production design by Ken Adam while not yet achieving the grandeur of later films is still brilliant establishing the iconic island lair that has since become a staple of the series. Dr. No himself while underused is a suitably formidable foe and Joseph Wiseman makes the most of his limited screen time.The film is incredibly dated and in many respects it doesn't hold up well. However I don't necessarily fault the film for that. It's definitely a product of its time and if looked at through the proper context it functions as a brilliant time capsule film giving audiences a unique look into the cultural and geopolitical beliefs of the time. I would have loved to see audience reactions to this movie back when it first came out. It's a really revolutionary film and at the very least it's worth checking out if only to see where it all started.".

Why do I like Dr. No better than most other Bond flicks? 1 There is no overload of explosions or special effects or action scenes. These elements never overwhelm the story telling.2 The story is simple yet more detailed and more enjoyable to watch than that of other flicks like Man With The Golden Gun Tomorrow Never Dies and Licence to Kill. In addition Dr. No's story can be taken seriously.3 Story is characterdriven and the use of mystery and suspense is VERY refreshing after watching too many explosions and special effects happen on screen Die Another Day anyone?.4 Sean Connery's performance is no less amazing and his use of charm coolness and cruelty truly defined James Bond. No matter how hard others tried Connery will always be the king of Bonds.5 Ursulla Andress similar to Connery is STILL the queen of all Bond Girls not only because of her hot look but also of her excellent portrayal of Honey Rider. On screen Ursulla has both the appeal of a fighting lady the helplessness of damsels and the beauty that satisfies viewers. If Bond were to marry again Honey is number 1 for him.6 Director Terence Young succeeded in keeping the pace right mostly moving in mediumpace which effectively balanced the presentation and prevented it from boring or exciting the viewer too much.. There are lots of details to pay attention to plus the characters are very well told.7 Dr. No is definitely one of the best Bond villains probably the best. Joseph Wiseman's performance as the halfGermanhalfChinese villain is great to watch and like Connery he had coolness and cruelty on screennote how cool Dr. No was when he resisted Bond's attempt to provoke him. To check things carefully Bond and Dr. No are essentially as bad as each other. One works to kill and destroy like the other. The makeup work on Wiseman is excellently convincing. Performancewise Wiseman's Dr. No is better and more appealing than that of villains Gustav Graves Stromberg Largo and others.8 Dr. No's production values despite the movie's age still stands up well until now. The interior sets are very well designed Dr. No's chamber where Bond and Honey had dinner with him plus Bond's Jamaica hotel room and has mostly good props some props look dated though.Dr. No is worth viewing not only as a classic spy movie but also as a historical art piece of motion pictures! No matter what naysayers say Dr. No will always be the model Bond flick for all sequels to be compared with.And let us not forget that 007 creator Ian Fleming himself was greatly involved with this movie's production. Dr. No has a plot that can be told clearly be taken seriously and enjoyed from start to finish. And it has a cast of characters greatly delivered by the actors. Many other Bond films failed when compared to Dr. No on these categories.Highly recommended viewing!".

	schema:reviewBody "Dr. No begins the entire James Bond film saga and yet barely fits any of the preconceived ideas of what a Bond Film is. What it does do is introduce the public to the basic tenets of who James Bond is and what he does and it does this very well.We meet Bond playing his card game of choice Chemin de Feur a form of Bacarat and as suave and confident as he will ever be. It is also in this first movie though the book was much later in the Bond series that Bond is assigned the Walther PPK from Q Branch by orders of M.Bond is asked to investigate some problems in the Caribbean by the US someone is messing with radar transmissions of US rockets in Florida after a British agent in the area is killed. The investigations hint at a mysterious Dr. No played brilliantly by Richard Wiseman who owns a small island off the coast of Jamaica.What is so great about this movie is that though a Bond movie it lacks many of the silly contrivances of the Bond Formula which would be introduced piecemeal through later films. Bond is a detective... an agent... not some superhuman hero who can pull down evil empires with a button on his magic watch. He's cool calculating and even coldblooded when he guns down a potential assassin who he has already disarmed though the scene inferred here has 2 filmed versions one in which the assailant reacquires his gun albeit it with an empty chamber... The interplay between Bond and Moneypenny are here from the getgo as is the irascibility of M towards Bond which Dame Judi Dench has brought back brilliantly in the BrosnanCraig Bonds.What's missing are the famous pretitles sequences although Maurice Binder's famous titles get a subtler beginning here before they became the nude extravaganzas in later years. The requisite bigbudget chase scenes are not here though a car chase is offered nor are the multicontinent gorgeous locales here... everything occurs in or near Jamaica.The most famous element of Bond movies outside of Bond are the famous Bond Girls. Eunice Gayson as Sylvia Trench comes first then the iconic and legendary scene Ursula Andress as Honey Rider. SPECTRE the infamous crime organization is also mentioned in this movie.Again this movie is not unlike many detectivespy movies of its era it is the name Bond that makes it stand out. The fame that the Bond series later achieved was not here the movie is solid and enjoyable but not Casablanca quality good. It is a 910 for Bond films because it is done well fairly faithful to the book and did not hide behind gadgets and gimmicks as later Bonds do. Bond here is an agent who must be detective lawman and killer all rolled into one and it does it well.All in all a fine movie made on a shoestring budget that accomplishes what it was meant to do ably and properly introduce James Bond to an international audience.".

The interplay between Bond and Moneypenny are here from the getgo as is the irascibility of M towards Bond which Dame Judi Dench has brought back brilliantly in the BrosnanCraig Bonds.What's missing are the famous pretitles sequences although Maurice Binder's famous titles get a subtler beginning here before they became the nude extravaganzas in later years. The requisite bigbudget chase scenes are not here though a car chase is offered nor are the multicontinent gorgeous locales here... everything occurs in or near Jamaica.The most famous element of Bond movies outside of Bond are the famous Bond Girls. Eunice Gayson as Sylvia Trench comes first then the iconic and legendary scene Ursula Andress as Honey Rider. SPECTRE the infamous crime organization is also mentioned in this movie.Again this movie is not unlike many detectivespy movies of its era it is the name Bond that makes it stand out. The fame that the Bond series later achieved was not here the movie is solid and enjoyable but not Casablanca quality good. It is a 910 for Bond films because it is done well fairly faithful to the book and did not hide behind gadgets and gimmicks as later Bonds do. Bond here is an agent who must be detective lawman and killer all rolled into one and it does it well.All in all a fine movie made on a shoestring budget that accomplishes what it was meant to do ably and properly introduce James Bond to an international audience.";

	schema:reviewBody "Dr. No is not my favorite James Bond film. But I'm glad it succeeded because it led to subsequent 007 films that were really very entertaining especially Goldfinger. Everything about Dr. No the story the music the special effects the dialogue even the acting is so ... tentative. The film lacks the selfconfident flair and cinematic flamboyance that characterize later 007 films from the 1960s. That is not a criticism given that Dr. No was the first Bond film and was lowbudget. No one knew how the film would be received.Through the years Sean Connery is the only actor who has done justice to the James Bond character in my opinion. Although his acting in Dr. No is probative at best he still manages to convey an aura of intelligent charisma. And that charisma would become less restrained in later films.The visuals in Dr. No are very dated. What seemed futuristic in 1962 seems stodgy now. All that engineering design those clunky computers and that modernistic interior decor all included to wow viewers then seem half a century later quaint obsolete even archaic. The film's story about an evil genius out to scuttle the U.S. missile program and dominate the world likewise seems dated. I must admit however that Joseph Wiseman as the villain is well cast with his passive face and those eyes that seldom blink.That the James Bond character and his adventures have survived all these years demonstrates the enduring appeal of cinematic heroes who like superman embody all that is good and strong in their successful efforts to conquer evil. I just wish that contemporary 007 films had the cinematic credibility of those 1960's Bond films You Only Live Twice From Russia With Love Thunderball and of course Goldfinger all of which owe their existence to the success of Dr. No.".

	schema:reviewBody "Still going strong four decades later it is sometimes hard to recall where the James Bond franchise began. Dr. No was released in 1962 with the relatively unknown Sean Connery in the leading role. The original Bond author Ian Fleming was still alive at the time and wasn't very pleased with the casting of Connery though he soon warmed to the actor's interpretation of the role when he saw the film.The big question is how does Dr. No hold up over forty years on? Personally it has always been my favourite Bond movie and probably will never be surpassed. Even now it is a step ahead of its counterparts. Connery never appeared in a better Bond flick some were close much less Lazenby Moore Dalton or Brosnan.James Bond Connery of the British Secret Service is sent to Jamaica to investigate the death of an operative named Strangeway. He learns that Strangeway was looking into alarmingly high radiation readings generating from a nearby island called Crab Cay. Bond heads to the island and learns that it is a suspiciously heavily guarded place patrolled by gunmen dogs and armed boats and none of the local islanders dare venture near because of rumours that a dragon also guards the area. Aided by a Jamaican agent called Quarrel John Kitzmiller and beautiful diver Honey Ryder Ursula Andress Bond searches the island's interior for answers. He discovers that the island is run by the deadly Dr. No Joseph Wiseman a visionary megalomaniac who plans to disrupt the American space programme by sabotaging their shuttles from his secret island base using gyroscopic interference to bring them down midflight.As the series went on it became less and less related to the Bond of Fleming's creation and increasingly akin to a comic book. Part of the strength of Dr. No is that it is faithful to its source. I've read Dr. No and it is such a good book that it didn't really need altering beyond all recognition in order to be filmable  so it's nice to report that scripters Richard Maibaum Johanna Harwood and Berkely Mather have adapted it accurately. The performances are excellent Connery confident and masculine as Bond Andress jawdroppingly gorgeous as Honey and Wiseman fabulously sinister as Dr. No. Terence Young directs with urgency getting plenty of excitement as well as some lovely location photography into his film hard to believe he would go on to make such inept bombs as Poppies Are Also Flowers Bloodline and Inchon. Dr. No is a milestone in cinema history. It is the film that gave us our first bigscreen 007 it is the granddaddy of all globetrotting adventure flicks and it is a classic action film in its own right to boot.".

Ted Moore's capturing of the Jamaica location is sumptuous something that really comes to the fore on the remastered DVD edition of the film. Connery is supremely cool and fearless the theme tune and gun barrel opening are already in place and Terence Young who directs three of the first four Bond movies keeps it zippy and suspenseful when story gathers up a flame throwing tank car chases fights and a quite brilliant tarantula sequence.Quite a debut uneven at times as it begins to find its feet but even if it wasn't the first James Bond movie it would hold up as an entertaining bit of secret agent shenanigans. 7.510".

Plot point is followed by murder attempt followed by plot point followed by murder attempt followed by plot point. At no time does any of this seem forced and at no time do we see 1520 minutes padded out with a ridculous stunt sequence . If only all Bond films were as good as this or GOLDFINGER".

James Bond. Since then we repeatedly hear this presentation that everyone even those who don't appreciate the character associate today to the British agent. Directed by Terence Young the film features Sean Connery as Bond in a role that will immortalize him. The actor shares the scene with Ursula Andress the first Bondgirl It was the biggest role of her career followed by a series of participation's in B movies and in another Bond film made on the sidelines of the official franchise. Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell also here begin their passage through the franchise as M head of British intelligence and his secretary Miss Moneypenny.This movie despite being simpler and not having the commercial apparatus of next films is still a classic that is at the heart of any Bond fan.

	schema:reviewBody "Rating610Dr No is the start of a massive spy franchise that is still going strong today with a fun new man named Mr James Bond and his charisma to match is known notorious name Dr No provides essential viewing for any fan wanting to see every film. Is it a good start? well that in the end is up to you but as for me I felt it was strongly a kind of good film I know many absolutely love this but some find it lacklustre just sit back and see here is why I felt it was a strongly OK film below.The story kicks off with a bang and a beautiful location to go with it and with also joining in a sinister looking villain what else could you really need to see from Bond. Although I don't think this is executed perfectly it still makes for good viewing and can still entertain fans and not particular fans a like. The story is somewhat predictable toward the end but with a middle part that I found especially thrilling it makes up for lost time with a great bunch of scenes where Bond is in trouble.Connery starts safely and firmly brings us a taste to come from his era as Bond with a suave suit that can dazzle the ladies to a swimsuit that can well also dazzle the ladies Connery oozes charm. The rest of the cast take a much further back seat to Sean and Ursula Andress as the Bond girl is good but not perfect and I felt she seemed a little lost in this. Other characters such as Quarrel a local Cayman Islander make fun work too and definitely help this films rating go up a little.Terence Young kicks Bond off under his guise and makes a good if not sometimes odd selection job but overall he does well The reason it is odd is simple things like physics the stunts could have been done a certain way but they insist on being ridiculous and I think Young did this. Written well though and introducing things that are still seen today in Bond the writing creates a sense that Bond was always there and we always knew it. I loved the location to it it doesn't really help the films mark but it looks stunning and sets off the adventures Bond goes on.The film isn't a super solid piece and with slower parts and bits that seem pointless Dr No is a film I feel is overrated but nevertheless a kind of good one. It can sometimes lack the thrills we expect and I am not sure if that is down to it being a light 60's film or the writing or directing just screwing it up anyway it is the film still manages a lot of positive away from such things as thrills and drama that may lack here.Bond fans well I am not saying you should watch it as it is the best but you have to see it to call yourself a true fan with most of the things Bond does originating from this film. Those wanting a more dark Bond will still be disappointed and a dark Bond doesn't really come round the corner until way off in 1989 so stay off if you dislike charm and style and want big bucks guns and effects.Overall I give this a 610 meaning It is Strongly an OK film near to be being good but just misses out with the criticisms I gave it. It is still a fun film and worth a watch as the story is basic like but serves to let you enjoy it but don't feel you have to like it because others say so much good stuff about it. On that point to any critics never feel pressured to rate this lower even if everyone seems to love it the film is far from flawless.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ian Fleming's James Bond character's humble onscreen beginning is just that  humble. Dr. No is more of a mystery than an action film so despite being the film that introduced the world to the most successful movie character of all time it's not often considered a favorite of Bond diehards.Yet the foundation for the Bond franchise's DNA is all here. The famous Bond theme the opening downthebarrel gunshot Bond James Bond the Walther PPK banter with Moneypenny  all originated in Dr. No. Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman honed the essence of Bond the first time through including casting the best actor to play the role the first time in Sean Connery.Connery isn't the only thing that makes Dr. No work but it's hard to imagine James Bond becoming the icon he is today without him and more specifically his performance in the film. That starts with the look. As Bond is a ladies man and more than a few women get all out of sorts around him in this movie Connery had to have a natural sex appeal and natural is the best way to describe it. Simply he's a man's man far from a pretty boy and he cleans up like a boss. And while he's pretty smart and skilled Connery adds some grit into the performance. Bond gets put through the ringer in this movie and he doesn't always look good doing it.Dr. No introduces Bond as a playboy but one whose duty to country calls. A fellow 00 agent who was investigating the jamming of Cape Canaveral's rocket launch signals has gone missing permanently a.k.a. he's dead in Jamaica and so MI6 sends Bond to investigate. From the moment he lands he finds he's being closely watched and everyone he tries to question won't talk. He soon collaborates with CIA agent Felix Leiter Jack Lord and a boatman named Quarrel where he learns of the reclusive Dr. No and his heavily manned island of Crab Key. Bond and Quarrel travel to the island where Bond discovers the beautiful Honey Ryder Ursula Andress but not without finding himself a bit trapped.A good deal of Dr. No is slowgoing and the script relies on our curiosity about the title character in order to maintain our interest. Dr. No Joseph Wiseman is revealed late in the game and he's worth the wait even if we don't get nearly enough of him. Creating the mysterious aura around No is one of the best things about this movie as it set the stage for the grandiose Bond villains to come. Most of the film is steeped in reality but once we get onto the island we see a bit more imagination and Bond gets rightfully larger than life.Wiseman and Andress are also examples of topnotch casting decisions. Andress is absolutely magnetizing despite her character's complete and utter lack of importance to the film. She is something for Bond to do in all senses and something for the audience to look at and she rocks that bikini. As much as she started the great tradition of Bond girls she amounts to a shellcollector who found herself in the wrong place at the wrong time. Oh well it was the early '60s.Dr. No has to be considered a wild success however because it introduced us to a character who clearly caught our interest. No matter how you feel about Dr. No it ends leaving you wanting to see more of this Bond James Bond fellow and what beautiful women he might sleep with next while saving the world at the same time. The foundation this film builds is rocksolid embodying nearly everything about the Bond character that we know today.Steven CThanks for reading! Visit my site moviemusereviews.com".

	schema:reviewBody "James Bond dons the training wheels in his first appearance on the screen heading off a surprise threat in Jamaica... where everyone speaks with a British accent. Without the kind of galacticsized budget or recklessly eccentric touches that would come to define the series in later installments I was impressed with the film's ingenuity in filling those holes. Though Bond lacks his usual cache of gimmicks and gadgets that time is instead spent inspecting the finer points of his espionage work which I appreciated. There's something to be said for firing lasers from a pocket watch but I was just as captivated watching Sean Connery booby trap his closet with a single strand of hair or set up a wouldbe assassin by rolling his bedsheets into a bundle and laying in wait. It loses touch with that grounded sensibility in the third act though which is much more inline with what one would expect from the series. Bond's dastardly eponymous foil is comically runofthemill although he doesn't truly get enough screen time to explain himself and seems far too easily defeated. This is such a Connery showcase though that I doubt there'd have been room for such elaborations to stick anyway.".

The quips crazy stunts and hightech gadgetry of the Roger Moore movies were what I grew up watching in comparison Connery's earlier films seemed like a lot less fun and a few drunken viewings on Christmas Day notwithstanding they've remained unseen by me. Until now...At last I've decided to catch up on the Bond films that have previously escaped my attentionstarting with the very first in the series Dr. No which might not boast the same production values level of escapism or explosive action as Moore's Bond escapades but which still proves to be a more than reasonable opening assignment for the agent putting into place many of the elements that would become standard for the series.Dr. No starts with what can only be described as very groovy titles bold multicoloured 60s graphics which transform into gyrating figures backed by a bongotastic calypso beat before the silhouettes of three blind men take us into the movie proper. The story starts in Jamaica with these three men who are not as blind as they pretend to be assassinating a secret agent and his secretary. The murdered spy had been on an assignment investigating the sabotage of US rocket launches and Bond is sent to the Caribbean to find out who was responsible and why.Connery's being Scottish has always made it difficult for me to accept him in the role of Bond moreso than Lazenby Dalton and Brosnan whose accents were less obvious and the size of his eyebrows are a little offputting but I have to admit that he's actually pretty good in the role whether getting into a fist fight with a bad guy or a clinch with a scantily clad babe he is certainly convincing as a deadly womanising super spy as much as I enjoy the impossibly suave and unflappable style of Moore Connery's macho style is more believable.And although there is none of Moore's wry innuendo and sexist remarks to lighten the mood the film does provide some unintentional laughs the 'dragon' that scares the superstitious locals could never be perceived as anything other than an armoured vehicle try not to giggle when Ursula Andress points out tyre tracks and calls them dragon footprints the atomic power plant on Dr. No's island is straight out of Austin Powers particularly the perilous walkway over the bubbling liquid the extra large red blinking light and the handy oversized dangerlevel indicator perfect for those intending to blow the place up and the bright red Tshirt worn by Bond's pal Quarrel John Kitzmiller screams out 'I'm over here please kill me!'.".

There was plenty of what I expected  vodka martinis nice cars women with unusual names. But there was also some I did not  far more detective work than your average spy and fewer explosions and action scenes than I would have thought.A great movie? Maybe not quite. But definitely a pretty good one. I was most amused by Sean Connery's attempts to suppress his accent and how it was not always successful.".

There was plenty of what I expected  vodka martinis nice cars women with unusual names. But there was also some I did not  far more detective work than your average spy and fewer explosions and action scenes than I would have thought.A great movie? Maybe not quite. But definitely a pretty good one. I was most amused by Sean Connery's attempts to suppress his accent and how it was not always successful.";

As a longtime Bond fan my opinions are somewhat different to those who just watch the film for a bit of a laugh. And although i do not believe it is the greatest film in the series i still reckon it's a cracker of a film.Sean Connery is perfect in this movie. the first time we see him  the coolness of the character just makes you want to light up with him and play baccarat  and shows the right mixture of tough man versus playboy bachelor that is needed for the movie Bond. I do not feel that Ian Fleming's idea of what James Bond should be like as a person works on the big screen. they are two different characters and the audience warms better to the Bond portrayed in this film than the Bond portrayed in the book.The plot has been altered slightly from the book's original storyline. Gone are the ideas of bird guano and perverse physical tests. Instead we have a much more sixties' storyline involving the beginning of the Space race. This is a smart move for even today the threat of a rocket been used as a missile still haunts us.We are automatically made aware that the women in this film are tough and sexy in a different way to the English madams of the postwar fifties. The sneaking in of Sylvia Trench the femme fatale of Miss Taro and of course the legend that is Honey Ryder  at first a sex object coming out of the sea then a tough and courageous woman with a knack for using poisonous spiders to reap vengeance. Although dubbed through the film Ursula Andress is fantastic. Looks good too.The island on which Bond and Honey meet is the lair of Doctor No. His presence as the title character is made even more aware by the fact that he appears only in the last third of the movie. A calm almost machine like genius working for SPECTRE and with metal hands which prove rather useless at the end of the film. Joseph Wiseman is perhaps a little too cool under the focus and I feel we do not see enough of him for him to become a considerable threat to our hero.But the end of the film is where it really grabs the edge of your seat. The merciless escape by Bond through the pipes the final fight with Bond and Doctor No  in which a gruesome death underneath bird guano is replaced with boiling hot heavy water equally as nasty  and the hurried escape by Bond and Honey just before the base blows up. It leaves you smiling cheering them on and wanting more Bond. Thankfully the latter has proved to be quite easy to get a hold of...810".

When you look back on Bond's first film salvo Dr. No it is a little hard to imagine that all that success would follow down the decades. Because truth be told this is not a very good movie. It may work as a nostalgia trip as a bit of film history. There is an undeniable curiosity to seeing the first Bond film. Watching this film may satisfy that curiosity but that's about it. If you ignore the billiondollar franchise it spawned and take the film on its own merits Dr. No just doesn't work.Perhaps the movie's biggest flaw is that the story is incredibly simple and not particularly interesting. Our villain Dr. No is from his Jamaican lair using radio waves to jam American rockets. If this doesn't strike you as being that big a deal you're right. There's very little sense of drama here. Bond villains in films to come had grand plans with undeniable high stakes. This villainous plan and the villain himself come off as a bit of a dud. So lacking that drama any good movie needs the movie slogs along towards its finish. There are some good moments sprinkled throughout. But in this case good moments do not a good movie make. And in the end comes a big letdown. Because for all its failings you hold out hope throughout that perhaps the movie will at least have a smashing conclusion. But sadly that is not to be. The big climactic final scene is more farcical than powerful. It all comes off as being a little silly. And silly is not really the effect you're looking for in a James Bond movie.Yes Sean Connery is a terrific James Bond. And it is interesting to see so many Bond firsts. There's the first appearance of that now so familiar musical theme. The first appearances of characters we would come to know and love in the films to follow. The first Bond James Bond. The first shaken martini. The first Bond girls with bonus points for the famously memorable way in which Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder is introduced in the film. And so many other firsts too numerous to mention. So go ahead and watch Dr. No for its place in film history for the nostalgia trip it provides. And then go watch a better James Bond movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Talk about a legendary classic of a movie! Dr. No... The very first James Bond film of all time! Everything you know about James Bond even if you're not a fan started here! Well if you doesn't count the 1954 TV episode Casino Royale from Climax that is. The film set the standards for many movies to come and the Bond universe has been parodied so many times over the years since! The film was based on one of the bestselling James Bond novels of the same name by Ian Fleming. There were so many people that contributed to makes this film so memorable Ian Fleming's excellent novels Sean Connery's brilliant portrayal of James Bond the stylish and tireless direction by Terence Young John Barry's brilliant theme tune Richard Maibaum and Johanna Harwood's fantastic script Maurice Binder's brilliant main title opening Peter Hunt's rapid and professional editing etc. It's just all so brilliant! Connery as James Bond was able to charm both critics and moviegoers from the premiere and it became an instant hit! The story centers around this British agent for MI6 names James Bond codenamed 007 who is sent to Jamaica to investigate the mystical disappearance of another British agent named Strangways and his assistant. Bond is almost immediately tried to get rid off and Bond is quickly lured into a darker and more sinister plot! The plot is in fact very simple though it gets kinda complicated at the end! Terence Young's brilliant direction is clearly visible right at the start! I don't think any other Bond director expect Guy Hamilton with Goldfinger has achieved to make such a sleek and stylish movie which matches Sean Connery's portrayal so far! Sean Connery is imo the best Bond ever! He was the first and the original of course but his performance is just so stylish and so memorable that whenever you think of Bond you'll think of Connery! He expertly and smoothly blends into the role of James Bond like he has been playing the character for years. It's interesting to note that Connery drew a lot of inspiration for his interpretation of Bond from Terrence Young! And that Young apparently had Sean Connery sleep in the special tailored suit he wears in the movie. Connery agreed and when he woke up the suit was still as comfortable as the night before! Connery owns the role and will for many be the first and best James Bond including me! Ursulla Andress plays the first EON Bond girl and boy does she look good in a white bikini phew! She's never been my absolute favorite Bond girl but if I were to make a top 10 she'd probably be nr. 3 or something. She isn't given much screen time but when she makes her entrance... it was worth the wait! She gets the most iconic Bond girl intro when she walks out of the sea with her white bikini! Andress isn't that good an actress but considering she's got no prior acting experience she does a decent job. Joseph Wiseman plays the first EON Bond villain. I've always liked this villain. He has a nice build up he has a nice calm and laid back performance which is a lot of fun to watch! He kinda set the standards for all Bond villains to come... Too bad he doesn't get much screen time neither. He is also the first to introduce us to SPECTRE! You'll hear more about them in the other movies! He'd probably be my nr. 6 or something on my top 10! We also have Jack Lord as Felix Leiter! Lord delivers the definitive performance as Felix Leiter. He's sophisticated suave and calm in all of his scenes and seems like a capable agent in his own right! More than you could say about the other actors to portray Leiter! Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell takes on the roles of M and Moneypenny and both does a fantastic job!Dr. No was never one of my absolute favorites. Don't get me wrong it is one of my favorites but not one of my absolute favorites. I would have liked Andress and Wiseman to have more screen time so that they could do more with their characters. The film hasn't got any real memorable action set pieces. The action consists of a regular car chase people trying to shoot Bond while he sleeps and some brawls in the end. That's kinda' it. Some might argue that this movie is boring. That is completely nonsense. The films pacing is slow but this movie is meant to introduce viewers to Bond. Who he is how he operates who he works for how he lives etc. The film does a pretty damn good job with that!I guess I have been pretty unfair with my verdict. It is the first Bond movie and therefore it is almost to important to rate! But here it is. Forget whatever critic I might have had against this movie and watch it! Probability says you're gonna like it and wanna go check the other Bond movies out! This is the first real James Bond movie... and it's absolutely friggin' awesome!910".

	schema:reviewBody "A masterpiece one of the best classic scifi horror films from the 70's I have ever saw and experience. The first time I saw this film was in the 97 when I was 13 years old because this film was so popular that time and even today people talk's about it. Watching the first time this film I must say I loved it. I love this film to death of all the scifi films today this one is the best one and beats them all. This is the real science fiction film about extraterrestrial life form it is interesting brilliant about time in the space and life form that want's to whip whole humanity out. This is Ridley Scott's masterpiece and one of his best films of all time. Everything about this film is perfect the script the actors puppetry models and special effects about Alien design. I would give this movie an 8 but it deserves a perfect 10 because it has a vision of the most imaginative directors on earth. Dan O'Bannon wrote brilliantly a story and screenplay with help from Ronald Shusett. Both of them make a brilliant imaginative story. This film has no plot holes I don't see them. Helen Horton as the voice of Mother the Nostromo's computer was believable and realistic and well performed. The design for the parasite the facehugger was excellent designed and brilliant. Everyone from the cast in here at acting is spectacular and acts believable. I love all the characters Parker Brett Lambert Ripley Ash Captain Dallas Kane and even Jonesy the cat. He was really trained I love that cat in this movie. The design about the ship Nostromo is fantastic and so is space and the computers in this film. The eponymous Alien and its accompanying elements were designed by the Swiss artist H. R. Giger which the effects and designs were excellent spectacular created in the film. Jerry Goldsmith makes an excellent music score for the film that I have enjoy it. My favorite scene in this film is when Parker torchers with flamethrower on Ash's corpse and burns his remains great a special effect. This movie stars Tom Skerritt Sigourney Weaver Veronica Cartwright Harry Dean Stanton John Hurt Ian Holm Yaphet Kotto Bolaji Badejo and Helen Horton they are all believable in their roles.This is my favorite science fiction film tough I prefer Aliens over this film because it is my favorite film The Thing Leviathan even The Blob as a horror films because I enjoy them more but Alien is my favorite science fiction film the best of it's kind. 1010 doesn't deserve the hate.".

The first time I saw this film was in the 97 when I was 13 years old because this film was so popular that time and even today people talk's about it. Watching the first time this film I must say I loved it. I love this film to death of all the scifi films today this one is the best one and beats them all.

	schema:headline " Alien is not just the monster it's the atmosphere and the way you feel!";
	schema:reviewBody "In Alien we follow a seven man crew enroute to earth on board the huge space freighter Nostromo. The crew is in cryosleep but the on board computer interrupts the journey when a foreign radio signal is picked up. It originates from an uninhabited planet and the crew lands to investigate. There they make contact with an alien lifeform...What makes Alien so great is the constant feel of uneasiness. Right from the beginning you have a feeling that something is wrong. The crew is not particularly friendly towards each other and you truly feel all the ingroup tension. The ship itself is a huge worn out industrialstyle maze of halls and corridors and it feels more like a prison than a place to live. It is as if not only the alien but also the ship itself is against the humans. The Alien itself is the scariest monster in history because it is a ruthless soulless parasite completely devoid of any human or civilized traits. The design of the monster is a stroke of genius. Sure it has a humanoid form but it has no facial traits or anything else which could give away emotions or intentions. Its actions reveals no weaknesses nor civilized intelligence. The Alien is more or less the opposite of everything human and civilized plus the creature is more welladapted to the inhumane interior of the ship than the humans who build it. To sum up you then have a setting where the humans are caught in a web of ingroup tensions an inhospitable ship and the perfect killer which thrives in the ships intestines. You almost get the feel that the humans are the ones who are alienated to each other and to their own ship.Ridley Scott tells the story with a perfectly synchronized blend of visuals and sounds. The actors do a superb job portraying their characters in a subtle but very realistic way. The seven man crew is not a bunch of Hollywood heroes. They are ordinary people with strengths and weaknesses likes and dislikes. In this way they all seem so fragile when confronted with the enemy. As mentioned the ship is very claustrophobic and Ridley Scott adds to the eeriness by using camera movement lights and shadows in an effective way. The living quarters are bright and should be comfortable to the crew but there is something sterile about it all. The rest of the ship is basically a huge basement. The music by Jerry Goldsmith underlines the eeriness so well and the movie wouldn't have worked without his score. Combined with the sounds of the ship it all adds to the uneasiness. This is not a story about heroic people who boldly teams up against evil. It's a story about ordinary people facing true fear which is the fear without a face. The fear we can't understand and can't negotiate with because its only goal is to survive on the expense of us. It's a story where some people bravely fight back whilst others are destroyed by the terror. It's a story where people a killed in a completely random way. There is no higherorder justice behind who gets to live and who dies. All seven characters are just part of a race where the fittest  not necessarily the most righteous  will prevail and all seven characters start the race on an equal footing. None of them are true heroes and none of them are true villains. All the above makes Alien so great as a horror movie. The terror isn't just the Alien itself it's the entire atmosphere which gets so effectively under your skin that you just can't shrug it off after the end credits like you can with so many other Hollywood horror movies. The title Alien doesn't just refer to the monster it is the theme of the movie and it is the feeling you have during and after the movie. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "'Alien' is one of those special films that have aged very very well. Even now after nearly 40 years everything about it just feels fresh. The restrained natural performances by the fantastic cast the outstanding production design the beautiful ominous score by Jerry Goldsmith the realistic livedin look of spacefreighter Nostromo's interior it actually feels less dated than many science fiction films that were made much later which is quite an astonishing feat. Even the what now must be considered retro technology inside the ship doesn't necessarily have to be viewed as anachronistic in the face of our obvious recent advancements because it's the most simple technological equipment that is usually robust enough to survive the longest under harsh conditions like the extreme temperatures in space. I feel it's especially hard for science fiction films to stand the test of time  which is kind of inherent to the genre I suppose  and 'Alien' simply remains an outstanding achievement in that regard. It's a testament to the talent of everyone involved but especially to the vision of director Ridley Scott. The film was crafted with so much love for every little detail and the designs by Moebius Chris Foss  and in particular the Lovecraftian horrors unleashed by Swiss surrealist H.R. Giger  are among the best and most iconic in any science fiction film. This isn't just an outstanding timeless piece of entertainment it's a work of art. 10 Stars out of 10.

However the lack of music in certain scenes works just as well and this combination makes for one of the best musical montages to be put on film.This is a classic film that spawned a series which is good overall and a bunch of copycats many of which are just sad.

I'm freaking sure that if somebody could have magically told them that thanks to their work a movie like 'Alien' would have been made in the future they both would have died of a sudden shocked by the consequences of their labor like an honest scientist would if he was shown an evil use of his research. In that sense but in the best way imaginable 'Alien' is the atomic bomb.In my opinion 'Alien' is the only perfect movie in the history of cinema. Of course this could be debatable but of all the films I've watched since I was born this is the only one in which I haven't been able to find the slightest flaw. It gets a golden ten out of ten. Bright solid and massive.I could go on with a panegyric but I'll try to be short and accurateThe direction is just perfect. Every shot is marvellous every movement of the camera is breathtaking. There is absolutely nothing you could add or subtract. Touch it and you spoil it. Seriously.The acting is splendid. The performances build a credible world centuries away. I don't know about you but this take on the future was unveliabably acceptable. Sigourney Weaver is more than a revelation John Hurt is a master and the rest are nothing short of marvellous.The script is a work of art the story is mesmerizing wellconstructed welldeveloped and free of absurd twists. Its simplicity and efectiveness are yet 25 years after to be matched.The atmosphere is pure genius. Gothic claustrophobic and sometimes baroque. The use of light and dark is beyond description the use of sound is as creepy as it gets.The FX are the best possible for 1979. In the time of the release some scenes were stomach churning.The score. Jerry Goldsmith's work matches the images so perfectly it seems to bleed from them. It is and will be the best soundtrack for a scifi flick in space ever.The tagline. In space no one can hear you scream. THIS is a tagline.And of course... the alien. The only alive creature that can steal Weaver the movie. Its design is the most innovative I've seen. It has spawned dozens of disgraceful imitations. This is the real deal. Not only the look but the complete design of a life form including biological features. Acid instead of blood. Jaws inside jaws. What more could you possibly want? This is how a movie is done.A very good sign of a movie that has gone down in history is the amount of collectively well remembered scenes. Well 'Alien' has so many that I won't go into it. This movie contains so many iconic scenes that has become an icon itself.So what else? I urge all young directors to watch this movie a zillion times as I've already done and take notes all along. But not in order to rip off from it as many others have done but to learn learn learn learn and learn how a movie should be done. 'Casablanca'? You must be joking.Oh I almost forget! There's a lovable cat in it.RATING 10".

But while these accusations have more than a little truth it has been an incredibly influential filmand even today in the wake of CGI effects it still holds up extremely extremely well.The story is well known the crew of an interstellar craft responds to what seems a distress signal only to encounter a remarkably lethal alien life form that boards their ship and sets about picking them off one by one. Some of the special effects are weak the alien spacecraft and the android revival are fairly notorious. There is little in the way of character development the film has a fairly slow pace and the story itself is predictable you can usually guess who is going to die next.BUT. The art designs are incredible the entire look of the film from the commercial nature of the spacecraft to the iconographic alien itself brilliantly envisioned by Giger is right on the money. Director Ridley Scott encouraged his cast to ad lib from the script and the result is a shocking sense of realismand the somewhat slow pace of the film and the predictability of the story gives it a sense of relentless and evermounting paranoia that is greatly enhanced by the tight sets and camera setups. With its odd mixture of womblike organics and cold mechanics ALIEN is a film calculated to send even the most slightly claustrophobic viewer into a fit of hysteria.The entire cast led by Tom Skerrit and Sigorney Weaver is very very goodand the film abounds with memorable images and scenes ranging from John Hurt's encounter with the alien egg to Skerrit's search of the ship air ducts to Weaver's terrifying race against time as the ship counts down to selfdestruct. Seldom has any film been so consistent in design cast direction and outandout fear factor and although certain aspects of ALIEN are open to legitimate criticism the end result is powerful enough to bring it in at a full five stars. A word of warning however you'll need to send the kids to bed for this one. And you'll probably be up half the night afterward yourself! Recommended.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

Witness the alien trap a female crew member and slowly rub up her leg moving with slow seductive movements before moving with terrifying speed to kill another crew member sneaking up behind it. The slow movements betray the alien's pure cruelty.The film is a study in terror. It may not be as action packed as the other films in the series but it brings the claustrophobia of being hunted to a new level.".

In fact on reflection there are only three Scott movies I genuinely like those being his first three. The last of these 'Blade Runner' was released twenty years ago now so to me Scott is long past his use by date. Whatever 'Alien' itself is a brilliant piece of work and is almost flawless. Scott's direction is superb and everything else about it is outstanding  a strong script from Dan O'Bannon et al an evocative score from Jerry Goldsmith brilliant design and special effects including the amazing contributions from H.R.Giger all add up to an amazing movie experience. I also really liked how the cast were character actors and not stars so there was plenty of suspense generated as to who will live and who will die. This is something very few subsequent movies have done 'Pitch Black' being one of the exceptions. Sigourney Weaver may be an icon as Ripley now but when the movie was first released she was virtually unknown having had a small cameo in Woody Allen's 'Annie Hall' and not much else. The rest of the cast are equally as good. I especially enjoyed Yaphet Kotto 'Blue Collar' and the legendary Harry Dean Stanton 'Wise Blood' as the wise cracking below deck crew. Many people seem to prefer James Cameron's sequel 'Aliens' over this but as I much prefer horror and suspense movies to action ones I think this is definitely the better movie and still the strongest and most effective in the series. 'Alien' is a horror classic and an absolutely unforgettable movie that I can't recommend highly enough. If you haven't seen it before watch it immediately!".

	schema:reviewBody "A SciFi horror  Masterpiece from 70's a real classic horror film with science fiction in space. This is a time and space in the movie. The spaceship Nostromo is beautiful designed with computers. It is beautiful designed you have beautiful great special effects that hold up till day. Alien stays the best horror movie in the franchise which was brilliantly directed by Ridley Scott. The effect and latex was made to fit Badejo's slender 6foot10inch 208 cm frame by taking a fullbody costume for Alien was great designed great idea. The story is brilliant the screenplay is brilliant. This is my second favorite Alien movie in the franchise I like this movie. James Cameron's Aliens is my number 1 favorite action horror film of all time.The crew of the spaceship Nostromo answers a distress signal from a desolate planet LV426 only to discover a deadly life form that breeds within human host. Now the crew members must fight not only for their own survival but for the survival of all humankind.There is a Extraterrestrial alien life form on a Nostromo ship who hunts down crew members and kills them one by one on a brutal way. Crew members has to fight for the survival and stop extraterrestrial thing before he destroys our whole world. The designed and building for shuttle and inside of the ship was brilliant to see it. The movie is rated R it is a horror film and the film becomes really scary by time to time and creepy.Alien 1979 stars Tom Skerritt Sigourney Weaver Veronica Cartwright Harry Dean Stanton John Hurt Ian Holm Yaphet Kotto Helen Horton and Bolaji Badejo all beautiful worked and acted their beloved characters they are all and believable.The first movie in Alien franchise is one of the greatest science fiction films and it is perfect it is fast paced goes quickly around. It is intelligent fascinating for the facehugger chestburster and Alien designs. It is the movie that started the franchise. The movie has mystery and a synthetic man on board who attacks one of his crew members. There is an alien on a different space ship who bring those eggs but no one knew what was inside of them until one of the got a parasite in his face and later becomes cocooned by one of those things. The mythology in this movie about Alien is brilliant.Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley did wonderful job at acting she was fascinating as the main heroine. I did enjoy Tom Skerritt as Captain Dallas and of course Yaphet Kotto as Parker. From James Bond 007  Live and Let Die to Alien. There was cat Jones in the movie and the cat was trained and it was likable.Alien 1979 first movie in the franchise is the best one in the series but my personal favorite horror film in the series will be the James Cameron's Aliens 1986 the sequel to this movie that I love to death an so much. I like the first Alien so much but I love Aliens more.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ridely Scott is such a minimalist in Alien that many scifi nuts find it slow and unexciting. So many people prefer Aliens its sequel to this one. I think Aliens directed by James Cameron is another scifi masterpiece and maybe the best action film ever made but I think Alien is much better. In fact I would say that it is among the best films ever made in scifi only second to 2001. The plot absolutely lacks contrivance. All the plot points develop how they would naturally. And there are great surprises throughout the film. Even if you haven't seen the film you know about the chestbursting scene. You probably saw it parodied dozens of times. But watch the scene where Ian Holm reveals his secret! That is one amazing scene! I actually saw the sequel first so I kind of knew that secret too but it still shocked me. It was so well directed.Notice how the dialogue works. It never particularly draws attention to itself. It actually reminds me of Robert Altman how he directed such movies as Nashville where many characters are speaking at the same time and nothing seems more or less important than anything else. It is just like real life. Alien is one of the most realistic documentarylike scifi films ever made. Also notice the setting. The Nostromo's design is so believable that I feel that I'm actually seeing a real space vehicle. The alien ship also beams with its spookiness.The characters are also extremely believable. They are so well written that even the first character who dies is completely developed. If you get the DVD they actually created dossiers about each of the crew members. It also has extra scenes which round out the characters even more. I think Ripley is one of the most endearing characters in film history. Even in the last two sequels which were visually interesting but not very well written or directed Ripley held my interest. I teared up when she died at the end of 3. If they made a fifth one I would go no matter how terrible I knew it would be. The acting is also topnotch. Ian Holm a great actor gives one of his best performances here. I love the last scene that he is in. Truly a master. And of course Sigourney Weaver could have just as easily been nominated for an Oscar for her performance here as she was for Aliens. I wish she would make more movies. She's so talented.The most important part of a film in my mind is the mood. And boy does Alien have one of the most genuinely spooky movies I've ever seen. Make sure you watch it after the sun has gone down. Also watching it alone will help. The special effects are kind of cheap but Scott knows this well enough. He only shows the alien for seconds at a time. Besides keeping us from seeing the shoddiness of those puppets this technique makes the alien seem all the more creepy and mysterious. 1010 no doubt at all BTW the symbols all over the Nostromo are the same insignias as those of the Purina Dog Chow company".

	schema:headline " Alien.....the one that started it all........";
	schema:reviewBody "Alien....the creature......the film.....the legend. The one that started it all the one that led to one of the greatest sequels ever made one that got a comic book miniseries and 2 crossover films with Predator. This is THE film. And without a doubt the greatest horror film ever created and this totally makes Halloween look like Chicken Little. You can forget about all those rubbish Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street movies 'cause Alien just takes horror up to so many levels! In Alien we find ourselves in the distant future with a crew just coming back from a haul of 20 million tons of ore back to Earth. But while the crew members are in stasis their ship picks up an SOS from a nearby planet and once the crew is awakened they are forced by the Company regulations to follow that signal. And then when they land on the planet and it turns out that something terrifying is in store for them when a hostile organism attaches itself to one of the crew members. And later on it becomes clear that the crew member was being impregnated and then dies a horrible violent death from a deadly breed of an otherworldly lifeform. And now the rest of the crew must fight off the creature.As other classic films should always have Alien does great on the characters. And of course the most recognizable one is the lead woman Ellen Ripley who is played thenunknown Sigourney Weaver. She provides a very human face and you're gonna feel like you're actually watching a reallife woman in here and it could be because of her accent or her mannerisms. But as the film progresses she develops into a more mentally tougher woman while combating the Alien. There are times when she totally keeps it cool times when she's afraid times when she's angry and times when its just Ripley being Ripley. And thanks to Weavers acting talents she can really dish out one hell of a character.The rest of the supporting cast are nothing short of spectacular Parker and Brett are the selfish sarcastic men who only want to make a profit. And through most of the film you can feel the tension that Ripley and Parker have. Lambert who one of my favorites from here is the second woman who happens to be the opposite of Ripley a total coward. Dallas who the viewer might get the vibe that HE is the main character in the 1st 15 minutes or so is pretty much the leader here. Kane is the tired deadlooking guy who is the one that carries the alien species inside of him. And finally Ash is the one with the sinister purpose and you start to suspect that he's up to no good at some point. And movie characters need to have their own personalities and that's what Alien has.And as for the Alien itself well what can i say? It is the most horrifying creature in the history of cinema period. I mean how could you stop it? It has acid for blood and is very lethal to fight facetoface. And the special effects were over 20 years ahead of its time. The facehugger on Kane looked so freaking real that you're gonna be scared just by looking at it even it doesn't do anything except breathe most of the time. And the sets couldn't have been better very futuristic yet there's always something ominous and dark about them.The suspense is impossible to resist as the sequences deliver the chills at times when you least expect it and when you do expect something to happen nothing happens. And Alien is one of the very few horror films that understands that you can't scare people by raking up the bodies and the blood but you have to build up the suspense to do it. And director Ridley Scott is such a genius and he shows that here he absolutely knows how to make any kind of film ones that can scare Alien one that can sadden Thelma and Louise and one that can excitethrill Gladiator. And Ridley really keeps up the dark atmosphere especially in the beginning when there's no talking for the 1st 5 minutes or so we get the feeling that something's not right all the time. Some parts are very quiet and very depressing and we feel exactly what we see.This is the legend that I'm talking about here folks. Don't miss the chance to see this because it will scare the living daylights outta you more than any other movie you're gonna see in your life. Take my word for it....I'm practically a movie buff so I know what I'm talking about....".

	schema:headline " The original masterpiece that launched a dynasty";
	schema:reviewBody "As the credits of Alien open the slowly paced opening titles and soft eerie score give some indication of what viewers will experience when watching this film.  It starts off so unassumingly that firsttime viewers are unlikely to be moved by the story or inspired by the slight character development in the film's first half.  It is in fact this lack of certainty that makes Alien work so well for as the film hits it second half it shifts dramatically from slow space road movie to an intergalactic haunted house fright show.  This flip in drama pace and tension makes for an unnerving ride into the unknown and results in one of the landmark subgenrescifi movies of the 20th century. The film is directed by Englishman Ridley Scott who had a total of one feature and numerous commercials under his belt when he took control of proceedings.  Since the success of Alien Scott has had an uneven career with highlights like Blade Runner Thelma and Louise Gladiator and most recently Black Hawk Down and low points like Legend G.I. Jane and the borefest 1492.  Alien represents the overtly stylistic and slick approach Scott brings to his films traits that are useful in science fiction but can sometimes seem out of place in more realistic genres. Here Scott retires the glitz and glamour of Star Wars which had been released two years before Alien.  Instead he portrays the spacecraft and crew as nothing more than a cargo ship and a rag tag bunch of intergalactic truckers.  This works very well as the viewer gets the distinct sense of the tedium and oppressive vastness of space travel.  The way the crew are so nonchalant about visiting another planet makes the audience feel that yes perhaps one day man will view space travel with a shrug. The opening scene shows us a huge spaceship named the Nostromo returning to earth with 20000000 tonnes of mineral ore on board.  The crew sleep in hibernation until the onboard computer awakens them.  It seems the computer has picked up a possible distress signal on an alien planet.  Under the law of the nameless and faceless 'Company' the crew are obliged to investigate. The waking scene is superbly filmed.  Kane John Hurt slowly rises like a chick from and egg.  Squinting and only partially awake slow dissolves from one angle of Kane to another emphasise his delirium and partial consciousness.  The final dissolve dissipates to the mess hall.  Here we meet the entire crew of the Nostromo for the first time. The ship is led by Dallas Tom Skerrit with Ripley Sigourney Weaver as the first officer.  Ash Ian Holm is the odd skittish science officer Kane John Hurt is weathered but adventurous Lambert Veronica Cartwright is the whiny and weak navigation officer and Parker Yaphet Kotto and Brett Harry Dean Stanton are the engineering grunts.  The ship is controlled by Mother a mute version of HAL 9000 from 1968's 2001 A Space Odyssey.  Like 2001 the reasons for having humans on board is unknown they almost seem pointless as the ship can basically control itself.  Are they simply pawns or guinea pigs awoken at the will of the computer? They respond to the distress signal after landing on the desolate planet. The beacon is tracked to a derelict spaceship which Kane Lambert and Dallas enter.  Curious and nave Kane wonders into a cavern of eggs. Stumbling on the slippery surface he slips and comes into contact with the living contents of the egg.  With the parasite attached to his face Dallas and Lambert rush Kane back to the ship. On board Ripley who is now in command demands that Kane be kept in quarantine for 24 hours.  Against her wishes the odd Ash lets the three crew in.  Upon removing Kane's helmet they find a claw shaped being attached to his face.  It eventually falls off and dies and amazingly Kane awakens seemingly unscathed. At this stage the film remains slow and ponderous.  Intent on getting back to earth they have one final meal before returning to hibernation.  As they eat Kane convulses violently and a creature bursts through his chest.  In utter disbelief the crew watch it skuttle away to the far reaches of the ship.From this point the film takes off.  Space and distance are enclosed as Scott uses a brilliant mix of close ups and wide angled shots to display the vastness of the Nostromo and the claustrophobia in the crew. The alien and set design are outstanding.  The massive sexual overtones of Swiss artist's H.R. Giger's alien and derelict ship are truly breathtaking as is the futuristicretro styling of Michael Seymour's sets.  Grubby yet cool the production quality of Alien is something to admire. It took seven more years before a sequel was made and when James Cameron took over the directing chair he revolutionised the series by making it all out action over spooky scifi with Aliens.  It may be a better movie but the original remains a quality stand alone film and a landmark in the scifi horror sub genre that has not been matched by any other saga.".

When they locate the source of the signal they find more than they bargained for and all of their lives are endangered.My feelings about this first film in the Alien series have vacillated slightly over the years. I loved it when I first saw it as a young teenager in the theater back in 1979. Later I wasn't as enamored with it and had actually rated it as low as a 7 out of 10at one point believing it to be my least favorite of the series. Now however my appreciation of the film has matured a bit and I'm back to thinking it's a solid 10 out of 10.The film's strong points are rooted in director Ridley Scott's focused commitment to sustaining a desolate dark atmosphere and gradually building suspense over the course of the film. Alien is unusual for its era in its pacing its lack of comic relief and its refusal to provide breaks from its growing tension. All three of these facts make it a somewhat difficult film. It's not recommended for light viewing. It's not a popcorn film. You have to be in the mood to sit down slow down concentrate invest emotion and let yourself be enveloped in the film's world.With Alien Scott has created a kind of bleak tribute to Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey 1968. This is evident in many characteristics of the film such as the graceful slowness of the cinematography editing and much of the action in the first section of the film including sustained pans across sterilelooking environments and wide external shots of a hulking but elegant spacecraft the personification of the ship's computer known as Mother here rather than Hal a few subtle instances of classical music the surprise discovery of a monumental structure on another celestial body and so on. However there are no instances of pleasant psychedelia here no retreats into dreamworlds no messages of hope no benevolence from alien beings. Alien is strictly concerned with making its scifi an issue of classic horror. At a base level it is about a malevolent monster first encountered in a dark Gothic environment and later chasing our heroes through a cross between a haunted house and cryptlike labyrinths.Much has been said about visual artist H.R. Giger's alien and production design and the film wouldn't be nearly as successful without it. Giger is largely responsible for the look of the beacon ship on the small planet both its exterior and interior the cocoon later encountered on the cargo ship and the creatures. His work also inspired a lot of smaller elements as can be seen in doorways pipes and other features of the cargo ship. Like most of his work these features are a combination of metallic and organic mechanical and biological futuristic and Gothic. They complement the austere Kubrickian sensibility in a surprising but completely successful way.Scott also uses simple effects like steam as well as unique lighting and sound effects to help build the film's thick tension. These techniques gradually become more conspicuous as the film goes on finally culminating in a claustrophobic symphony of flashing lights constantly hissing pipes and hoses and an incessant audio alarm.Finally the last key to the excellence of the film is the cast. Although a somewhat stereotypical movieworld ragtag bunch their characterizations provide more depth than the norm with Sigourney Weaver as the standout in perhaps the defining role of her career and one of the more admirable filmic portrayals of a womanshe's the smartest most sensible strongest and certainly most sexy of the bunch.".

Lovecraft and others had written about expeditions that had gone to investigate and collect important data only to find themselves being hunted down one by one be it an unseen terror or their own fears.Ridley Scott's ALIEN looks and feels like a science fiction movie. However it is not. Everything in its look and tone suggests horror of a more cerebral kind. When three crew members come across what seems to be a large spacejockey with a thing attached to its face dead we feel our stomach turn. If something that small was able to take over a creature this large they are in deep trouble here. The scene is masterful restrained but a classic in the horrormovie sense it's as if we had been witness to terrible events which had taken place and decided to get to the bottom of it. Scott tightens the noose employing ageold tricks of the horror genre and only once shows blood and guts  one which follows a calm dinner sequence. He never allows the viewer to get a true glimpse of this sadistic killer much like Spielberg in JAWS and this becomes nervewracking because again fear of the unseen is more powerful than what comes into view. The theory dictates I was afraid of that thing? I thought it was bigger! All we see of this alien are his teeth and in one memorable twisted scene his tail snaking up Lambert's Veronica Cartwright leg. Later on as Ripley Sigourney Weaver in her breakthrough role the quintessential Final Girl makes her escape it is possible to hear Lambert shrieking.

	schema:reviewBody "In the crowded gallery of horror films Alien hangs in a prominent position high above its rivals. By virtue of its deft blend of psychology and physical horror it lifts the genre out of the graveyard and into deepest space . While its scale models grimy characters and shimmering soundtrack may no longer appeal to a generation of audiences who revel in the hotchpotch storyboards of 'Drag Me To Hell' Alien still commands great respect and rightly so. It has not lost any of its cutting edge even after thirtytwo years. Alien's simplistic premise keeps the film tight and lean a taut slowburning game of cat and mouse involving a vicious shadowy creature whose acidic blood can melt the very girders of the ship it has invaded and a compelling blend of the brave Ripley cautious Dallas and mechanical Ash. There are no meaningless references to childhood memories or superfluous romance. The characters and their personalities are weathered believable and their mission plausible. The profitdriven search for mineral ore provides a realistic corporate counterpoint to the main story which sees the seven crew members dragged somewhat unwillingly into the extraterrestrial's world. With the possible exception of Ash they did not seek this encounter the computers lead them to it. How each crew member responds to the situation is key in effect seven sub plots form each focusing upon something different be it a crew member's mannerisms their way of thinking or indeed a violent death Chestburster. This is Alien's greatest appeal it provides an insight into the human mind as psychological horror movies should. Which crew member do we the audience root for admire or resent? Who can trust who? Sigourney Weaver so often credited with inspiring a rollcall of female cinematic heroines rightly earns every syllable of praise that has been heaped upon her since the film's release Ripley's resourcefulness and courage are marvellous to behold. However as the genuinely disturbing android Ash Ian Holm is supreme his reserved demeanour and considered approach masking the motives that lay hidden out of sight. As an exercise in sound and vision Alien is a memorable spectacle. There are many moments that are striking. The colossal hauler Nostromo futuristic and industrial in design dominates the screen as it crawls slowly almost gracefully towards Earth. The sheen of the soundtrack and the echoing calls from the freighter to 'Antarctica Traffic Control' are atmospheric to the core while the fogbound alien planet littered with blackened mountains and the silhouette of the hulking derelict vessel is hauntingly desolate. Spaces where in modern horror films the gaps would be filled with meaningless dialogue are left vacant. The viewer can interpret what they see with no need for speech. Ridley Scott's vision of 'horror first sciencefiction second' was without a doubt fulfilled audiences should ignore the flashing lights and controls of the spaceship and focus upon the Alien. Around which corner does it lurk? Who becomes its next victim? Alien is a film of immense quality. It has the capacity to frighten and to deceive. It flows precisely from scene to scene with no wasted shots and most tellingly does not stray off course by incorporating fanciful special effects or worthless roles filled by fringe characters. One spacecraft one extraterrestrial seven humans and one cat is all we are given. And quite simply anything more would have been a waste. While the genre of horror may have moved on the art of horror is captured perfectly here in the blackness of space.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the few scifi horror films from the period of the late 70searly 80s that has really held up with time.On a visual level the film is highly satisfying. Green and light blue colors are saturated throughout the film but so grayed that the movie almost appears at many points to be shot in black and white. The miniatures and matte effects used in the original film were quite good.The movie works on pretty much every level though you can't really say it's an incredible story either. On a scifi level the best parts are the early parts where we first see the alien technology. I was disappointed actually in the print that I saw because I believe it was altered with computers I remember seeing more matte screens that resembled the HR Geiger artwork when the film was on video. Anyway the alien technology succeeds on a level never before achieved in terms of showing a realistic alien culture. We can almost imagine these creatures living on this ship it seems to fit in with the alien biology so well.When they arrive back on their own ship the film unfortunately descends into a fairly typical horror action film. Perhaps taking a note from Hitchcock's Psycho Scott kills off the only reasonably well known actor in the film at the time of its release Tom Skerrit fairly quickly and leaves us with the thenunknown Weaver as the hero. This makes her the first really buttkicking female heroine of a scifi action film and that alone qualifies this film as groundbreaking.The cast in general is just amazing. Yaphet Kotto Ian Holm John Hurt Harry Dean Stanton  these are quite simply some of the best character actors of their generation all gathered for the purpose of making this more than just a typical monster movie. Other films such as Predator tried but failed to get a supporting cast as distinguished and talented as this one gathered for a scifi action film. The quality of these actors makes the film better not only in the individual scenes they are in such as Holm's incredible turn once exposed but also the aggregate total of the film  because the actors are so good and the characters relatively fleshed out we can imagine right up until the film's final moments that any one of them could be the one who ends up surviving.Another interesting element not often commented on is the cynical attitude the astronauts have towards the company which employs them. From Kotto and Stanton's character's complaints about the hours all the way up to Weaver's discovery that all of them were expendable and kept in the dark as to the true purpose of their mission which Skerrit's character seems to also know more about than Weaver's there is a kind of dark realism here that you won't find in the vast majority of films of this type. It dovetails with the other element I've talked about the fact that the cast is so good that any one of them could be the hero  this is a very democratic look at the future one edged with deep cynicism but with an ultimate eye towards presenting a future of real people who are oppressed by situations far beyond their control. It is a far cry from the Utopian dreams of Heinlein and other scifi progenitors and represents this film's true gift to science fiction as a whole.".

	schema:reviewBody "Review 1 of 4Alien is one of those films that will never age. It takes the simplest story and tells it as well as it can be told. I look at this film as the first in a trilogy many may not agree with that but Alien is a perfect beginning. It establishes an entire world and makes it feel real. Everything feels new and interesting. The things that are not explained in this film are exactly what makes it so fascinating to watch. Where did that ship come from? It doesn't matter. Like a good novel the film allows you to fill in the pieces with your own imagination. This goes for the alien it self since we see so little of it that it becomes all the more terrifying for it. Ridley Scott is like a painter with his images. So many frames of this picture seem like they could be made into still photographs. Alien is science fiction and yet with the way it is shot and acted the movie feels like a documentary. It's that sense of verisimilitude that has made this movie last for so long. So much is present in the subtext. I get the feeling that one of the underlying themes of the film is that technology in the future will little by little overtake the lives of human beings but paradoxically the nostromo still needs a crew in order to operate. I believe this film is one of the few realistic depictions of what encountering a real Alien life form might actually be like and that it may not be what we are expecting. something that has always stood out to me about the film is the level of familiarity that the characters have with their surroundings. Many science fiction films love to draw attention to their futuristic technology but the characters in Alien react to it like a construction worker would with operating a crane it is their job. This film is so good for so many reasons. The performances are nothing short of amazing the set design exquisite the score by Jerry Goldsmith is subtle and evocative but the main reason for me that alien still holds up after all these years is that it takes itself very seriously. There is no Hollywood style self referential humor that would saturate the later entries of the series. Sigourney Weaver may have gotten the academy award nomination for Aliens but her work here is very solid. She plays a character who through much hardship finds strength within herself that never appeared to be there to begin with. If you look at the Alien series as a trilogy this is the film where Ripley discovers who she really is or defines her character and the only way one can do that is through the choices they make in extreme circumstances. This is a film of great tension and subtly well worth seeing over and over again to pick up on all the layers of subtext that may have been missed the first or second viewing.".

The script never falls apart with one of the most steady spaced movies I have ever watched. The acting is unknowingly great depending on your observations of certain characters. The ship is fully developed with a crew that does not hesitate in any scene with their brilliant chemistry. The ship design feels dirty and lived in keeping the advanced look. Every time a button is pressed to put in commands or a lever is pulled the ship responds. The Alien design is many peoples favorites feeling real. For 1979 this movie is revolutionary in visuals and props never looking too fake. If there is anything I would have to say this movie does best on it is the cinematography.

As many people have pointed out the story is basically Bmovie stuff a spooky monster haunts some hapless people only this time they're in space. Scott stages the rather simple plot like an arthouse flick beginning with the slick and lifeless introduction to the space ship Nostromo. The atmosphere is unbelievably tense throughout the movie from the industrial Nostromo the stormy planet V426 to the phallic Alien designed by H. R. Giger. In many ways Alien is the antithesis to Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey the most megalomaniac movie ever conceived. Ridley Scott shows us that space travel won't be about philosophical selfdiscovery. It will be about dirty senseless work. Of course there are also some gender issues at stake here. Sigourney Weaever as Ellen Ripley might be most badass last girl in movie history  and maybe the first female action star that is not reduced to her womanhood. If Alien has one problem it's the fact that it betrays its Bmovie roots. There is a wannabedeep scene near the end of the movie that feels affixed as if Ridley Scott wanted to reconcile the intellectuals in the movie theater. That wasn't necessary at all.

	schema:headline " Whose idea was it to bring a cat in the first place?";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm a little confused as to why there was a cat on board in the first place. Needless to say given that there was an entire crew on board the Nostromo a merchant vessel carrying if I remember correctly something like 20000000 tons of mineral ore there was hardly a lack of companionship. At any rate I can easily brush aside my curiosity about the effort that went into designing the life support system that would have been needed to keep the cat alive along with the rest of the humans as they traveled for months on end in deep sleep. It doesn't matter because the cat was involved in most of the scariest scenes. That being said I think that one of the things that really makes Alien great is that it explains all the twists and turns of its plot in great detail which is almost unheard of in science fiction and horror films. No one displays ludicrous behavior to allow for the construction of bloody gory death scenes the alien masterfully designed isn't rushing across the screen in every scene to allow for maximum payoff of the costume design we don't even see it until well past the halfway point in the movie. Like Jaws Alien takes its time to allow the characters to gradually grasp the enormity of their situation. The Nostromo is a merchant ship which allows for a nonmilitary crew to be faced with a mortal enemy that they do not understand. The ship intercepts a strange transmission that must be from an intelligent source since it repeats itself every twelve seconds and so it wakes up the crew to investigate. The subtlety of the way the conflict is introduced is very important. The transmission didn't just appear the ship awoke the crew months ahead of schedule because it was programmed to do so should anything like that happen. And to the chagrin of a couple of the money financialminded crew members it is also in their contracts to investigate any such occurrence. The movie is covering its tracks very thoroughly and to great effect. When they reach the planet from which the transmission originated they find the spectacular discovery of what appears to be a crashed alien spaceship complete with a dead alien pilot still in his chair. A brief look at the body suggests that the pilot may have exploded from the inside creating curiosity about his death that the movie never satisfies but doesn't need to. One of the crew members discovers what look like dozens of leathery eggs gets attacked and is brought back on board the ship. Significantly protocol is broken to get him and the alien life form back on board for medical attention. When they discover that the alien has blood that melts through the hull of the ship like thermite a new and particularly difficult challenge arises. How do they kill a deadly enemy without making it bleed? And to make matters worse the very ship is programmed to work against them. They are in the most hostile environment imaginable worse than anywhere on earth. They are being stalked by an unknown creature that they can't injure for fear of damaging the hull of the spaceship and the ship itself has placed the survival of the alien life form above their own survival. They have to trick the alien into submission without letting the ship know what's going on. Even HAL wasn't THIS creepy.Released at a time when science fiction was probably at the most popular that it had ever been and possibly ever will be thanks to the recent release of Star Wars and the soon to follow first sequel Alien came along and capitalized in an area of science fiction that people evidently were very eager for the darker more sinister and dangerous side. The side of science fiction with the bloody deaths rather than light sabers and heroes. In fact by looking at the way people probably saw Alien in 1979 and the way they see it now you can learn a lot about how science fiction and horror have evolved over the years. Back then this was horrorscience fiction. Today it's science fictionhorror. But while it was more horrible in 1979 than it is today it is significant that while other films that have come along over the years have overshadowed Alien as far as the intensity of the horror the movie has lost none of its powerful effect. Rather than reinventing the science fiction genre by adding horror to it it is now maintaining the life of the science fiction genre by reminding us of how good it can be when it's done right.".

The subtlety of the way the conflict is introduced is very important. The transmission didn't just appear the ship awoke the crew months ahead of schedule because it was programmed to do so should anything like that happen. And to the chagrin of a couple of the money financialminded crew members it is also in their contracts to investigate any such occurrence. The movie is covering its tracks very thoroughly and to great effect. When they reach the planet from which the transmission originated they find the spectacular discovery of what appears to be a crashed alien spaceship complete with a dead alien pilot still in his chair. A brief look at the body suggests that the pilot may have exploded from the inside creating curiosity about his death that the movie never satisfies but doesn't need to. One of the crew members discovers what look like dozens of leathery eggs gets attacked and is brought back on board the ship. Significantly protocol is broken to get him and the alien life form back on board for medical attention. When they discover that the alien has blood that melts through the hull of the ship like thermite a new and particularly difficult challenge arises. How do they kill a deadly enemy without making it bleed? And to make matters worse the very ship is programmed to work against them. They are in the most hostile environment imaginable worse than anywhere on earth. They are being stalked by an unknown creature that they can't injure for fear of damaging the hull of the spaceship and the ship itself has placed the survival of the alien life form above their own survival. They have to trick the alien into submission without letting the ship know what's going on. Even HAL wasn't THIS creepy.Released at a time when science fiction was probably at the most popular that it had ever been and possibly ever will be thanks to the recent release of Star Wars and the soon to follow first sequel Alien came along and capitalized in an area of science fiction that people evidently were very eager for the darker more sinister and dangerous side. The side of science fiction with the bloody deaths rather than light sabers and heroes. In fact by looking at the way people probably saw Alien in 1979 and the way they see it now you can learn a lot about how science fiction and horror have evolved over the years. Back then this was horrorscience fiction. Today it's science fictionhorror. But while it was more horrible in 1979 than it is today it is significant that while other films that have come along over the years have overshadowed Alien as far as the intensity of the horror the movie has lost none of its powerful effect. Rather than reinventing the science fiction genre by adding horror to it it is now maintaining the life of the science fiction genre by reminding us of how good it can be when it's done right.";

	schema:reviewBody "Unforgiven may well be Clint Eastwood's greatest triumph as an actor and director.  In this grim dark and yet strangely beautiful story of former gunslinger William Munny Eastwood who comes out of retirement for one last job Eastwood deliberately sets out to demystify the old West.  This is evident in the conversations between Munny and the Schofield Kid Jaimze Wolvett who has a romanticized image of the oldtime gunfighters and between sheriff Little Bill Daggett Gene Hackman and hack journalist W.W. Beauchamp Saul Rubinek.  Yet the demythologizing message doesn't feel forced it is woven effortlessly into a gripping story that powerfully conveys the human cost of violence.Moral ambiguity pervades the film which has no easy resolutions and no customary clear lines between good and evil.  Will and his friend Ned Morgan Freeman nominally the heroes have clearly done many bad things in their lives.  When they come to Big Whiskey as hired killers it is ostensibly for a just cause  to punish two nogood cowboys who slashed the face of a prostitute.  Yet as we know from the beginning the version of the attack that is reported to Will and Ned is highly and grotesquely exaggerated. While the cowboys certainly should have been punished we may legitimately wonder if death is a punishment that fits the crime.  The agonizing death of the younger of the two cowboys who didn't do the slashing and clearly felt bad about what his partner had done certainly doesn't look like justice.The ostensible villain Little Bill is not just a villain.  He is a sheriff determined to preserve law and order in the town.  One can't blame him for wanting to keep paid assassins out.  In a violent society there's no way he can do his job without using violence.  Unfortunately he also takes a sadistic pleasure in his brutality  even though he also seems to want a peaceful quiet life in the house he's building.One might say that Munny's heroics in the gunsblazing climax undercut the film's purpose of dismantling the mystique of the Old West and its gunfighters.  But the truth is Unforgiven is both an homage to and a deconstruction of that mystique.  While Munny acquires almost mythic stature in that scene his actions are still morally shady and his exchange with the nerdy Beauchamp quickly dispels the romantic aura.  What's more his rise to heroism can also be seen as a fall from grace and a reversion to his old ways.The film may be just a tad slow at times but at 2 hrs 10 minutes it remains nearly always gripping.  As for those IMDB reviewers who've knocked the movie because there are too many scenes where Eastwood's character is weak and pathetic falling off his horse or getting beat up  why don't you just go see some Arnold Schwarzenegger flick!  Not only are the principal characters welldeveloped but even minor characters come across as real people with individual traits the credit is due both to the excellent screenplay and to the superb cast.  The scenes between Will Munny and Delilah the prostitute who was slashed are very touching without being at all sappy.  Eastwood is simply superb as the tortured and selfloathing Munny Gene Hackman fully matches him as Little Bill Morgan Freeman exudes a quiet dignity as Ned Wolvett acquits himself well as the Kid.  Add to this a scenestealing performance by Richard Harris as the elegant vicious gunslinger English Bob and terrific work by Saul Rubinek Frances Fisher as the prostitute Strawberry Alice and Anna Levine as Delilah.Unforgiven is a modern classic a mustsee for those who appreciate intelligent highquality filmmaking.".

	schema:headline " Requiem for a Western";
	schema:reviewBody "Unforgiven will always be the last Western. No matter what comes after it Tombstone The Missing or Wyatt Erp Unforgiven has the final word. Not that I wouldn't characterize those films as Westerns but the spirit of Unforgiven from the opening shot of the house with the scrawny tree and lonely grave to the end which returns there is imbued with the finality of a spent genre. The feelings evoked are ambivalent and distant much like the characters within Unforgiven itself. Perhaps Clint Eastwood's genius lies partially in that he doesn't allow for us to mourn. It wouldn't be western to cry because a storyform is over it wouldn't be leather to empathize for a broken man who doesn't want your sympathy it wouldn't be spurs to despair about the implacable and corrupt forces of life which turn men like William Munny into killers. Clint Eastwood presents to the audience the most distorted configuration of the western the most disfigured example of a genre whose classical conventions were untouchable and sacrosanct. We have no heroes and no villains only a protagonist and a puffed up sheriff who thinks he's doing the right thing and does in fact have more moral vision than the dried out killer The movie itself is riddled with identity crises the killer has turned into a farmer and a father the young gunslinger is a virgin to bloodletting the sheriff shows signs of being a slave master and the innocent one gets it first and gets it dirty. Gone are the days of the Magnificent 7 where one rode into town rallied the brave cowpokes with shiny silver pistols and dispatched an easily recognizable enemy. Gone even are the days of Bonnie and Clyde where gunslingers were attractive and fascinating to the audience exuding flair charisma and sparking the imagination. They were legends William Munny is a sad bit of history. He is presented with deadpan honesty not as a caricatured Tarantino assassin or a misunderstood old man who has atoned for past wrongs. He is a broken human person so lost along the moral frontier that the only compass he can grasp is more killing. Throughout the movie we are reminded again and again of the stark contrast Unforgiven stands in to most other Westerns by the obsequious scribe W. W. Beauchamp. He was the one who wrote the John Wayne stories the ones with ethical clarity at least. He was the one who coined phrases like highnoon and hot lead. In Unforgiven Clint Eastwood takes apart the classical western narrative piece by piece allowing the audience to inspect the illusion. Characters like English Bob are unscrupulous frauds ladies in distress are revenge bent whores and old men really don't ever change for the better. They become that way when sensationalized by hack storytellers like Beauchamp.

	onyx:emotionText "Unforgiven will always be the last Western. No matter what comes after it Tombstone The Missing or Wyatt Erp Unforgiven has the final word. Not that I wouldn't characterize those films as Westerns but the spirit of Unforgiven from the opening shot of the house with the scrawny tree and lonely grave to the end which returns there is imbued with the finality of a spent genre. The feelings evoked are ambivalent and distant much like the characters within Unforgiven itself. Perhaps Clint Eastwood's genius lies partially in that he doesn't allow for us to mourn. It wouldn't be western to cry because a storyform is over it wouldn't be leather to empathize for a broken man who doesn't want your sympathy it wouldn't be spurs to despair about the implacable and corrupt forces of life which turn men like William Munny into killers. Clint Eastwood presents to the audience the most distorted configuration of the western the most disfigured example of a genre whose classical conventions were untouchable and sacrosanct. We have no heroes and no villains only a protagonist and a puffed up sheriff who thinks he's doing the right thing and does in fact have more moral vision than the dried out killer The movie itself is riddled with identity crises the killer has turned into a farmer and a father the young gunslinger is a virgin to bloodletting the sheriff shows signs of being a slave master and the innocent one gets it first and gets it dirty. Gone are the days of the Magnificent 7 where one rode into town rallied the brave cowpokes with shiny silver pistols and dispatched an easily recognizable enemy. Gone even are the days of Bonnie and Clyde where gunslingers were attractive and fascinating to the audience exuding flair charisma and sparking the imagination. They were legends William Munny is a sad bit of history. He is presented with deadpan honesty not as a caricatured Tarantino assassin or a misunderstood old man who has atoned for past wrongs. He is a broken human person so lost along the moral frontier that the only compass he can grasp is more killing. Throughout the movie we are reminded again and again of the stark contrast Unforgiven stands in to most other Westerns by the obsequious scribe W. W. Beauchamp. He was the one who wrote the John Wayne stories the ones with ethical clarity at least. He was the one who coined phrases like highnoon and hot lead. In Unforgiven Clint Eastwood takes apart the classical western narrative piece by piece allowing the audience to inspect the illusion. Characters like English Bob are unscrupulous frauds ladies in distress are revenge bent whores and old men really don't ever change for the better. They become that way when sensationalized by hack storytellers like Beauchamp. And when the only character materializes who seems to at least fit the description of gunslinger Munny is so empty and hopelessly unheroic that we begin to reconcile ourselves to the end of the Western. Where else is there to go? We understand how the old stories were crafted thanks to the insider's view provided by Beauchamp and what's left is a craggy faced cadaver with a dead wife a dead friend and two forgotten children.Every character within Unforgiven inhabits a gray zone that clouds the audiences's ability to easily categorize them as good or evil.

	schema:reviewBody "Ford Hawks Leone Peckinpah all of them big names who have defined the Western genre in one way or another across the history of cinema transforming what started as lowbudget action films into an art itself where the American Old West served as setting for tales of mythical heroism classic tragedies and legendary adventures. Actor and Director Clint Eastwood is probably one of the most knowledgeable artists about the Western genre as his acting career began as the legendary Man With No Name in the Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns of the 60s. As a director he somewhat continued this legacy through movies like High Plains Drifter and Pale Rider but finally in 1992 Eastwood released what many consider his final ode to the Western and his ultimate masterpiece of the genre Unforgiven an epic saga about the deconstruction of the Western myths.Clint Eastwood himself plays William Munny a former gunslinger who is now living a peaceful life as a farmer with his two children. However life is very difficult for Munny's family as since the death of his wife the family has been facing financial problems. One day a young man calling himself The Schofield Kid Jaimz Woolvett appears looking for Munny. The Kid tells Munny about a bounty offered in the town of Big Whisky and offers him the chance to join him as hired gun and split the reward between them. While Munny's days as a murderer are in the past he decides to join him after thinking about the farm's problems but not without calling his old friend Ned Logan Morgan Freeman to join them. However Munny's past as a notorious thief and murderer will return to haunt him in this last mission as the Kid shows a true and honest admiration for Munny's fame as a gunslinger even when Munny himself considers his past as villainous.While better known for his work in science fiction David Webb Peoples' screenplay proves to be a very accurate description of life in the American west particularly concerning the aspects of the uses and abuses of violence in that era. It is in fact the use of violence what comes as the main theme of the story as Munny is escaping from his past's violence while the Kid is eagerly awaiting the next chance to prove his masculinity by the use of violence. The duality between man and myth is explored not only via the relationship between the Kid and Munny but also in the shape of a character who writes novels about the wild west and sees the figure of the gunslinger as an idolized modern hero. Peoples' screenplay is remarkably well written as the many characters and their relationships are exhaustively explored resulting in a character driven revisionism of the western that in many ways criticizes the genre's origins as violent Shoot 'em up films.Peoples' script is definitely the movie's backbone but it is Eastwood's masterful direction what transforms this meditation of violence into a unique revision of the Western. With a gritty and realistic approach very in tone with the script Eastwood portraits the Wild West without romanticism and leaving out the mythic aspects of the genre taking the revisionism of the Western one step beyond. Using Peoples' script Eastwood takes a critic view on the figure of the hero in Westerns focusing on the image of the gunslinger and the use of violence to solve problems. Visually Eastwood has crafted his most impressive movie since Bird with an extensive use of shadows and light in the excellent work of cinematography by Jack N. Green. Eastwood's style originated by the influence of Sergio Leone and Don Siegel and developed through many stages seems to finally have spawned its masterpiece in this film.As William Munny Clint Eastwood is simply perfect in what at first sight looks like an extension of his earlier Man with no name persona. William Munny has a name and a past he wants to escape from and Estwood captures the image of guilt and regret to the letter. This is easily one of his best roles to date. Morgan Freeman is also very good as Ned Logan although like Jaimz Woolvett who plays The Schofield Kid gets easily overshadowed by Gene Hackman's powerful performance as Little Bill Daggett. Hackman completely owns every scene he is in showcasing his enormous talent in a very dramatic role. The legendary Richard Harris has a small appearance as another aging gunslinger English Bob in very memorable scenes where he demonstrates why he is considered one of the best actors of his generation.After starting his career playing a mythical hero in Leone's Dollars trilogy it is actually fitting that is Eastwood who explores the figure of hero in his many movies. Ever since his first directed western Eastwood showed an interest in the duality of the hero taking a special interest in the archetype of hero portrayed in the classic 1953 Western Shane. Eastwood has explored this theme in many ways in the past first as a true antihero High Plains Drifter then as a man becoming legend The Outlaw Josey Wales and later as a true mythic hero Pale Rider all this culminates in Unforgiven as the ultimate demythologization of the concept and his final ode to the Western genre. While the movie indeed feels a bit preachy at times the story is devised in such a way that it never feels too heavy handed as it unfolds nicely as a classic epic tale of the West.Personally I can't praise this movie enough as it is easily one of the best Westerns done since Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch and required viewing not only for fans of the genre. While some consider it an antiWestern I think that with this movie Eastwood's name can proudly stand along those of Ford Hawks Leone and Peckinpah as a master of the Western. Unforgiven is definitely Clint's masterpiece. 1010".

Widowed and struggling to raise his two children on a paltry farm he's tempted out of retirement for one last pay dirt job the consequence of which provides violence both physically and of the soul.Clint Eastwood signed off from the Western genre with this magnificent 1992 picture the appropriation and irony of which is in itself a majestic point of reference. After the script had been knocking around for nigh on twenty years written by Blade Runner scribe David Webb Peoples Eastwood seized the opportunity to play William Munney and lay bare the mythologies of the Wild West. What is most amazing about Unforgiven's screenplay is how we the audience are firmly on Munney's side we are incredibly influenced by Eastwood's part in the history of the Western. In spite of Munney's obvious murky past despicable crimes they be we wait and hope for Munney to make a quip and waylay the bad guys actually salivating at the prospect is probably closer to the truth. So it's with enormous credit that Eastwood and his magnificent cast and crew manage to fuddle all our respective perceptions of the West and the characters we ourselves have aged with. It's not for nothing that W.W. Beauchamp Saul Rubinek is the critical character that nobody expected. Beauchamp is a writer of penny pulpy novels that tell of derringdo heroics gunslingers with a glint in their eye and death dealt like an heroic encore this gives Unforgiven its excellent sleight of hand this West is grim and a destroyer of all illusions.Eastwood is greatly served by the actors around him here Morgan Freeman Gene Hackman winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for a script he turned down many years before! Rubinek Frances Fisher Anna Thomson Jaimz Woolvett and an incredible cameo from Richard Harris. Along with Hackman's win for his brutally tough portrayal of Sheriff Little Bill Daggett Unforgiven also won Oscars for Eastwood for his clinically tight direction Best Picture Best Editing and was nominated for in another five categories. One of those nominations was for Jack Green's cinematography which now in this age of High Definition enhanced cinema can be seen in all its wonderful glory. The Alberta location is magically transformed into the western frontier with the orange and brown hues a real treat for the eyes. Ultimately tho Unforgiven is a lesson in brilliant film making across the board it works so well why? Well because the man at the helm knows this genre so well having been its sole flag bearer for practically 25 years and learning from his peers Eastwood has crafted a thematically complex piece that for all its violence debunking and melancholy pulse beats is a film that is as beautiful as it is most assuredly stark an incredible and true highlight of modern day cinema. 1010".

I was also excited to see Morgan Freeman in the cast so I know now that Million Dollar Baby was not Clint and Morgan's first experience together. They work so well as a team and bring nothing but sheer entertainment and charm to movies.Unforgiven is a very good picture that has a real story and isn't just about cops and robbers or cowboys and Indians. How far would you go for a friend? I loved Will and Ned's friendship so much because you could tell how much they had been through together and Will went back to his old ways in the blink of an eye for his dear friend. I loved watching Will's story through the movie the first time you see him he's just so charming and you would never had suspected of his former life of crime alcohol and bloodshed. Through the film you have a lot of doubt for his character if he could go back to his old life despite his promises to his deceased wife. He the Kid and Ned go on a trip to kill two cowboys who cut up a prostitute's face for 1000.00. Together they learn that this isn't going to be such an easy task when the boys they're hunting down belong to a town where guns and all arms are banned that could lead to a punishment as far as death. But Will gets sick and the Kid and Ned give a lot of talk in killing these cowboys themselves when Will is just half himself he does the deed himself in killing one of the cowboys. He tells Ned to go back home and he'll take care of the other cowboy he does so but gets caught and beat to death by the sheriff.The Kid and Clint do the rest of the job by killing the other cowboy and receive their reward by the prostitutes but Will learns of Ned and goes back into his old habits. What happens next? You'll have to watch yourself. Something that I learned that was interesting Clint dedicated Unforgiven to Don Siegal and Sergio Leone two directors who believed in him as a young actor. Unforgive is a remarkable film methodical deeply felt with a devastating emotional and moral impact. It is easily one of the best Western movies. Like I said it just has such a classic feel to it and you can't help but enjoy it. It seems like Clint might just own Hollywood one day.  810".

	schema:reviewBody "You just shot an unarmed man! Well he should have armed himself...Plenty of films have tried to examine the human side of violence. This is especially appropriate for westerns where very often rows of men are gunned down without a thought. 'Unforgiven' does better than most but where this differs from other films is that at the end this whole theme is flipped around as the outlaw William Munny Clint Eastwood pulls of a truly legendary piece of shooting. This scene though only emphasises a great sense of failure for the characters which for me is the most prominent theme of the film. For most characters their failures are obvious but I won't give too many examples for fear of spoiling it. Look at the way the trio of Munny Ned Logan Morgan Freeman and the Schofield Kid Jaimz Woolvett are slowly whittled down to just Munny as the others realise that they just don't have what it takes to kill people anymore. Munny although carrying out his task to the full has equally failed in his attempt to reform himself as he proves to himself that he is not a pig farmer after all but still the legendarily cold blooded killer from years ago. Westerns have had different ways of looking at violence. Leone looked at the build up. Peckinpah looked at the violence itself. Eastwood here looks at the moment after the violence and shows the heartbreaking consequences. Given this it is all the more shocking to see just how merciless and devastating Munny's furious assault on the saloon really is with him shooting unarmed and wounded men just for the sake of completeness. There is a question of motivations thoughbefore he was in it for the money but when a personal element is added to the mix the results are volcanic. But this is no blaze of glory for Munny but something that has to be done and although treated in a callous way there is a sense that this will have consequences as far reaching as before. Munny has failed in his attempt to reform himself and the purpose of his life is defeated. There is a suggestion that Munny is damnedthere is a moment in the carnage where Munny stops for a drink. The scene is shot so that Eastwood appears to have no reflection the large mirror placed above the bar.  More obvious is the following exchange between Munny and Sheriff Dagget Gene HackmanSee you in Hell William Munny Yeah.The way the climax is presented would be perhaps more appropriate for a more lurid western with most shots going wildfar more shots are fired than are strictly necessary in true action film tradition. This is just the point though as the end is supposed to be at odds with the grittily realistic nature of the rest of the film. The end result is a powerful message powerfully put across.That is not to say that other westerns that do not necessarily share this sentiment at least to this level are less powerfulthe theme of 'Once Upon A Time In The West' is equally strong and affecting but the message is different and presented in a different way. 'Unforgiven' proves though both to the writer W.W. Beauchamp Saul Rubinek and to the audience that there is a flip side to every story and a dark side to every man.".

	schema:reviewBody "Clint Eastwood's storytelling gives the western genre one of its most sublime story's. Gone is the trademark mysterious hero and in its place is an ex gunman who made his peace when he met his wife. Eastwood has transcended traditional entertainment to storytelling craftsmanship. He delivers rich characters with deep rooted problems inextricably linked to the villains of the story. Refusing to wither and die away style has been perfectly adapted with age thus ensuring his maturation into a true Hollywood legend.Besides his now distinctive storytelling there are numerous factors that make this a landmark Western. The ensemble cast could not have been stronger and there were no weak performances. The soundtrack accentuates the intended atmosphere of the director. A single detracting factor I could find only just qualifies as such. Munny's whimsical lines seemed a little contrived at times. They droned on like pale attempts to capture the Western era. But this is a consequence of the fact that they were more to do with the character of William Munny. He is after all a reformed killer with a now passive approach to people. Given this fact and also that it may have been distracting since it was so out of sync with what we are used to seeing from Eastwood I still have to list it as a demerit on the account it slightly jerked me out of the story.Hollywood producers have to satisfy audience preferences if investments are going to accrue profits. It is the nature of the beast. The action and more specifically the Western genre will stick to tried and tested formulas in order to guarantee audience acceptance. But every so often you get people who as a natural consequence of their unique character appeal are able to deliver a story that is outside these understandably restrictive boundaries. Eastwood is a cool individualist who normally plays characters who are not team players and do it their own way. His own way this time is to give the western genre a real story oozing characterization. A sort of ballad for the bad guy.The ballads tune provides the story with a sad introspective mood within the opening and closing scenes. The opening scene depicts Munny in his new found life. He is cured of his wicked ways helped by his dear departed wife. But men are not willing to forgive or forget his monstrous deeds and in the final scenes he is who he has to be. Such is the sorrowful life of William Munny.Westerns are typified by clearly defined goodies and baddies but this is definitely not the case here. Eastwood and Freeman play reformed killers who find circumstances drawing them once again to their evil ways. But the older and wiser men now realize the value of life and come face to face with their troubled consciences. This is unlike their nave young partner who is attracted to the bravado image of the killer and relishes taking a man's life. This moral issue is virtually taboo for the classic western which glamorizes the lawlessness and the hero attraction of the gunslinger. This is also why in my view noone besides Eastwood should have handled this movie.Then we have the juiciest character of the movie superbly played by Gene Hackman worthy of the weight of every micro granule of his Oscar. He is the epitome of every hardline lawman that ever was. The misguidance of the so called righteously empowered swinging the hammer against evil for good. Hackman must have salivated when he read the script since there was obvious relish in his performance. All the better for the movie and of course for Eastwood at the Oscars. By far the best performance and the others were good further underlining the talent of the man.The antagonist of the movie is almost always the most complex and thus most interesting to analyze. His vain attempts at carpentry are his way of trying to appear to be a good man. There is purity in building ones own home and it is this wholesomeness that he wishes to capture. In that way his fellow citizens will see him as a simple man only wanting to lead a righteous life. But his inability as a carpenter is indicative of his depravity. He cannot be a good man. The source of his drive is anger and hatred. It is through this failing that we realize he cannot escape who he is.Indeed it was not only the power of the script that gave the audience a spellbinding climax but the talents of the actors. The actors' characterizations deliver the audience a spellbinding climax. It is only through Hackman's performance that we not only acknowledge his ending as inevitable but also as deserving. We saw him as a man who virtually thought that he was righteously empowered to rid the earth of Munny and his kind What he thought was an honorable task was one rather of abuse and suppression. He became the baddie in the eyes of the audience and it is he who the audience wants to see justice served upon. Munny was so weak throughout the movie that the eruption of his evil ways captured the interest of the audience. He transformed into the Eastwood of old  the anti hero with a far more malevolent presence. Never could we have sensed this hatred and evil that we now see in William Munny. It is now that the frivolity of his mannerisms that I touched on in the beginning adds to the story as it helps to accentuate the turn in character. He is now only a killer in it neither for money or fame as the writer nearly finds out to his tragic detriment.Those who have only seen his Westerns of old or the 'Dirty Harry' movies may enter the cinema with expectations of such like will either be disappointed or pleasantly surprised. It is the atypical western and an unfamiliar portrayal by Eastwood. But I believe that most people will have the latter reaction. The differences are their strengths helped by the fact that it was a superbly crafted movie with a meaningful story and thought provoking lessons for our heroes and villains. Eastwood was directly suited to the roles that we identify him with but it is exactly because of this suitability that he eases into the role of Munny. No mellowing with age no identification with the mainstream he has always done it his way and he is so good that any way could be his way.".

	schema:headline " Amazingly ThoughtProvoking on How Much a Life is Worth and the Inner Workings of a Man With a Regrettable Past.";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1992 Clint Eastwood created the last and greatest western 'Unforgiven'. A tribute to the previous masters Sergio Leone and Don Siegel who died within a mere 3 years before this brutal masterpiece.Eastwood stars as William Munny a retired gunslinger with a guiltfilled past. He lives alone with his two children and grave of his young wife outside. One day a young cowboy The Schofield Kid Jaimz Woolvett comes in need of his service to hunt down some men who cut up a whore. William reluctantly accepts and with the help of Ned Logan Morgan Freeman they work together to track down the criminals. Meanwhile the sheriff of the town Little Bill Daggett Gene Hackman is also looking for them. This then leads to a bloody showdown climax welcoming back a sort of 'Man With No Name' character to the genre.William Munny is a coldblooded killer. The Schofield Kid wants to be one. But all the murders and sins Munny used to commit has affected him in an extraordinary way. He takes no hesitation in killing. In the climax he just walks past a man he shot who didn't die and shoots him dead. It may sound like nothing now but he just took a life for no apparent reason. When the Kid kills his first man of which deserved it he hesitates. This is The Kid who is so eager to kill people as he thinks it will make him a man. But after the assassination he breaks down. He realized what he had done. He had wiped another man of the earth. And Munny does it with ease. So does Little Bill. He is a violent and brutal cop who uses torture to get what he wants from the prisoners. Logan also finds it hard to take lives.The film studies on how much a life is worth. Sometimes it is worthless see Tarantino or Scorsese films and sometimes it is a major feature. Usually a film only does one. Unforgiven does both. A life isn't worth the same amount to each person. When a life is taken it is the killer who decides how much it is worth by how much it affects him. Whether he just lets it slide Munny and Little Bill or kills someone and calls it a day Kid and Logan because they can't bring themselves to forgetting it. This is the most thoughtprovoking thing for me personally ever.Unforgiven in my opinion is the greatest western. Actually its the greatest film of alltime. It shows how violent it was back then and the fact everybody was beaten. It is more realistic than any of Leone's 'Man With No Name' films though I will admit they were set in a sort of fantasy land. But Munny is not proud of his violent nature. He blames it on alcohol which his wife persuaded him to quit to explain why he also gave up being a murderer. The film shows the cowboys as they really are either cowards or killers. The choice of word 'coward' is to say that they should be killers as that is apparently what a man is an exaggeration as most westerns glorify violence but the men can't handle it.Clint Eastwood did an amazing job as William Munny. He showed how he regretted his past very well by admitting to it in a shameful way like when asked if he killed women and children he replied I've killed just about anything that walked or crawled at one time or another and I'm here to kill you. He even admits that he will meet Little Bill in Hell. Gene Hackman delivers one of the greatest performances of the decade the tension he makes is incredible. Woolvett and Freeman remain in solid above average performances throughout.The script written by David Webb Peoples buzzed around Hollywood for nearly 20 years even being rejected by some of the cast before Eastwood picked it up. Clint Eastwood deserved his Oscar for best direction. The plot flowed fluently with some surprises and memorable lines. An instant classic. The cinematography is much different that of 'The Good The Bad and The Ugly' or the others westerns Eastwood appeared in. It is a much cleaner and crisp view yet also being extremely raw. The score though not used often is very refreshing and moving.'Unforgiven' is an unforgettable look on life man and the real west. One of the most powerful films of the '90s. A true triumph exploring important morals. Do not miss it.910".

One day a young cowboy The Schofield Kid Jaimz Woolvett comes in need of his service to hunt down some men who cut up a whore. William reluctantly accepts and with the help of Ned Logan Morgan Freeman they work together to track down the criminals. Meanwhile the sheriff of the town Little Bill Daggett Gene Hackman is also looking for them. This then leads to a bloody showdown climax welcoming back a sort of 'Man With No Name' character to the genre.William Munny is a coldblooded killer. The Schofield Kid wants to be one. But all the murders and sins Munny used to commit has affected him in an extraordinary way. He takes no hesitation in killing. In the climax he just walks past a man he shot who didn't die and shoots him dead. It may sound like nothing now but he just took a life for no apparent reason. When the Kid kills his first man of which deserved it he hesitates. This is The Kid who is so eager to kill people as he thinks it will make him a man. But after the assassination he breaks down. He realized what he had done. He had wiped another man of the earth. And Munny does it with ease. So does Little Bill. He is a violent and brutal cop who uses torture to get what he wants from the prisoners. Logan also finds it hard to take lives.The film studies on how much a life is worth. Sometimes it is worthless see Tarantino or Scorsese films and sometimes it is a major feature. Usually a film only does one. Unforgiven does both. A life isn't worth the same amount to each person. When a life is taken it is the killer who decides how much it is worth by how much it affects him. Whether he just lets it slide Munny and Little Bill or kills someone and calls it a day Kid and Logan because they can't bring themselves to forgetting it. This is the most thoughtprovoking thing for me personally ever.Unforgiven in my opinion is the greatest western. Actually its the greatest film of alltime. It shows how violent it was back then and the fact everybody was beaten. It is more realistic than any of Leone's 'Man With No Name' films though I will admit they were set in a sort of fantasy land. But Munny is not proud of his violent nature. He blames it on alcohol which his wife persuaded him to quit to explain why he also gave up being a murderer. The film shows the cowboys as they really are either cowards or killers. The choice of word 'coward' is to say that they should be killers as that is apparently what a man is an exaggeration as most westerns glorify violence but the men can't handle it.Clint Eastwood did an amazing job as William Munny. He showed how he regretted his past very well by admitting to it in a shameful way like when asked if he killed women and children he replied I've killed just about anything that walked or crawled at one time or another and I'm here to kill you. He even admits that he will meet Little Bill in Hell. Gene Hackman delivers one of the greatest performances of the decade the tension he makes is incredible. Woolvett and Freeman remain in solid above average performances throughout.The script written by David Webb Peoples buzzed around Hollywood for nearly 20 years even being rejected by some of the cast before Eastwood picked it up. Clint Eastwood deserved his Oscar for best direction. The plot flowed fluently with some surprises and memorable lines. An instant classic. The cinematography is much different that of 'The Good The Bad and The Ugly' or the others westerns Eastwood appeared in. It is a much cleaner and crisp view yet also being extremely raw. The score though not used often is very refreshing and moving.'Unforgiven' is an unforgettable look on life man and the real west. One of the most powerful films of the '90s. A true triumph exploring important morals. Do not miss it.910";

	schema:reviewBody "Unforgiven is Clint Eastwood's tribute to his mentors Sergio Leone and Don Siegel. Regarded by many as the last true Western Unforgiven is truly unforgettable. Though it being the last true Western is subject to qualification but it definitely consummates the genre. In fact it will easily make it to the top 10 of the decorated genre a genre illuminated by greats like Ford Wayne Leone Peckinpah and Eastwood himself. The movie not only revived Eastwood's career as an actor but also certified his directorial prowess. Unforgiven doesn't embody righteousness but projects domination based on ruthless opportunism. It is a clash of egos a battle of icons in Gene Hackman and Clint Eastwood each ubiquitously acclaimed for his idiosyncratic style and delivery. The two scenes that they share in the movie are exact antithesis of each other giving them a chance to display their protean skills. The first encounter between William Munny Eastwood and Little Bill Hackman portrays Munny at his most vulnerable pitted against a brutally dominant and unforgiving Bill. The second encounter is a completely different affair with Munny calling the shots against a helpless Bill. The other scenes are equally brilliant especially the one between English Bob Richard Harris and Little bill. The entire cast has performed really well with a special mention of Morgan Freeman as Ned Logan. Unforgiven is undoubtedly a quintessential Western and a must for the fans of the genre.httpwww.apotpourriofvestiges.com".

	schema:reviewBody "To say that this is the best western ever made or to say that it's Clint Eastwood's best film would be wrong. Why? Because such droll understatement would be woefully misleading. This film isn't just those merely those things. Unforgiven ranks as one of the greatest films of all time. Period. No delimiters or qualifiers apply. And what follows is my view of this film's place in Hollywood history.When John Wayne died in 1979 it was emblematic of the state of the western genre in Hollywood. In fact Wayne's last film The Shootist dwelt on exactly that and indeed that was what The Shootist was all about the end of the wild west the end of westerns in Hollywood and of course the impending demise of John Wayne. Hey to say these things to make these statements is precisely why they ever took the time and the bother to make The Shootist. So then when the Duke really did die the keys to Hollywood's westerns kingdom were handed off to Clint Eastwood a bequeath almost by default. Through the 70s Wayne and Eastwood were just about the only ones left making westerns and The Outlaw Josey Wales 1976 his then most recent effort was arguably Eastwood's best film to date. But Clint deserved receiving those keys because he had earned them. Clint patiently waited nine years to release his next western Pale Rider a homage to the western classic Shane. In 1985 the general consensus was that Pale Rider was Clint Eastwood's finest film his defining masterpiece. But as it turned out Clint wasn't done. Seven years later in 1992 he released what is now said to be his last western Unforgiven. And with Unforgiven Clint hits all the classic western themes. I won't belabor retelling the story because that's been done very well elsewhere in other comments. Nor will I dwell too much on the myriad layering of the characters. I will say that in watching and rewatching and rewatching numerous more times it became quite clear to me that Unforgiven was Clint's labor of love. It's the little things subtleties that reveal that truth. Things like the classic cowboy lines that roll off the character's tongues without a second thought but which reach deep and stay with you. Too many of those to list but just read all the other reviews on this site where they are recounted nicely. One striking thing is the implicit irony that the characters as ostensibly depicted are to a one exactly opposite of their true nature or of how they themselves want to be. The Schofield Kid blustering braggadocio notwithstanding is no killer. I ain't like you Will a chastened Kid says as he departs. And Little Bill Daggett remonstratively represents law order and justice the supposed peace officer keeping the peace is in truth corrupt and sadistically violent unable to rise above his own vicious lawlessness. English Bob the erstwhile cosmopolitan gunslinger is a fraud and a coward to boot. And William Munney keeps saying he's a changed man that he ain't like that anymore. But oh yeah he is. The only honest character the only compassionate character is Ned Logan. He's the only one who kills no one because of all of them he really isn't like that and yet he is the only one of the hired killers to get killed and to suffer the consequences of being a supposed killer.To tell this story that plumbs the depths of human depravity telling it convincingly exploring various relative degrees of the human character holding the requisite feet to the fire and doing it all tightly in 131 minutes Clint assembled great cast to work with Morgan Freeman Gene Hackman and Richard Harris. All are marvelous. The film is a masterpiece.Is Unforgiven to Eastwood as The Shootist was to Wayne i.e. his own swan song of sorts? Well certainly Clint unlike John Wayne wasn't dying but the fact is Clint has never made another western. It appears that he has said all he has to say in that genre and is finished with it.And to the critic poseur who suggests that Dances With Wolves was a slightly better western puhleeeeze. Kevin Costner can't carry Clint Eastwood's jock strap literally or figuratively. At least couldn't back then at that point in his career. All too often and certainly in Dances With Wolves Costner's main attribute is his gargantuan yet wholly unwarranted ego and a selfabsorption that runs amok chewing scenery and stepping all over everybody else. And Costner's dime store cultural anthropology while earnest is laughable. The combination of Costner being Costner a corn pone and contrived story and the 4 hour length of the movie is a definite mind number. Dances With Wolves's real value is as a sleep aid. None of which is to say that Kevin Costner did not possess the capacity to make and leave an indelible mark on Hollywood's westerns. He did and he did. But it wasn't with Dances With Wolves that it happened. In 1993 Costner's career took a fortuitous turn when he worked with Eastwood in the contemporary western A Perfect World. There Costner learned and showed an ability to sublimate himself into a role and to keep his egocentric tendencies in check. Immediately following that experience Costner released Wyatt Earp a better film and a better western than Dances With Wolves. Then in 2003 Costner working with Robert Duval made Open Range arguably Costner's best work to date and certainly the best western made since Unforgiven.We can all hope that Clint has more westerns in him. If he doesn't the keys he inherited from John Wayne appear destined for Kevin Costner. Again by default.".

It appears that he has said all he has to say in that genre and is finished with it.And to the critic poseur who suggests that Dances With Wolves was a slightly better western puhleeeeze. Kevin Costner can't carry Clint Eastwood's jock strap literally or figuratively. At least couldn't back then at that point in his career. All too often and certainly in Dances With Wolves Costner's main attribute is his gargantuan yet wholly unwarranted ego and a selfabsorption that runs amok chewing scenery and stepping all over everybody else. And Costner's dime store cultural anthropology while earnest is laughable. The combination of Costner being Costner a corn pone and contrived story and the 4 hour length of the movie is a definite mind number. Dances With Wolves's real value is as a sleep aid. None of which is to say that Kevin Costner did not possess the capacity to make and leave an indelible mark on Hollywood's westerns. He did and he did. But it wasn't with Dances With Wolves that it happened. In 1993 Costner's career took a fortuitous turn when he worked with Eastwood in the contemporary western A Perfect World. There Costner learned and showed an ability to sublimate himself into a role and to keep his egocentric tendencies in check. Immediately following that experience Costner released Wyatt Earp a better film and a better western than Dances With Wolves. Then in 2003 Costner working with Robert Duval made Open Range arguably Costner's best work to date and certainly the best western made since Unforgiven.We can all hope that Clint has more westerns in him. If he doesn't the keys he inherited from John Wayne appear destined for Kevin Costner. Again by default.";

	schema:reviewBody "Contains SpoilersWho would have thought it? During the eighties when the cinematic Western was at its lowest ebb I doubt if anyone could have predicted not only that two of the best films of the early nineties would be Westerns but also that both would go on to win 'Best Picture' at the Academy Awards something that only one film from this genre had done previously. Yet that is exactly what happened. First came Kevin Costner's 'Dances With Wolves' then Clint Eastwood's 'Unforgiven'. In both cases the star also acted as director. In Eastwood's case he was returning to the genre in which he first made his name this was his first Western since 'Pale Rider' eight years earlier which in turn was his first since 'The Outlaw Josey Wales' eight years before that.In 'Unforgiven' Eastwood plays a former gunfighter and robber named William Munny. Pronounced 'Money' there seems to be a tradition in Westerns of giving characters surnames which suggest they are for hire. There is Charlton Heston's Will Penny and in 'Hannie Caulder' Robert Culp plays a hired gunman named Price. In his younger days Munny was a hardened criminal but he abandoned his life of crime when he married and settled down to life as a farmer. At the beginning of the film he is a widower trying to raise two young children on his own. He is tempted to return to his former life however when he hears of a bounty of a thousand dollars which a group of prostitutes have placed on the heads of two drunken cowboys who badly injured one of their number by cutting her face with a knife. Abandoning his children to fend for themselves Munny sets off to try and claim the money. He recruits a former associate Ned Logan and they are joined in their quest by a young man who calls himself the Schofield Kid and who is eager to make a name for himself as a gunfighter. They are not however the only men in search of the reward an eccentric Englishman named English Bob who has won himself an undeserved reputation as a Western hero is also trying to track the cowboys down.The film reminded me of another Western Michael Winner's 'Lawman' from the early seventies. That film has at its centre a sheriff whose inflexible determination to uphold the letter of the law at all costs leads to tragic consequences. 'Unforgiven' approaches the question of law enforcement from a slightly different angle. A key role is played by Gene Hackman's sheriff Bill Daggett. Unlike that of Burt Lancaster's character in 'Lawman' Daggett's approach to the law is arbitrary and inconsistent. He can at times uphold the law with savage zeal. He is determined to protect the two cowboys from vigilantism but in doing so he transgresses the law himself dealing out a brutal kicking to English Bob and an even more brutal flogging to Ned which results in the latter's death. Moreover Daggett has himself created the need for vigilante justice by denying the full protection of the law to the injured prostitute. The only punishment imposed upon the cowboys is an order to pay compensation to the woman's pimp for the loss of her economic value to him. There is in fact no character in the film who is entirely sympathetic. Munny starts the film as a reformed character but slips back into his old ways when he is tempted by the prospect of money. He becomes to borrow the title of another Eastwood Western a man prepared to kill for a fistful of dollars. The lack of an easily identifiable hero is a common feature of modern 'revisionist' Westerns. Unlike some such Westerns however Sam Peckinpah's 'The Wild Bunch' is a good example 'Unforgiven' does not lack a moral centre. The Schofield Kid and English Bob have both been seduced by the dubious mythology of the West. The Kid as his nickname suggests is an inexperienced young man but would like others to see him as a hardened and ruthless killer because he regards killing as something glamorous. Bob takes the credit for acts of violence which are wrongly attributed to him but which in reality he would be too cowardly to commit. Munny for all his faults can see Western mythology for what it is. Even when he is setting out to kill for money he remains uncomfortably aware that to kill a man to take all he has and all he's ever gonna have is a desperately serious business. In Ovid's phrase quoted in the title he sees the better path and approves but follows the worse.The first half of the film can be slowmoving but the second half is gripping as the death of his friend Ned leads Munny to seek a bloody revenge. As with many Westerns there are some attractive shots of the local scenery the film is ostensibly set in Wyoming but was actually shot in Canada but the overall tone is a dark claustrophobic one in keeping with the film's theme. Many scenes are set in gloomy interiors whether bars brothels or ranchhouses. One of the villains is actually shot dead in an outside lavatory. Of the two great Westerns of the early nineties I would marginally prefer 'Dances with Wolves' which to my mind has a greater epic sweep but by any other standard 'Unforgiven' is a very fine movie indeed wonderfully acted especially by Hackman Morgan Freeman and Eastwood himself. Freeman's role is a rare example of a black actor taking a leading role in a Western. It also asks some searching questions about the nature of law and justice revenge and the roots of violence. It is interesting that Eastwood has not made any films in the Western genre since this one perhaps he feels that it has set a standard that cannot be surpassed. 910".

But this one is more touchy than the othersit features a character who may be The Man with No Name a.k.a. Blondie thirty years after we saw him ride away at the end of The Good the Bad and the Ugly. This particular man is filled with guilt trailing him from his past when he was a gunslinging drunkard made infamous throughout the west as a brutal killer. Now he's older and a retired cowboyhe lives with his two children in the middle of nowhere as a farmer. His name is William Munny.The film opens in a town miles away run by the evil Little Bill Gene Hackman the corrupt town sherriff. In the town brothel a hooker is beaten to a pulp by two men who get away with simply having to hand over some horses to the owner of the joint. Seeking revenge the women of the facility put together their small fortunes and put up a stash of reward money for the assassination of the two men.Enter the Schofield Kid Jaimz Woolvet who is eager to hunt down the two men and collect the reward money. He invites Will Munny to accompany and help him with his quest. At first Will refuses but then he decides to put down his pitch fork and use his weapons one more time. Along the way Will and the Schofield Kid pick up Ned Morgan Freeman another retired gunslinger living out west in peace and harmony. Together they ride off into the sunset in hopes of finding their targets and collecting some reward money for their efforts. Things aren't always as simple as they seem.The Schofield Kid claims he has killed five men. But Ned and Will come to an agreement that they think he's bluffing. The Schofield Kid is like an eager kid wanting to impress his role model. WheUnforgiven is a tender western that isn't quite as unrealistic as you might expect walking into the theater to watch it. Clint Eastwood is famous for the cowboy roles. Now it's his turn to give a new insight into the feelings of cowboys. The underlying roots of the movie are quite simpleyou can't teach an old dog new tricks. Even though Will has left his brutal and abusive past behind him his old personality is still in there somewhere amongst the chaos of his colliding feelings. He's a man beaten by his heart more than by any enemy he has encountered in the past.Gene Hackman is always good for bad guy roles mainly because he can create some of the most hateable characters of all time. I saw Crimson Tide immediately after Unforgivenhis roles are often the same but there is no doubting that he can create a truly mean character while still adding some depth to his persona.Clint Eastwood is one great director. He has created a wonderful and grim epic that transcends the genre. Westerns have always been a bit cheesy as compared to more contemporary films after all there's a reason they're often called spaghetti westerns. Unforgiven is given the regular screen treatment. This is a more accurate portrayal of the wild wild west. The Good the Bad and the Ugly is superior but that's a given.The end of Unforgiven is a mix between Taxi Driver and The Good the Bad and the Ugly. It's a bit depressing but at the same time refreshingly noble. It's one of the best cinematic climaxes ever created. The message behind Unforgiven may not be encouraging but some of the greatest films aren't.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's interesting that when UNFORGIVEN was released every review show that showed an excerpt would would always show the same clip  the climax where Clint Eastwood's grizzled antihero walks in to the saloon and informs Gene Hackman  I've killed everything that's walked and crawled and now i've come to kill you little Bill  .

You could still have Eastwood  Hackman and Harris play the same characters. One can speculate the critics wouldn't have held it in too high regard because there wasn't enough violent action as seen in the likes of HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER . David Webb Peoples screenplay is well over long by about an hour and is populated by characters that don't really drive the plot forward . Take for example the character of English Bob superbly played by Richard Harris . He arrives in town is beaten up by Little Bob  who arrests and taunts him in the town jailhouse and is then run out of town . It's an acting tour de force by both Harris and Hackman but what has this to do with anything except to perhaps point out it's July the fourth ? It's a very loose screenplay which puzzles me why it was so rewarded by that year's award shows I can see what UNFORGIVEN is trying to do . The title alone points out the subtext  it's a story of one man's redemption . The problem is that the story for some perplexing reason introduces so many characters that it looses focus on the person and clogs up the story unnecessarily . These characters are cast very well and this saves the film from its most obvious fault in that it's an overlong film lacking a central narrative drive . You don't agree ? Imagine if Kevin Costner as Bill Munney  Eddie Murphy as Ned Long  Hugh Grant as English Bob and Jason Priestley as The Schofield Kid . Different film now isn't it ?".

When the colonial marines are called upon to search the deserted space colony they later find out that they are up against more than what they bargained for.

	schema:reviewBody "Aliens 1986 is a masterpiece one of the best action scifi horror war films of all time hands down. I love this movie to death it is my personal number 1 best action scifihorror movie that I love to death. In my opinion this is James Cameron best film ever don't get me wrong I love The Terminator I love Terminator 2 Judgment Day to death they are both my personal favorite James Cameron films because Cameron is a legend I appreciate him. The same time my personal favorite films of all time will always be Aliens and Rambo First Blood Part II because James Cameron wrote the script for it. It is a badass film and I wrote a war because this time is war in the planet LV426 Platoon of US Space Marines fights against Aliens.I know a lot of people compere this film to an action and scifi genre but doesn't compare to horror genre. There's plenty of horror in it the opening scene the dreams sequence in which Ripley has a nightmare and we see Ripley been cocooned from one of those Alien creatures in her stomach that was scary sequence in which her cat Jones start hissing and creeps me out every time I see it. The creepy atmosphere of the LV426 colony and the heart pounding face hugger on the loose scene in the medical bay that is horror sequence.I love James Horner's music score for the movie which is his best soundtrack ever who is no longer with us anymore. R.I.P. you are missed.I love all the characters Ripley Newt than the marines Corporal Dwayne Hicks Bishop Private Hudson Lieutenant Gorman Private Vasquez Sergeant Apone Private Drake Private Frost Corporal Ferro Private Spunkmeyer Corporal Dietrich Private Crowe and Private Wierzbowski I love them all in this movie and they are memorable.Sigourney Weaver returns as Ellen Ripley who travels with a platoon of US Colonial Marines to investigate a loss of contact with the colony established on the same planet discovered by the crew of the Nostromo in the original filmI love the action Ripley Sigourney Weaver finds the Alien nest saves Newt Carrie Henn destroys all the eggs of the Alien. Battles with the Alien Queen oneonone she gains a new daughter when her real daughter was dead. Ripley comes back to colony LV426 to face her fear once and for all so that she want have any nightmares and she and Newt will be safe. We have Bishop here a synesthetic android he saves Ripley and Newt. Lance Henriksen is excellent as Bishop I love him in Hard Target 1993 and I love him in here to death.I love Michael Biehn as Corporal Dwayne Hicks this is my favorite role of the actor he played. I love Private Hudson Bill Paxton he was the best rest in peace I really miss you. Ellen Ripley is a badass warrior Sigourney Weaver was the best in this movie. Carrie Henn as Newt was the heart in this film.I love this film to death I am cherishing with all my heart. I have this movie on Bluray disc and I am constantly watching it. I used to had the DVD version but I trade it for Bluray because of the better picture quality better special features and the DVD cut scenes from the film away even the special edition did that. DVD did not had any special features at all. 1010 my personal action scifi horror masterpiece war movie of all time I love Aliens to death!".

	schema:reviewBody "Aliens 1986 is the best Epic SciFi Classic Action Movie of all time and one of my personal favorite best action scifi flicks that I love to death. Just like I love The Terminator and T2 I love this movie to death. James Cameron's classic masterpiece. The now classic science fiction film was only the third feature directed by James Cameron following Piranha Part Two The Terminator. It is the sequel to the 1979 film Alien and Alien is a masterpiece I love that film but I love this movie more sorry this is my personal opinion this is my movie. I am not saying it is better than the original movie but it is right up there with Alien a real classic.  Ellen Ripley Sigourney Weaver the sole survivor from the original Alien returns to Earth after drifting trough space in hyper sleep for 57 years. Although her story about the Alien encounter is met with skepticism she agrees to accompany a team of hightech marines back to LV426 and this time it's war! It has great cast I love the marines fighting aliens in this movie. The movie stars Sigourney Weaver Michael Biehn Carrie Henn Paul Reiser Lance Henriksen Bill Paxton William Hope Jenette Goldstein Al Matthews Mark Rolston  Ricco Ross Colette Hiller Daniel Kash Cynthia Dale Scott and Tip Tipping and they are all believable enough.I love the characters beside Ellen Ripley Newt Corporal Hicks Bishop Private Hudson Private Vasquez Sergeant Apone Private Drake Private Frost Corporal Ferro Private Spunkmeyer Corporal Dietrich Private Crowe I love those platoon of US Colonial Marines I know I haven't mentioned Burke because he was the bad guy and I don't like him. But most of the characters in this movie I love.  I know it is a scifi action film but it also does a have a horror mixed together people just don't see that. There's plenty of horror in it. The nightmare sequence in the beginning the creepy atmosphere of the LV426 colony and the heart pounding face hugger on the loose scene in the medical bay. You see mother of those aliens who cocooned all the humans and killed them you see Ripley finding the nest and fight the Alien queen on the end. Ripley faces her fear and gets over her PTSD by going in by herself to rescue the GirlFight the Aliensand Destroy the Entire Nest...Battles One on One with an Alien Queen and Whips its' Ass...and by the end now both her and Newt can dream without the worry of any more Nightmares which plagued Ripley at the beginning of the film.This is the finest action movie of all time. And yet believe it or not it's not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a 100 million budget in 1986! with multiple huge explosions with thousands of bullets fired and scores from James Horner of stuntmen used.1010 I have the Bluray disc which it also have a special edition version on it I used to had this film on DVD but I throw it away because I bought the Bluray which I am very happy about it. I love this film to death it is my personal favorite scifi action film even Lance Henriksen from Hard Target and The Terminator is in here and he is the good guy.".

Aliens set such a high standard in action scifibasically the new genre the James Cameron has created that none of the copycats can compete. Take the recent movies Soldier and Event Horizonboth directed by Paul Anderson. They both try to be Alien movies but do not succeed. My advice to Mr. Anderson is to stop trying to copy what has already been done. Enough said.As for Aliens it is a perfect scifi action movie. Great castingalthough ALL are stereotypes great musicJames Horner is the man great use of technology and  a well written script are all present. Weaver's performance is outstanding one of the best action heroes of all time just happens to be a woman. If you have a chance to watch the director' cut of Aliens I suggest you take itit's available in the new Alien Legacy box set or alone on DVD and VHS as well as on laserdisc. It expands on Ripley's maternal persona which makes Weaver's performance all the better.James Cameron came off making The Terminator and made Aliens. He used his expertise in the scifi genre and created an engrossing story that does not let up until the final reel of the film.

	schema:headline " One of the most thrilling films ever special edition highly recommended";
	schema:reviewBody "James Cameron is an extremely talented action director because not only does he know great action but he always backs the action up with a great story and interesting characters. Aliens is his finest achievement as far as I'm concerned. Of course I should specify Aliens Special Edition is his finest achievement.In 1986 several scenes were cut to keep the movie's runtime reasonable but there was one scene that was incredibly foolish to leave out. The scene I refer to is near the beginning where Ripley learns that her daughter has died while she was away in 'hypersleep' for 57 years. I promised her I'd be home for her 11th birthday cries Ripley. This is a very moving scene that adds a great deal the character's depth and makes more sense to why she cares for a little girl named Newt later in the film. She's seeking penance through Newt with her love and determination to keep her alive at all costs. The theatrical edition obviously doesn't elude to any of this and even cheapens the relationship between Ripley and Newt just a little bit. James Cameron has said that all of his movies are love stories and Aliens is a story of parental love. He has also said that the special edition is his intended if not definitive version of the film. For about five years or so the Special Edition was the only version of Aliens you could get on DVD. It should have stayed that way.Aliens is a unique film experience it's genuinely thrilling and exciting unlike a lot of movies where people shoot the evil monsters and there's disgusting blood and rapid gunfire and it's really meaningless. In Aliens' case the aliens are very threatening and more than just target practice. We don't see any aliens for over an hour but once we do it's a huge payoff. By that time we get to know some interesting characters Hicks Michael Beihn a takecharge marine who also turns out to be sweet and sincere Hudson Bill Paxton a braggart who turns out to be a coward and complains most of the time Vasquez Jeanette Goldstein the ironwilled woman soldier who proves to be one of the bravest characters in the film Bishop Lance Henrikson a robot that is very helpful for everyone's survival Burke Paul Rieser the slimy company man who the audience loves to hate and of course the adorable little Newt Carrie Henn a girl who has survived unspeakable horror. Holding the whole film together is Ripley played by Sigourney Weaver in her surpriseOscarnominated performance. I think the only reason why the audience cared for her in the first film is because she was the only person left and we wanted her to live. But for this film James Cameron added so much to her. With all this investment in characters we're really concerned for their wellbeing. We don't want those aliens to get them. Some die and I'm always truly bummed out when it happens.Filled with amazing performances and an abundance of thrills Aliens is one of the greatest of any genre it attempts whether it's action scifi horror or even drama. I personally liked it better than the first film but it's really like comparing apples and oranges. I prefer the special edition and don't see why anyone should view the other version instead.My rating 1010".

I promised her I'd be home for her 11th birthday cries Ripley. This is a very moving scene that adds a great deal the character's depth and makes more sense to why she cares for a little girl named Newt later in the film. She's seeking penance through Newt with her love and determination to keep her alive at all costs. The theatrical edition obviously doesn't elude to any of this and even cheapens the relationship between Ripley and Newt just a little bit. James Cameron has said that all of his movies are love stories and Aliens is a story of parental love. He has also said that the special edition is his intended if not definitive version of the film. For about five years or so the Special Edition was the only version of Aliens you could get on DVD. It should have stayed that way.Aliens is a unique film experience it's genuinely thrilling and exciting unlike a lot of movies where people shoot the evil monsters and there's disgusting blood and rapid gunfire and it's really meaningless. In Aliens' case the aliens are very threatening and more than just target practice. We don't see any aliens for over an hour but once we do it's a huge payoff. By that time we get to know some interesting characters Hicks Michael Beihn a takecharge marine who also turns out to be sweet and sincere Hudson Bill Paxton a braggart who turns out to be a coward and complains most of the time Vasquez Jeanette Goldstein the ironwilled woman soldier who proves to be one of the bravest characters in the film Bishop Lance Henrikson a robot that is very helpful for everyone's survival Burke Paul Rieser the slimy company man who the audience loves to hate and of course the adorable little Newt Carrie Henn a girl who has survived unspeakable horror. Holding the whole film together is Ripley played by Sigourney Weaver in her surpriseOscarnominated performance. I think the only reason why the audience cared for her in the first film is because she was the only person left and we wanted her to live. But for this film James Cameron added so much to her. With all this investment in characters we're really concerned for their wellbeing. We don't want those aliens to get them. Some die and I'm always truly bummed out when it happens.Filled with amazing performances and an abundance of thrills Aliens is one of the greatest of any genre it attempts whether it's action scifi horror or even drama. I personally liked it better than the first film but it's really like comparing apples and oranges. I prefer the special edition and don't see why anyone should view the other version instead.My rating 1010";

This second installment in the Alien series evolves the original movie's horrorscifi genre into actionadventurescifi setting a standard which has not yet been matched. I like this movie because it paints a picture of the future which is realistic enough to suck you in during the beginning of the film and then quickly introduces you to interesting characters who you become concerned with some you love and others you hate.....but none of them bore you.  By the time the action starts it's possible to forget you're watching a movie at least the first couple of times.  The plot is filled with tension that is occasionally broken by some of the most memorable oneliners in history especially by Private Hudson.  The special effects are remarkable considering the fact that they were accomplished the old fashioned way prior to digital manipulation.  I can report that I now own the Director's Cut and rate this version a 10 also.  The extra footage will be extremely interesting to fans of the 1986 release.  Either version gives you great characters suspense action firepower sarcasm and wit.  Aliens is an outstanding show!".

I will not say that it is much better than Alien  which is just about near to being perfect also. But I do love all the characters in this movie. I have rarely seen a movie where all the characters were so well developed. Even most serious dramas seldom develops each character so completely. None of these characters are stereotypes even Paul Reiser as Burke although the slimy companygovernment man villain is a prerequisite in disaster type movies. I would almost say that my favorite is Michael Beihn as Hicks just because I like his work  consider him to be underrated. But I also like Lance Henriksen as Bishop William Hope as Lt. Gorman Bill Paxton as Hudson and of course Jenette Goldstein as Vasquez. I liked all of these characters. I cared about their lives  deaths. The final scene for Gorman  Vasquez still chokes me up after seeing it many times. I am not ignoring Sigourney Weaver or Carrie Henn. Ripley is the template for the modern action heroine. In the 24 years since Alien few have been able to measure up to Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. Even in Alien 3  4 Ripley was still powerful despite the 3ed rate quality of the movies. As for Carrie Henn as Newt she was the emotional heart of Aliens. Cameron's ability to develop well rounded characters does not detract from his ability to create great action scenes or to scare the audience out of a several years of growth.".

This is a direct continuation of that story.57 years after the events of the first film Ellen Ripley Sigourney Weaver is found and awakened from hyper sleep to discover that a terraforming colony has been set up on LV426 the planet wherein she and her fellow crew of the mining cargo spaceship Nostromo first encountered the titular aliens. When Earthbased communications loses contact with LV426 a band of marines are sent to investigate taking Ripley and a representative from the company that financed the colony Carter Burke Paul Reiser along for the ride.For the difficult job of following up Ridley Scott's excellent Alien director James Cameron decided to go a completely different routeto make a fast moving slightly tongueincheek boisterous action extravaganza. Remarkably he was able to do that while still maintaining a stylistic and literary continuity that melds Aliens seamlessly with the first film.Ripley is much more fully developed in this film although unfortunately some of the most significant scenes were deleted from the theatrical release if at all possible watch the 2hour and 37minute director's cut instead. Cameron fashioned Aliens into a grand arc where Ripley's actions at the end of the film have much more meaning as she's not only fighting monsters but also fighting to retain a semblance of something she lost due to her 57year hyper sleep. As in the first film she is still the most intelligent courageous and resourceful member of the crew but she has much more colorful company.The marines accompanying Ripley back to LV426 may be too cartoonish for some tastes as for viewers of that opinion most of the action and the film overall is likely to be too cartoonish but for anyone more agreeable to that kind of caricatured exaggeration it's a joy to watch. I'm a big fan of both Bill Paxton and Lance Henriksen and both turn in wonderfully overthetop performances at their diametrically opposed ends of the emotional spectrumPaxton as the spastic surferredneck and Henriksen as the intense moody sage with a surprising reality and an even more surprising conscience to go along with it. We also get a cigarchomping Sergeant a crazy butch Private and a complex pensive Corporal as main characters and a mysterious bright young girl played in a terrific performance by Carrie Henn. Much of the center section of the film hinges on the interrelationships of these characters despite the action trappings going on around them.Cameron carries over the cryptlabyrinth motif of the first film and adds a metaphorical descent into the bowels of hell in the climax. The action throughout is suspenseful. Aliens contains one of my favorite cat fights in any film. It's also worth noting the influence this film may have had on Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers 1997although admittedly we could say that Cameron was influenced a bit by the Robert A. Heinlein book as well. Throughout all of the varied action sequences as well as the important early scenes of colonists on LV426 Cameron is able to clearly convey the logistics of very complex sets so that viewers remain on the edges of their seats.Part of what makes the monsters so effective is that we're not told too much about them. We only get glimpses into their physiology's their behavioral patterns and their intelligence. Cameron gives us just enough to become wrapped up in the film but not so much that we become overly familiar with the aliens or start to question the logic behind the film. He also smartly carries over some devices from the first film that were abandoned to an extent such as the acidic blood of the aliens and he supplies answers to the few questions that the first film raised such as why the blood doesn't corrode instruments and objects when a dead alien is examined.Aliens is yet another example of a sequel that is just as good as an original film in a series. Just make sure you watch both in order and try to watch the director's cuts.".

The atmosphere in this movie and the lighting and cinematography and of course the direction are top notch and some of the scenes are some of the scariest I've seen in my life time.  But what puts this movie over the top as one of the all time greatest films ever made is the casting.Sigourney Weaver is terrific but it is her supporting cast that shines and makes you feel like you know the crew that is heading to that desolate planet.Paul Reiser is perfect as Burkethe slimy corporate kiss ass that cares about profit before human lives.  Lance Henriksen shines as Bishop the cyborg with a heart.  Jeanette Goldstein is the rough around the edges female marine that more than holds her own with all the testosterone floating around and Michael Biehn  another Cameron favourite is the perfect quiet leader that leads by example and not so much a loud demonstrative voice.  But the show stopper in this flick  just as he always is in any movie that he is in  is Bill Paxton.Paxton and Cameron have worked on Terminator 1 True Lies Titanic and Aliens and Bill is one of those actors that steals scenes from every actor and was always a recognizable face even before Titanic.  Here his Hudson character is the comic relief but he is also perhaps one of the true characters that we can all identify with.  His tough exterior is nothing more than camouflage for his frightened fragile interior.  He realizes the dire situation that they are all in and he can't hide his fear.  When he finds out that they won't be rescued for at least seventeen days his response is  Hey man we're not going to survive 17 hours man!  Those things are going to come in here and they're going to get us and.....   Ripley  This little girl survived longer than that with no weapons and no military training.   Hudson   Why don't ya put her in charge!!! Paxton is a gift to any and every movie that he is in and this is his finest work.  He should have won a best supporting actor that year.  And if you haven't seen this movie rush to see it if only for Bill Paxton.  He steals the show.  But if a tightly wound brilliantly technical and unbelievably scary movie is your thing then you can't go wrong here.  This is easily a ten out of ten and one of the best ever made.  If Spielberg is the king is Hollywood then Cameron is his heir apparent.  Oh and one more thing Paxton will win an Oscar one day.".

It is certainly the BEST sequel ever made in movie history and one of the GREATEST MOVIES EVER MADE.At its core is Lt. Ellen Ripley played by the badass Sigourney Weaver a warrant officer and tough as nails.  Her character is one of the greatest heroines of all time.  Sigourney really does pull it off.  No one else could have done it like her.  Ripley's maternal connection with the young girl Newt is amazing to watch...but the ultimate scene is her final battle with the galaxy's most deadly creature  set to a pulsing military score James Horner delivers in a big way!.  Quite possibly my favorite fight scene of all time.There's not really much else to say  just go watch the movie on DVD and you will not be let down.  You're in for a wild ride!!!ALIENS  THIS TIME IT'S WAR".

It is certainly the BEST sequel ever made in movie history and one of the GREATEST MOVIES EVER MADE.At its core is Lt. Ellen Ripley played by the badass Sigourney Weaver a warrant officer and tough as nails.  Her character is one of the greatest heroines of all time.  Sigourney really does pull it off.

	schema:reviewBody "I have watched this movie when I was a preteen at the cinema and MY! It completely blew me away. It has got my adrenalin pumping so hard that I almost wanted to slip back to my seat and take a breather! Although during that time I didn't quite understand most parts of it too young to understand I was deeply immersed into such rich storytelling and the fantastic alien creatures. The tensely buildup atmosphere and the spaceships grips you so tightly it seems never to let go.This movie rocks scares you right on to your face very mysterious have tons of special effects not quite CGI though but the mechanical aliens looks just so threatening and scary. James Cameron is such a fabulous storyteller in this SciFi stellar! The movie ran at more than 2 hours but I didn't feel that at all. Actually James has cut out a lot of scenes for this theatrical release back then but you can still get those scenes back on the DVD extra 17 minutes footage.The acting is good especially from Sigourney Weaver Paul Reiser and Lance Henriksen as the robot. Sigourney's Ripley is such a strongwilled woman that even put shame to men somehow I feel this is quite unbelievable because she has got so much energy especially the scene where she gets back to the Queen's hatch to save Newt. I have watched other alien series Alien legacy  All four parts but I can say this part 2 of the series is my favourite followed by Alien then AlienResurrection and lastly Alien3I am quite happy to see this film stays high at one of the top SciFi movies in IMDBTill now as an adult I still go back to watch this DVD occasionally and every time I watch it again it brings in a completely new scare and new thoughts also the new meaning of what is a horror movie all about!Highly recommended if you haven't watched this yet. I give it an 8 out of 10! Truly deserves the high IMDB rating at 8.2 todate".

Hicks Hudson Vasquez this time around.The action is great the creature designs are better and the visuals are simply awesome. The Queen Alien is one of the greatest monsters ever put on screen and it's amazing that the effects were all done in camera.Aliens also feels more textured from a character and writing perspective. I love the Vietnam WarStarship Trooper aesthetic I personally like this movie better than the actual Starship Trooper movie and the underlying themes of motherhood that is further accented in the extended cut.I also liked how Ripley is upgraded to be an action heroine and Cameron showcases this transition perfectly. It all felt perfectly natural and in keeping with the logic of the story I'M LOOKING AT YOU FORCE AWAKENS!!.James Cameron back in his heyday really understood that in order for all this action and spectacle to matter you need to have compelling relatable characters to anchor it.It kinda bothers me that there is this growing trend of stereotyping the film as a dumber action shootem up version of Alien which baffles me to no end.Seriously it's nearly a full hour before any gun is fired and there is literally zero moments in this story where the marines have the upper hand.".

	schema:reviewBody "Aliens is one of many movies from my adolescent years that is just as good today as it was back then. It is an adrenaline filled ride filled with creepy locations intense action thrills much circumstantial humor and oneliners that will never grow old mostly thanks to Bill Paxton. It is unapologetically a man's movie filled with everything except nudity which it did not need.All movies in the Alien series have a claustrophobic feel to them and involve a relatively small cast of players. Aliens is no exception and really capitalizes on the fear potential of the locale. Cameron is not exactly known for injecting horror into his films but provides enough here to satisfy.The characters are very well cast and the actors have great chemistry. I especially grooved to the fact that even though the soldiers are supposed to be tough marines not all of them were completely gungho about their adventures. In fact a few were downright cowardly and indecisive in the face of combat  something I'm certain would happen to many in such a situation. Bill Paxton stole the show as the wisecracking space marine. With all the likable characters involved the stakes were very high. When they start dropping we feel the loss.Movies like this just don't come around very often. The pacing is very tight even when the action is absent. The characters and situations are interesting enough  when the action hits it just serves to suck us in deeper. I have nothing bad to say about Aliens. It is simply an awesome movie with a well deserved reputation for being such. See for yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "Back in 1986 sequels had become very common Superman Star Wars Indiana Jones yet people were suspicious when they heard of a followup to Alien Ridley Scott's acclaimed scifi horror from 1979. Most of the criticism was aimed at the fact that Scott had nothing to do with the new movie which had been entrusted to an unknown at the time named James Cameron. Fortunately Cameron had shown he knew the genre two years earlier with The Terminator and by perfecting the skills he had developed on that film he delivered Aliens which still stands out as one of the greatest science fiction flicks of all time.Given how the first film ended all characters but one died Cameron wisely decided to radically separate his movie from the original and he does so from the very beginning by having Ripley Sigourney Weaver wake up from her cryogenic sleep and make a shocking discovery although she hasn't aged at all 57 years have passed since she left the Nostromo meaning everyone she knew is either dead or very old in a particularly heartbreaking scene she talks on the phone with her grownup daughter who is full of resentment for her unjustified absence. In addition no one believes her story regarding the alien since as she's told by scientist Carter Burke Paul Reiser the planet where these creatures allegedly lived has been successfully colonized. Suddenly though all communications with LV426 are inexplicably interrupted. Thinking there might be some truth to Ripley's tale Burke asks her to join him and a group of soldiers on a mission to uncover the mystery. And while most of the participants are in it just for the money our heroine realizes this is her only chance of confronting her worst nightmare and overcoming it for good.The main problem with Alien some have said was that as great as it can be the characterizations were reduced to the minimum not that it really mattered with Ridley Scott ensuring the film retained the right pace and suspense throughout. With Aliens character development is the last thing fans should worry about Cameron being fully aware of each individual's potential and exploiting it as much as he can. Ripley who was just part of an ensemble in the original is now allowed to carry the whole film and boy does she carry it rarely has there been a more solid compelling female role in a genre movie like this the fact that Sigourney Weaver is the only actress thus far to have received an Oscar nomination for a sciencefiction film is further testament to Aliens' immortality. The supporting cast is equally good with a multitude of different characters ranging from funny regular Cameron collaborators Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton to weird Lance Henriksen's android Bishop and bringing something extra to the movie's unique atmosphere.Ah the film's mood that's the other aspect Cameron deserves all the credit in the world for. On a superficial level it could be said Alien was a horror movie while the followup is more actionoriented that may be true but one should also notice that every single spectacular battle scene actually oozes tension never leaving the audience with a pause to breathe or relax. In fact Cameron has succeeded where many other directors would have failed he stayed faithful to the original's tone but managed nonetheless to make the film undeniably his own.Relentlessly creepy occasionally very violent and consistently compelling Aliens is a pitchperfect piece of adult sciencefiction. Watch it on a double bill with Scott's version and you will get four hours of genre filmmaking at its finest.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rarely does a sequel do greater justice to an idea than the original. But 'Aliens' manages it in spades.The music and sound score alone are absolutely mesmerising. If you haven't got a good system you're missingout big time. Here's a simple thing just listen to the 3 latches locking into place when Ripley's 'lifeboat' is recovered by the deepspace explorer. You can't see them but you can hear them kerklink each in succession right around your sound stage. The noise tells you that they haven't just latched but latched and locked. Listen with you eyes shut if you don't believe me. It's that meticulous attention to detail both aural and visual that makes this movie a true work of art. There really is no need for the sounds to be there at all. But they are and they convey complete fidelity to a scene that lasts just seconds. Here's another. When the marines are crossing the rainswept depot to the airlock its windy and wild. When they get inside the ambiance completely changes. it's still noisy the wind continues faint but audible and there is lots of dripping water but now there's also a strange claustrophobic intimacy and I'm quite at a loss as to how that has been accomplished. Yet the moodchange is hairraisingly palpable. These set pieces are completely seamless throughout the movie. Strange gloomy suggestive broken the ghost of dead technology appears to haunt them as much as any alien demons. A thin whining electronic note does the work of tense music it suits the circumstances perfectly as well as providing a foil to any ambient sounds that the engineers and director thought appropriate. The sound and sets earned it two welldeserved Oscars.Tension builds and builds again. It's a fairly wellworn formula of gradual attrition. Ripley's valliant rescue of the ambushed and trapped spacemarines must have any viewer at the edge of their seat. And on it goes tighter and tighter until finally we are squeezing through airducts. Acting is pretty formulaic but entirely believable. People we've quickly grown to like get killed suddenly and nastily smug Apone and macho Drake. The alien queen brings the movie to a perfect climax. Correct me if I'm wrong but there was absolutely no CGI in this. Proof enough that it isn't actually needed and is never as good as the real McCoy. And the script by the way is excellent.As a comment upon sexuality and survival it is a very telling one. The female is deadlier than the male. It draws from a simple Darwinian premise that she makes a greater investment in the production of the young and will therefore go to more determined and ruthless lengths to ensure their survival. She knows her genes are in the offspring momma's baby poppa's maybe. Males are simply expendable seedcarriers of convenience. I've docked a point for what strikes me as technological incongruity. The continued use of oldfashioned 'querty' keyboards for example and CRTVDU. The latter have all but gone to the scrapheap now never mind hundreds of years hence. Checkout the rollup screens in 'Red Planet' now that's more like it. Also a sophisticated android like 'Bishop' surely suggests the probability of 'mechanised' marines. Or at least a selfpropelled remote for entering the alien hive. Bomb disposal squads already have those today. Bishop himself should have been able to simply plugin and interface with the uplink. Or even communicate by WiFi. Though these things would compromise drama their absence compromises its sciencefiction credentials. And I am certainly no purist. But gollygosh!  nitpicking aside this is an absolute crackerjack of entertainment.I believe it has only one other challenger for the crown of greatest scifi horror movie  Carpenter's 'The Thing'. You split 'em I can't.It's 22 and 26 years since their creation and noone has managed to raise the bar. What does that tell you?".

	schema:reviewBody "How do you follow up a movie that is possibly the best example of a scifihorror movie ever? Simple. Make what is possibly the best scifiaction movie ever. Eminently quotable and totally enthralling Aliens burst onto our screen seven years after the original movie was released. At the helm this time was the relatively unknown director James Cameron and didn't he do well? The plot is a simple one. After being cryogenically frozen for 57 years Ripley Sigourney Weaver is found floating in space. She is woken up and finds out that the planet they first found the Alien on is now inhabited. Despite her impassioned pleas that her crew was killed by a massive alien that burst out of a man's chest had acid for blood and two sets of teeth for some reason she isn't believed. Her pilot status stripped away she is left to fend for herself until earth loses contact with the colonists. Then Ripley is talked into joining the Marines assigned to find out what went wrong in an advisory roll. The Marines are cocky brash overconfident and wielders of immense amounts of firepower. In short they're dead meat. Also along for the ride are Bishop Lance Henriksen  an android and Burke Paul Reiser  a sleazy corporation guy. Upon entering the colonists' facility the Marines find signs of a massive firefight as well as a remarkably cute little girl generally called Newt Carrie Henn. Eventually they find where the colonists appear to be. All in one area so it's a simple matter of going down there and finding out what's going on.After the majority of the marines have been killed and their main way off the planet wiped out it's up to the survivors to  basically  continue to survive. Eventually after a few more casualties they escape. Except ooops Newt didn't make it. Happy to leave behind Marines and corporate stooges by the bucketload Ripley who frankly hasn't been the best mother in the world to her own daughter decides to go back for Newt. An encounter with the Alien Queen and a whole room full of eggs and her finding Newt later and we're back on the space ship finally safe. Until of course in a fantastic fakeout involving more milk and yoghurt than ever before seen on film we see Bishop ripped to shreds by the Alien Queen we thought was left behind to die. The final showdown of these two protective mother figures is a lot of fun the Queen is sucked out into space and everyone is happy in the end. OK so maybe the plot isn't all that simple.Many people may have heard me call this a Vietnam War movie and once again I stand by that. The Marines despite their hightech weaponry look like a unit in Vietnam. This was a conscious decision by Cameron he went as far as getting the actors to decorate and customise their own costumes. The scenario itself hightech army against lowtech but numerically superior forces vents doubling for tunnels the heat the loud Sergeant Apone Al Matthews the oppressive atmosphere all of it feels like Vietnam. You even have Hudson Bill Paxton talking about being a short timer! This allows the audience to connect with the characters. By making the distant future feel like our recent past the war had only finished 11 years previously we are able to identify with their plight. These aren't super soldiers or men in battle suits. These are grunts who are just doing their job.The acting is generally pretty good with the supporting cast not given that much to do other than portray a group of Marine stereotypes. Paxton is possibly the most standout of all of the marines though he does generally get most of the best lines. Michael Biehn as the dependable Cpl. Hicks Ripley's love interest is also very good. Both Henriksen and Reiser give great performances with memories still strong of Ian Holms android going postal in the first movie Henriksen plays every moment for all of its sinister value until the very end when we realise Bishop is a good guy and Reiser is so slimy he practically leaves a trail.The best performance of the movie is easily that given by Weaver. The fact that in 1987 a performance in a scifiaction movie should be nominated for an Oscar is testament enough to the quality of her acting. The motherdaughter bond that grows between Ripley and Newt is central to the movie and one that allows Weaver to develop her character even further. Of course Cameron cannot resist mirroring this with the maternal instincts of the Alien Queen. These themes of motherhood and the nature of the difference between the two species are continued in the next two movies although never as subtly.What can I say about the direction? It's James Cameron so there is a lot of blue or red on the screen. Here it leads to a truly atmospheric feel the tension building up as things just go from bad to worse for the marines. With clever use of camera angles quick cuts lighting and good old fashioned dry ice Cameron never once gives away too much about the aliens and manages to make it feel like there are far more on screen than there really are.This is a movie that does not give you a break. Cameron is either piling on the dramatic tension or the adrenalin pumping action. Everything about this movie is sheer class and it is rightly considered one of the best of its type ever made. If you don't like this movie then the problem is your taste in films not the film itself. If you have not seen it not only am I surprised I recommend you do so when you're in the mood to have a rollercoaster ride but Blackpool is too far away.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been long a fan of the orignal Alien but somehow I never saw this sequel until now. If this were in fact the first or only alien movie I would undoubtedly rate it higher than I do. It's edge of your set exciting and much better than most movies of this type. The special effects are great and there are some real scary moments.But to say this is as good or beter than the originalthat I cannot agree with.First of all there is very litte original in this sequel. Indeed it is more of a remake of the first Alien than a progression. The plot if very similar and indeed the ending is basically the same idea right down to Sigourney Weaver in her underwear. So the mere fact that is not original is to be considered. What Aliens offers over Alien is faster pacing more and bigger aliens and a generally higher adrenaline level. This is probably why a lot of people prefer it. And it is all very well done.But Aliens is basically a military shootemup. The original for all its comparative simplicity is a much more subtle deftly constructed and very atmpospheric movie.  The spareness creates a feeling of claustrophobia and terror which is very effective and memorable.  I found Alien truly psychologically frightening while Aliens is more of an in your face adrenaline rush.  Alien also has a more interesting cast more human and subtle. The military posturing of the Aliens cast was pretty standard stuff. Sigourney Weaver of course is possibly even better than in the first movie. I also like the music in the first movie better.I find Leonard Maltin's comment on the Alien inexplicable. What he seems not to like about the first movie is there in spades in the second movie.Aliens is a darn good movie but Alien is a scifi classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "You know back in 1987 when i first watched this movie on VHS  later i watched the uncut version  i was at first reluctant at giving it a shot but then i said what the hell might as well go for it and let me tell you i was more than impressed i was awed this movie was THAT good. I thought of it as the best scifi flick ever at the time and still do 20 years later. I mean you gotta look at this movie not only from the crew's perspective but also from the audience's. And that perspective scores very high all across the board mainly because from the very beginning the crew was set on making a scifi futuristic movie that continued the story from ALIEN but added new unique elements to the story. Everything is great about ALIENS the plot the storyline fine continuity and not only it follows where Riddley Scott left off but adds something unique to the gender. And the way the story unfolds gradually building up the tension while at the same time treading on that fine line between dark and light good and evil is just amazing how that was done in terms of sentimentality Ripley missed her daughter's birthday because fate was cruel to her given the circumstances of her floating out into space for 57 years after she escaped from the Nostramo and now she sees in Newt the one and only child who could possibly make up for the hole left in her soul once she found out her daughter was gone only 2 years prior to her rescue and here is her chance to make up for it. The way this chemistry between Newt and Ripley develops can clearly be seen throughout the movie little at first but as the movie advances their relationship grows ever stronger and culminates at the end when Newt calls Ripley mommy. It's clear that James Cameron and all his crew had their hearts set on making a movie not just for the money but also for providing high quality action to the viewer blended with that feeling that despite all the evil around us despite all the risks we take all the compromises we might make love conquers all in the end from start to finish while at the same time making us relate in some way to anyone of the characters..I mean you gotta understand that love sentimentality and aliens the story of the movie don't quite mix generally speaking but by bringing Newt into the picture as the orphan child the way the chemistry between the main character and the little kid develops is just amazing..is something unique and you don't get to see this a lot in movies of this gender at least not a lot. I just watched not long ago ALIENS THE MAKING OF  BONUS DVD ONLY and i was just amazed with all the hard work and soul James Cameron and his entire crew put in in order to give the audience a final product that i'm sure will be remembered for generations to come. And to sum it up that's what this movie is all about...something that revolutionized the scifi gender. Of course Riddley Scott did a fine job to with ALIEN only James did better. Way to go James! A masterpiece! And one other thing...you gotta keep in mind they used 80's technology as far as the equipment used is concerned  the spaceship just to name one the atmosphere processor etc but looking at this movie 20 years later you still cant tell the technology is outdated..is just amazing how they've accomplished something like this and only with an 18million dollar budget at the time. This just goes to show that if you as a director and crew as well have your heart set on making something memorable everyone will remember your name. And last but not least the soundtrack rocked man especially given that James Horner had little time to implement it into the movie. Good work James! My vote 1010".

I like both films a great deal but find Alien a superior film in my books.The overall plot of Alien is about a small group of people in isolated conditions. A dangerous alien gets loose amongst them. Everyone bar one person and a cat is killed. The lead goes back to rescue the cat. The survivors manage to barely escape at the last moment from a large mining ship going thermonuclear. Unbeknownst to the survivors the alien sneaks on board and after a brief struggle it is blown out of an airlock into space courtesy of Ripley. The survivors go into hypersleep and the credits roll.Aliens is about a larger group of people in isolated conditions. Many dangerous aliens gets loose amongst them. Everyone bar three plus an andriod are killed. The lead goes back to rescue a child. The survivors manage to barely escape at the last moment from a large mining colony going thermonuclear. Unbeknownst to the survivors the big alien sneaks on board and after a struggle it is blown out of an airlock into space courtesy of Ripley. The survivors go into hypersleep and the credits roll.More than just a few similarities here. The second one is basically a rehash of the first on a larger scale more people more aliens more noise more explosions. The basic plot is not only the same there are specific point of plot detail that are the same.I also find the story for Alien a lot more edgy a true psychological horror  drama where the alien was secondary in the story to the interaction between the crew of the Nostromo. Aliens is more of an action  horror film. This is of course a personal preference. However I am finding myself getting increasingly annoyed with modern movies concentrating on loud noise fast action and great effects while neglecting the story. And from what I can see Cameron took the original story and added loud noise and fast action. I feel the effects on the first were actually superior. Bigger is not necessarily better.Set  decoration  costume wise both movies have aged very well. I do however get a little annoyed in Aliens when I continually see the video screens in the movie being standard 43 tv's actually blackened down to 1.851 to make them look like a futuristic widescreen sets I guess. Pretty ironic when I think about it given how Cameron makes films matted 1.661 Super 35. If he made Aliens now he'd probably matt the tubes down to 2.351...And on a lighthearted note I like cats. Anyone who'd risk their life to save their cat is true hero in my books. Add to this the fact that I don't like children and Alien definitely gets my vote in this area too...".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first watched Alien i was really impressed and had to get Aliens. I wasn't sure if this could be as good because most sequels hardly ever surpass the first. But I thought this was a lot better. Don't get me wrong the first was brilliant but this was amazing. Everything was right. They had a brilliant cast brilliant story brilliant effects and brilliant acting.The thing i was most impressed about was the design of it all. It looked amazing. They Made things look realistic and the aliens looked really good as well. The aliens home was put together brilliantly. For a 1986 film they made the effects look really good and the set. The king alien looked very good and the set of it's home was very good as well. Yet again Sigourney Weaver puts on a brilliant performance as like she did in the first one and Jennette Goldstien as Pvt Vaquez gave a great performance and is one of the best movie heroes ever.With the first film it had a lot of parts that made you jump and had you on the edge of your seat. It was exactly the same with this one. There were lots of parts that made you jump and nearly the whole film had you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what was going to happened next and they had a lot more gore in this than the first which was good to see because i thought in the first it would be fairly gory but it weren't that much.If you thought the first was good you must watch this. You will be blown away by the effects and design and the great action sequences they have with the aliens. It is one of the best films made and it will keep you entertained from start to finish.".

Officially Aliens should be called an action movie not a horror like the first because it is not stop and the special effects are top of the line. Acid for blood and humans for hosts the aliens of the film are THE image for aliens you will think of from now on. I've seen this movie countless times and have never picked out a real flaw. It has so many great characters.. Hudson Bishop newt Hicks all the marines and ofcoarse Ripley and the aliens themselves. I loved Bishop as the android and Hudson's panic and foul mouthed presence earned him a lot of fans. The story is a colony establishing an atmosphere on a planet loose communication with 'the company' running the show. USMC marines are sent in to see what's going on and Ripley the survivor of the 1st film reluctantly agrees to go along. The director even lets you get to know each marines personality each one is a little unique and I thought the cast was really a timeless one. There's some amazing combination of puppets animatronics and miniatures used in the film from the drop ships to the amazing face huggers to the new queen alien from. There's enough beeps on motion trackers futuristic weapons and ice cold metal cooridors to fill 3 movies. Not to mention this time 'it's war' with literally crowds of aliens coming at us full speed. The most memorable moments are of the crew preparing for the mission at the meal table and bishop the android doing the knife trick at 100 miles an hour between the fingers of a marine who laid his hand on the table Hudson. But the mega scene is when Ripley has to find the young character only survivor colonist named newt which leads her directly into the alien breeding chamber. The alien queen is simply amazingly done and the director Jim Cameran really convinced the effects guys to go all the way with it. Well it worked. The result was amazing and pricless. What really made Aliens an absolute action and horror gem was the writing and the amount that was there was just so richly done I was so very impressed. It's by far the best of the series of movies and the best alien film of all time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Review 2 of 4As the middle part of the Alien trilogy this film accomplishes exactly what any good second chapter must do it builds on the world established in the first film and takes the story in new and interesting places. The emotional canvas of this story is broader than the original Alien and the film as a whole is less subtle. I really like the theme's of family and the parallel character arcs of Ripley and Newt. They are both characters who have lost everything they ever cared about and through finding each other they attempt to fill the holes in their hearts that their respective losses have left behind. Cameron takes great time in setting up his characters from the start something that was lacking in the original. The beginning of the film may be a little slow but like Cameron's next film The Abyss the payoff in the end would not be nearly as satisfying without all this time to get to know the characters and become emotionally invested. The setup is massively important to the rest of the film. Aside from the abundance of action this film benefits greatly from a larger emphasis on character. Hudson Hicks Vasquez Burke and Bishop are all very memorable characters perhaps more memorable than those in the original film. It is the relationships between these characters that make it more than just an action film. Cameron has such a way with dialog and Aliens is a prime example. I have built entire friendships on mutual love of this movie. So many lines are so easily quotable. From a technical level this film is flawless and like the original it has not aged much at all since its release twenty years ago.If in the first film Ripley was discovering her inner strength Aliens is where she learns to master her fear. In this film we also learn the depths of her humanity that was scarcely present in the original film the scene where she goes back to save her cat comes to mind. Ripley is a character that continues to change and grow and this film does a fine job of fleshing out her interesting in under developed character from the first film. Aliens is definitely a film to watch more than a few times but for different reasons than the first. The mystery and ambiance of the original film makes it fascinating to watch multiple times but Aliens is more like spending time with old friends you want to spend two and a half hours with these characters. Aliens is quite possibly the perfect sequel because it gives you everything you got in the first film and much much more.".

	schema:reviewBody "Home Alone 1990 Rating 810It might be dumb and corny but I've actually liked this highly entertaining flick. The plot's unbelievable but who cares it's funny! Macaulay Culkin plays 8 yearold Kevin a misunderstood kid who lives in a big ass house with his family. They're about to leave for Paris where they're gonna spend Christmas. About 20 people are running around the house frenetically preparing for the trip. Kevin's mad at everyone because no one pays attention to him unless it's to yell at him. Hence Kevin goes to sleep wishing that his whole family would disappear and the next morning they do! The thing is that they somehow woke up late left home in a hurry and hey they forget Lil Kev! At first he's happy as a monkey but after a while things get messy. Two dumbass robbers are planning to rob his house but Kev ain't gonna let them!Okay I know this is one stupid story but it's developed into a wonderful family film as enjoyable as it is warmhearted. Mac Culkin is awesome in the lead. He really carries the film he's got style he's funny and he's even a good actor! Too bad his personal life screwed up because he had the talent to become a grownup movie star. The idiotic criminals are also really cool because they cast good actors instead of some Erneststyle lameo overactors. Oscarwinner Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern the narrator on The Wonder Years are hilarious but they also bring a bit more depth to what could have been cardboard characters. Pesci plays an aggressive thug and anyone who's seen him in a Scorsese film knows how good he is at it. Stern plays a total dufus and he's also really convincing at it. The film's humor might seem dumb but hey it's funny. John Hughes' screenplay has Kevin protecting his home by turning the thieves into human Wile E. Coyotes and like the cartoon it made me laugh. The gags might be old but they're played with inventiveness and the acting is always right. I just love this film and you will too if you look beyond the fact that it's a family film.".

	schema:headline " Heartwarming Holiday family classic.";
	schema:reviewBody "'Home Alone' has succeeded in establishing itself as a Christmas tradition spawning off three sequels including a madefortelevision flop and a whole franchise in and of it.Macaulay Culkin plays Kevin McCallister the average American child. He has an attitude almost expected of a Chris Columbus film from the eighties. He lives with a large family which right now being around Christmas time is about quadrupled flooded by relatives' children all of whom pick on poor poor Kevin sympathy long lost later into the film.One day Kevin wakes up from his sleep to find his wish has come true his parents John Heard and Catherine O'Hara have disappeared. Enthralled by this he proceeds to do everything and anything he was not allowed to do before including eating ice cream in the morning watching violent gangster films jumping on the bed wrecking his brother's room and having some fun with a BB gun. Unfortunately for Kevin his parents have not just disappeared  they have accidentally left him at home before going to Paris!Trouble really starts when two pesky burglars Harry Lime Joe Pesci and Marv Merchants Daniel Stern decide that their next burglary will be at the McCallister residence. Little do they know Kevin is more than prepared arming the house with an array of boobytraps that would impress top spies in the American government.John Hughes writerdirectorproducer of my favorite comedy 'Planes Trains and Automobiles' wrote this film and it is no wonder. It is just like Hughes' humor. It mixes emotion belly laughs and a warmhearted ending all into one little bundle called a movie. John Hughes' films in my experience are usually very good mainly because he approaches films at a very classic level. He doesn't resort to crude kid jokes like 'The Master of Disguise' or 'The Tuxedo' to name a few recent flops. He almost always levels everything out perfectly in his scripts and nothing is different here. Also he places Kevin and co. in a large brick home in a large neighborhood in Chicago a home that very much resembles those in 'Planes.' and 'Uncle Buck' I would not be surprised if it is the same home.As for the acting.Macaulay Culkin is not at his best here. His best performance would have to be in an earlier John Hughes film named 'Uncle Buck' where he had more of a cute charm than an acting charm. Here he could barely act his way out of a plastic bag. Fortunately with great performances by John Heard Catherine O'Hara Pesci and Stern his bad acting is long forgotten by the time we become absorbed into the film.John Heard and Catherine O'Hara bring Kevin's parents to life. They seem almost complete opposites. Kevin's father Peter Heard is very calm and laidback. His mother Kate O'Hara is extremely nervous almost all the time fretting throughout the film. She is aggravated very easily and like all mothers her instinctive nature to care for her child is what drives her to the point she goes to in the film.And then there's Pesci and Stern. My favorite lot of the film. They perfectly blend humor pain and aggravation to the film.Pesci's character Harry is very strict easily agitated and picks on Marv for a great many things. Marv the stereotypical 'tall stupid one' is completely stupid. He does things that would make a hamster blush. Yet he is the character I have found many like the most mainly because he is so stupid you have to feel sorry for him.

	onyx:emotionText "'Home Alone' has succeeded in establishing itself as a Christmas tradition spawning off three sequels including a madefortelevision flop and a whole franchise in and of it.Macaulay Culkin plays Kevin McCallister the average American child. He has an attitude almost expected of a Chris Columbus film from the eighties. He lives with a large family which right now being around Christmas time is about quadrupled flooded by relatives' children all of whom pick on poor poor Kevin sympathy long lost later into the film.One day Kevin wakes up from his sleep to find his wish has come true his parents John Heard and Catherine O'Hara have disappeared. Enthralled by this he proceeds to do everything and anything he was not allowed to do before including eating ice cream in the morning watching violent gangster films jumping on the bed wrecking his brother's room and having some fun with a BB gun. Unfortunately for Kevin his parents have not just disappeared  they have accidentally left him at home before going to Paris!Trouble really starts when two pesky burglars Harry Lime Joe Pesci and Marv Merchants Daniel Stern decide that their next burglary will be at the McCallister residence. Little do they know Kevin is more than prepared arming the house with an array of boobytraps that would impress top spies in the American government.John Hughes writerdirectorproducer of my favorite comedy 'Planes Trains and Automobiles' wrote this film and it is no wonder. It is just like Hughes' humor. It mixes emotion belly laughs and a warmhearted ending all into one little bundle called a movie. John Hughes' films in my experience are usually very good mainly because he approaches films at a very classic level. He doesn't resort to crude kid jokes like 'The Master of Disguise' or 'The Tuxedo' to name a few recent flops. He almost always levels everything out perfectly in his scripts and nothing is different here. Also he places Kevin and co. in a large brick home in a large neighborhood in Chicago a home that very much resembles those in 'Planes.' and 'Uncle Buck' I would not be surprised if it is the same home.As for the acting.Macaulay Culkin is not at his best here. His best performance would have to be in an earlier John Hughes film named 'Uncle Buck' where he had more of a cute charm than an acting charm. Here he could barely act his way out of a plastic bag. Fortunately with great performances by John Heard Catherine O'Hara Pesci and Stern his bad acting is long forgotten by the time we become absorbed into the film.John Heard and Catherine O'Hara bring Kevin's parents to life. They seem almost complete opposites. Kevin's father Peter Heard is very calm and laidback. His mother Kate O'Hara is extremely nervous almost all the time fretting throughout the film. She is aggravated very easily and like all mothers her instinctive nature to care for her child is what drives her to the point she goes to in the film.And then there's Pesci and Stern. My favorite lot of the film. They perfectly blend humor pain and aggravation to the film.Pesci's character Harry is very strict easily agitated and picks on Marv for a great many things. Marv the stereotypical 'tall stupid one' is completely stupid. He does things that would make a hamster blush. Yet he is the character I have found many like the most mainly because he is so stupid you have to feel sorry for him. Stern brings a great trait to the character of Marv and I am very pleased he got the part. It's a hard choice to decide which baddie is better so I just say I like them both the same.All in all 'Home Alone' is probably the best Christmas movie to rise out of the film industry in the last twenty years. It seamlessly blends humor pain emotion human instinct and some great boobytraps all into one little bundle. This film has stood the test of time greatly.4.55 stars ";

Macaulay Culkin seems to have no problem carrying most of the film with a wide variety of looks gestures and expressionsbut for my money it's Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci who get the main laughs as the bumbling burglars intent on outwitting the kid's traps.Others in the cast don't have as much to do but do well enough by their roles particularly Catherine O'Hara and John Heard as the parents who only discover on the plane that Kevin is missing. The laughs are steady the color photography is great and the slight story is probably every boy's fantasy of what it might be like to be left home alone.

Quite rightly as most of them were seriously funny  I'm DEFINITELY not referring to Curly Sue so relax! In one particular scene from Uncle Buck Macaulay Culkin interrogates a babysitter through the letterbox to make sure she's not a baddie. This inspired Hughes to write a whole new movie. Who would have known that this and its sequel would go on to become two of the biggest hits of all time? Both Hughes and Chris Columbus seem to prefer setting their movies during the holiday season Gremlins Planes Trains  Automobiles Christmas Vacation and manage to pull them off without too much sentiment or sickening amounts of gooey love.There are two reasons why Home Alone was such a big success. The first is that it's about a kid who outsmarts grownups something that happens every day only there's a worldwide conspiracy of silence. This movie yells it out loud and clear. The second is John Williams's magical score which elevates the movie way above slapstick family fare to something more serious and regarded. It was nominated for an Academy Award along with the Christmas carol Somewhere In My Memory but lost to John Barry's Dances with Wolves. Damn! In a mad rush to the airport one morning the MacCallister family forget one little thing...Kevin Culkin. He is an eightyearold kid who wants nothing better than a peaceful Christmas and some time to himself. It's hard for him to get this when living in a house with seven other peoplethe exact same house from Planes Trains And Automobiles don't you know0.

	schema:reviewBody "Home Alone is one of the most popular movies from the early 90's. Its success was phenomenal and it also made Macaulay Culkin a superstar.The plot is quite original and surreal a child who is home alone and capable of making the bandits's lives miserable? Sure it's an impossible story but who cares? Far from being a perfect movie it is however okay and fun to watch entertaining and contains slapstick humor too although I don't like some of the language used. Our story takes place in Chicago at Christmas time which makes this a Christmas film. In fact the movie has lots of Christmas decorations lights snow and many other details which create the feeling and magic so characteristic of Christmas. To accent the Christmas atmosphere even more there are a cup of nice Christmas carols such as Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree performed by Brenda Lee You're a mean one Mr. Grinch White Christmas Carol of the Bells Oh Holly Night and Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas and some brilliant instrumental musics.Kevin McCallister is the hero of the story. He's not just any kid he's a very smart one. He also knows all about the intentions of the wet bandits Harry and Marv and prepares them lots of unexpected surprises. Their lives won't be easy with Kevin defending his house. Sure they are the villains and as such they get what they deserve but they do suffer a lot too. We almost feel sorry for them.The wet bandits were nicknamed like that by Marv because their calling card according to him was to let the water running in every houses they robbed. That said both wet bandits are hilarious. Harry is more cranky while Marv is the most stupid of the two although both are stupid and maybe that's why people tend to sympathize more with him. Marv's stupidity also makes him the funniest of the two. Marv is the typical tall and clumsy guy with no brain a bit like Averell Dalton from the Lucky Luke comics.The movie has lots of funny moments. The funniest for me is when Harry and Marv pretend to be Santa Claus and his elf and the way Harry speaks in that scene followed by the even funnier part when Kevin fires at Harry's pants. Whenever Kevin fools the bandits in a try to make them believe the whole family is at home when Kevin is all alone is funny too. For some reason I also find funny whenever Kevin screams maniacally particularly when he says he's not afraid anymore and sees Old Marley and screams out loud.The scenes which Kevin fools and scares the Little Nero's Pizza boy and Marv with the gangster film Angels with Filthy Souls are hilarious but in the case of the Pizza boy it is unfair for him. There was no need to scare the hell out of him  he was just delivering pizza and wasn't after Kevin.Old Marley is an interesting character. I always felt sorry for him because of the lies Buzz tells about him. And the man never did anything bad to anyone. Buzz is a jerk and Uncle Frank is even worse. Buzz is mean for Kevin and Uncle Frank openly dislikes Kevin. When Uncle Frank tells Kevin Look what you did you little jerk! Kevin's parents should tell him something like Frank stay out of this and shut up!.The church is magnificent. It's one of the biggest and most beautiful churches I've ever seen in a movie. Macaulay Culkin is terrific as the clever kid Kevin McCallister. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are awesome as the wet bandits and Roberts Blossom is great as the character Old Marley. It's also delightful to see John Candy as Gus Polinski the Polka King of the Midwest.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is no film to put beside Home Alone by way of comparison. It is a film genre of it's own. I read and hear reviews of this movie that express disgust and horror and I picture John Hughes chuckling. This was the intent it was meant to upset the status quo and in politically correct times that we live in isn't it a small surprise to see this film come to the forefront again? This is a movie that will freak out the uptight for as long as it exists in any media. It was meant to. As much as Clockwork Orange talked about ultraviolence this movie is all about ultrabad pranks. We can numb ourselves to sex and violence but Home Alone is a movie you just will never get used to. There will be something in this movie that will get to you. As a last resort to make sure everyone is offended before you leave the theatre John includes the always discussed paint can scene. No reason for this scene except to make sure he gets you and also to make sure you leave talking about it. Obviously filmed on a budget and using Hughe's stock cast this is a movie simply about a young kid whose parents forget him while they go on vacation. All the characters are bizarre in one way or another. This movie reminds me of Rocky Horror Picture Show in that everyone in the film has something odd about them and both movies joyfully celebrate these uniquenesses. Not a movie to buy for Mom on Mother's Day... but worth seeing just to say you did.".

	schema:reviewBody "Home Alone is a nostalgic film for me having watched it religiously when I was a young kid growing up. Roger Ebert gave this film a 2.5 out of 4. He calls the film unrealistic and says that it goes in another direction from the original premise.Home Alone plays on the scary scenario every kid fears at some point in their life. Kevin McCallister Macaulay Culkin is forgotten at home in Chicago when his family rushes off to the airport for their trip to Paris. Soon after Kevin is visited by home invaders Marv Daniel Stern and Harry Joe Pesci and it's up to him to stop them.Ebert complains that this film deviates from the main premise and simply brings in stunt doubles and fills the film with wacky traps that would otherwise cost the McCallister's tens of thousands of dollars to accomplish what Kevin does. While this is not far from the true you're supposed to suspend some disbelief when watching this.I enjoy Home Alone because an 8year old handles two grown up burglars. I don't enjoy watching people getting hurt but I think in this case there is an exception. The moral of the story is that even when you're young you can still be responsible and handle your home from being invaded. It shows that it's wrong to rob people and that even children can be heroes.However I find that the sequel is much better than this and it's due to the far superior story setup. Kevin being left home alone was a great initial start and opening up to the opportunity of a follow up story.To review this film without the mention of Macaulay's acting is a crime. Macaulay portrays Kevin with amazing talent and it's great for the simple fact that the 90s weren't really big for their child actors as far as I can remember. Macaulay is able to hit all ends of the acting spectrum showing being scared showing emotion and showing confidence and hilarious comedic relief too. He was a great actor and I was sad to only see a few of his films before he retired.Another great point about Home Alone being a cult classic is the musical score provided by legendary John Williams. He gives the film the final emotional touch that allows us to forever remember Home Alone as being a classic film and never forget Macaulay's performance. Somewhere in My Memory has always been a favourite track of mine by Williams and it's just a great piece of music on top of a great film.This film is a classic for me and I would never say that this isn't a wonderful film despite being a tad bit unrealistic. But the fact is most films exaggerate and force you to suspend disbelief. Don't allow for this film not to be a favourite because you don't think this sort of thing could happen.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's that time of year again the time of year when it is acceptable to binge on Christmas films. The first one I watched this year was Home Alone. It is a classic for me certainly a child hood favourite!The story is a very simple one Kevin McCallister Macaulay Culkin is accidentally left at Home over the Christmas as his whole family fly to Paris. They board the plane without realising that they have left one of their Children home alone! Two small time robbers are also in the area looking to break into houses they target the McCallister household as they believe they are all away for the Christmas holidays. It is now up to Kevin to protect his house from the burglars by setting up traps and playing pranks some of which are absolutely brilliant! The two Robbers Marv  Harry played by Daniel Stern  Joe Pesci give fantastic performances. They portray the classic dumb  dumber routine. Harry thinks he is the brains and sees himself as the leader  Marv plays the really stupid gullible one who falls for much more simple traps. The on screen chemistry between these two and the relationship they have is fantastic it comes across very realistic and hilarious.Macaulay Culkin was 9 or 10 when Home Alone was filmed and given such a big role with this much screen time must have been a big challenge but he walked it and gave a very convincing performance. The Home Alone films are pretty much all he has been known for which is a shame really he had a few other films but none are as wellknown and successful as these. Of course this isn't the most realistic films and it does have massive plot holes and ridiculous scenarios but who cares. It's fun! It's Christmassy  It's got great characters with some truly hilarious moments.Overall Home Alone is a very fun movie I have the relation to it as it was always on at Christmas when I was a child. But even if this isn't the case I'm sure many adults who are new to this will love it just the same as us who have fond memories of watching it as a child!810".

	schema:headline " Quality at Xmas";
	schema:reviewBody "Home alone reviewHome alone is a warm family comedy film made in 1990 it was written and produced by John Hughes and was directed by Chris Columbus. The main part of Kevin McCallister is played by Macaulay Culkin his parents are played by John Heard and Catherine O'Hara and the villains the wet bandits are played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. The signature tune is made by John Williams musician of 'Star Wars' 'Harry Potter' and 'Lord of the Rings'. 20th Century Fox bought the plan for home alone from Warner Bros and upped the budget for the movie by 4 million it turned out as a bargain for 20th Century Fox because it raked in 476684675 at the box office and as of 2009 home alone was the highest grossing comedy of all time! The McCallisters go to Paris for Christmas however their eightyearold son Kevin is left behind after sleeping in and not being awoken but being forgotten...bad parenting! In the mother's defence she moves Heaven and Earth attempting to get back to her son. At first Kev loves being alone by himself in his house eating junk food jumping on beds watching scary movies going through his brothers personal belongings without anyone telling to do otherwise. But eventually the young boy has to fight for himself and his home as two wannabe robbers plan to raid his house. He does this while helping repair the broken family of a man who once scared the life out of him can an eightyearold really manage to do this? Mend cook clean and kick butt? After writing my Hobbit review I reread my previous reviews and of course I came across my Home Alone 2 review. It stated that the home alone's were really good Christmas films and conveniently my parents had bought me the box set the previous day...good parenting! So I decided to do some Christmassy things decorated the cake that my Grandad baked and put up my tree whilst watching it. This movie is just as good as it's sequel which means this film has to be quality because number two had an automatic advantage due to the fact it was in New York. This film is the first of it's kind an individual not repetitive a breath of fresh air which I pointed out it's sequel review John Hughes must have been just as tired as me with boring ol' movies that are remade every year he must have had to rack his brains for a while in order to think up a plot like that it's pure random gold! Anyway I love this film the plot is magic the actors are magic the music is magic and I think it well deserves to be the highest grossing comedy of all time! I think that's why it's followup had to be something special in order to not be one of the biggest movie let downs of all time and that's why three and four were. So Well done John Hughes and Chris Columbus for one and two not three and four because they were a massive let down. RATING 8.310Best parts Kevin's initial reaction to being left alone The booby trap fight The ending oh how cute!?".

The signature tune is made by John Williams musician of 'Star Wars' 'Harry Potter' and 'Lord of the Rings'. 20th Century Fox bought the plan for home alone from Warner Bros and upped the budget for the movie by 4 million it turned out as a bargain for 20th Century Fox because it raked in 476684675 at the box office and as of 2009 home alone was the highest grossing comedy of all time! The McCallisters go to Paris for Christmas however their eightyearold son Kevin is left behind after sleeping in and not being awoken but being forgotten...bad parenting! In the mother's defence she moves Heaven and Earth attempting to get back to her son. At first Kev loves being alone by himself in his house eating junk food jumping on beds watching scary movies going through his brothers personal belongings without anyone telling to do otherwise. But eventually the young boy has to fight for himself and his home as two wannabe robbers plan to raid his house. He does this while helping repair the broken family of a man who once scared the life out of him can an eightyearold really manage to do this? Mend cook clean and kick butt? After writing my Hobbit review I reread my previous reviews and of course I came across my Home Alone 2 review. It stated that the home alone's were really good Christmas films and conveniently my parents had bought me the box set the previous day...good parenting! So I decided to do some Christmassy things decorated the cake that my Grandad baked and put up my tree whilst watching it. This movie is just as good as it's sequel which means this film has to be quality because number two had an automatic advantage due to the fact it was in New York. This film is the first of it's kind an individual not repetitive a breath of fresh air which I pointed out it's sequel review John Hughes must have been just as tired as me with boring ol' movies that are remade every year he must have had to rack his brains for a while in order to think up a plot like that it's pure random gold! Anyway I love this film the plot is magic the actors are magic the music is magic and I think it well deserves to be the highest grossing comedy of all time! I think that's why it's followup had to be something special in order to not be one of the biggest movie let downs of all time and that's why three and four were. So Well done John Hughes and Chris Columbus for one and two not three and four because they were a massive let down. RATING 8.310Best parts Kevin's initial reaction to being left alone The booby trap fight The ending oh how cute!?";

	schema:reviewBody "When it comes to enjoying that jolly time of year there are several movies that must be viewed or else it just isn't Christmas. One of those is 1990's Home Alone. Written and produced by the late great John Hughes and directed by Chris Columbus it follows the story of young Kevin McCallister Played by Macaulay Culkin arguably the best child actor since Shirley Temple who's constantly picked on and looked down upon by his large extended family but especially by his older and much hated brother Buzz Devin Ratray in what has to be his best role. On the eve of the big family vacation Kevin lashes out and gets sent to the attic by his impatient mom The talented and ravishing Catherine O'Hara and right then Kevin makes the prophetic wish of never seeing his family again. Little does he know his wish is about to come true when due to a convenient power outage his parents' alarm clocks fails to go off and the result is sheer holiday hell as everybody scrambles like there's no tomorrow to catch that flight. Everybody that is except little Kevin who's forgotten by everyone and as the title says is left home alone. Shock turns to happiness as Kevin realizes his wish has come true.But it's not all fun and games as two naughty burglars Harry and Marv Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who give a wonderful performance together as the two bumbling thieves are on the rampage in Kevin's neighborhood. Rather than running away like most kids might do Kevin decides to fight back using his creativity and some simple but potentially bone shattering traps. It all might sound like a simple holiday comedy to be watched and then put away but there's something more to the film that keeps me and many others coming back year after year. To be sure the physical comedy of Harry and Marv getting their asses handed to them by Kevin's traps is nothing short of a laugh riot Traps include anything from heated door handles to slippery steps.But the film also manages to include a lot of heart as Kevin slowly but surely begins to realize that family is what the holidays are all about and without them it's pretty lonely a lesson he learns first hand by the at first feared but then loved neighborhood recluse Old Man Marley the late great character actor Robert Blossom. John Williams score to this is undoubtedly one of his best as it is both grand and yet not overbearing in the least. On the contrary it manages to invoke the spirit of Christmas in all of us while giving us the chills because of its beauty. And of course who can forget the performance of Macaulay Culkin since the film rests on his shoulders more than anything else. With his mischievous grin and resourcefulness we just can't help but love his character and root for him all the way through the film. I should also mention that the movie includes a small but very memorable performance by the legendary John Candy Try not to laugh at the conversation he has with Kevin's mom in the back of the van!. Home Alone is one of those films that no matter how many times you might see it it just never gets old. The movie is a time capsule in many ways because it somehow captured not only the holiday spirit but also the magic of the time it was made in the 90's a time where not only were the movies better but so was everything else. It is for that reason that movie will live on forever and ever much like the spirit of Christmas itself. So without further adieu I urge you to watch this modern classic and if you're ever going on big trip with the family make sure that you have all your children! Also starring John Heard and a host of other memorable actors. Merry Christmas everyone!!!!!!!".

Two crooks attempt to rob the family home and it is up to Kevin to protect the place! Home Alone is one of my all time favourite Christmas movies I couldn't get enough of it as a kid growing up. There was something powerful as a child seeing another child around the same age face the bad guys and be able to defeat them. Home Alone is basically about a family that leaves for vacation but in the rush of getting out on time they forget that young Kevin McCallister was not with them on their way to the airport. So while they take off for Paris Kevin wakes up to find that he is all alone in this gigantic house. It's all fun and games at first for Kevin until he discovers that a pair of thieves plan on robbing his house thinking that the place is empty. Whiz kid Kevin sets up a number of booby traps and set ups that severely injure the bandits. Examples include one of the thieves named Harry getting his head set on fire the other Marv gets hit in the head with an iron. These kind of stunts could kill a person in real life but the magic of movies allows the bandits to shake it off and continue their mischief.The acting in Home Alone is top notch! Macaulay Culkin is brilliant as Kevin McCallister the scared yet empowered young boy who takes on the Wet Bandits. Those bandits are played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who add so much to the film with their performance. And you get some good screen time from stars such as Catherine O'Hara John Heard and even John Candy. The traps that Kevin sets are smart and witty and the location shots are perfect for the tricks he has planned for Harry and Marv.All in all Home Alone is a classic film not only for Christmastime but all year round. This should be seen by everyone at least once.810".

His last good film being Ritchie Rich 1994 liveaction film adaptation of the Harvey Comics comic book character Richie Rich.So from his highest grossing film Home Alone to Richie Rich is only a 4 year reign. In this film we have the pairing of two talented actors in Joe Pesci and Daniel SternI REALLY LIKE THE WAY THIS GUY ACTS  HIS SENSE OF HUMOR!!!. They are a pair of burglars Harry Lyme Pesci and Marv Merchants Stern specializing in housebreaking when the occupants are off on holiday. This time its on Christmas. The McCallister's have planned a trip to Paris. Meanwhile Harry has his sights set on the McCallister House.However things don't necessarily go as planned... Kevin has been forgotten at home and the McCallister's realize this too late. Now Kevin is all alone against a duo of hardened? professional? crooks. 2 vs. 1 is not a fair fightor so you think....What happens next is why this film has become the most grossing American comedy film of 1990. I WON'T reveal what happens next so either go see it at a Cinema you like or watch it on DVDCABLE or ONLINE or buy the DVD either at a DVD store or online. This film has a decent sequel Home Alone 2 Lost in New York which follows the further mishaps in the life of Kevin.Other Macaulay Culkin films worth seeinghaving Uncle Buck The Good Son My Girl Getting Even with Dad and Richie Rich.".

What child hasn't wished they could spend some time alone in their house free to stay up and do what they want? There are some fun scenes throughout especially one when the pizza delivery man comes calling.The burglars are very well played by Daniel Sterns and Joe Pesci both as clumsy as each other. At first Kevin fools them making them believe he is not home alone but they soon become wise to his act and break in...that is when the fun starts as Kevin uses dozens of household items to fight them. Everything from irons which he uses to hit their heads to christmas decorations with sharp ends which Daniel Sterns steps on.It's hard not to thoroughly enjoy a film like this especially as it appeals to all of us adults and children who have wished we could just have the house to ourself and do what we please. This is a great film which I thoroughly recommend and it was followed by two great sequels.".

It is soon learned by the military that a number of enormous objects are on a collision course with Earth. At first thought to be meteors they are later revealed to be gigantic spacecraft piloted by a mysterious alien species. After attempts to communicate with the aliens go nowhere David Levinson an exscientist turned cable technician discovers that the aliens are going to attack major points around the globe in less than a day. On July 3rd the aliens all but obliterate New York Los Angeles and Washington as well as Paris London Houston and Moscow. The survivors set out in convoys towards Area 51 a strange government testing ground where it is rumored the military has a captured alien spacecraft of their own. The survivors devise a plan to fight back against the enslaving aliens and July 4th becomes the day humanity will fight for its freedom. July 4th is their ...";

	schema:reviewBody "Independence Day is the sort of film that's best appreciated on a big screen preferably a massive great plasma television that is so huge you had to cut the roof off your house and get airlifted in by helicopters just to get it in the living room. You should also have the most state of the art surround sound possible with bass pickups so deep they cause earthquakes on the Eastern seaboard. Not because Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's alien invasion flick is a masterpiece of cinematic art or anything but because it's loud. Very loud. And if the windows in your house don't shatter when the spaceship flies over New York then well you're just not experiencing it properly.Taking the 1950's invasion narratives and protooling them for 90's audiences Independence Day is an absolute blast of visual flare and gung ho heroism. The plot is so straightforward as to be superfluous aliens invade fights ensue but even so it remains an invigorating watch purely because of the spectacle it provides. Back in 1996 the sight of that giant blue laser tearing apart lower Manhattan made jaws drop and while it's unlikely to do the same to today's overstimulated audiences it's still an incredible visual feast. What's more the ensemble cast makes it surprisingly unpredictable  we all know that the aliens will be defeated at the end but what isn't so obvious is which characters are going to be alive to see it. Except for the kid and the dog. They're relatively safe bets.Watching it now though it does possess a cheerful naivety in the face of world politics. After all this was 1996 the Cold War was over and 911 a long way off so the entire world uniting against a common foe without being bogged down with petty arguments and personal agendas still seemed believable. Hell even the guntoting Arabs that briefly appear on screen are more than happy to rally behind Uncle Sam in the name of freedom. That's right folks it's an Americans Save The World movie complete with a snapshot of British officers drinking tea in the desert and waiting for those silly yanks to get a bally move on and show us what to do.Needless to say this is blockbuster entertainment through and through. The aliens are apparently here to strip mine the planet of all her natural resources but they're quite happy to put that off for a bit in order to blow things up for the entire running time. Fans of indepth characterisation intelligent story telling and emotional engagement with the protagonists are wasting their time but if you want to watch tourist attractions jet planes and space craft exploding for three hours you can't really go wrong. That business about a computer virus bringing down the mothership is a bit daft though not once did they try switching everything on and off again.".

What were they expecting?  A remake of 2001  A Space Odyssey.  Sure I am not going to pretend the film does not has many glaring weaknesses.  The plot is hardly original its execution is even less inspiring.  Roland Emmerich goes out of his way to use every cliche in the book oversentimentality weak flat characterizations incredible jumps in logic and reasoning made on the viewer and the use of special effects to overcome these shortcomings.  But what some of the reviewers seemed to have missed and its there as substantiated by the huge popularity of the film is heart. The film has a lot of heart.  It makes you feel good after watching it.  And although that quality does not make it a great film it certainly makes it a good film in my book.  The film is vastly entertaining very suspenseful a delight for the eyes with dazzling special effects and even has some dialogue that does just rise above its hackneyed origins.  The acting is adequate all around with no one pulling off a great performance but a few doing marvelous jobs with what they have to work with.  Judd Hirsch easily out acts his fellow colleagues as a Jewish father with a gift for common sense and lack of tact.  Jeff Goldblum also gives a pretty good performance as his son.  Yeah Will Smith is just Will Smith..lots of one liners and little meat so to speak.  But he is bearable.  Watch for Brent Spiner in an outrageous role as a hippie scientist.  His performance is a real hoot!  If you are looking for philosophical science fiction this is not it.  See Starship Troopersa great film.  This is just good old Americans against the universe stuff lots of action but little substance. But whatever it may have as its faults it is a fun happy sad charming engrossing film to watch...time and time again.".

This is not a Best Picture film but a very entertaining popcorn film. This tells the tale of aliens attacking Earth and a group of survivors must unite together to destroy the invading aliens. The acting is decent. Will Smith with a movie career underway is excellent. Bill Pullman is great as the President. The effects were amazing especially when the buildings were blown up. David Arnold's music score is just fantastic. The theme is still stuck in my head. Overall this is an excellent film. I rate this film a 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed this movie sure it isn't the most original movie ever made or the best but it was what it set out to be...which is a combo alien attack movie of the 50's plus an allstar disaster movie of the 70's.  A lot of critics don't like this one and a lot of people who think of themselves as critics don't care much for it either but it still brought in over 300 million at the box office in the summer of 96.  I thought it was an entertaining film with lots of action and a good dose of comedy as well.  One complaint I have is that it runs a bit long and you feel the time pass not like other movies like The Two Towers where it doesn't feel like all that much time has passed.  Another problem with this movie is that it is best seen in the theater.  This movie has a score of only six at imdb so a lot of people who saw it probably saw it on TV.  Or if they did see it at the theaters realized it just wasn't as good on the small screen when they saw it on TV. The movie also benefited from a great ad campaign that started with a super bowl spot that showed the White House being destroyed.  The movie is basically an alien invasion movie and it is like a 50's science fiction movie.  It also has a lot of stars not the biggest names just like a 70's disaster flick.  If you don't care for either of these genres you probably won't like this movie but if you like one or the other or both it is worth checking out.  Just don't take it too seriously and have fun watching it.".

If you set aside the fact that the aliens in this movie use Macintoshbased computer systems the Prez hops into a fighter jet AS THE PILOT and Will Smith punches an alien unconscious in his downed spaceship...this movie is still horrible. Aliens come to earth to sap it of it's resourcesa nd to accomplish this of course the aliens have to destroy earth's inhabitants. The enormous spaceships gather above major cities around the globe and WAIT THERE DOING NOTHING FOR DAYS. Then they start to blow up stuff we recognize not military targets just useless tourist attractions that will make us sad. Does blowing up hte White House really accomplish anything? Does it terrify Earth's inabitants? the giant spaceships do that just fine. How about attacking military installations capable of fighting back? They can't be stopped...or can they? What's next?...Not Six Flags over Nebraska!?!?!?! The solution to Earth's dilemma lies in the Apple Corporation's operating system for homebased computing. Simply walk into an Apple store grab a Powerbook fly into the enemy spaceship how you ask?....naturally by piloting one of their spacecraft 200 years ahead of earth technology on your first try mess with their hard drives using an earth laptop computer I'm not kidding and whamo!!!...Aliens start dropping like flies! Not an ounce of creativity or originality or brainpower was used in writing this drivel. I enjoyed all the stereotypical characters brought together to fight...the drunken former pilot the hotshot young stud pilot the computer geek the kid and the most powerful man we gots...the PRESIDENT OF THE US... YEAH BABY!!!It plays like a 10 yearold's idea of a really cool thing that happened once. Horrible. Don't see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a rule I don't like highconcept movies. However Independence Day is one of the few with some merits. It is also the best film todate by German scifiaction director Roland Emmerich. The greatest flaw of Indepence Day aka ID4 due to initial copyright problems with the Independence Day title is the excessive jingoism. Completely America centric it seems that the rest of human civilization is helpless without the Yanks. The American President is not just the only world leader fighting for a free world he even moonlights as a fighter pilot attacking the aliens.However its still a damn entertaining film. There is a large ensemble cast of good actors some in career best roles. Will Smith was really launched as a movie star by this film and he has some very funny lines. Jeff Goldblum actually looks nerdycool as a scientist who likes to play chess in the park. And Bill Pullman is the cleancut American President who proclaims that July 4 will no longer be an American holiday but a world holiday! The rest of the ensemble cast includes small but meaty roles for Judd Hirsch Randy Quaid and Vivica Fox. Harry Connick Jr. has a small part but blows it completely.The things that make ID4 watching is that something is always going on. There are plenty of oneliners and the onedimensional character all have their peculiar personality traits and quirks. The action scenes are impressive and in fact this film has the largest number of miniatures ever built. That record will probably never be broken because digital technology is limiting the use of miniatures. If you can let your hair loose and just want to enjoy a light movie without letting the America is Great propaganda get to you ID4 is for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes you wonder just how bad a movie can be. Don't wonder any longer. Just rent this colossal piece of manure and strap yourself in for perhaps the worst movie viewing experience you have ever tolerated. This overlong overblown ridiculous cartoon has one redeeming quality and that is the buildings being blown up once the aliens FINALLY launch their attack on the world. Prior to that and trust me it takes awhile you must tolerate scene after scene of reaction shots to the approaching alien craft. The cast aren't really looking at anything because the computer animation hasn't been added yet. Hohum. Between these scenes and for a long time afterward the people featured in this story have a peculiar tendency to go on with their lives as if there is no particular hurry trying to deal with everything suddenly turned upside down. There's all the time in the world to say goodbye eat a bag of chips drive to work go on a short vacation or do whatever else you want. That's when you realize just how boring and absurd this thing is going to be. We must admit those effects are pretty good the giant explosions and the flying cars and trucks squashing the running crowds as they attempt escape. I'll give this horrendous pile a 1 just for that. Soon enough though we're right back to the sappy dreary meaningless dialog. You can almost imagine one of the actors on the set acting confused and asking Wait a minute. What's my motivation here? The cast and crew crack up knowing just how silly his remark is but the actors actually must pretend this farce is poignant. For example there's Will Smith trying to tell his girlfriend he loves her while choking back the emotion or was it the other way around? I don't quite remember but who gives a rat's. Then Will's dragging an alien across the salt flat and hamming it up. It's painful to watch. Then there's Jeff Goldbum and his dad Judd Hirsch who play chess in the park as a regular thing. Jeff is welleducated but lacking in ambition so he's a cable guy. His appraising gaze is often fraught with smouldering sensitivity belying the supposed depth of his character. Go grab a snack or take a pee and don't bother with the pause. You won't miss anything worth seeing except perhaps a rather silly excursion into the character of the president who is seen at the helm in the midst of this crisis. Gee he looks kind of young to be president. As the aliens wipe out most of the world he seems paralyzed with indecision but never fear. Finally realizing the invaders are beyond redemption and the human race is about to be annihalated he gives the order to nuke 'em! Wait a sec we almost forgot. it doesn't matter what you hit 'em with because nothing will penetrate their shields. Sounds familiar. The prez gives a stirring speech and hops into an Air Force fighter jet. He wants a piece of them himself. Whaddya mean that doesn't quite add up? Pretend you're six years old. Goldblum and Smith fly into space never mind how to rendevouz with the mother ship and download a virus into it's computer banks using Jeff's trusty notebook computer. This he thinks will screw up the alien signal our only chance to save mankind. Once this brilliant maneuver is executed it will take down the shields from all the giant craft and we will be able to shoot them down at least for a few precious minutes. The armed forces of other countries have been contacted by Morse Code and are ready to act in concert. The ridiculous virus strategy worked of course and Jeff and Will are heroes. So is the president and so is the drunken crop duster pilot who makes the ultimate sacrifice. Too bad the First Lady took some shrapnel in the ass early in the flick and went down to defeat. Anyway that's a wrap people. Let's sling this piece of cheap dogfood into the can and go home. There's gonna be a cast party over at Will's house and attendance is mandatory. Do I make myself clear? Do you wanna get paid? Be there!".

	schema:reviewBody "Personally I think this is the best movie of the 90's.But then I think South Park is the best TV show of the 20th century. Followed by Twilight Zone and Star Trek tying for second and third place.While there's no accounting for taste in art I can make reasoned arguments for my choices.The people here on IMDb who hate this movie and provide negative comments probably have their reasons too but mostly they say stupid things. For example the one vituperous reviewer who lambasted the film's lessthanimpressive CGI effects. Well duh they didn't use very much CGI as far as I know. They did special effects the oldfashioned way. This schmuck is complaining about reality not being very realistic?And if box office is any indication of excellence then the stats are on my side and prove the naysayers are tasteless boobs. Make that witless tasteless boobs. Independence Day is one of the highest grossing movies in history worldwide sales topping a billion.Admittedly ID4 is one of those semirare movies that people either love or hate. And in this case hate with a passion. Why? I'm still trying to figure that one out but so far I believe the whiniest critics are just your stereotypical jaded art critics selfcentered pseudointellectuals with attitude who pounce on any flaws in anything they personally don't like just to show off their own vapid superiority. What do they want? Yes the movie has flaws but it also has a lot of plot a lot of heart and a lot of action. Dialog? I make fun of the dialog myself... so what? The worst criticism I can lay against the writers is that a lot of the dialog is inane... just like real people talk! That just makes it more realistic. Have any of these critics on here ever listened to how real people talk? In some cases the dialog is sooo frigging inane in ID4 that I marvel at it's brilliance. Or chutzpah.What happened mommy?I don't know babyAs for the Applealien hookup... my god have we become so inured to the miracles of science that we calmly overlook or accept miracles like antigravity and kvetch instead about mundane technicalities? Yes the Applealien computer hookup is a plot hole... so what? I can easily explain that away a billion times easier than I can explain antigravity. I happen to know a bit about both.Again. Are there stupid things that happen in ID4? Sure. Checked reality lately? Stupid things happen all the time. But so do heroic things. As well as evil. Typical fare for the ancient tragedies. I believe ID4 carries on that ancient and honorable tradition entertainment. And viewing it as a work of art I must say that I was impressed over and over again while watching this film where most of the studios would have wussed out or flinched these film makers didn't. They stepped up to the plate and tried to beat the ball to death over and over again with their bat.And you know what? These film makers did it with a hint of humor. Not bad at all.".

This was his biggest success and deservedly so  though The Day after Tomorrow was just as spiffing.The script ain't strong and the plot ain't great but this is an actionepic film and on that scale Independence Day delivers.

	schema:reviewBody "This was one of my favorite movies of the year.  It had lots of great effects and the action sequences are great.  Will Smith was his usual self funny and entertaining.  While the realism may be a little hard to take spoilers laptops compatible with alien technology a virus drummed up in a couple days that can disable the ships etc.  It wasn't really meant to be taken as an extremely scientifically accurate movie.  Just a fun alien invasion movie where humanity has to come together and fight off the aggressors a little overused subject maybe but what isn't these days?  At any rate this rehash was pulled off very well.  One thing I would like to say though is to all those posting complaints about the Americans always find the answer.  This is a movie about Americans made for Americans so why would they go all that way and then have say to pull a country out of the hat the British win it for them? no slight to the British intended at all in that That would be stupid!  I'm not an expert on foreign films but I doubt there are a lot of British films that show German's winning it or French films that have Spaniards winning so I think these America always seems to do it arguments are rather unfair especially for a film such as this one which is a work of total fiction.Gentlemen you can't fight in here! This is the war room!".

While the realism may be a little hard to take spoilers laptops compatible with alien technology a virus drummed up in a couple days that can disable the ships etc.  It wasn't really meant to be taken as an extremely scientifically accurate movie.  Just a fun alien invasion movie where humanity has to come together and fight off the aggressors a little overused subject maybe but what isn't these days?

I'd also like a BDAF to be a bit less well homogenized.

	schema:headline " The greatest badass best action movie hands down my personal favorite number 1 movie of all time";
	schema:reviewBody "Die Hard 1988 the first action film is by far one of the greatest best action movies of all time from the 80's till this day hands down. It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time I love this movie to death! I love it so damn much and I have fun watching it so much. I have to talk about this movie It is one man army fighting against a team of terrorists with automatic weapons and plastic explosives. Bruce Willis performance was excellent in this movie John McClane is his best role ever. It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time I love this movie to death! It's stay in my heart forever. To me it felt this film realistic and it makes you think that you are alone trapped in a building against bunch of terrorists what will you do? This film has heart and soul. A lot of movies have try to do that premise since but no movie has nail it like Die Hard. This is a modern day action film of the action genre. I watch this film as a teenager I even watch it with my mom it was ultimate thrill ride. I love everyone in here all the characters and the lead character. I love that McClane is alone he has no help all telephones doesn't work he is barefoot with his gun and the only help has is from Sgt. Al Powell down there who didn't even see him at all but were both talking on a radio from cop to cop. I love that bond between those two lead heroes. I always love when McClane talks to himself whenever he was about to do something crazy. It is going to be 30 years anniversary this summer 20th July. I love this film to death I am hugh fan of Die Hard films I love this film so damn much. I would really love to see this movie in a widescreen in a movie theater. It was directed by brilliant John McTiernan it is is based on a novel Roderick Thorp Nothing Lasts Forever. This is a masterpiece action film that started all action genre one man army types battling terrorists while trapped in a confined space. It was arguably the first one in the action genre. This movie has everything . It has intense Action Drama Thriller twists great dialogue explosions fights. Exploding building great helicopter explosion action scenes. John McClane is one man against a whole team of terrorists. A cracking Action Thriller from beginning to end Die Hard explodes with heartstopping suspense! It has great cast great plot great explosions no shaky cam doesn't deal with CGI but real actions real practical effects. Great Direction from John McTiernan great dialogues great acting from everyone. Everyone does an excellent job. Bruce Willis is a bad ass action star as John McClane. It has a great badass action hero who does impossible buy stopping the terrorists who were actually a real terrorists who try to steal the money in a vault 640.000.000 in bearer bonds stored in the building's vault. My favorite action sequences and the best part of Die Hard McClane grabs the fire hose ties it around his body jumps with the helicopter about to kill him. Then Gruber blows it a second after McLane jumps off the roof! It was an incredible explosion that totally takes out the helicopter. But McLane is falling down the side of the building and needs to get inside quickly this is the best scene in the movie my favorite. McClane climbs in the elevator shaft escapes Karl and his men trying to kill him. McClane shoots on the table with his gun killing Marco. According to the director the proximity of the gun to Willis' ear during this scene caused permanent hearing loss for Willis. McClane shot's Hans and Eddie Happy  Trails Hans... Incredibly satisfying action in a brilliant action movie! McClane try to save Ellis when Ellis try to save him self. McClane was afraid of flying and he always carry gun because he was afraid someone would have hijack it. The fight between Karl and John was excellent and well choreographed. McClane drops C4 down the elevator shaft and destroys the entire floor where the terrorists are firing from giving the cops a chance to retreat. I love The broken glass scene. He shoot's and kills two terrorists with his machine gun to escape Hans and Karl John McClane is forced to sprint over broken glass while barefoot the best badass scene in the movie my all time favorite. Three terrorists are shooting on McClane on the roof chasing him in which he escapes in the beginning of the movie awesome. Karl shoots in an elevator shaft in which McClane is hiding a real kickass scene I love this film to death! I love the characters in this movie John McClane a real action hero to me that does something that no one can he stops a team of terrorists. Hans Grubar the German mastermind he was ruthless and brilliant and he would do anything to steal the money even killing people and get what he want's. Alan Rickman's performance was excellent I love him to death in this movie. I really miss the actor he was the best villain of the whole world. The LAPD Supervisor Diana James I like that girl she was so good when McClane call's her for help I love it. I love Sgt. Al Powell how he stand's up and defends McClane against his supervisor. Reginald VelJohnson does a brilliant performance as a great supporting hero in this movie. I love Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson to death he is my favorite character in here. Paul Gleason was so good I love his performance  kick ass. I love how he tried everything to safe the hostages including SWAT team who were badly hurt. I like Richard Thornburg in this movie who is annoying reporter but I still like it. Bonnie Bedelia as Holly McClane's wife was great.John McTiernan directed excellent this masterpiece Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza wrote a script that it delivers. The helicopters in here were models in this movie delivered to me the action scenes felt realistic. This movie has ton's of action and you never get bored with it. Michael Kamen made a music score and you never get bored with it. You'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons and you'll see them used well. The film is violent and bloody rated R with real blood squibs. 1010 it is my favorite action film in the action genre I love this film to death it is my personal action favorite film. I miss movies like this I miss action movies like this one today I want them back. It is a shame we don't have movies like this today.".

	schema:headline " The Perfect Modern Action Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Die Hard is the prototype type for the modern action film.  Since it's also one of the best action films ever made that happens to be a very good thing.  Die Hard is lean mean and doesn't contain a single second of wasted screen time. The direction the action the story the acting . . . every aspect of this film comes close to bigbudget action movie perfection. Since Die Hard was first released in 1988 it's difficult to think of a blockbuster action film that doesn't follow the basic structure and format of Die Hard . . . or for that matter is better than Die Hard.Die Hard is about John McClane Bruce Willis in one of his alltime best film performances a basically good honest New York cop with a penchant for annoying authority figures.   Traveling to Los Angeles in a last ditch attempt to patch things up with his estranged wife Holly Bonnie Bedelia John McClane suddenly finds himself involved in a hostage situation. Terrorists led by the enigmatic Hans Gruber Alan Rickman have taken over the office building in which Holly is working and with Gruber holding the upper hand over the LAPD and FBI forces in Los Angeles it's up to John McClane to save the day . . . .Kudos should be given to both director John McTiernan and screenwriters Jeb Stuart and Steven DeSouza  the film is tight electrifying and clever which is something few action films can ever claim.  The story isn't completely believable but it's believable enough and it manages to move along at a quick enough pace to where the most glaring plotholes can easily be glossed over.  There's also enough twists and wrinkles thrown into the story to keep the audience guessing as to what's going to happen next . . . and the surprises don't come out of left field but are actually clever and well thoughtout.  The fact that McClane often relies on his brains instead of his bullets to get out of his predicaments is also a big plus. Simply put Die Hard is one of the smartest and savviest action screenplays ever written.  McTiernan holds up his end of the film admirably as well  he uses the claustrophobic nature of the office building to great effect particularly in any scene involving an elevator shaft and he keeps the film rolling at a rollercoaster pace building up the anticipation of the audience before unleashing the action.  A lot of recent action films just fly along at a mindless breakneck pace without ever allowing the story to breathe or the suspense to build . . . unlike those films Die Hard knows how to maximize the impact of each and every scene and that's why it stands out so clearly from them all.  With Die Hard John McTiernan puts on a perfect clinic as to how to pace an action movie.As for the acting it's darn near close to perfect.  Bruce Willis is awesome as John McClane.  As played by Willis McClane's a smartass with a distinct disdain for being given orders . . . but McClane's also clever and knows how to keep cool under pressure.  There's more to McClane than the stereotypical tough guy hero.  Fortunately the role was given to Bruce Willis who infuses McClane with the perfect mix of cocky arrogance and stonecold heroism.  The fact that Willis plays McClane as a man often in disbelief of his own situation and who struggles in his fight against bad guys instead of just killing bad guys with ease like most stereotypical action heroes  well not only does it make the character much more believable it's darn brilliant.  The fact that Willis also knows how to deliver a deadpan oneliner better than anybody else in Hollywood makes the character all the better.  There's only a handful of movies where both character and actor are a completely perfect match Bruce Willis as John McClane is one such perfect match.Also worthy of mention is Alan Rickman's performance as the villain Hans Gruber.  The Machiavellian Gruber would've been an easy villain to turn into little more than a scenerychewing Bond villain . . . fortunately Rickman doesn't travel the easy route.  Gruber as played by Rickman is cold and calculating and actually acts smart instead of merely claiming to be smart and then being thoroughly outwitted by the hero.  He always appears to have an ace hidden up his sleeve and is so convincing at giving this impression it's hard to tell throughout the film whether he or McClane truly have the upper hand.  Other actors probably could've played Gruber fairly well but Rickman makes Gruber one of the alltime great villains.  As for the rest of the cast they're all pretty good.  Bonnie Bedelia does a nice job as John's soontobeexwife Holly  she plays her with enough smarts and feistiness to break the usual damsel in distress mold.  It's also worth mentioning that Paul Gleason who plays the obstinate police chief Robinson pretty much sets up the modern action movie stereotype of the authority figure who refuses to heed the advice of the maverick hero.  The character is stupid to a fault and he's wonderful because of it.Die Hard is a terrific example of what happens when all the pieces of a film fall together perfectly.  There simply are no weak spots or dull moments in the film.  Is Die Hard one of the best overall movies ever made?  Probably not.  But it's undeniably one of the best action movies ever made and it just might well be the perfect modern action film.  Grade A".

	onyx:emotionText "Die Hard is the prototype type for the modern action film.  Since it's also one of the best action films ever made that happens to be a very good thing.  Die Hard is lean mean and doesn't contain a single second of wasted screen time. The direction the action the story the acting . . . every aspect of this film comes close to bigbudget action movie perfection. Since Die Hard was first released in 1988 it's difficult to think of a blockbuster action film that doesn't follow the basic structure and format of Die Hard . . . or for that matter is better than Die Hard.Die Hard is about John McClane Bruce Willis in one of his alltime best film performances a basically good honest New York cop with a penchant for annoying authority figures.   Traveling to Los Angeles in a last ditch attempt to patch things up with his estranged wife Holly Bonnie Bedelia John McClane suddenly finds himself involved in a hostage situation. Terrorists led by the enigmatic Hans Gruber Alan Rickman have taken over the office building in which Holly is working and with Gruber holding the upper hand over the LAPD and FBI forces in Los Angeles it's up to John McClane to save the day . . . .Kudos should be given to both director John McTiernan and screenwriters Jeb Stuart and Steven DeSouza  the film is tight electrifying and clever which is something few action films can ever claim.  The story isn't completely believable but it's believable enough and it manages to move along at a quick enough pace to where the most glaring plotholes can easily be glossed over.  There's also enough twists and wrinkles thrown into the story to keep the audience guessing as to what's going to happen next . . . and the surprises don't come out of left field but are actually clever and well thoughtout.  The fact that McClane often relies on his brains instead of his bullets to get out of his predicaments is also a big plus. Simply put Die Hard is one of the smartest and savviest action screenplays ever written.  McTiernan holds up his end of the film admirably as well  he uses the claustrophobic nature of the office building to great effect particularly in any scene involving an elevator shaft and he keeps the film rolling at a rollercoaster pace building up the anticipation of the audience before unleashing the action.  A lot of recent action films just fly along at a mindless breakneck pace without ever allowing the story to breathe or the suspense to build . . . unlike those films Die Hard knows how to maximize the impact of each and every scene and that's why it stands out so clearly from them all.  With Die Hard John McTiernan puts on a perfect clinic as to how to pace an action movie.As for the acting it's darn near close to perfect.  Bruce Willis is awesome as John McClane.  As played by Willis McClane's a smartass with a distinct disdain for being given orders . . . but McClane's also clever and knows how to keep cool under pressure.  There's more to McClane than the stereotypical tough guy hero.  Fortunately the role was given to Bruce Willis who infuses McClane with the perfect mix of cocky arrogance and stonecold heroism.  The fact that Willis plays McClane as a man often in disbelief of his own situation and who struggles in his fight against bad guys instead of just killing bad guys with ease like most stereotypical action heroes  well not only does it make the character much more believable it's darn brilliant.  The fact that Willis also knows how to deliver a deadpan oneliner better than anybody else in Hollywood makes the character all the better.  There's only a handful of movies where both character and actor are a completely perfect match Bruce Willis as John McClane is one such perfect match.Also worthy of mention is Alan Rickman's performance as the villain Hans Gruber.  The Machiavellian Gruber would've been an easy villain to turn into little more than a scenerychewing Bond villain . . . fortunately Rickman doesn't travel the easy route.  Gruber as played by Rickman is cold and calculating and actually acts smart instead of merely claiming to be smart and then being thoroughly outwitted by the hero.  He always appears to have an ace hidden up his sleeve and is so convincing at giving this impression it's hard to tell throughout the film whether he or McClane truly have the upper hand.

It's scripted so that the two of them end up talking over each other about what McClane's idea of their marriage is and it's such an honest depiction of estranged spouses that I find myself forgetting what movie I'm watching when I get to that part.Granted not everyone has a terrorist takeover of their office building to teach them not to take each other for granted but it works here.That scene is one of the great things about Die Hard not because it contributes anything to the action but because it contributes everything to the characters. Most action films before and after this seem violencedriven but this one manages to balance the humanity of its protagonist and I can't even begin to measure how much of that balance comes from that one scene.I think the other thing that most defines the spirit of this movie is McClane's shoes. It's such an obvious contrivance set up right from the beginning but it's worked into the entire story so artfully that I have completely forgiven it every time I've seen the film. Of all the bad luck to be caught in the middle of a terrorist attack and then have to chase the bad guys around a 40story building all without shoes.But as McClane himself says it's better than being caught with your pants down. I know how much of the plot and the action hinges upon luck timing strong fingertips and the Rube Goldberg machinery of the FBIterrorist interplay but I really don't care. I still get caught up in the nervous moments of this movie 18 years later. I still ache along with McClane as he pulls a threeinch piece of glass out of his foot in the emergency lighting in the bathroom. And I still root for him to get the bad guy rescue his wife save his marriage and meet Al Powell even though I must have scene this movie 30 or 40 times already and I know he's going to do it again the next time.This is a great film and easily the best written and best executed action movie I have ever seen. But more to the point and more importantly it's a fun movie to watch no matter how many times you see it.".

Riding for the first time in a limo he's introduced to the suave driver Argyle De'voreaux White who gives him some pretty useful advice on trying to win over the wife.At Nakatomi things of course get off to a rough start for McClane as he gets into an argument with the wife and is left to wallow in his misery.

It was also praised for the energetic and skillful direction of John McTiernan whose most notable credit was the actionscifi thriller Predator which was released the year before and starred Arnold Schwarzenegger.Bruce Willis was the perfect actor for this performance since he brings the wit and vulnerability to a role like this one. If Stallone or Schwarzenegger were in this movie I'm sure the effect would have been a lot different.Personally I think Die Hard is one of the greatest action movies ever up there close to my favorite action movie of all time Raiders of the Lost Ark. Like Indiana Jones in that film Die Hard had an Everyman cast in the role McClane like Indiana Jones wasn't a largerthanlife musclebound grotesque he was a real guy that you cared about who got hurt and had real feelings.That's why I think both of these movies have sort of stood the test of time as becoming what they are best known for today action classics and they're here to stay ladies and gentlemen.1010".

	schema:headline " My favourite action film of all time";
	schema:reviewBody "I've seen many action films over the years but few have had an impact like Die Hard. Bruce Willis gives one of the best if not THE best performances of his film career. This is quite simply my favourite action film of all time.Willis plays NYPD cop John McClane who has come to LA to be with his estranged wife Holly Bonnie Bedelia and their children for Christmas. To my knowledge Die Hard is one of the few action films set at Christmas. This makes Die Hard rather unique for the genre but the seasonal setting does nothing to detract from the action and its still a gripping film to watch.Getting back to the plot McClane heads for the Nakatomi Plaza a 40 storey skyscraper Holly's workplace to pick her up from the Nakatomi Corporation's annual Christmas party. But just after a heated discussion concerning the breakdown of their marriage a group of German terrorists led by Hans Gruber the brilliant Alan Rickman seize control of the building.McClane manages to escape detection and where the action kicks into overdrive. Willis makes a very likable hero as John McClane because he comes across as a more down to earth guy than other action heroes. An example is when the terrorists first seize the building but instead of trying to be a hero he just runs and tries to call for help.This is believable behaviour to me and you would expect anyone thrust into the same situation to do just that. Since the action is confined to an LA skyscraper it makes for a more claustrophobic atmosphere and environment. With McClane crawling through air ducts and elevator shafts the camera angles have you right in his face. In some ways Die Hard reminds me of The Towering Inferno the classic Irwin Allen film also set in a skyscraper. But they are still two very different films with Die Hard being more about action.McClane must now wage a one man war against Rickman's terrorists. It may sound ludicrous for one man to singlehandedly pick off a group of heavily armed terrorists but in this film it works. I think its because of Willis' likable performance of an ordinary man plunged into an extraordinary situation. I like the way he wears that white vest that becomes increasingly dirtier as the film goes on. To me this symbolises his transition from ordinary joe to the one man army he's been forced to become.Alan Rickman oozes evil as Hans Gruber who is principally interested in the 640 million dollars worth of negotiable bearer bonds in the Nakatomi building's vault. He is in complete control of the situation even when McClane is causing high rise havoc with everything from automatic weapons to plastic explosives.Rickman never loses his cool and gets a lot of great lines. He even finds time to mock McClane likening him to a cowboy. This is where McClane's famous catchphrase comes from Yippie Kayee Mother Fer. I like the way Rickman has the police and later the FBI at a complete disadvantage bluffing his way past them about comrades in arms to keep them occupied. He simply weaves them into his plan and he skillfully manipulates them to play right into his hands. This is a rare thing in an action film where neither hero nor villain upstages the other.Reginald VelJohnson is also great as Sgt Al Powell the only ally McClane has with the cops on the outside. Although they talk via radio the two have great chemistry and I like the scene when Al confides in McClane how he accidentally shot a kid even though they've never met. This illustrates the bond between them. McClane returns the favour when asking Al if he could tell Holly he's sorry their marriage didn't work out. This shows his more sensitive side but I think it shows depth to McClane's character and doesn't come across as soppy. That's why he's such a great hero.The stunts are incredible in particular when McClane has to jump off the roof tied to a fire hose. I like the way he says just before he's about to jump Oh God please don't let me die compared to some other action heroes like Schwarznegger or Stallone who would probably just jump. This again demonstrates what a realistic character he is playing.Nailbiting stuntwork and spectacular pyrotechnics are impressive and never overshadow the characterisation built upon throughout the film. The action scenes serve the plot when in most action films it is the other way around. There are some people who won't like the swearing and even I found some of it unnecessary but the film is still a masterpiece of action. Definitely John McTiernan's best film although Predator was almost on a par and its so stylish and witty right up to the nailbiting conclusion.Die Hard even succeeds as a knowing commentary on the action film genre dropping references to other action heroes and exemplifies Bruce Willis as a new type of hero. One that can get hurt one that feels pain and one that actually has ties to the world.The best of the Die Hard series and I love the Christmas song Let it Snow Let it Snow Let it Snow on the end credits to remind you it is still Christmas even after all this. Not to mention how liberating it is to watch a corporate building going up in flames.Die Hard set a whole new standard for action films to come. There have been many imitations since but none have ever managed to top the unforgettable adventure of Die Hard.".

He is in complete control of the situation even when McClane is causing high rise havoc with everything from automatic weapons to plastic explosives.Rickman never loses his cool and gets a lot of great lines. He even finds time to mock McClane likening him to a cowboy. This is where McClane's famous catchphrase comes from Yippie Kayee Mother Fer. I like the way Rickman has the police and later the FBI at a complete disadvantage bluffing his way past them about comrades in arms to keep them occupied. He simply weaves them into his plan and he skillfully manipulates them to play right into his hands. This is a rare thing in an action film where neither hero nor villain upstages the other.Reginald VelJohnson is also great as Sgt Al Powell the only ally McClane has with the cops on the outside. Although they talk via radio the two have great chemistry and I like the scene when Al confides in McClane how he accidentally shot a kid even though they've never met. This illustrates the bond between them. McClane returns the favour when asking Al if he could tell Holly he's sorry their marriage didn't work out. This shows his more sensitive side but I think it shows depth to McClane's character and doesn't come across as soppy. That's why he's such a great hero.The stunts are incredible in particular when McClane has to jump off the roof tied to a fire hose. I like the way he says just before he's about to jump Oh God please don't let me die compared to some other action heroes like Schwarznegger or Stallone who would probably just jump. This again demonstrates what a realistic character he is playing.Nailbiting stuntwork and spectacular pyrotechnics are impressive and never overshadow the characterisation built upon throughout the film. The action scenes serve the plot when in most action films it is the other way around. There are some people who won't like the swearing and even I found some of it unnecessary but the film is still a masterpiece of action. Definitely John McTiernan's best film although Predator was almost on a par and its so stylish and witty right up to the nailbiting conclusion.Die Hard even succeeds as a knowing commentary on the action film genre dropping references to other action heroes and exemplifies Bruce Willis as a new type of hero. One that can get hurt one that feels pain and one that actually has ties to the world.The best of the Die Hard series and I love the Christmas song Let it Snow Let it Snow Let it Snow on the end credits to remind you it is still Christmas even after all this. Not to mention how liberating it is to watch a corporate building going up in flames.Die Hard set a whole new standard for action films to come. There have been many imitations since but none have ever managed to top the unforgettable adventure of Die Hard.";

	schema:reviewBody "Based on ex cop Roderick Thorpe's 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever Die Hard directed by John McTiernan changed the face of the action movie. Starring Bruce Willis Alan Rickman Bonnie Bedelia Reginald Veljohnson Alexander Godunov William Atherton  Paul Gleason McTiernan's movie went on to make over 100 million in profit at the box office alone. Spawning three equally successful sequels at the time of writing it began a franchise that showed that if done well the action movie could be a dominant force in the world of cinema. The set up is relatively simple Willis plays New York cop John McLane who during the Christmas holidays is in L.A. to visit his estranged wife Holly Bedelia. She works for the Japanese Corporation of Nakatomi and currently she's attending the company Christmas party up on the 30th floor of the humongous Nakatomi Plaza tower block. Bad day at the office because a group of apparent German terrorists led by the charismatic Hans Gruber Rickman take the whole building hostage with one exception McLane who evades capture and launches a one man war against the terrorists. What follows is just over two hours of high octane action smart dialogue and technical smarts. McTiernan had already endeared himself to the action movie fan with the ball busting beef stew that was Predator in 87 a fact not lost on Die Hard's co producer Joel Silver who clearly knew that McTiernan could smoothly shift the action from the Val Verde jungle to the urban jungle of L.A. And he did. Next was to get the right man for McLane. Richard Gere was first choice but passed so the makers took a gamble on Willis whose career was at a standstill after his leap from TV show Moonlighting on to the big screen with the likes of Blind Date  Sunset barely making a ripple in Hollywood. The rest for Willis as they say is history. McLane is an everyman hero streetwise even slobbish but identifiable to many with his work ethics desperate heroics and emotional vulnerability. Willis attacks the role with a hunger rarely seen from the big male earners in filmdom. During the two hours and ten minute running time of Die Hard Willis as McLane changed the face of the action hero for ever even making a dirty white vest iconic in the process the latter of which couples nicely with the hero being bare footed throughout for a nifty bit of writing. Across the board the casting is flawless Bedelia is spunky and driven a woman worth fighting for. Veljohnson as beat copper Al PowellMcLane's walkietalkie buddy and only link to the outside worldis memorable because it feels real he has his own issue gnawing away at him but his exchanges with Willis keeps the humanity grounded as the carnage unfolds. Gleason  Atherton are wonderfully anal as Deputy Police Chief and TV Reporter respectively while Hart Bochner as Ellis dishes out one of the best weasel turns to have ever graced a movie featuring corporate suit types. But as Die Hard resembles the great Westerns of yesteryear much like the great Oaters Die Hard could only be as good as its chief villain. As Willis' McLane ushered in a new action hero to copy Rickman's uber intelligent villain set a new benchmark. Snappily dressed well versed and as charming as they come Gruber in Rickman's hands is a villain you could quite easily root for! That's further testament to Willis' turn that Rickman doesn't walk away with the movie both men are from different sides of the fence good and evil yet both are characters you can hang your hat on. Quite a trick from McTiernan that. Rickman is ably supported by the scary Godunov as right hand man Karl and Clarence Gilyard Jr. as the cold hearted Theo. Elsewhere the impact of Robert Davi  Grand L. Bush as the two cocksure FBI agents Johnson  Johnson no relation should not be underestimated. All the actors of course are indebted to the sizzling script by Steven E. de Souza  Jeb Stuart. So to is praise due to photographer Jan de Bont who in collaboration with McTiernan produces a camera work lesson for action movies as the camera swoops in and around the tower down elevator shafts and up tilt to roofs with the fight scenes afforded a spatial sheen not expected in the confines of a tower block setting the film was actually shot at 20th Century Fox's own 2121 Fox Plaza. Even the scoring from Michael Kamen and the sound tracking are of a high standard check out the various mood uses of Beethoven's Ode to Joy from Symphony No.9 and Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 In G Major Brilliant. The 80s was well served by action movies with the likes of Lethal Weapon and Beverly Hills Cop proving massively popular. But just as Raiders Of The Lost Ark changed the game for actionadventure so too did Die Hard. It's now the benchmark movie for action a film that unlike Hills Cop  Lethal Weapon remarkably shows no signs of ageing either. It's no monkey in the wrench or a fly in the ointment it's the daddy and the one that all other action movies have to answer to. 1010".

Rickman was amazing and it is one of the best bad guys performances and the one scene when we snaps at John's wife is priceless. It is kind of fun to see how a lot of action movies pull from a lot of stuff from this movie even though I sure this movie got a lot of it's substance from other movies. One of the highlights of the movie is the music and when the bad guys actually manage to open the vault one really feels a swelling of emotion as the music grows. The one problem I have is that the LAPD is not that dumb and the FBI agents are not that dumb and the fact that Al knew better than both of them was kind of silly but I did like the dynamic of the two FBI agents and the way they fit into the movie as a bunch of idiots but it was almost a little too much. The humor they tried to inject with the black guy who was cracking the vault was a little dry but not to the point where I hated him. The limo driver's smile got annoying too but I liked his character for the most part. Bruce Willis did a perfect job with the character and played him perfect. I like action films like this where there is unnecessary swearing and violence but it works and I hate how Hollywood is making a lot of action films with a pg13 rating when i think it would be so much more enjoyable with just letting them swear and be really violent. I know one does not need the violence but I think it does so much more for the movie experience by letting the characters express themselves with their violence. The last gripe I have is that the ending with Karl jumping up out of nowhere was totally unnecessary and it really annoyed me. The cop did not need a complete arc and John's and his hug was all the ending needed. This will probably always be one of the my favorite action films.".

	schema:headline " Was there Action Films before Die Hard?? Who cares!! Die Hard is the patriarch of modern action.";
	schema:reviewBody "Of course the Action Genre existed before Die Hard. After all you had The Terminator Commando Top Gun Roadhouse...but didn't Die Hard absolutely revolutionize the eighties action Genre. It came like a savior and encompassed everything that would blow you right out the back of the theater and made Bruce Willis an absolute idol in the Action world and for good reason. Die Hard had pointless nudity scores of bad language bloody death guns explosions a gritty tough as nails sweating dirty hero that takes on everyone with nothing more than a hand gun and his brains. If you watch Willis in Die Hard it's a thing of beauty. His shirt torn off bare foot wounds all over him...he looks like he just crawled from a war rather than stalking terrorists through an enormous high rise office building in L.A. The script was so dead on...it was basic it was to the point it has great sarcastic humor and one liners that could never be forgotten. And Willis was the man to pull it all together. Add a decent supporting cast a guy on the ground who is like his partner and a MacGyver style of killing bad guys that will go down in history...THIS IS DIE HARD.Bruce Willis was brought up right in the Prime of his TV Series Moonlighting where his irresistible charm and personality made him a hit. John McLean was David Addison but with a lot more guts and a lot more ammo. That only made the film more exciting to fans of Willis already. Willis has a way of just making everything edge of your seat and everything believable. Who else could make you smile in fear when he's diving out of a 30 story window attached to a fire hose while the roof of the building is exploding. He really doesn't single handedly make the film...the supporting cast is terrific. Bonnie Bedelia is great as McLean's straight laced professional and estranged wife. They make an odd yet touching couple. They have some electricity and it's ironic and yet sensible that they don't end up together throughout the series. Still Bedelia is a great female lead and her character is strong and not at all misused in the role. Alan Rickman is just one kick ass bad guy. Can you say anything else?? As terrorist Hans Gruber he is terrifying evil brilliant and you just despise him and you can't wait to see him go up against Willis and he does. He doesn't stand a chance but Rickman is still brilliant as the bad guy. Reginald VelJohnson plays a small yet very important role as Willis' guy on the ground on the other end of a walkie talkie. They don't know each other and barely know each other's name but yet they become as close as partners and they too are odd together and yet fit. William Atherton has to be mentioned even though it's a very small role it's Die Hard history that he plays slimy tabloid reporter Richard Thornburg who gets his just end by Holly McLean's fist which becomes a running joke in the series.Die Hard is everything that people would look at in disgust now in the new millennium and yet it was everything the eighties stood for when it came to action and heroes. McLean has a cigarette dangling from his mouth blood pouring everywhere and a happy ending despite all the destruction around them. If you haven't seen Die Hard you can't ever proclaim yourself an action fan because Die Hard IS action. It's the film every action film strives to live to and will never meet...whether it was before 1988 or after. We won't ever get something like this again. It's an absolute 100 classic!! for all the wrong reasons!! 1010".

They make an odd yet touching couple. They have some electricity and it's ironic and yet sensible that they don't end up together throughout the series. Still Bedelia is a great female lead and her character is strong and not at all misused in the role. Alan Rickman is just one kick ass bad guy. Can you say anything else?? As terrorist Hans Gruber he is terrifying evil brilliant and you just despise him and you can't wait to see him go up against Willis and he does. He doesn't stand a chance but Rickman is still brilliant as the bad guy. Reginald VelJohnson plays a small yet very important role as Willis' guy on the ground on the other end of a walkie talkie. They don't know each other and barely know each other's name but yet they become as close as partners and they too are odd together and yet fit. William Atherton has to be mentioned even though it's a very small role it's Die Hard history that he plays slimy tabloid reporter Richard Thornburg who gets his just end by Holly McLean's fist which becomes a running joke in the series.Die Hard is everything that people would look at in disgust now in the new millennium and yet it was everything the eighties stood for when it came to action and heroes. McLean has a cigarette dangling from his mouth blood pouring everywhere and a happy ending despite all the destruction around them. If you haven't seen Die Hard you can't ever proclaim yourself an action fan because Die Hard IS action. It's the film every action film strives to live to and will never meet...whether it was before 1988 or after. We won't ever get something like this again. It's an absolute 100 classic!! for all the wrong reasons!! 1010";

Alan Rickman was the right actor to play as Hans Gruber the way how he did that German ascent. As soon John accidentally killed Karl's brother during their fight all things broke lose with him the part when Karl said  I want blood. The only part was so stupid was when Ellis trying to be a hero claiming to be John's friend. Ellis should of known that Hans was really going to kill him. I liked the way how John handled the terrorist situation as a New York cop. Reginald Veljohnson played as Sargent Al Powell stole the movie too. Such as the way how Sargent Powell trusted John Mcclane standing up for himself against Executive Chief Duane T. Robinsonincluding in the ending when held up his gun and shot down Karl. I also like the part when John and Hans finally met when Hans was acting like a hostage and claiming that he works for Neketomi. I think that was a challenging part for the director to put those two together. The best fight in Die Hard was John and Karl I enjoyed that fight.

They had the most unreal stunts and crazy over the top action sequences that you could imagine at the time and they were and still are great fun. However they usually lacked three vital ingredients1. A sense of realism meaning the hero is only human and can get hurt2. Grit messy unpolished action dirty people and LOTS of swearing3. Rrated violence showing the audience what real weapons do to the human bodyWell it took John McTiernan to bring those three key elements together in 'Die Hard'  and thus the modern action film was born it had a good run through the late eighties until the end of the nineties  then the studios figured out they could maximise the boxoffice by taming down the swearing violence and sex and thus alas the contemporary toothless PG13 action film was born. Sure there have been a couple of others before McTiernan's masterpiece 'First Blood' 'Terminator' 'Predator'  which was also by McTiernan  or 'Lethal Weapon' and probably some more but those films could have fallen into any number of other categories as well 'AdventureSurvivalWar' 'Sci Fi' 'Horror' or 'Buddymovie'  and I can't think of another film that was just such a relentless pureactionfromthebeginningtotheend film as was 'Die Hard'.

	schema:reviewBody "In the Sixties author Roderick Thorp wrote a novel The Detective which was turned into a movie starring Frank Sinatra in the title role of Joe Leland. A sequel was written in which Joe becomes trapped in the Claxxon Oil Corporation skyscraper after it is taken over by German terrorists and he has to rescue his daughter and grandchildren. Two decades later the skyscraper becomes Nakatomi the daughter becomes the wife Leland becomes John McClane and the title becomes Die Hard.To say that Die Hard sets new standards for action movies is like calling Bill Gates well off. The movie was so innovative and groundbreaking that dozens of ripoffs followed  Passenger 57 Under Siege Cliffhanger Sudden Death et al. Hostageterrorist movies were all the rage in the early Nineties.Very few came close because Die Hard had so many strong points not least of which was Alan Rickman's marvellous performance as Hans Gruber  also the name of the villain in Our Man Flint  the classically educated smartly dressed terrorist leader. This is not some hammy guy in a chainmail shirt with spikes on his gloves Commando. Gruber would have been well at home on Wall Street.His plan is to break into the vault on the 30th floor of the Nakatomi Plaza and take away 640million in negotiable bearer bonds. When he and his 12 European henchmen round up the office workers who are enjoying a Christmas Eve party one man slips away unnoticed. He is John McClane a New York cop who has come to LA to settle down with his estranged wife Holly Bonnie Bedelia. The odds are against him. But that's just the way he likes it.The terrorists even have names. And we remember them. Most action movies these days have unidentified heavies played by stunt men who are lined up and knocked over.In his battle to save his Holly McClane is scorched torched beaten and blown up. He jumps off the roof and falls through air ducts. He uncovers deception and doublecross and picks broken glass out of his bare feet. No help comes from the naive and incompetent police who are unable to get inside and even less from the FBI.McClane is not a supercop. He is an ordinary guy who doesn't want a fight. When he is shot he bleeds. He hurts. All he has are his pants his vest his gun  which runs out of ammo. This is the first realistic connection the audience has. When you don't want to be in McClane's position it makes for much excitement.John McTiernan who's only previous mainstream movie was Predator uses awesome photography and technical skills to give the film a truly polished and sophisticated look  it was nominated for four technical Academy Awards. He also allows for enough time for decent character development most of which comes between McClane and a cop Reginald Veljohnson he makes friends with on a CB radio.Die Hard manages to be heartpounding and teethgritting every single time. And if you are one of those many people who have only ever been able to watch it on TV then now is definitely the time to rediscover a cool classic and creative action picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "Quite possibly the best modern action movie since the classic Dirty Harry Die Hard simply rocks. Based on the interesting novel Nothing Lasts Forever by Roderick Thorp Die Hard made headlines for its combination of a terrific cast excellent script amazing action sequences and superb direction.  Headed up by screen favorite Bruce Willis The Sixth Sense Die Hard also features the talented Alan Rickman Galaxy Quest and Bonnie Bedelia Needful Things.  Directed by action veteran John McTiernan the mastermind behind such action spectaculars as Predator The Hunt For Red October The Thomas Crown Affair 1999 and Die Hard With A Vengeance.In the role that shot him to stardom Willis plays Detective John McClane a hardhitting cop from New York on Christmas Vacation in LA.  He is there to visit his wife whom he is separated from Holly Gennaro who recently got a great job working for the Nakatomi corporation and has permanently moved to Los Angeles with their two children.  John arrives at Nakatomi Plaza expecting a fun Christmas party and a relaxing night.  Man was he wrong!  A few minutes after getting settled twelve guntoting Eastern Europeans take the entire 30th floor hostage.  The supposed terrorists are headed up by the brilliant megalomaniac Hans Gruber Rickman who actually wants the 640 million dollars inside the floor's vault.  Somehow McClane escapes upstairs armed only with a handgun and starts causing a ruckus slowly hunting down each wellequipped thug.Die Hard succeeds is because it presents every challenge McClane has to face realistically and clearly.  As the tension mounts the ordeals for John become increasingly harder.  First it's just a terrorist.  Then a whole slew of them.  Later it's the NYPD and even the FBI!  Director McTiernan gives the film a good pace and makes the film work by showing that John isn't superhuman he only uses his brain more than his gun.  Also screenwriters Jeb Stuart The Fugitive  Steven E. De Souza 48 Hrs. add touches of humor that lighten up the viewer and classic oneliners YippyKiYay ! that ignite the screen.  Their subplots actually add to the story instead of overcomplicating it especially one featuring good cop Sgt. Al Powell Rejinald VelJohnson of TV's Family Matters.Overall this movie was awesome.  Willis is very believable and has significant screen presence.  Character development is superb and even though Stuart and De Souza leave some loose ends untied  like how  a man gets hung with a chain and still comes back for more  the film remains to be an action classic.  Note to Parents the nudity drug use continual profanity and extreme violence would make this a bad choice for kids under 13.  Otherwise see Die Hard ASAP! Overall Rating    Worth 9 out of 10 dollars ".

	schema:headline " Die Hard Best Action Movie I've Ever Seen!";
	schema:reviewBody "Die HardI saw this movie a few years ago and never wrote a review on it. I've found the quintessence of action movies. This is the single greatest action movie I've ever seen. My usual formula follows.Plot The plot is simple. A NYPD cop named John McClane goes to Los Angeles to visit his wife Holly who works at Nakatomi Plaza. Later terrorists take over the building and John with his sidearm is forced to take them on. This movie has many twists and always keeps the pace moving.Acting The acting in this movie is the best I've ever seen in an action movie. Bruce Willis stars as John McClane with a stunning performance. He shows stress fear bravado and creates a fallible hero who makes mistakes and is vulnerable as well. Alan Rickman in his movie debut gives the performance of his life as Hans Gruber. Creating the perfect action villain he even surpasses Bruce Willis in my opinion. No one gave a bad performance in this movie everyone played their part.Action This movie is the pure quintessence of the action movie genre. This movie didn't create the action genre but it evolved it. It made a new kind of hero who was fallible made mistakes and was more human. It also made a new kind of villain in the form of Hans Gruber. He was a villain who liked to let his goons do the dirty work for him most of the time but at times did it himself.Although this movie has mistakes that we notice easily we must remember every movie has those. It should not break your praise of the movie. This is a movie I define as a masterpiece of movies. A masterpiece of the genre is something that mostly only the fans of the genre will like and a few outside. A masterpiece of movies is a movie that even people who don't generally like the genre will like.So I say if you love action movies and haven't seen this yet what are you waiting for get this now. If you don't like action movies that much then still see it. I say that for every 10 people who see it at least 8 to 9 people will love it.1010".

The problem with most movies like this is either that you from the beginning know how it will end or that it takes a unbelievable turn that makes you cry out in pain. Well of course you know that the good guy will end up in victory even this timespoiler? but everything is so freaking well done. The action scenes is explosive and extremely well directed and Alan Rickman as the bad Germanguy is so cool I actually sometimes hoped he would win.I hear a lot that Bruce Willis is just another movie hero without any skills in acting but hey the man can act. He may not be a Brando but he knows how to do his job and here he does it real good. I also think that the location of the story is very thrilling a skyscraper where the characters plays hide and seek in the elevators and ventilators.As a action movie I rank this as the best just above other classics as FaceOff The Rock and The Untouchables. 55".

The best part of this film is it's ages really well you would think it was made only yesterday it has one of the biggest stars in history of films Bruce Willis.OK so on to the film it starts like any other film and sets the scene for what is a roller coaster ride that will leave you wanting more at the end. In the beginning we see John Mcclane Bruce Willis on a plane on his way to Los Angeles the reason he is going there is to meet his wife Holly Bonnie Bedelia who looks really attractive in this film and it's Christmas Eve.He goes to the Nakatomi Corporation building which is where Holly works to see her and be there for his kids who he hasn't seen in a while but during the time there he has abit of a fight with her and she gets called to give a talk anyway John is in the bathroom insulting himself in the way how Bruce Willis does and he ends up taking his shoes off the person who he is sat next to on the plane says the best way to get over flying is to take your shoes off and walk bear foot and make fists with your toes...personally never tired it. During the time little does he know that a group of terrorists are planning on taking over the building this all happens in the first 20 minutes or so.The film then really starts to go into its own as we follow an average police officer from New York in LA trying to just to get home for Christmas still more about this film. Upon noticing that the building is being taken over by terrorists John escapes and heads to the top floor with work is still going on and sets off the fire alarm in an attempt to get the police there. When the terrorists find out that hes set the fire alarm off from the top floor they phone the police and tell them that its nothing to worry about and send someone up to kill him John pleased with his attempt to get back up there looks out the window and swears at them for coming to his aid then notices they turn around.At this point they send someone up to take him out and the person ends up getting killed John having a wicked sense of humour on both levels of the word sends the dead body down the lift and takes as much as he can like the machine gun and cigarettes as you do when your in that sort of situation and tries on the shoes only to find they are too small. He also writes an amusing note on the persons jumper meanwhile hes in the lift above the one that stopped taking notes on what hes up against.Later on John goes to the roof of the building to transmit a cry for help to the police and has a fairly amusing conversation on to the police anyway at this time he gets cut off due to being attacked by the other terrorists and they choose to send a police officer to search to see if John was telling the truth anyway the terrorists and John are having a shoot out in one of the offices and to get the attention John uses his head he throws the body out of the window.Now that he has some help the film moves onto a new level and the action increases more as police road bloke outside and the FBI get involved the scale of this film which by the way was made in 1988 starts to show. As John gets in situations and the action increases and has loads of twists and turns.In my view this film has everything to be one of the best if not they best film out there the scale of it is amazing and the cast is true great. Words cant really describe this film you really have to watch it but the film does leave you wanting more and does leave you wanting to watch the next one in the series. I could talk for days about this film and it's action sequences from the very small gun fights to the massive C4 explosion and the plot which doesn't seem to lose it's appeal even after watching it infinite times and also it's feel good factor at the end when John is back with Holly and they are in the snow lets face it you knew they would live but it's got something that does make you want to watch it over and over. If they made more films like this then people would probably remember what cinema is about and we may have really memorable hero's like we use to.This film should be a benchmark for ever other film that is out there trying to be an action film with a strong story lets face it on paper it's a simple story terrorists want a building for money they take it over then John gets caught up in this mess...it's not hard really.But then maybe people like it because it's simple however I think they like it or i I like it because it's so original and has never been done before even Die Hard 2 and 3 they push the idea of films harder and further than before. They go that one more to make it fun and try to make the story still remain simple. It's one film you have to watch and it really should be in the top 250 on IMDb.".

	schema:headline " Hooray for decent more realistic spy films!";
	schema:reviewBody "I have grown extremely tired of the typical formula spy film like Bond or the juvenile stunt exhibition Triple X. There have been a bare handful of spy films that feature relatively realistic spy thrillers especially recently with a concentration on spectacular movies that have less substance than cotton candy.Besides The Bourne Identity Ronin is the only other recent spy movie I can think of that didn't feature skydiving bungie jumping skiing downhill while shooting innumerable bad guys laser pens cars with ejection seats or silicone breasted women with names you'd be vaguely embarrassed to say in front of your mother. Most of the crap that passes for an espionage film has no plot or reason for existing other than to meet a quota of explosions and cleavage in order to draw the summer action film crowd.While Bourne does not have a particularly deep plot it is consistent and focused. The focus is entirely upon Bourne and how he is to deal with having no memory of his past being hunted without knowing why. Some people have complained about being confused by the movie. I for one do not need to have everything spelled out since in many cases this smacks of unreality in the first place the essence of espionage is drawing conclusions from very sketchy information. If you can't handle a little of that you probably should stick to Disney films or TV's Scooby Doo where everything is explained in the end. We never find out about what is in the case in Ronin and I can live without some information being filled in about Bourne's past.To those who have moaned about the incompatibility of the book and the movie seek help. There are probably several things that work in the book that would either be boring and take too much screen time to explain or would be viewed as cliche to modern screen audiences. As I remember I liked the book and I definitely like this movie. I view any movie adaptation as an interpretation of the book rather than a translation from words to pictures anyway.As for realism most of the action scenes are believable no supergadgets are to be seen no incredibly lovely models fall madly in bed with Bourne and the hero shows definite signs of physical vulnerability despite a very high level of training and competance. As someone who has trained in martial arts for over 10 years unrealistic fight scenes are a pet peeve. The fights in Bourne are fast nasty and very realistic while still being entertaining for the layman. And yes taking a gun away from some idiot who is standing well within your striking radius without getting shot is definitely doable though I had serious doubts until we tested it for ourselves with plastic dart guns in the dojo several years ago.While not being perfect The Bourne Identity is simply put several grades above the typical spy film. Being focused on an individual level rather than involving itself huge political ramifications lends it another layer of respectability rather than detracting from it as some comments have implied since it remains a human problem on a comprehensible scale. The mysteries that are left are bigger mysteries for Bourne than us and I think should be viewed as intentional omissions rather than loose ends. The implausibilities are kept to a minimum and the realism to as high a level as possible while still being spectacular enough to meet the expectations of the genre.".

Gone or almost gone are the special effects that James and Ethan rely on all too heavily. Hell in those franchises the special effects have virtually replaced story and characters. The Bourne Identity has a very straightforward story to tell a mystery that slowly unravels. Spycraft is not all about technical gizmos but requires human brains and human brawn and a fair amount of gunplay and car chases. Set in various locales in Switzerland and France during the winter much of the visuals for The Bourne Identity are gray and damp. That's a plus Monte Carlo and like locales can get boring. Mat Damon is great as Jason Bourne fished from the Mediterranean mostly dead by gunshot wounds. A total amnesiac he slowly realizes that he possesses the deadly skills of a welltrained assassin and that someone is out to kill him. Franka Potente is equally good as the young woman swept up in his life and forced to run with him. Run or be killed.I can't say enough good things about this movie.

Normally you see the super hero using all kinds of weird gadgets driving extremely fast sports cars and sleeping with ladies who look more like prostitutes than being normal women.Jason Bourne however doesn't have all this things which makes this movie a lot more realistic. The fights are fast and very realistic but still entertaining. The action scenes are believable no supergadgets no incredibly willing women sharing his bed... Our hero even shows definite signs of physical vulnerability despite a very high level of training and competence. In the meanwhile he has to deal with amnesia while being hunted without knowing why. In the end this is still a man which you can identify yourself with.I would say Go watch it when you are a fan of movies like Ronin don't watch it if you think James Bond is a person who you can bump into on the streets when going out. Personally I would award this movie with an 810.".

One reviewer states it's a good movie based on a completely false occurrence that being amnesia in general. They say it doesn't exist and nobody loses their memory of their identity while retaining knowledge of everything else. This is untrue. I am currently studying to become a psychologist it's called Dissociative Amnesia. Dissociative Amnesia  formerly Psychogenic Amnesia is a pervasive loss of memory of significant personal information. This disorder is characterized by a blocking out of critical personal information. Dissociative amnesia unlike other types of amnesia does not result from other medical trauma such as a blow to the head. The predominant disturbance is one or more episodes of inability to recall important personal information usually of a traumatic or stressful nature that is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness  Just to prove it's true and does happen. So this movie is not based on something made up similar losses of memory do happen to people. Especially people in a job such as that. So concluding this is a great action film I truly enjoyed this movie along with the sequel The Bourne Supremacy. Both are I think going to be a couple of the best movies we will see this decade 20002010".

The 'body' indeed is not dead but unconscious he is Jason Bourne Matt Dammon a CIA secret and very well prepared agent with amnesia. During the period of fishing in the sea he recovers his health. Once on shore he decides to go to the Swiss bank and then to the American Consulate. There he meets Marie Helena Kreutz Franka Potente from 'Run Lola Run' and 'Anatomy' and they two together will pass to the most spectacular actions along the film. The great Matt Dammon and Franka Potente are perfect. This movie is everything that 'Tripple X' and 'Die Another Day' intended to be and did not offer to the viewer a nonstop and excellent action film. Fortunately this screenplay was not in the hands of Tom Cruise otherwise he would like to perform the role of Jason Bourne and spoil this film as usual. It is amazing the filmography of Matt Dammon. This great actor knows how to select good screenplays. I am not familiarized with the filmography of Franka Potente  I believe most of them has not been released on VHS or DVD in Brazil but in 'Run Lola Run' and 'Anatomy' I liked her performance very much. One thing that called my attention along this movie was her perfect accent in English with the exception of the 'sh....' expressions in German. The great Chris Cooper and Julia Stiles perform secondary roles along this outstanding action movie. My vote is nine.Title Brazil A Identidade Bourne The Bourne Identity".

	schema:reviewBody "While the action genre is as believable and formulaic as an NSync song The Bourne Identity takes a much needed step to the side to watch oncoming traffic. Subtle yet still holding true to multiple action formulas lots of fighting cool weaponry and chase scenes this film presents a new era of action film making which could be all the wave. Matt Damon who has the unfortunate nature of watching his less talented friend Ben Affleck gain notoriety for trash movies is an excellent choice as the CIA operative turned amnesiac Jason Bourne. His presence is both believable and realistic like he is some guy who looks like a bookworm. While the film's cinematography was rather average there are moments in the film which presents actual anxiety. The viewer knows something is coming yet the genuine far exhibited by the characters makes those moments so interesting. I thought this would be some average action but I walked away amazed. Franka Potente played the role of Marie perfectly even though some prettier and less talented actress could have been placed in this film. Kudos to the producers for the casting choice. 7.410".

Cooper Cox and Owen shine in their alltoobrief screen time. Potente is attractive in a real person sort of way sigh of relief for this genre and possesses an inner strength that makes her character's actions and reactions ring truer than what we'd get from the traditional Hollywood eyecandy girlfriend these films normally feature.From the gritty bowels of the trawler where Damon awakens to his situation to the field where he confronts his most deadly assailant the locations are the antithesis of the travel poster hotspots that Bond so frequently visits. Despite its breakneck pace handled so well by Liman and so poorly in the sequel by his protg the film manages to convey a sense of melancholy that lifts it a bit above the average action thriller. Sorry book fans  it may not be your cup of Ludlum but it's still a damn fine little action flick.".

I know its a cliche but why would this movie reinvent the medium anyway? I also like car chases through foreign cities passports and accents.  So with all that intact I liked 'The Bourne Identity' very much.  It has all the elements of the genre.  You know what you're getting and you get what you want. There is no point in going over the plot.  It gets confusing about 34 in but it does not matter that much.  Its fun for two hours and that's it.I have been a huge fan of Franka Potente since becoming mildly obsessed with 'Run Lola Run' and she does not disappoint.  She has some real chemistry with Matt Damon and has a very sweet inviting way about her.  She is not traditional leading actress material thank God and I credit the producers for hiring her.  Even more so when you realize that Julia Stiles has a small part in this movie.  I am sure someone wanted a bigger 'name' to be Matt's female lead and it might have occured to more than one exec to switch Franka and Julia but obviously I am glad that did not happen.Clive Owen adds another strong performance to his resume.  He has only one big scene really but makes the most of it.  Chris Cooper and Brian Cox are known for their sturdy work and they also deliver here.Excellent summertime entertainment.  810.".

There's plenty of thrilling action sequences and there's also the addition of brains to counterbalance the brawn. Matt Damon who was an unlikely choice as the spy Jason Bourne completely redefined the movie spy for the millennium and made himself and his character a household name. Based on the best selling novel of the same name by Robert Ludlum The Bourne Identity was one of the most successful movies of 2002 which spawned several successful sequels.The movie begins with Jason Bourne Matt Damon Good Will Hunting being rescued by Italian fishermen after being found in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea with two gunshots in his back. While being nursed back to full health Bourne wakes up with no memory of who he is and how he was found but is fluent in several languages and highly proficient in unarmed combat. finds himself capable of advanced combat skills and fluency in several languages. The only lead Bourne can act on is a tiny laser projector under his hip which gives a number of a safe deposit box in Zurich. After he visits the bank in Zurich he finds a large sum of money various passports and a handgun. The visit to the bank alerts black ops CIA director Alexander Conklin Chris Cooper Adaptation who is in charge of Operation Treadstone. As Conklin and Deputy Director Ward Abbott Brian Cox Manhunter spearhead the operation to take down Bourne who is believed to have gone rogue Bourne enlists the help of German woman Marie Kreutz Franka Potente Run Lola Run to initially drive him to Paris with a sum of money but finds herself being caught up in the middle of the secretive plot. While Bourne slowly uncovers how he found himself in his current situation and who he really is he also uncovers the conspiracy to see through that he is not to be taken alive.Matt Damon won critical acclaim for he previous roles in Good Will Hunting 1997 and Saving Private Ryan 1998. Here in The Bourne Identity his career kicks into another gear as super spy Jason Bourne who also has cemented a well deserved spot as one of the greatest characters amongst such names as James Bond Rambo Terminator and John McClane to name a few. It's hard to believe Matt Damon was an unlikely casting choice but now Jason Bourne is one of Matt Damon's best roles.The rest of the supporting cast round out the movie well such as Franka Potente Chris Cooper Brian Cox Clive Owen Julia Stiles another unlikely casting choice and Adewale AkinnuoyeAgbaje. Keep an eye out for Walton Goggins The Shield Gabriel Mann Revenge and Josh Hamilton American Horror Story.Director Doug Liman was also an unlikely choice as director following his work in indie movies such as Swingers 1996 and Go 1999 but here his work has worked wonders.The Bourne Identity spawned several blockbusting sequels however giving credit where its due The Bourne Identity was the movie that started it all and made its permanent mark. Putting a lot of no brainer action movies to shame The Bourne Identity is more of a thinking man's action movie with spectacular stunts and more twists and turns than a roller coaster ride. Even after Moby's Extreme Ways plays during the end credits you still find yourself glued to your seat. The Bourne Identity is still an entertaining action movie from start to finish.910.".

Within its niche loosely actionspyamnesia it may end up being one of the greatest ever watchable and entertaining over and over...I think I have seen this more than 10 times putting it up there with Fistful of Dollars and Godfather. The pedigree is astonishing. Ludlum was not respected in his lifetime but he sure sold a lot of books. Interestingly Bourne had ALREADY emerged as the most popular of his works long before the film adaption was attempted. While not breakthrough  amnesia stories have been done to death especially in the 1940s  the combination of the memory issue and the assassin twist essentially put the story over the top. There were written sequels rare for Ludlum and posthumous attempts to revive the character in new novels very rare!.This 2002 film was serendipity. Gilroy a veteran did one of the leanest adaptations ever. His writing is genius. The film moves through progressive action arcs so eloquently the viewer does not even realize what is happening. Consider the arc where the Bourne character takes out Clive Owen's counterassassin. It's almost brusque. On the news that the dog is not responding Bourne goes into action like a tiny Terminator. Not a second of screen time is wasted. How many films can make the same claim? Damon is an excellent actor but the argument can be made that he did too good a job with Bourne hence his refusal to appear in the last film. Arguably he was too young for the part as written but props to director Liman for going with him anyway. That decision made film history.The supporting cast is brilliant. Cooper and Cox as supporting characters? R U Kidding me? Wow.The criticism can be made not by me but it can be made that Potente does not inject enough feminine energy she mainly reacts never acts which probably explains the overemphasis on the Pam Landy character in the two sequels. Which works well. But the truth is this is a man's action film and one of the best ever so the director had latitude.And poor Clive Owen. In of the great ironies of cinema his action scene became a metaphor for his Alist career. At the time the common wisdom was that he was the next big thing. Didn't happen.Highly recommended. The sequel is serviceable but not a standout. The final part of the trilogy is satisfying but lacks magic. Any future films without Damon are to be scrupulously avoided.".

Not a second of screen time is wasted. How many films can make the same claim? Damon is an excellent actor but the argument can be made that he did too good a job with Bourne hence his refusal to appear in the last film. Arguably he was too young for the part as written but props to director Liman for going with him anyway. That decision made film history.The supporting cast is brilliant. Cooper and Cox as supporting characters? R U Kidding me? Wow.The criticism can be made not by me but it can be made that Potente does not inject enough feminine energy she mainly reacts never acts which probably explains the overemphasis on the Pam Landy character in the two sequels. Which works well. But the truth is this is a man's action film and one of the best ever so the director had latitude.And poor Clive Owen. In of the great ironies of cinema his action scene became a metaphor for his Alist career. At the time the common wisdom was that he was the next big thing. Didn't happen.Highly recommended. The sequel is serviceable but not a standout. The final part of the trilogy is satisfying but lacks magic. Any future films without Damon are to be scrupulously avoided.";

	schema:reviewBody "After seeing trailers and commercials for The Bourne Legacy which comes out August 10th I had to watch the trilogy as soon as it releases in theaters. I heard a lot of great things about the trilogy especially with The Bourne Identity. So I decided to get the trilogy for Christmas and today I sat down watched The Bourne Identity and I extremely enjoyed it. I thought it was a fantastic start to the Bourne trilogy.STORY A man's Matt Damon body has been recovered from the Mediterranean Sea by fishermen. When he is saved however he remembers absolutely nothing from his life including his name. So that means he has amnesia. When he starts to remember some details from his life he finds out that his name is Jason Bourne. He and his new friend Marie Franka Potente go on the run from someone who's trying to hunt him down so he could try to search for his identity.MY THOUGHTS The actionfight sequences were the main qualities that made this movie great. They were wellexecuted wellchoreographed wellshot wellpaced and all in all very welldone. The direction by Doug Liman was excellent. He knows how to direct a scene that was fastpaced and it keeps people on the edge of their seat. This movie is full of twists and turns so if you haven't seen the movie yet and feel like you need to be prepared to pay attention.THE ACTING Matt Damon does an outstanding job playing the hero Jason Bourne. I think he was more believable as a hero than Ethan Hunt in Mission Impossible although I liked Ethan Hunt. Damon's fighting choreography  which were basically martial arts fighting moves  they were pretty impressive and make the movie worth watching. Bourne is very intelligent he can speak in many different languages whenever he's in a different country and he's also violent like many other action heroes. Franka Potente does great playing Marie a woman who Bourne meets at a bank in Switzerland and he decides to bring her so they could get away from the CIA.The supporting cast features Chris Cooper Clive Owen Julia Stiles and Adewale AkinnuoyeAgbaje Mr. Eko from Lost. I think the best supporting actor in this movie is Chris Cooper as the head of Treadstone at the CIA headquarters who's tracking down Bourne.IN CONCLUSION I thought The Bourne Identity was a great start to the Bourne trilogy. It was intense fastpaced wellacted especially from Matt Damon and very entertaining.1010".

	schema:headline " Finally! A movie that can stand without excessive special effects.";
	schema:reviewBody "I enjoy the great special effects of movies such as the Star Wars series and other action packed movies such as the Die Hard and James Bond films but the special effects are just as much a part of the plot and story lines as the writing. It is refreshing to watch a film that does not rely on excessive special effects to tell its story. The Bourne Identity 2002 is one such film. The Bourne Identity stars Matt Damon as Jason Bourne a man found shot and lying in the ocean by fisherman who has lost his memory. He struggles to regain his strength on the ship and he tries to piece his life back together. He hits a dead end and finds that he must leave the boat. Bourne has a bank account number that leads him to a safety deposit box filled with money and fake passports. Bourne realizes that he must be a secret agent for some country. He hooks up with Marie played by Franka Potente. As it turns out Jason Bourne was a secret agent who was shot because he did not fulfill his mission to Assassinate Wombasi an African Leader played by Adewale AkinnouyeAbaje. There were agents who planned to kill Bourne because he has now been considered a rogue agent. One familiar face Julia Stiles plays Nicolette an agent in an operator type position. There was also the agent played by Clive Owen the Professor who was one of the agents sent to hunt Borne down and kill him. Packed with action and suspense this film is wonderfully shot. There were flash cuts in certain action packed parts of the film. Also during the action there was minimal music playing in the background to add to the realistic feel to the film. I can say that I enjoyed watching a film that did not need to blast techno or other type of music to express the action of the film. The use of less sound made the film enjoyable. You can concentrate on the action on the screen and not worry about who made the song and other things that can be distracting when watching a film. These flash cuts and the use of less music added a dramatic feel to the film because Borne can be a real person this can happen to any agent who defies the government and choose not to follow orders. They can be hunted down!".

Like the book the movie is also good. Perhaps it is the excellent cinematography of France  it captured the clichd images I imagined when I read the book. The acting is surprisingly good as well. Not many people know that The Bourne Identity' is the second film to be based on Ludlum's novel see the TV version starring Jaclyn Smith and Richard Chamberlain from 1988 but the newer 2002 version is much better and definitely worth wasting your money on.Matt Damon pulls off the character of Jason Bourne with ease while Franka Potente does not disappoint. Chris Cooper has fun with his role and a small role by Julia Stiles surprises.There is a great car chase in this film. Fans of the Seventies and Eightiestype genres will love this movie. It has the feel of a classy thriller and never resorts to stupidity instead smarts or action instead of plot.Of course many things had to be dropped from the book to make this film. That is only expected. But I'm glad they didn't butcher' this movie up like some other booktofilm movies.Overall The Bourne Identity' is not a great movie but it sure is good as well as surprising. Very much so in fact. 45 stars John Ulmer".

At the beginning of the movie Bourne is unable to recall his identity or the purpose of his mission. As the viewers are also unaware of this it allows us to see the world from his point of view. I believe that this generates a much greater impact than knowing beforehand the identity of Jason Bourne.For the majority of the movie Jason Bourne struggles to remember anything about his past which is well executed by Matt Damon's acting. The CIA plan to capture him and the whole movie is essentially a battle between Jason Bourne and the CIA.Technically all aspects of the movie is quite impressive. A car chase sequence in particular is pulled off with consummate skill. Due to a runtime of just over two hours the movie keeps you hooked and the strong writing enables the film to never lose traction.I would highly recommend watching this movie as it is not a mere caricature of some other wellknown spy thrillers.

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of James Bond but acknowledging its campiness clichs and formulas it was extremely refreshing to see a true spyaction movie with a movie star I already respected but never thought could pull it off Matt Damon. Damon did a superb job as Jason Bourne in The Bourne Identity as did the rest of the cast. You rooted for him sympathized with him and despite the past you soon learn to question you still wanted him to succeed. Bourne is found without a memory in the ocean by fishermen who attempt to help the young man by dropping him off with a little bit of cash near a place Switzerland where he might regain his identity. There he learns of extraordinary fighting skills he was unaware of and meets the soontobe and obvious love of his life Marie. Both try and piece his past together while formulating a future together albeit on the run from a mysterious Treadstone organization. The action when shown is intense the intrigue storyline is not only plausible but ontheedge of your seat exciting and the cinematography is stunning  I must visit Paris France soon. The only flaws I can find though I didn't look for them was the obvious pairing of Marie and Bourne their inevitable sex scene and Marie's accent and languages that jumped from one culture to the next. Other than those minor defects this was a wonderful suspenseful and crafty movie. I absolutely loved them reverting as they did with the asgood sequels from CGI and made me believe in action again and not the green screen. Also despite knowing there was more than one book this was based upon and knowing sequels were in the works I loved this was a completely stand alone feature and is absolutely recommended.".

Art has a way to warn express or simply entertain in a way that its relevance will always be renewed. That opening with George C Scott's secretary in her underwear answering the phone for her boss in the most professional tone imaginable is a masterful way to introduce us to the normal absurdity we're about to embark on. Terry Southern's extraordinary script sharing credit with Peter George and Stanley Kubrick himself is a masterpiece of intention and execution. The film doesn't have a moment of emptiness nor a single cheap shot. Everything works with the irrational logic of tradition and set standards. How can something so serious and ultimately terrifying can be so funny. I think that's the definition of film art. I don't want to sound pompous but that's exactly how I feel. I've seen a 1966 movie by Stanley Kubrick in 2017 that's better more relevant ingenious and even revolutionary than anything we've seen in a long long time. Peter Sellers fantastic three times over and he was also going to play the Slim Pickens part George C Scott in one of the greatest comic performances ever put on film and Sterling Hayden in a frighteningly credible show of abuse of power complete the pleasures of this remarkable film.".

This film came out at a height of paranoia of the nuclear age and the Cold War right around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. This film depicts a horrible tragic incident in which a breach in the government and a few diplomatic mistakes result in nuclear holocaust. So why didn't this film inspire panic? Because of the brilliant way in which Kubrick presents it... as a satire. The scariest thing about this film in retrospect is not how it depicts the impending doom of the Cold War but how it makes you laugh at it. By presenting it with humor it conveys just how much of a farce the nuclear arms race was in real life. And I don't think that any other film has captured the absurdity of war nearly as well as this one has. And I am not likely to believe that one ever will. In my opinion Kubrick has never made a better film since. And kudos to George C. Scott for his astounding performance as well as Peter Sellers for the most versatile acting I've seen from an actor in one film and to Sterling Hayden for performing the most serious yet the most hilarious role in film with perfect accuracy.

	schema:reviewBody "Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is cited as one of the director's best films and one of if not the best satirical comedy in cinema history and with very good reason.Dr. Strangelove exceeds exponentially in many ways the three main being the direction writing and the unforgettable performances from George C. Scott Sterling Hayden and of course Peter Sellers. Kubrick's direction is perfect the film is perfectly paced no scene overstays it's welcome and the editing and camera angles do their jobs greatly at conveying a time of nuclear crisis but at the same time remaining darkly humorous. One of the more obvious factors of the film is that it is shot and presented in black and white which works perfectly with the film the dark representing the terror of the situation and the white representing the comedic side of the film. Kubrick also manages to assist in the comedic side of the film he achieved this through using 'rehearsal' takes and allowing Peter Sellers to improvise. The level of film making is exquisite Kubrick uses mostly steady camera shots when in the War Room and handheld camera shots when inside the B52 bomber he also frames each image with perfection and creates incredible compositions. He never cuts too often or ever drastically changes the angle thus never confusing the viewer and allowing the scenes to flow. The B 52 models on real life footage backgrounds may look dated but oddly enough it still works well with the overall tone of the film in fact it could be argued that it even adds a small comedic aspect to the film.In my opinion this film's writing was quite underrated many people remember the genius unforgettable lines that were likely adlibbed by Peter Sellers but overall the film's dialogue and plot is incredibly well written. The plot goes that the general of an air force base goes mad and withoutauthority commands a large number of B52 bombers to attack their targets in Russia and the men and President in the War Room desperately attempt to prevent this from happening. This plot is outright brilliant and is executed brilliantly there is no outright exposition in the dialogue and any exposition there is is not jarring or comes of as lazy at all. The film does an incredible job at creating an environment of sheer crisis with George C. Scott's character explaining that there are very few options in resolving the matter and the reveal of Russia's top secret 'Doomsday Machine' which adds an almost unbearable amount of tension to the film. The film reaches it's inevitable end of Nuclear Annihilation after one of the B52 bombers manages to hit one of it's targets thus triggering the Doomsday Machine and ending all life on Earth. I found this ending not only to make sense but also to fit perfectly into the film's tone there is also a great comedic value to the end with it coming so suddenly and playing classic music over the footage of many nuclear bombs detonating.Overall I hope it is clear that I see this as simply one of the best comedies ever made or even perhaps one of the best films ever made. The film is incredibly unique and although the more satirical points of the film may not be quite as relevant now they are still hilarious to experience. The film holds up incredibly well even with it's clearly dated visual effects and somewhat dated humour but Peter Seller's performance alone will allow for this film to be seen as one of the funniest satires ever made even long after the events the film is poking fun at have ended. And even if you don't find the film particularly funny you can still be in awe of the genius film making and incredibly suspenseful plot.".

It is loosely based on Peter George's novel Red Alert.A crazy American general has ordered due a bizarre reason a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union. A bit absentminded captain has realized that a general has lost his mind. Meanwhile a President meets with his top Pentagon advisors including a passionate superhawk general who sees this as an opportunity to do something about Communism in general and Russians in particular. However the Russians have an automatic response...This film loses all touch with the reality on the one side and yet it directly affects an image of a disturbed political reality on the other side. The irony stems from human stupidity irresponsibility suspicion and arrogance. Mr. Kubrick has created a satirical hopeless situation through a conflict of mentality and a sense of patriotism after which a bizarre  moral winner rises. The highlight of satire is that world diplomacy rejects itself on multiple occasions.However there is a lot of questions. Why give so much power in hands of a few people? One of them I mean all are mostly crazy. Why use energy resources to build nuclear weapons? Probably because we do not have better things to do. Is it wise to make fun of a defense system of the strongest force in the world? Of course it is one day we have to stop being afraid of each other.That's why this film is a satirical warning in an universal time because we live in a time of a political satire with very serious consequences.I am thrilled with a fact that this film does not have a trace of cynicism. Of course there is plenty of satire sarcasm irony perhaps exaggerated caricature but there is no cynicism. Mr. Kubrick you're a genius! The characterization is excellent.Peter Sellers Captain Lionel Mandrake President Merkin Muffley and Dr. Strangelove the wheelchairusing nuclear war expert and former Nazi is simply awesome as a kind of voice of reason incompetence and insanity at the same time.

What strikes one most however in this cinematic gem are the individual characterisations of Sellers Scott Hayden and Pickens. To refer to them as memorable roles is a gross understatement. With names such as President Merkin Muffley General Buck Turgidson General Jack D. Ripper and Major T.J. King Kong you know that these characters will not be soon forgotten. Other features of the film such as the remarkably designed war room set the handheld camera techniques employed by Kubrick and the black and white cinematography of Gilbert Taylor only add to the power and impact of Strangelove.

Peter Sellers is nothing short of brilliant in the three different roles that he plays Group Captain GC Lionel MandrakePresident Merkin MuffleyDr. Strangelove. But also George C.

This movie also marks James Earl Jones his very first appearance in a movie.This is perhaps the most subtle and 'darkest' comedies ever made. Everything about it is shear brilliance and even now 40 years later it hasn't lost any of its power. The movie still looks like it could had been made a couple of months ago. A movie that will never feel outdated or too 'old fashioned' to watch. In 50 years from now this movie will be just as good and hilarious as it is now.

	schema:reviewBody "Who'd have thought that Kubrick had such a great sense of humor? I mean in most of his films there are snippets of humor and Barry Lyndon has a definite irony but I hadn't expected him to be able to direct such a hilarious and thoroughly entertaining comedy. I had known for a while that this was the highest rated Kubrick film here on IMDb so naturally I was excited to find out if it was really his best film. Even though I haven't seen Lolita Spartacus Eyes Wide Shut or his first few filmsthe shorts he made before his feature and even though I thoroughly enjoyed his other films this very well may be his best film. Made in a period of time where the thought of nuclear war was a terrifying idea that was believed to be a reasonable fear the film takes this idea and turns it around makes us laugh at it. The film was made during the Cold War which must have taken quite a lot of guts on Kubrick's side... then again he did start out intending to make a thrillersuspense film about the subject but ultimately realized that a comedy with a lighthearted look on the situation would be a better idea. So he turned the idea of impending doom from nuclear holocaust into a black comedy. Personally I think he did a damn good job of it. I haven't laughed that hard and for so long at any one time for quite a while... in fact I might never have. The comedy isn't overplayed in fact most of it is presented in a deadpan matteroffactlike type of way... what's even more hilarious is that the better part of it is completely accurate. No dumb stereotypes no old clichs... just logic and simple good oldfashioned observation. The plot is excellent and very wellpaced. In my opinion Kubrick's most wellpaced film. The plot takes off almost immediately and moves at a great pace throughout the film. The acting is flawless. Absolutely flawless. Not something completely unusual for a Kubrick film but still. George C. Scott and Peter Sellers are amazing. Normally I'm not too fond of Sellers but here he was brilliant. The characters are wellwritten diverse and interesting. The cinematography is great. Just like Kubrick's other films this one has some very memorable scenes one of whichthe bombriding sequence has been referenced and spoofed a huge number of times... possibly more times than any other sequence in Kubrick's films which is quite impressive. The dialog is wellwritten welldelivered and memorable. Plenty of quotable lines. I can't really say much more about the movie without ruining one or more of the innumerable great jokes... so I'll just suggest you see it. Seriously if you enjoy Kubrick's sense of humor as seen limited in his other movies you're going to enjoy this film. Maybe not as much as I did but you'll most likely laugh. A lot. I recommend this to any fan of Kubrick black comedies Peter Sellers or just comedies with a dark basic theme to watch this. I can't praise it enough. See it unless you are offended by the themes the film presents. You won't regret it. I know I didn't. Not by a long shot. Hilarious film with a provocative plot and basic idea. 1010".

However when the Russian Ambassador warns of the doomsday machine  a machine that will destroy all life on earth in response to a nuclear attack things become desperate.  With one plane making a desperate run to it's target things look bleak.Now well respected as a superb satire on the arms race this is one of my favourite Kubrick films.  It is less cold than some of this later work and is genuinely funny without losing it's point.  The story focuses on three main areas of the attack  the military base where one crazed man launches the attack the war room at the pentagon and the plane making the bombing run.  All these have comedy inherent in them  although thew war room is by far the best.  The story is an satire on the futility and danger of the nuclear deterrent while also scattered with fantastic dialogue.  It may not sound funny but trust me  it is.The characters are all great and well done by the cast.  Peter Sellers excels in each of his roles and shows his quality.  As Mandrake he is funny in a very British way as The President he has great one sided conversations with his Russian counterpart as well as great dialogue including the legendary Gentlemen you can't fight in here  this is the war room'. However as Dr Strangelove he is hilarious  the character himself is a swipe at those who change political sides but maybe still hold onto their old ideologies.  Sterling Hayden is great as General Ripper  he delivers his madness with a straight face throughout or maybe noone told him it was a comedy!.  Slim Pickens is good and has the most famous scene from the film that has been copied in many things including Homer's fantasy in The Simpsons.  However for me the standout is George C. Scott  not exactly a comedy actor he is frantic and over the top with his communist paranoia.Overall this is a classic and deserves to be.  It is sharp today as it was then and even more relevant.  The comedy is still fresh and the dialogue is great  quite simply when Scott implores the president to act quickly as we must not have a mineshaft gap!' then you've arrived!".

	schema:reviewBody "This film has become a cultish film because of the subject of course but especially because of the tone that is really entirely conveyed by two actors Peter Sellers and his three roles and George C. Scott. We could add Slim Pickens in the batch with his phenomenal dive into nuclear annihilation at the end. The subject is central in our post WW2 world since it has to do with nuclear weapons and war. These weapons have only been used once in fact twice by the USA against Japan in 1945. The deterring effect of the possession of such weapons is supposed to keep the world as peaceful as it can be though we all know it is not exactly true since wars have been going on practically constantly since 1945 for oil for uranium for who knows what other resources or tribal heritage from the centuries of slavery imposed onto black Africa or the centuries of rife between sects in some religions. But they were always limited geographically. Most of these wars apart from the direct colonial wars of Great Britain not so many and France essentially two in Indochina and in Algeria were the deeds of the USA Korea Vietnam and the Middle East and should I not mention Granada and Panama? The Soviet Union only had one in Afghanistan and they stepped out of it in front of the resistance from the Taliban and the Mujahedeen armed and financed by the USA and the CIA. These movements gave rise to Al Qaeda and later ISIS. In 1964 just after the missile crisis in Cuba the world had just gone through a terrible scare and Stanley Kubrick wanted to produce a film that would make the world realize how dangerous these weapons can be and how little we can stop them when they are already in the air. He decided to make it a comedy by using Peter Sellers in three different parts in which his improvising was able to make a real hit on the psyche of an audience.

	onyx:emotionText "This film has become a cultish film because of the subject of course but especially because of the tone that is really entirely conveyed by two actors Peter Sellers and his three roles and George C. Scott. We could add Slim Pickens in the batch with his phenomenal dive into nuclear annihilation at the end. The subject is central in our post WW2 world since it has to do with nuclear weapons and war. These weapons have only been used once in fact twice by the USA against Japan in 1945. The deterring effect of the possession of such weapons is supposed to keep the world as peaceful as it can be though we all know it is not exactly true since wars have been going on practically constantly since 1945 for oil for uranium for who knows what other resources or tribal heritage from the centuries of slavery imposed onto black Africa or the centuries of rife between sects in some religions. But they were always limited geographically. Most of these wars apart from the direct colonial wars of Great Britain not so many and France essentially two in Indochina and in Algeria were the deeds of the USA Korea Vietnam and the Middle East and should I not mention Granada and Panama? The Soviet Union only had one in Afghanistan and they stepped out of it in front of the resistance from the Taliban and the Mujahedeen armed and financed by the USA and the CIA. These movements gave rise to Al Qaeda and later ISIS. In 1964 just after the missile crisis in Cuba the world had just gone through a terrible scare and Stanley Kubrick wanted to produce a film that would make the world realize how dangerous these weapons can be and how little we can stop them when they are already in the air. He decided to make it a comedy by using Peter Sellers in three different parts in which his improvising was able to make a real hit on the psyche of an audience. And it is a success and it is still valid.The argument is that there will always be some crazy guy who will be able to bypass all limitations and firewalls to play a trick on the world on the USSR at the time and Russia nowadays or even China for the more reckless and manage a bomb and today a missile to reach the other side and start the ABSOLUTELY AUTOMATIC responding defense that would become a tremendous backattack or act of final justified but lethal compensation.

The humor is right there in your face however there is always an underlining political critique under every character every line and every government representation. Slim Pickins is the never quit Airman. He is a representative of our entire military system of the time. The president played beautifully by Peter Sellers is a demure calm presence trying to deal with the Russian premiere. His perfect counterpart is a war hungry General ready to accuse the Russians of any small infraction. This leads to one of the funniest lines in the whole movie. Sellers also plays a British airman who has to deal with the crazed general in the usual polite British manner. Seller's third role is that of the title character Dr. Strangelove a former nazi and weapons designer for the Americans. He represents the scientific community of that time period those who worked tirelessly to build a better bomb. These characters all of them strongly parodying a cross section of society make for an odd story. The final scene while played for laughs is actually a frightening image of a communist future. The final moments are frightening in their truth leading one to put themselves in a position of the characters. Dr. Strangelove is the funniest disturbing film I've ever seen.".

He's got this strange  but very funny  theories about bodyfluids but his men respect him and do everything he says. So 34 fullyarmed plains are sent to as many targets. Meanwhile his Colonel Mandrake tries to talk sense to him and the president and another General are trying to warn the Russian prime minister. You can have nothing but great respect for Peter Sellers. He plays three roles in this film and every single one of them is flawless. The doctor Strangelove character is hilarious and creepy at the same time. His appearances as the doctor are along with the telephone conversations between the president and the Russian Prime minister the funniest moments in the film... Also the classic bombride of Major Kong off course. George C. Scott is clearly having fun in his role and the debut of James Earl Jones is also definitely worth mentioning.

There are moments during movie that you follow the dialogue and watch it progress and you feel fine but then there are verbal 'bombs' for lack of a better word dropped on you and you can fall on the ground for laughing so hard.At some point in the move I was thinking is it inappropriate that I'm entertained and then I looked it up on IMDb to see the genre and felt a bit relieved to see that it is indeed a comedy.The pace was so slow and in the best way possible you wonder how Kubrick managed to squeeze so much in so little screen time yet nothing feels rushed and everything gets enough time. Loved it! Recommend it to everyone!".

	schema:reviewBody "Stanley Kubrick directs Dr Strangelove. The plot? General Ripper a manic US general orders a nuclear attack on Russia. He believes the purity of his essence has been contaminated by the enemy the mere existence of whom threatens his gene pool. To maintain the purity of his lineage Ripper thus initiates Attack Plan R an order which results in the 843rd bomb wing leaving their fail safe points and proceeding into enemy airspace. In response the Russians reveal that they are in possession of a doomsday device. Throughout the film Americans and Soviets will attempt to defend and propagate political ideologies that mutually define the other as a danger to purity.Ripper like most of the film's characters is sexually dysfunctional. He misinterprets his post coital fatigue or erectile dysfunctions as a Communist plot and believes that the enemy is sapping his sexual essence. To reassert both himself and his masculinity Ripper sees it as his duty to deny or destroy Russia. As he gains power Ripper munches on phallic cigars and unsheathes huge eroticised machine guns.Group Captain Lionel Mandrake Peter Sellers tries to stop Ripper but is himself too weak and effeminate to overpower the psychotic general. Mandrake a nervous flight commander named after a flightless male duck has a broken leg frequently stammers and proves not masculine enough to overpower the deranged Ripper. This tension between masculinefemininecreationdestruction permeates the entire film.Enter Buck Turgidson George C Scott a warmonger who seeks to capitalise on Ripper's sneak attack. The ball's already rolling he says so let's roll along with it. Buck's name is symbolic of sexual virility Buck vibrant male turgid swollen.But once again Sellers plays the effeminate foil to his hypermasculine counterpart. He's President Merkin Muffley a bald and small man unable to commit to combat and constantly seeking to work with the enemy. Merkin and muff are slang terms for pubic wigs and female pubic hair respectively.On the other side of the Atlantic we join Major Kong a George Bushesque Texan warmonger. His B52 bomber is making a run for a Russian base at La Putta the whore. Unfortunately a Russian missile damages the aircraft's radio and they are unable to receive the recall code. Kubrick's films frequently deal with systems machines and communication networks breaking down. Here a bizarre and complex series of freak accidents  impurities or oversights in the system  essentially leads to Armageddon.The recall code is itself discovered by Captain Mandrake. An acronym for Purity of Essence and Peace on Earth the code points to both party's fascist mindset for peace to arise there can only be one pure lineage. The Other must be eradicated. When Kong reaches his target he rides a bomb down to ground zero. This activates the doomsday device blanketing the earth in a series of atomic explosion. Like most Kubrick films the film climaxes with a system failure. The irony here is not only that base human drives result in intrinsically corrupt and inherently stupid systems but that it's precisely a series of fail safes and precautions a neurotic desire for total control that kill us. Once an irrationality or rather super rationality is introduced via the psychotic Ripper the system self destructs.Before the film's iconic finale its cast of world leaders listen as Dr Strangelove a wheelchair bound exNazi professor describes the steps necessary to preserve life. With passages equating US presidents to fuhrers and with world leaders discussing fascist policies and eugenics its clear what power and ideology has ultimately triumphed. The film ends with bombs going off in tandem with the newly risen capacity of Strangelove and his Nazi affiliations.With Strangelove Kubrick recognised the inherent beauty of the mushroom cloud as well as its horror. Spectators often embrace apocalypse or unconsciously desire some idealised notion of it. But rather than the arms race it is libidinal drives which Kubrick satirizes. Think Major Kong straddling a 20 megaton thermonuclear bomb as it plummets towards a soviet ICBM site hollering inane Texan war whoops as he falls. If violence always has a sexual element and vice versa this is warfare as a kind of sexual hysteria Kong whipping his bomb in a masturbatory frenzy hat in hand before the screen is engulfed in the brilliant overexposure of nuclear detonation the perfect oneness of pleasure where the intersecting vectors of sex death and speed collide headfirst in an orgasmic explosion of fission fcking and fallout. The great black joke of Strangelove is that war stems from the phallus and that nuclear stalemate is a kind of sexual frustration or strange love to the technocratically evolved male there are forever strong dangerous unconscious drives conspiring to launch the ultimate attack. No surprise then that the film is awash with sexual imagery. Phallic Guns cigars swimsuits playboy centrefolds dominant young bucks sexually dysfunctional wheelchair bound degenerates and a narrative bookended by copulating aircrafts and an atomic ejaculation...the film's entire semiotic language is a consistent ballet of creation sex and destruction war. This is combat out of obedience to the crotch war as the drive to dominate and possess there is a matingwarring association deep in the male brain dominance associated with the phallus think how phrases like f you up and get some action have double meanings man seemingly rapingpillaging to create space for his dark cycles of creations.The film is also unique in the way it blends genres comedythrillerdocumentary. Kubrick's camera is initially detached godlike and methodical coolly milking the suspense while the film's second half with its outrun missiles and nervous faces awaiting annihilation plays likes a precursor to contemporary ticking clock action movies. Kubrick changes aesthetics styles once again for the film's now much copied ground battles which incorporate urgent documentarylike war footage. The rest of the film swings between comedysatire and straight drama. This results in strange and complex juxtapositions.1010  Masterpiece.".

While on the skies the planes march towards Soviet airspace  undetectable unstoppable.It's a beautiful scenario made even more poignant by its sheer absurdity. It tells something about a movie when it opens with a message from US Air Force stating that the thing showcased in the movie could never ever under no circumstance no way no how happen. Now please crawl out from under your beds.And this could be an unbearably heavy movie. But Kubrick helms it as a satire. The characters are amazingly out there as are the lines of dialogue the sets the music. But the subject matter is still so large so huge so scary that horror lurks underneath all the comedy. It underlines every scene every moment. Most of us now have grown up in a world where nuclear war has always been a possibility. And in this film that fact can never be forgotten.The acting is also superb with the MVP award easily going to George C.

To that end. the acting was first class Peter Sellers is very good as a feeble US president a powerless British commander and the mentally disturbed Dr Strangelove who reminds me of Werner von Braun with his SS past and trip to the Moon future.

The acting is from adequate to good the effects were well done and quite nicely not overdone.So it's a fantastic idea that wasn't ruined but isn't spectacular. The actors carry themselves well and this is a worthy addition to any scifi collection especially those who like the idea of alternate history for mankind  See Alien vs. Predator.I normally don't write such quick reviews but this is what I felt about the movie and I think that much more would give away too much for those who haven't seen it.".

The actors carry themselves well and this is a worthy addition to any scifi collection especially those who like the idea of alternate history for mankind  See Alien vs. Predator.I normally don't write such quick reviews but this is what I felt about the movie and I think that much more would give away too much for those who haven't seen it.";

	schema:reviewBody "I don't understand why this movie is so underrated. I have seen it multiple times and each time I get something new from it. It is a beautiful work of art The Director's Cut is also a mustsee because the added scenes elaborate on a few confusing plot points Now I would just like to take a moment and talk about the aspects of Stargate that make it an enjoyable exciting riveting and thoughtprovoking film.First of all David Arnold has to be recognized for his masterful soundtrack. He should have won some kind of award like Hans Zimmer won for Gladiator. David Arnold combines themes of romance adventure and wonder the likes of which I have never heard. And believe me I am an avid fan of movie music especially SciFi I am even brave enough to say that his music in Stargate rivals classic celebrated soundtracks such as Star Wars John Williams Next time you see the movie pay as much attention to David Arnold's music as you pay to the plot. The opening titles themselves are reason enough to rush to the store immediately and buy the soundtrack. My favorite sequence of the soundtrack by the way is 21 Myth Faith and Belief In the movie this is the scene where Daniel James Spader talks to Ra Jaye Davidson It is the scene right before the one where Daniel is almost forced to kill the soldiers including Jack O'Neill Kurt Russell that he arrived with.Second of all this is a VERY believable science fiction film. Most films like Star Wars Star Trek and more don't have very many ways in which they can actually tiein with reality. Stargate is in itself a theory. It asks Where did the pyramids come from? How did the Egyptians develop their gods and how were they influenced? The answer given by the film to these questions is entirely feasible. Even though the gate itself isn't easy to accept the underlying theme to the movie is. pay very very close attention to Daniel and the seminar he gives about 10 minutes into the movie in front of other scientistsThird and last I would like to tip the hat to Jaye Davidson's performance. His portrayal of Ra is chilling.although some people don't seem to agree Just hearing him speak and seeing his eyes glow sends shivers up my spine. He makes a perfect villain and it is truly a shame that he hasn't been in many other movies.This movie receives from me an easy 9 out of 10. It would have gotten a 10 if it were not for the horrible lack of character development. Jack O'Neill is especially bland although he does seem to brighten up a little bit in the last scene.See the movie! Buy the soundtrack! And I hope you liked my comments!".

While your disbelief definitely needs to be suspended to cover some inconsistencies the atmosphere and action of the movie make it worth your while.  Not only does Stargate combine science fiction with history but it weaves them together in a way that remains exciting the entire film despite major changes of environment.  Upon hearing some major elements of the film one might think that aliens ancient Egypt and atomic bombs could only come together in some kind of bizarre montage.  However this film is strongly plotdriven and while this does make it typical in some respects the plot itself is remarkable.  Hardly artsy the score is in many places Hollywoodish presenting emotion in a straightforward manner yet it too is enjoyable.  None of the acting is spectacular but this is made up for by the characters' wholesome qualities and ability to change however slightly over the course of the movie.  To summarize while nothing in the film is a complete divergence from the standard it follows the Hollywood style in a manner that is original enough to make a solid and enjoyable adventure. This is the actualization of the potential within the Hollywood film template a good story told well in all respects. 910".

I saw it in theater when it first came out and seeing it again on the small screen still excites and entertains me. It's one of those films that with repeated viewing you get still another perspective.I liked best the interplay with Kurt Russell and James Spader. Two very opposite men in temperament and in training over the course of the film gradually gain a great respect for each other. Both deliver performances that would rank in the top five for both these players.One of the ways that Ra keeps his people subjugated is the forbidding of any of the nomadic types that are under his thumb to learn to write or even create a written language. In that culture and in every culture literacy is the strongest weapon against tyranny. In fact one of the characters makes quite a sacrifice to secure the permanence of the revolution they've wrought on this world in another part of the galaxy that has a strange connection to our Earth.

If after all those years it is still a pleasure to watch it then why ? A fine story  believe it or not  a fine cinematography and a beautiful soundtrack that stacks into your mind. Roland Emmerich is perhaps one of the best directors and the casting is superb.The visual design artifacts and architecture are well studied. Though the story could be more mysterious and could leave some imagination to the viewer it is well told.One of my best science fictions ever. Just watch it you won't regret it. Or even you may come back here and vote it to raise the unbelievably low point which it got much less then it deserved.Thanks Roland you're my man.".

I still enjoy the film now 1o years later although disappointed they never made a sequel as it was set up for one. Never really liked the ending  should have included the return to earth. The TV series has moved the story along nicely  even changes to the cast have worked well and i particularly enjoy the dry humour of the TV series.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the sort of movie that shouldn't had really worked out but yet it did. Everything about this movie screams Bmovie. Just look at the title read the script see the characters the cast etcetera. Yet Stargate works out tremendously fine as great and above all fine entertainment. It's for most part due to the fine directing skills of Roland Emmerich show really knows to uplifts this movie and its story. This movie also really marked the big breakthrough for Roland Emmerich. Yes it's true that his real breakthrough movie was Moon 44 and even though that movie was by no means a great one it still showed that the director had lots of potential and took the maximum out of the movie. So Moon 44 got him Hollywood's attention but with Stargate he for the first time really proofs that he can handle a multimillion dollar production as well and successfully since Universal Soldier was only a successful movie in certain circles. If it weren't for Stargate then now way we would had had movies such as Independence Day The Patriot and The Day After Tomorrow. Some people wouldn't had minded that by the way.Even though the story itself is not that much special it still has a great and original as well as an intriguing concept that somehow knows to connect an alien world to ancient Egypt and their Gods. It's a great sciencefiction story without ever really getting too 'sciencefiction' like. It's uses lots of great and imaginative elements.Once you start really thinking about it there isn't an awful lot happening in this movie mostly action wise. Yet it's a very entertaining movie to watch which is due to the fact that it's made with lots of pace and because of it's greatly and perfectly adventurous concept of traveling to a far off planet. It's a movie that never bores and is a perfectly fun one to watch actually. The movie gets also really uplifted by its David Arnold musical score.The movie is fair enough looking. For 1994 standards the special effects are good especially for the masks worn by the 'Gods'. But because the movie is for most part set in a dessert like environment it's not really one that jumps out in its looks and actually also really doesn't looks and feels like a multimillion dollar production even though it is. The movie actually looks and feels more cheap which is also one of the reasons why this movie has already become a sort of a cultclassic.The movie is greatly cast with James Spader and Kurt Russell in the lead roles. But man did James Spader look still so much different and younger back then. He's just not the kind of person that aged well. He went from a boyish look in 1994 to an old dirty wrinkly man look now days even though he'll turn only just 48 next month. Also greatly cast was Jaye Davidson as Ra. He's a true memorable villain and it makes you realize what a great shame it is that Jaye Davidson has never acted in many movies simply just because he never really enjoyed acting much despite having also received an Oscar nomination for his debut role in The Crying Game.Truly a recommendable sciencefiction classic from the '90's.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw STARGATE about seven years ago and left with memories of thinking that it was in some way an old fashioned movie . I couldn't put my finger on why I thought this was an old fashioned movie but after seeing it again tonight I can perhaps explain it better now STARGATE isn't so much as  old fashioned   it's just got a rather old type of plot that's versatile . It's almost like a Tarzan movie from the 1940s where a bunch of good white guys  In movies in those days bad guys were usually white  The good guys were always white  team up with the king of the jungle in order to fight a bunch of evil slave traders . The story could easily be reworked with a bunch of 18th century good guys led by Errol Flynn getting shipwrecked on an island where they meet noble natives and defend them from evil pirates . Rewatching this movie again after a gap of several years I often forgot that I was watching a far fetched SF blockbuster and thought I was watching a historical drama  something that's not to be taken as a criticism . I also became aware of subtle plot points that I'd missed on first viewing . For example I thought the death of O'Neil's son was so underdeveloped that it was totally unnecessary to include this in the movie but there's a couple of scenes where it is important to the plot later on . I also knew that the movie wasn't going to be an ALIENS type of movie  something the original trailers confused me about . let's face it  a special forces team creeping about a dark pyramid . It's got be similar in tone to ALIENS . If that's what you think STARGATE is going to be about you'll be as disappointed as I was first time I saw itOf the cast Kurt Russell and his special forces group are slightly wooden but I won't criticise the cast since these type of characters always lack flair in these genre movies . James Spader is slightly unconvincing as hero Dan Jackson due to wimpish nature and effette hairstyle  Was Jackson conceived as a female character ?  but Jaye Davidson is absolutely superb as Ra . This is the same Jaye Davidson from THE CRYING GAME and I was totally shocked to find this was the second and last feature film he appeared in . According to the trivia section of STARGATE it appears he's difficult to work with but someone cast him in more movies pleaseAs for the Roland Emmerich  Dean Devlin partnership there are a few faults . One is the opening of the script that contains no hook and fools the audience into thinking they'll be watching a RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK type movie which they won't be . The script also contains a few unlikely plot holes such as the special forces team taking some GPS equipment with them something that wouldn't work on a planet where humanity had never been  and also discovering in an unlikely scenario that they won't be able to return to Earth thanks to Jackson . There is a very interesting point to the subtext however and that is that if there is a god it doesn't necessarily mean he'll be benign or good . Food for thought . Thankfully Emmerich doesn't go overboard on the CGI while he also had the good sense  Say it again  to cast Jaye Davidson as RaBy no means a classic SF movie STARGATE is solid entertainment and is rather more enjoyable on second viewing".

I would like to thank our Swedish contributor. I don't speak Swedish and thought that the language used was another 'made up' language that is used in 'alien' films. It's most annoying that these languages are always spoken in sharp short bursts which have no flow. Why Swedish? If one is going to use an alien language just make it up or find a language which is lessknown. Viveca Lindfors was sadly wasted as were the other actors in the beginning of the film. They just disappeared. I would have much rather seen a movie about Lindfors life from the first discovery of the Stargate. I wonder if she was the Swedish coach? The premise was interesting but the behavior on the 'parallel' world was ridiculous. The cliches flew quick and fast. James Spaders falls in love with dusky native maiden. How many times has this 'instant cross cultural love' been used? What is really offensive about this plot device is that 99 of the time it's always a white MALE who gets the 'native'.The other cliches were just as bad. When a problem can't be solved the Americans 'get out the guns'. Guns solve everything. I am an American. Jaye Davidson was very good in 'The Crying Game' but his character in 'Stargate' was as weak as the plot and gave no sense of the immense power he was supposed to wield. James Spader was in my opinion playing the 'cliche' genius with a lot of little 'absentminded' mannerisms which were supposed to make him 'cute'. I didn't mind his hair. Kurt Russell was another cliche. The way to bring him back from a deep and suicidal depression was to send him out on a mission.Then he gets to kill a lot of people which makes him feel much better. Something that the army would never risk.   In the processhe finds a surrogate son in the Bedouin boy.  Give us a break!".

	schema:headline " Decent scifi adventure film.";
	schema:reviewBody "Stargate starts in 1928 in Giza where an archaeological dig uncovers an alien Stargate used to travel between worlds. Jump forward to the 'Present Day' where Egyptologist Dr. Daniel Jackson James Spader has radical theories that the Pyramids weren't constructed by the Egyptians he is contacted by Catherine Langford Viveca Lindfors  given the opportunity to prove his theories. Langford takes Jackson to an underground Military facility where noone has been able to work out how to operate the mysterious Stargate within a couple of weeks Jackson has it all figured out. A mission is undertaken to travel through the Stargate to a distant planet  investigate the alien world on the other side...This French American coproduction was cowritten  directed by Roland Emmerich  is a fine scifi adventure film that holds up very well even when viewed today nearly fifteen years after it was made which is a feat in itself since a lot of scifi dates badly very quickly. Originally the rough cut for Stargate was apparently three hours long it was eventually released into theatres at two hours long  has subsequently been released in a 'Director's Cut' that adds about ten more minutes to the theatrical cut having said that I will be basing my comments on the original two hour theatrical version. The script by Emmerich  producer Dean Devlin bases itself on the idea that an alien visited Earth  formed our society  Egypt is a reflection of those aliens it's a reasonable idea although since the alien planet looks like a desert with Egyptian Pyramids  human beings as it's inhabitants it sometimes feels like Stargate is set on Earth rather than some distant planet on the edge of the known Universe. The story starts off intriguing enough  it's a very watchable  overall enjoyable film but at two hours in length it does drag at times  I wasn't keen on the rebellious slave uprising at the end it just felt rather clichd  predictable. The character's are alright  it's refreshing to see an alien planet where the aliens don't speak English while this maybe authentic you can see why most scifi films don't go down this route since lots of alien dialogue without knowing what they are saying does tend to get a bit tedious I certainly wouldn't want to watch many films where half the dialogue spoken is quite literally alien although having said that towards the end the dialogue starts to be subtitled.Director Emmerich is no stranger to the big budget special effects laden blockbuster  would go on to make films such as Independence Day 1992 Godzilla 1998  The Day After Tomrrow 2004. Stargate was his second 'big' film after the rather good JeanClaude Van Damme action scifi film Universal Solider 1992 Stargate certainly looks nice enough from the bright sunshine of the desert planet to the dark grey interiors of the evil aliens spaceship. The special effects are generally very good made before a time CGI computer effects were used for everything Stargate has a mixture of CGI model work  on set effects which all blend together to make for a convincing alien world. The huge Pyramid spaceship in particular looks very impressive. Apparently conceived by Emmerich during film school in 1979 both he  Devlin were sued by someone who alleged they stole the story from him the case was settled out of court.With a supposed budget of about 55000000 Stargate was a well funded film  it show's with a real sense of scope  scale it also has that polished Hollywood feel although the scene at the end where Daniel  the girl are transported back down into the Pyramid is very poorly edited  it is actually quite difficult to make out what's happening. Apparently filmed in California  Arizona. The acting is good I have always liked Kurt Russell but don't consider this to be one of his best films as he gives a largely cold  detached performance  only really becomes the action hero for the last fifteen minutes while Spader is likable enough as the geeky hero.Stargate is a good solid scifi film that doesn't quite reach the heights of greatness due to it's length a lot of pointless dialogue scenes with aliens who you can't understand  I didn't really like the constant bland desert setting that much. Followed by the popular American Canadian TV series Stargate SG1 1997  2007 which ran for ten seasons  two hundred  thirteen episodes which itself spawned another TV series Stargate Atlantis 2004 which is still running now  the less than popular Stargate Infinity 2002 which ran for a single solitary season.".

	schema:reviewBody "With his 'crazy' views on the origin of the pyramids and his great intellect Dr Daniel Jackson is the natural choice to join a team looking into the mysterious of a collection of stone tablets that had been uncovered many decades ago. Within a few days Jackson has cracked it and is soon introduced to the true mystery of the whole project  that of a metallic portal covered with the same symbols and hieroglyphics. Activating it under the watchful eye of the military Daniel sees the gate open to somewhere else. Joining the group going through the portal Daniel finds a world like Egypt full of peaceful people worshiping the sungod Ra. Things go great for a while until that is Ra shows up.Having now spawned two TV spin off series neither of which I have ever bothered with I suppose this film might have gained a bit of respect looking back on it as the starting point for a relatively successful franchise but this does not mean that the film has suddenly become a wonderful piece of action scifi  cause it ain't! The plot is silly from the very start and never manages to get over this  any film that has to have the main character use his dialogue to spell everything out to the audience is on a hiding to nothing from the getgo and so it is here. Jackson manages to solve the decades old riddle in a day or two then goes along then discovers etc etc. All the way the film tries to cover this weakness but it has too many dull moments to really cover it all up. The action is OK but without a decent plot to engage the audience it is really nothing but noisy special effects  effects that may I say have not dated well at all in the past decade.The cast try hard but even James Spader struggles to buy into the idea of him as an action star he appears to be laughing at the script at times in the early scenes! Russell is cool and has a tough presence but he is lumbered with a poor character who has a lazy 'dead son' thing put on him that he cannot use at all. Jaye 'Crying Game' Davidson makes little or no impression at all and looking back is actually less interesting than his own bodyguards! The support cast are all nondescript actors in poorly written roles and few can do anything with their material.Overall this is a fairly average film that makes for passable entertainment but certainly no more than that. The plot is poor and the dialogue is written to match. The action is noisy but uninspiring throughout and the cast simply run around spouting drivel. Not totally worthless but you need to be in a pretty undemanding mood to get any significant value out of this.".

The performances are pretty good from Kurt Russell's hardass soldier to James Spader's nerdy Egyptologist and the aforementioned SFX are decent.

	schema:reviewBody "It is amazing how similar films can be when it comes to plot predictability and story line. I liked the direction Roland Emmerich put into the film and screenplay but it felt like there were some areas that were not carefully scanned over thoroughly. There were several things I enjoyed during the running time of Stargate but there were some drawbacks that should have been addressed at the same time.Stargate is the story of linguist Dr. Daniel Jackson James Spader who is on the verge of finding the truth behind the great pyramids of Egypt. Of course no one believes him until he is given a special offer that will allow him to prove his theory. Hmmmm....already from there it sounds like the story of Milo James Thatch from Atlantis The Lost Empire 2001. Accompanying Dr. Jackson is Colonel Jack O'Neil played by veteran actor Kurt Russell. At first O'Neil is one of those silent characters who is difficult to communicate with but he opens up later on. Thankfully Russell doesn't play stonefaced the whole time like Todd from Soldier 1998.Along with these two actors the rest of the acting is presentable. The special effects are average. Nothings amazing nor does it seem really cheap looking so there's nothing to critique there. Looking back on them they were standard for their time. As the plot continues Jackson's' group of followers run into distant humans in a far away galaxy. It is there that Spader's character falls in love with the leader's daughter Sha'uri Mili Avital who I will say looks great. I did like the love story but it left me wanting to see more that it showed.Again this specific plot device runs practically parallel to that of Disney's Atlantis. The difference is that Disney's was more entertaining and with characters that had more personality to them. Sure Spader played a great nerd and Russell was good as depressed individual at first but having a boatload of characters with different accents is much more fun to listen and watch on screen. I also liked the themes that were played in David Arnold's soundtrack. It may not have had sci fi feel to it but it did have a memorable tune. In some ways it bordered on the edge of John Williams but obviously not as epic sounding.Stargate is the film that pushed director Roland Emmerich to the pinnacle of success but the characters within the story lack heart. However it is supported by a good music and acting.".

The Stargate franchise has already started to reach the same size and popularity as even Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica.So for all of you who have just seen this film and liked it I advice you to take a look into the TV series.

	schema:headline " Die Hard 2 is my all time personal favorite Action film an underrated";
	schema:reviewBody "Die Hard 2 in my opinion is my third favorite decent action flick in a Die Hard series and a good movie to watch. It is one of my personal favorite action movies. It is one of the most underrated Die Hard films in the series and that not a bad one. His wife again a hostage Christmas again the same reporter from the 1st film now a janitor Marvin is a helper instead of Argyle and so on. As far as sequels go Die Hard 2 is excellent. Of course it isn't better than the first but sequels rarely are. This film is like going to a circus you sit back and watch crazy stuff happen laugh cheer joke and just have a good time. Bruce Willis gives a great performance in the lead we have some solid villains and some brilliant action set pieces. I say check it out. I'm not one to subtract points for a lack of realism or real world believability in films. Because of that Die Hard 2 poses a very interesting case study for me. Real world believability is very difficult to not think about when watching this film. Why wouldn't the planes just reroute to other nearby airports? There are a bunch less than an hour's flight away including Baltimore Philadelphia the three New York Cityarea airports and so on. Why wouldn't they be able to call another close airport or the Pentagon or somewhere else nearby to have them contact the planes? They're near Washington D.C. after all don't forget that Dulles is 26 miles away from D.C. in Virginia making it unlikely that planes out of fuel would begin dropping on the White House lawn. It seems like maybe this film should have been set somewhere like Salt Lake City Utah instead. Why wouldn't they be able to show the runways through some other means like a line of emergency or police vehicles with their sirens on? If the terrorists started shooting at the vehicles or trying to blow them up at least they'd be given an indication where the fire is coming fromgiven their location. Just how likely would it be that there's a big storm in the area on the day when General Ramon Esperanza Franco Nero is being extradited? How likely is it that he'd be extradited on Christmas Eve? Why the hell is John standing out on the runway in the snow waving a couple of flaming polesjust what does he think that will do? Die Hard 2 is still awesome movie and sequel to the first one for me and I don't know why people are saying it is the worst one or why they hate it. I don't I love it more than the first one I love it. In 2005 was my first best action movie than the first one. What I love about this film is they show John McClain more as a human being. In the beginning at the airport when his car was taken away at the airport the whole movie show's an actual terror the villains are more of a threat cause they're actual terrorists! The Action sequences are awesome there is barely any Cgi in it John McClane is again in another elevator shafts. I love the plot twist that was wonderful the snow in the film the mobile snow chase whit McClane was awesome. This film is not perfect It is good it has some problems in it. Always enjoyed watching it. The problems for the airport I already mentioned the most annoying to me was after McClane kills the henchman when he was saving Leslie Barnes he pushed a terrorist of the latter and that latter tower falls on a terrorist you can see that it is a dummy from close that should not been seen from close camera.It is still It is one of my personal favorite action movies mostly in the winter when it is snowing. The first movie was hug success Renny Harlin's job by making this movie make it even harder for him to find a good story and make a snow because they didn't had any actual snow at the time it was really hard. I love it. The facts I love Chase with the Snowmobile shooting with blanks on Carmine Lorenzo fights on an airplane double cross John's jokes... The General Esperanza on airplane from Val Verde the same country was named in Schwarzenegger's movie Commando John's shooting with snowmobile than John's fight by the church. Movie to me is really awesome. I enjoy watching Die Hard 2. 1010 Grade BadAss Seal Of Approval It is my second favorite Die Hard film in the series.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have watched many movies where they have had a sequel which left me disappointed and uneasy but the sequel to the smash Die Hard Die Hard 2 Die Harder was what think a sequel should be  more of what made the first film so successful. So its all out war for unlucky Police Detective named McClane in a heartstopping jetpropelled journey through excitement and terror.On a snowy Christmas Eve in the nation's capital a team of terrorist have seized a major international airport and now holds thousands of holiday travellers hostage. The terrorists a renegade band of crack military commandos led by murderous rogue officer have come to rescue a drug lord from justice. They've prepared for every contingency except one John McClane an offduty cop seized by a feeling of deadly deja vu. The heroic cop not only has to battle terrorists but also an incompetent airport police chief the hard headed commander of the army's antiterrorist squad and a deadly winter snowstorm. The runways are littered with death and destruction and McClane is in a race against time. His wife is trapped on one of the planes circling somewhere overhead desperately low on fuel!Die Hard 2 makes Bruce Willis look better and better. The role of John McClane is one filled with the fight for right and to trying to stop the bad guys. Again a lot of the stunts would have been done by Willis considering the professionalism of the man. Running all over an airport in a fierce snowstorm fighting scenes on the wing of a real 747 jet and trying to save lives he has no attachment to L.A. cop John McClane puts his body on the line so justice is served and so did the actor Bruce Willis in my view to bring a great action movie back for a second time. Willis is one of my favourite actors but I have only started to watch his movies in about the last 23 years and what a mistake that has been.   This film has more freedom as it is held at an airport. McClane is like I have said all over the place. The freedom and space this story has makes this film much easier to watch. Another thing which is impressive about Die Hard 2 is the effort to put more thrills in the movie. The snow which of course is man made has a major role so do all the planes making quite a crisis on their hands. Not only do they fight on the wing of a 747 but also fly a real helicopter on the wing of the plane also. The scene where McClane ejects himself from the exploding plane is another favourite scene of mine. Other parts of this movie which stunned me I wont tell you about as it will give too much away but trust me they are exceptionally done.Again the bad guys have a major role in this one. William Saddler is Colonial Stuart a heartless leader who only cares that a drug lord escapes and can get in on all the money making scheme. I loved his role in this. Another face that I remember in Die hard 2 who was a bad guy is Robert Patrick. I loved his role in Terminator 2. But the conflict between the good guys is extremely tense. Especially between McClane and Police Officer Lorenzo played by L.A law star Dennis Franz. It is hard to understand if this character is on the side for good or not. Here comes another analogy on Die Hard 2 do you ever know who is on the side of good or bad? Well for at least three quarters of the film it is unsure. The storywriters need to be commended because the story left me intrigued and when you think you know what is about to happen the circumstances change. Also having a different director gave this sequel new prospective. Director Renny Harlin threw his hand into the ring. What a gamble? An unknown director but to my surprise I say that it worked. His other films worth mentioning include A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 and Cliffhanger. So overall Die Hard 2 was extremely enjoyable sequel to watch. The story the characters and the situation are all of a great tension which I love in a movie. So one cop who is so vulnerable and emotional ends up being the one person who you would most like to have save your life. Like Willis said in an interview Die Hard 2  Die Harder  it's bigger badder and louder. I will leave you with one question the first Die Hard had approximately 20 people die can you count for me how many perish in this film? It is quite a turn around!Rating 45 or 910".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1988 action thriller DIE HARD was such a huge critical commercial and artistic success that it was probably inevitable given Hollywood's mentality that there is never too much of a good thing that a sequel would follow.  The result thus is DIE HARD 2.Bruce Willis returns as John McClane who on this Christmas Eve is at Dulles International Airport in Washington awaiting the arrival of his wife Bonnie Bedelia from Los Angeles.  Flights however are being delayed all across the board into D.C. by one of the biggest blizzards on record.  And when Willis spots Army mercenaries in sensitive areas of the airport where nobody is supposed to go his cop instincts take hold.  As it turns out these mercenaries are led by a hardnosed rightwing colonel William Sadler whose aim is to snatch a known LatinAmerican drug dealer Franco Nero from the hands of U.S. justice agents.  Their reason as Sadler puts it is because he had the guts to stand up against Communist aggression.  To prove his point Sadler and his minions shut the entire airport down putting all those planes in the snowbound skies over the nation's capital in mortal peril until Nero's military plane arrives.  The result is a battle in more ways than one as Willis must not only tangle with Sadler's gang but also with an incompetent airport cop Dennis Franz who thinks Willis is a lunatic.Very solid acting from Willis as well as Fred Dalton Thompson and Art Evans who portray the two sympathetic airport officials helps DIE HARD 2 remain leagues ahead of the majority of testosteroneladen action flicks. But many of the same flaws that were in DIE HARD 1 creep up here again.  To paint the airport cops as incompetent buffoons just so that Willis can be the hero of the piece is grossly inaccurate and offensive.  Even the media in the guise of the ultraobnoxious Dick Thornberg William Atherton gets slammed and not in a very fair or accurate fashion.  And the violence and language in DIE HARD 2 are far more pervasive than the original with at least two scenes the icepick to the eye and Sadler's excommander John Amos getting sucked into the engine of the getaway 747 at the end approaching extreme in terms of bloodshed and the use of the 'F' word approaching SCARFACE in terms of occasions when it is used.Still there is plenty of suspense and tension to be had here with the direction of Renny Harlin evincing at times the feel of a Spielberg or Peckinpah at their edgeoftheseat best.  Michael Kamen's score which interpolates Jean Sibelius' Finlandia at the end is also a plus.The verdict is that DIE HARD 2 DIE HARDER is not an unflawed film but one can certainly do much worse.".

I loved how this movie ended Holly really kicked more butt in this film. But it is Bruce who really wins the movie over he's even more bad than ever before he's just so awesome you can't help but to keep rooting for him.

	schema:reviewBody "After the terrifying events in LA John McClane is about to go through it all again. A team of terrorists led by Col. Stuart is holding the entire airport hostage. The terrorists are planning to rescue a drug lord from justice. In order to do so they have seized control of all electrical equipment affecting all planes. With no runway lights available all aircraft have to remain in the air with fuel running low McClane will need to be fast.This is a Die Hard film so it must be entertaining right? You are correct! Am I afraid to say this film is even better than the first film? No way! I'm going to say it right now! THIS FILM IS BETTER THAN THE FIRST!Now getting that out of the way this is what you expect from a sequel Bigger set pieces more body counts more and bigger explosions many more people and the same old McClane! However it does surprise me that the film doesn't have as much action as the first film. If I look back correctly McClane isn't an action hero until the last 10 minutes of the film!Now that isn't a bad thing. I'm kind of glad that it's different. This is an entertaining summer movie! Now changing my attitude this film suffers from what the first one did A long runtime. The movie overstays its welcome for about 30 minutes and I mean it. I would've liked it to be a tight packed fastpaced action movie but whatever.Now what can I say about the performances? Bruce Willis plays the same character flawlessly. It's really good! William Sadler I guess is a decent antagonist. Nothing really stands out for me except for him practicing to fight naked.What can you expect from this? Well not necessarily more action scenes from Bruce Willis. Still this film is a lot of fun to watch although it overstayed its welcome. There are also some memorable lines.

	onyx:emotionText "After the terrifying events in LA John McClane is about to go through it all again. A team of terrorists led by Col. Stuart is holding the entire airport hostage. The terrorists are planning to rescue a drug lord from justice. In order to do so they have seized control of all electrical equipment affecting all planes. With no runway lights available all aircraft have to remain in the air with fuel running low McClane will need to be fast.This is a Die Hard film so it must be entertaining right? You are correct! Am I afraid to say this film is even better than the first film? No way! I'm going to say it right now! THIS FILM IS BETTER THAN THE FIRST!Now getting that out of the way this is what you expect from a sequel Bigger set pieces more body counts more and bigger explosions many more people and the same old McClane! However it does surprise me that the film doesn't have as much action as the first film. If I look back correctly McClane isn't an action hero until the last 10 minutes of the film!Now that isn't a bad thing. I'm kind of glad that it's different. This is an entertaining summer movie! Now changing my attitude this film suffers from what the first one did A long runtime. The movie overstays its welcome for about 30 minutes and I mean it. I would've liked it to be a tight packed fastpaced action movie but whatever.Now what can I say about the performances? Bruce Willis plays the same character flawlessly. It's really good! William Sadler I guess is a decent antagonist. Nothing really stands out for me except for him practicing to fight naked.What can you expect from this? Well not necessarily more action scenes from Bruce Willis. Still this film is a lot of fun to watch although it overstayed its welcome. There are also some memorable lines. With everything mostly bigger although not better but in this case it is this film is better than the first film but not the fourth.";

	schema:reviewBody "Okay I have one big problem with this sequel to Die Hard. The movie was entertaining at times with McClain taking on more badass terrorists and their ultraelaborate plan. But unlike the first film in this series this particular entry was utterly preposterous. Sure the action of the first was huge and explosive itself but in the scheme of the movie it always basically made sense. In Die Hard 2 though there were individual scenes that made no sense and a plot with holes so big you could fly a 747 through them. I do not mean to be the overly discriminating film reviewer who knitpicks at technical details and writes the movie off as a result. No if you see one or even a handful of discrepancies things that violate reality you dismiss them. But this movie is just a series of them over and over and over. I mean how can you shut your brain off that much and just sit back and enjoy the action when the movie couldn't happen in a million years for reasons that you don't even have to be some kind of expert to be conscious of. For example at the beginning of the movie National Airport is shut down because of the snow and you hear airport controllers discussing how they will be taking over its flight load. So my question is if the terrorists disable Dulles couldn't the reverse occur? How could the terrorists have counted on National being shut down for a snowstorm when they'd been planning for months? And then of course there is Baltimore Washington International Airport BWI which was never even mentioned of course that may have come in handy for people trying to land planes circling over DC. Also how can they expect us to believe that the planes circling overhead are doomed to crash in two hours when they run out of fuel when a flight from DC to Memphis Philly New York or Atlanta takes less than that. And of course why couldn't the controllers have transmitted to the planes using radios in planes that were already on the ground? My point is you just can't sidestep reality in such a plethora of ways and expect an audience to follow you through the whole plot. If you have to do that so much to make your movie work then perhaps it never should have been made. Oh yeah and having John McClain simply say at one point 'How can the same thing happen to the same guy twice?' doesn't successfully negate the fact the odds on that are too infinitesimal to even be contemplated. So bottom line it had too many holes to be enjoyable even though it was only trying to entertain with a series of explosions. The first movie was so much more plausible and that's why people actually buy the first one by itself. I have a feeling the vast majority of Die Hard 2 owners bought it as part of the trilogy set mostly as a means of seeing the other two.P.S. I almost forgot about the grenades that took 20 seconds to explode. Riiiiigghhht.".

	schema:reviewBody "Series note It is not necessary to watch Die Hard 1988 before this film. However that is the better film and it will give you a better introduction to the continuing characters so it is still recommendable to watch the first film before this one.Set an unspecified number of years after Die Hard I'll call it Die Hard 1 Die Hard 2 has John McClane Bruce Willis just outside of Washington D.C. on Christmas Eve where he is waiting for his wife Holly Bonnie Bedelia to arrive at Dulles International Airport from Los Angeles so they can visit her mother for the holidays. Holly calls John from the plane to tell him that they're a halfhour behind schedule. While he's waiting in the crowded airport he first sees a man he recognizes but can't place it turns out to be one of the villains then sees a couple other suspicious men heading into the restricted baggage area. He follows them in has a confrontation and eventually learns that one is a special ops military guy whose records say he's been dead for two years. That cues him in to the fact that something big is going to go down as if he couldn't tell based on the fact that he's in another Die Hard film. Since a bigwig cocaine dealer from Latin America is on his way to Washington for extradition that's a pretty big clue regarding what is about to go down. Shortly after chaos ensues as terrorists take control of Dulles with dozens of planes in the air and no place to landthey're not able to talk to the tower use their instruments properly or conduct a visual landing. How will they resolve the situation? I'm not one to subtract points for a lack of realism or real world believability in films. Because of that Die Hard 2 poses a very interesting case study for me. Real world believability is very difficult to not think about when watching this film. Why wouldn't the planes just reroute to other nearby airports? There are a bunch less than an hour's flight away including Baltimore Philadelphia the three New York Cityarea airports and so on. Why wouldn't they be able to call another close airport or the Pentagon or somewhere else nearby to have them contact the planes? They're near Washington D.C. after all don't forget that Dulles is 26 miles away from D.C. in Virginia making it unlikely that planes out of fuel would begin dropping on the White House lawn. It seems like maybe this film should have been set somewhere like Salt Lake City Utah instead. Why wouldn't they be able to show the runways through some other means like a line of emergency or police vehicles with their sirens on? If the terrorists started shooting at the vehicles or trying to blow them up at least they'd be given an indication where the fire is coming fromgiven their location. Just how likely would it be that there's a big storm in the area on the day when General Ramon Esperanza Franco Nero is being extradited? How likely is it that he'd be extradited on Christmas Eve? Why the hell is John standing out on the runway in the snow waving a couple of flaming polesjust what does he think that will do? And we can go on and on.In the above it becomes clear that maybe the problem isn't realworld believability but internal logic although to an extent some of the internal logic is extremely difficult to separate from facts we know about the real world that aren't mentioned in the film. But Die Hard 1 was an extremely taut film that had impeccable internal logic. The film itself gave reasons for the dilemmas that arose and they were justifications that made the dilemmas inevitable. It doesn't matter that some of the facts or situations in Die Hard 1 were contrary to our beliefs about the real world. The film defined things to be the fictional way it defined them and the logic was consistent and valid in the formal sense from within the film.However it becomes clear not too far into Die Hard 2 that perhaps looking at it for things like realworld believability and logical consistencyvalidity is misconceiving it. My belief is that this film is meant to be a spoof of action films as much as it is meant to be a serious action film. That's why John is standing out on the runway waving around flaming poles like a maniac. That's why baddies can easily shoot and kill 20 or so highly trained highly armed S.W.A.T. team members wearing bulletproof vests but can't hit John who is wearing street clothes and rolling around on the floor with a pistol. That's why the planes are stuck over D.C. with no options and the film doesn't even try to justify this. That's why there are scenes of John riding explosions like a cowboy yippeekiyay mf'er indeed. That's why there are a number of winkwink cracks about being in another Die Hard film. That's why there are a few scenes that look oddly similar to Airplane! 1980. That's why the film so frequently joyously embraces silliness.Director Renny Harlin and his bulletproof vested army of scriptwriters and producers apparently set out to make a cartoonish satire of action films while still making a serious action film. In 1990 action films were just at the tail end of their domination of the U.S. box office so it was a ripe time to spoof them. Harlin and company succeed fairly well. It might have been even more artistically successful if they had more firmly committed to one angle cartoonish satire or the other serious actioner but the performances are pretty good the fistfights gunfights explosions and chases are very good and the film is frequently funny if you have a taste for the absurd.".

There have been many cases where I was immediately fooled by a sequel that had more packed in it longer bigger more characters more effects more action etc. thinking with something other than my common sense! When I first saw DIE HARD 2 back in 1990 the year it came out I thoughtOh it's not confined to that building and is instead in a big airport Dulles so it's got to be better! McClane gets to move around more doesn't have to walk around barefoot gets to interact with a lot of people so it will be less uncomfortable.The action can be more spread out and is not restrictive. So it's got to be better.Wrong wrong and wrong!Again with hindsight and repeated viewing DIE HARD 2 continually gets downgraded by me as what is wrong with most Hollywood action movies especially nowadays.What I realize is that part of the brilliance of the original DIE HARD was it's claustrophobic nature and that by limiting the action to that one skyscraper it allows everything to be more personal centrally located and focused. You had to have everything happen in that one building so you couldn't cheat or fool the audience. By design the filmmakers had to come up with original ideas. In a situation like DIE HARD 2 there is action HERE THERE and EVERYWHERE to the point of just a bunch of the same action scenes each with nonquotable stupid dialogue and oneliners. The action in DIE HARD 2 is not unique nor are any of the situations scary or tense as they were in DIE HARD.Our hero is once again John McClane played by the reliable action hero Bruce Willis but this time in a thankless situation and as previously stated he is at Dulles Airport in D.C. waiting his wife Holly's Bonnie Bedelia again arriving plane so they can meet her parents for Christmas. A bad snowstorm has caused so that even planes at nearby airports must reroute to Dulles. This time as opposed to in the original DIE HARD these terrorists are actual terrorists a group of U.S. military expatriates who plan to seize control of Dulles and force them to have the plane of a political prisoner routed to a special runway. This group is led by Col. Stuart played by William Sadler. This is another huge problem with DIE HARD 2. The main villain is not effective. While in DIE HARD Hans Gruber was truly diabolical smart charming and relentless Stuart in DIE HARD 2 is pretty much just a stock villain who has an eternal scowl on his face with no distinguishing characteristics. Very monotone character. Also Stuart strangely doesn't seem to be fazed or surprised about McClane's involvement in trying to stop him which I find unrealistic.Another problem is that whereas DIE HARD had a core of memorable supporting characters Holly Hans Karl Powell Robinson Thornburg etc. each with some character believability and depth DIE HARD 2 is populated with virtually all annoying characters the airport personnel led by Fred Dalton Thompson and Dennis Franz are spectacularly idiotic at least in DIE HARD even though Robinson wasn't too bright he had legitimate reason to believe that McClane might not be on the up and up these airport guys had no excuse so why waste the whole 2 hours arguing with him!. Also I found most of the more minor characters like the flight attendants on Holly's plane the female news reporter following McClane around like his pet that creepy drunk guy working in the underground part of the airport etc. all annoying.Then you have John Amos playing an Army major and a former colleague of Col. Stuart's and his military squad pop in to save the day at the last minute but again it is not exciting or tense at all. In fact with all the action in DIE HARD 2 none of it is thrilling just bythenumbers fare fakelooking fights and machine guns going off all over the place but without the style flair and dare I say realism of DIE HARD. The action situations in the original were more sparse believable and wellstaged.But the biggest offense of DIE HARD 2 is the cringeinducing dialogue. It is really bad. One of the reasons many of the characters come off so bland monotone and annoying. I mean it is unintentionally laughable. ALL characters are a victim to it. And finally amazingly although it came out only 2 years later this sequel seems way more dated than the original. In fact the original doesn't seem dated at all to me. DIE HARD 2 is just a mindless action flick.".

	schema:reviewBody "I got the DVDbox which contains all four Die Hardmovies. I watched them all again leaving this one for the last. There aren't many successful franchises around with 3rd and 4th movie being better than the second. Die Hard has made the exception.I was entertained by the three other movies being able to forgive some silliness and just enjoy the action and the characters. Die Hard 2 just made me uncomfortable several times.The whole idea is good enough and the settings aren't that bad. Some plot twists are decent. Some action scenes don't suck. That's it.Main character McClane is handled poorly. He's too serious when he should crack some jokes and tries to be funny at wrong times. It feels cheap after the first movie. At least the third one Die Hard with a Vengeance took McClane back on track with a sense of selfirony. Dennis Franz probably hated his role being a clichfilled antiMcClane officer.The plot holes and other stupid scenes don't help much. I'm not expecting a realityfest from a Die Hardmovie but come on. I didn't know crap about radio communication or grenades when I was twelve when I first saw this movie but even then I managed to hang my head against a wall in shame for my fellow countryman Renny Harlin.But who cares when you got action right? Umm yeah. You get explosions frequent slomo deaths bad fistfights dull chase scenes and McClane shooting as bad as the bad guys just to break some lamps and decorate the walls. I didn't get the evil grin on my face not once. In the first movie that grin was on my face all the time.But when you got a character like McClane you can't totally screw it up. I watched this one from the beginning to the end without getting drunk and Rrated violence is always better than PG13pudding. I would still like to pretend that this sequel never existed like the following sequels do but I can't. It is part of the beloved Die Hardfranchise and that alone makes this film better than it deserves to be. And I'm glad that I watched this movie again now I'm sure that I won't have to do it again. edit Die Hard 5 doesn't count. That's not a Die Hardmovie.".

Die Hard 2 just made me uncomfortable several times.The whole idea is good enough and the settings aren't that bad. Some plot twists are decent. Some action scenes don't suck. That's it.Main character McClane is handled poorly. He's too serious when he should crack some jokes and tries to be funny at wrong times. It feels cheap after the first movie. At least the third one Die Hard with a Vengeance took McClane back on track with a sense of selfirony. Dennis Franz probably hated his role being a clichfilled antiMcClane officer.The plot holes and other stupid scenes don't help much. I'm not expecting a realityfest from a Die Hardmovie but come on. I didn't know crap about radio communication or grenades when I was twelve when I first saw this movie but even then I managed to hang my head against a wall in shame for my fellow countryman Renny Harlin.But who cares when you got action right? Umm yeah. You get explosions frequent slomo deaths bad fistfights dull chase scenes and McClane shooting as bad as the bad guys just to break some lamps and decorate the walls. I didn't get the evil grin on my face not once. In the first movie that grin was on my face all the time.But when you got a character like McClane you can't totally screw it up. I watched this one from the beginning to the end without getting drunk and Rrated violence is always better than PG13pudding. I would still like to pretend that this sequel never existed like the following sequels do but I can't. It is part of the beloved Die Hardfranchise and that alone makes this film better than it deserves to be. And I'm glad that I watched this movie again now I'm sure that I won't have to do it again. edit Die Hard 5 doesn't count. That's not a Die Hardmovie.";

The only intense moments in the entire movie was when the plane full of holiday travelers crashed exploding on impact and McClane ejects from the plane set to explode within seconds. THAT'S IT! Other than that it's has no more action than Airport disaster films of the 1970's!What really doesn't make any sense is the middle to the end of the film. The planes have no other option except circle the airport until they run out of fuel. Are you kidding me? There has to be dozens of alternative airports to land at from Logan in Boston to Charlotte North Carolina! Did this director fail geography as a kid or something because he seems to be very ignorant of eastern seaboard. Why must they all land at Dulles was there a law? No it was Hollywood Logic They must have something to tie the movie together Seriously dude you've could have done a lot better! Get this! The jumbo jets land in a field big enough for a number of them. What? How? Without crashing into one another or collapsing the landing gear? Impossible! What kind of narcotic was Renny Harlin huffing snorting andor drinking when he directed this? Was he drunk or in La La Land? Another weird moment is when some of the evacuated passengers are not wearing any shoes! You're in a snow field and it's cold enough to form deadly iciclesbelow 32F why would you be without any shoes and protection from a coat? Ever heard of frostbite and hypothermia ?! Give me a break! The planes weren't in any danger surely they would have time to grab a coat or something Jeez!Sadly Die Harder joins the universal hall of fame for cheesy airport disaster melodramas that only a mediocre Hollywood director like this bozo and a ratings hungry bastard of a 24hour news network can only fantasize about. I can't believe that I actually wanted to buy this movie on VHS!".

However as he waits for her plane to come in terrorists seize control of the control equipment and keep the planes circling.  They plan to rescue captured dictator General Esperanza by landing his plane at the airport and making their escape.  However as the terrorists wait the circling planes get shorter and shorter on fuel leading John McClane to take what action he can to regain control of the planes.This second of the exciting die hard series has a hard act to follow.  The first film was amazing and broke the mould relating to action films it showed that action could occur in everyday locations caused English actors to get lots of work as bad guys and set many other copycat films in motion die hard on a mountain die hard on a bus etc.  However this is nothing special.  The plot tries to be similar to the original but it lacks as much originality as the first.  The terrorist plot is not quite as likely and it doesn't have the same flow as the first.  Storywise the main flaw is in McClane's involvement  in the first film he was very much trapped and forced to take action in fact his first instinct was to run away from the terrorists.  Here the same is not true Willis tries to make it seem that he doesn't want all this again how can the same  happen to the same guy but really he throws himself into the thick of the battle.  This takes away from the image of him as an ordinary guy put into a difficult situation.The action scenes don't help this problem.  Yes all the action scenes are good and exciting but many of them are too big.  In the first the action occurred in short standoffs usually with McClane running away or sneaking around.  Here there's too many of one man v's the world style action with Willis running in against a large number of terrorists and winning.  Again this takes away from the tension and claustrophobia of the other film and makes it feel like a Arnie blockbuster.  That said the action is still good and won't disappoint action fans.The main failing of the film is that it tries to be like the first film without success.  It retains the same setup McClane trying to rescue his wife from terrorists brings back the same Christmas time setting and music it even wheels back in as many repeat characters as it can Veljohnson as Sergeant Powell Atherton as Thornburg but it loses the most important item  the set parameters of the action.  Die Hard was great because it had very tightly set locations for it's action in the office block.  Here the action can spread out all over so a lot of the tension and claustrophobia is lost.  The decision to make the second film so similar to the first can only lead us to comparing the two and seeing the inferiorities.The performances are quite good generally.  Willis can almost do this type of thing in his sleep while the other repeat characters simply redo their roles.  Unfortunately many of the repeat characters don't have much to do and seem out of place.  The 'new' characters fill the stereotyped shoes of previous actors.  Dennis Franz takes on the mantle of incompetent cop standing in McClane's way by going by the book Sheila McCarthy takes on the story hungry journalist role etc.  The bad guys do have a lot to live up to by replacing Alan Rickman and they don't quite reach that standard.  William Sadler is good as Colonel Stuart but doesn't have any style of his own anyway it's good to see Franco Nero cult star of western Django in an American film.The film has some nice twists towards the end but it just doesn't come close to the atmosphere of the first film.  By trying to be similar to the first film Renny Harlin shows that he's not as capable as McTiernan in creating a mood of tension mixed with the action.  The result is a great action movie but one that cowers in the shadow of it's better bigger brother.".

It's a genre that's usually synonymous with silly campy cartoonish crap but Bryan Singer delivers a longawaited exception to the rule.  XMen is smart stylish and very cool... one of the better sci fifantasy films of the last decade.Of course it helps to have good source material.The XMen comics which originated in the 1960s are more politically progressive and morally complex than older superhero stories such as Superman where the heroes are always right and truth justice and the American Way always prevail.  The series is a wellcrafted parable about individuality and discrimination.  The characters are mutantsstruggling to find a place in a society that rejects them.  Its primary villain Magneto isn't an evil lunatic he's a sympathetic character a misguided revolutionary playing Huey Newton to Professor Xavier's Martin Luther King. The iconic character Wolverine is a beerswilling antihero who cares little for ideals and fights only to protect himself and his loved ones. The female characters are as powerful and important as the men rather than being mere love interests.Rather than making just another flashy explosionperminutespecialeffectsextravaganza Singer practices the lost arts of character and plot development.  As a result the movie has a far greater depth than the average big budget summer flick.  The acting is also quite good on the whole.  Hugh Jackman who plays Wolverine is fantastica bona fide Clint Eastwood caliber badass.  Some of the dialogue is fairly cheesy but in the hands of Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart it sounds quite convincing.  Stewart has made a career out of making lame dialogue sound cool.Hardcore fans of the comics have complained about the omission of several popular XMen.  This is silly.   A movie that gave the background on every character in the comic books would be 6 hours long.  There will be plenty of time to develop new characters in the forthcoming sequels.  Fans have also complained about the casting of Anna Paquin as Rogue.   I disagree.  Rogue is unable to touch another human being without harming themshe would not realistically act like a confident sassy warrior.  Paquin did a tremendous job of conveying the fear and isolation that such a young woman would feel. She will undoubtedly grow into the part in future movies.In the end XMen is a comic book movie.  Superpowers are explained with silly pseudoscientific babble the plot revolves around a fairly ridiculous takeovertheworld scheme and names like Magneto are spoken with a straight face.  Don't read all the glowing reviews and expect Citizen Kane. But don't underestimate XMen either.  It is an intelligent movie that people will enjoy whether or not they are familiar with the comic.".

Whenever a movie is made that is based on comic books there is always a fear that it can and will be typically pigeonholed into the comic book film genre and that the movie is basically made for the fans of that comic book.  Comicbook films are usually unrealistic and unappealing to the general audience.Bryan Singer however did a wonderful job at making XMen a movie that will not only overjoy the fans of the comic book but also the general moviegoer as well.  The movie is grounded without the flighty unrealism of comic book material and it delivers a message about prejudice that has always been what XMen were about fighting for a world that hates them.The performances are outstanding especially Hugh Jackman who in my opinion did a deadon Wolverine and Patrick Stewart who never failed to show the peace and selfcontrol that Professor Charles Xavier always strove to maintain.Aside the characters the plot was original I couldn't tell you what was going to happen in the end by the middle of the movie and most importantly the world was REAL.  The only suspension of disbelief that is required is the assumption that these genetic mutations can happen and did causing these extraordinary people.  Honestly I was a little disappointed that the colorful highflare costumes were omitted but I instantly forgave Singer when I realized why.  It was simply to add to the realism.All in all XMen was excellent.  If you're a fan of the comic book series as I was then you'll endlessly enjoy seeing these characters come to life.

	schema:reviewBody "If this film had been given to the wrong director it could have been incredibly cheesy. Being a reader of the comics I know that there are a few things that works on the page of a comic book but not in a film and let me say that the costumes is one of these things that in all probability wouldn't work. Singer chose to go with black leather outfits and I for one am very thankful for this choice. There are many things in this film that works but unfortunately there are a few things as well that prevent the film from being truly great.Lets start with the things that work. Acting wise the film is very good. This is above all attributed to some excellent casting. Hugh Jackman is simply perfect as Wolverine and brings out the duality of the character in a very satisfactory manner. Also the scenes were we see a glimpse of the rage in the character work remarkably well. The only thing that could be said about him is that he is too tall but it seems most people including myself have accepted this fact. I think also that it was a wise choice to let a relatively unknown actor play the part because in that way we have no preconceived notions about him. As for Professor X no other man than Patrick Stewart couldshould play him. Stewart simply becomes Xavier both in presence voice and looks. An example of perfect casting. Ian McKellen is brilliant as Magneto and succeeds in creating a human villain rather than the usual clich like villains we see in Hollywood productions. The acting aside from the ones mentioned above is pretty good. Not spectacular but good. The only one who does not look and act like the character we know from the comics is Anna Paquin who plays Rogue. The character is nothing like in the comics and Paquin's performance doesn't help the character.When it comes to music and sound effects in general the film is a notch above average. The musical score has a very grand even epic feel to it and this suits the film very well. The score is not as memorable as the score from Batman 1989 but it is very adequate. As for the general sound effects they are both very fitting and believable adding to the overall credibility of the film which is considerable. The sound Wolverine's claws make when they come out is exactly as I imagined it. Very well done. The effects in general are also very well made. Not as good as in SpiderMan but still very good. A lot of care has been taken to make the effects seem as believable as possible and from where I'm standing they work. The only character whose powers I did not fully believe in was Toad's. Ray Park is an excellent athlete but many of his stunts look like obvious wire work. This is a pretty general complaint I have as some of the action look rehearsed. There is however some interesting action scenes and overall the action is acceptable.The story is pretty well written and the dialog is both witty and sharp. Especially much of the dialog between Wolverine and Cyclops James Marsden is very entertaining and true to the comic books. Where I feel the story is lacking is in the climax which I am afraid to say is a little silly. Magneto's plan for world domination is actually pretty stupid when you think about it and that is a shame because much of the exposition is very well done. Generally however the first film is all about setting the stage for the films to come and it does do that in a satisfactory manner.All in all XMen is definitely one of the better super hero movies out there and although it was surpassed by the sequel it still stands as a true testament to Singer's skill.810".

	schema:reviewBody "With so many movies out right now that are designed solely for entertainment puposesfrom Gone in 60 seconds to MI2 to Scary Movieit is promising to sit through a 90minute film based on a comicbook that actually gives you an opportunity to think and be challenged.Bryan Singer's Xmen The Movie is nothing more than an introduction to the lives of the characters from the comic book. The very fact that his movie doesn't try to add new elements or change elements that already existed within the comic is what makes it so successful.Xmen the comic series has been around for more than 30 years. And for good reason. It has dealt with all of the important elements that good storytelling includesrejection loneliness hope fear distrust love selfishness power and the price you pay for doing what you believe is right. By consistently exploring various difficult elements of humanity the Xmen comic has been able to be not only entertaining but stimulating as well.Thankfully Singer's movie translation is no exception. Xmen is very well executed with excellent character work for the leads Logan Rogue Magneto and Xavier a good exploration of the motives of each character and dialogue that is sharp and intelligent. However lest you think Xmen is only intellectual let me assure you that the specialeffects department has done an incredible job of mingling the human elements of the story with action. From Wolverine's claws to Rogue's devasating touch from Storm's namesake displays of nature to Magneto's awesome power Xmen constantly finds new and arresting ways of showingoff each mutants power. And the closer you get to the end the more exciting it is.True the movie was not perfect. Certain story elements were modified slightly for bigscreen adaptation nothing however that is disloyal to the ethic of the series. The soundtrack was only sufficient rather than being something truly memorable. And not all of the characters were given equal time on screen some important characters were completely missing.But for a 90 minute movie that needs an action plot it's obviously impossible to give all the Xmen and their evil counterparts equal attention or character development. In fact the sheer scale of the series alone all but requires a sequel to flesh out what was missing in this first Intro to Xmen movie.Yet as a beginning exploration of the Xmen universe this movie shines. It is attractive fun and meaningful. Whether you're an Xmen fan you're looking for something that will make you think you want an action movie you enjoy scifi or you just want to leave the theater feeling like you didn't just waste a couple of hours and seven bucks go see Bryan Singer's Xmen. You won't be disappointed.".

The very fact that his movie doesn't try to add new elements or change elements that already existed within the comic is what makes it so successful.Xmen the comic series has been around for more than 30 years. And for good reason. It has dealt with all of the important elements that good storytelling includesrejection loneliness hope fear distrust love selfishness power and the price you pay for doing what you believe is right. By consistently exploring various difficult elements of humanity the Xmen comic has been able to be not only entertaining but stimulating as well.Thankfully Singer's movie translation is no exception. Xmen is very well executed with excellent character work for the leads Logan Rogue Magneto and Xavier a good exploration of the motives of each character and dialogue that is sharp and intelligent. However lest you think Xmen is only intellectual let me assure you that the specialeffects department has done an incredible job of mingling the human elements of the story with action.

	schema:reviewBody "The film version of Stan Lee and Jack The King Kirby's bestselling comic book creation XMen has finally succeeded where more than twenty years of fourcolor superhero movies have failed.  They have finally got it right...It is a stunning cinematic experience faithfully adapting nearly 40 years of continuity into a streamlined fastpaced wonderfully exciting trip into the legendary Marvel Universe.  XMen features incredible portrayals of much of the classic mutant cast especially virtual unknown at least here in the States Hugh Jackman as Logan the Canadian wildman we all know and love as Wolverine.  Jackman seems born to play this coveted role with every bit of gruff and grim gusto his Wolverine looks as if he simply stepped off one of Chris Claremont and John Byrne's exquisitely crafted pages.  The rest of the cast was also pleasantly wellcasted and wellsuited for their roles including the handsomely chisled James Marsden as the stoic field commander Cyclops and the gorgeous Anna Paquin as the cannevertouchbutwishweallcould Rogue.  Famke Janssen and Halle Berry are beautiful and bold as Jean Grey and Storm respectively not just appearing as fleeting shards of eye candy but actually adding depth and strength to the flow of the film.  Patrick Stewart's excellent Professor Charles Xavier is in fine Stewart fashion extrapolating on his JeanLuc Picard character and adding genuine compassion and warmth.Ian McKellan is superb as the tortured master of magnetism Magneto playing the part with malicious glee tempered with an extreme form of jingoism for his cause of the militant uprising of mutants over normal people.  His Brotherhood of Evil Mutants is composed of Sabretooth viciously and animalistically portrayed Tyler Mane The Phanton Menace's Ray Park is the wickedly amusing Toad and the stunning Rebecca RomaijnStamos is the shapeshifter Mystique.  Park actually had the most to say of Magneto's henchmen but it was appropriate as these three comprise an awesomely evil team of muscle and not philosophy like their leader.The productions values were spectacular as were the settings taking us from a stark malign concentration camp in Poland to the wilds of the Canadian north to the serenity of Westchester New York to a mindbending climax on Liberty Island.  The action sequences were wellpaced and actionpacked and much more smoother and better choreographed than any of the Batman films.  The special effects especially Wolverine's legendary adamantium claws were truly aweinspiring.XMen was meticulously directed by Bryan Singer who along with 20th Century Fox actually listened to and cared about what XFans thought and wished to see on screen.  Although we would have all liked to have stayed in that theater for another 95 minutes there are many more stories to tell and God willing Fox will let it happen.Most importantly XMen finally gives Marvel Entertainment Group a firm footing on film a foundation that was never fully in its grasp until the surprise hit of two years ago Blade.  Now that Marvel has discovered that it can succeed with its toptier characters the sky is truly the limit for its varied cast of great characters.  I hope that Warner Bros. will sit up and take notice at what XMen has accomplished.  Maybe this will be a wakeup call to those studio executives in charge of Superman and Batman and make them realize that the fans' input really does count in the end...Highest recommendation!".

In doing so it goes right to the heart of the country's shadow  our continuing inability to deal with those who are different from us either by race ethnic heritage sexual preference or generation. The story taps into the reservoir of feelings we have about diversity tolerance and exclusivity.

It's almost too faithful to its original medium with 2d performances from all the principals except for Hugh Jackman as the grouchy Wolverine he displays the closest thing to personality among these cardboard cutouts.  Patrick Stewart is lifeless.  Ian McKellen who was believably dark in Singer's Apt Pupil here only looks very drowsy.  And the XMen themselves look like the cast of Dawson's Creek in drag.This film has endless problems.  The action sequences and in particular the climactic battle in and on the Statue of Liberty look terribly staged just as on the comics page the characters halt to strike dramatic poses or dotingly brandish their super powers one of them hilariously even utters at one point Storm use your power!.  It simply doesn't work any more than if Singer had put speech bubbles above the characters' heads. Compare these silly little fights to the superb sequences in Jet Li's Black Mask 1996 a film shot for a fraction of this one's budget but obviously with much greater talent and vision.For a comic with a rich graphical past the movie's art direction delivers a strangely bland sterile look both for Professor X's school and for the Liberty set.  Both look lowbudget but neither is quite as bad as the villain's secret seaside hideout which Singer shot in such darkness that nary a detail can be seen.Oddly XMen looks like two different movies.  The first 15 minutes are lavishly designed and shot from the opening flashback of Jews herded into a concentration camp to the discovery of a Wolverine slumming in a moody northern logging camp.  Then abruptly the flair is gone and for the remaining 90 minutes we get a film that looks like one of the Star Trek TV franchise vehicles.  Except for Storm's look it's pure Penthouse Magazine ca. 1975 with Halle Barry's vapid expression rounding out the bill.  The villains are halfcomically done but even that is a blunder by Singer  we don't really get any comic relief from them and we can hardly worry too much about the Xmen if they're beset by the likes of a villain called Toad and even less when they remind us of the far wittier and betterlooking sendup of all this nonsense last year's Mystery Men.Apart from the inanities there is also a true sin it's unforgivably trite when a pulp fiction like this one hijacks the Holocaust to inflate its meagre storyline and insincere theme.  XMen isn't really an allegory of genocide or even merely of racism.  That stuff is just tacked on to what is really an exercise in big fights and big boobs  the old Marvel formula. Fights and boobs aren't bad in their own right but they're done much better elsewhere without the pretensions to social justice.".

It was no other movie than XMen that reignited the genre and proved that a comic fantasy world does not have to be corny goofy and cheesy at all.Bryan Singer created a suspenseful story in which the characters had to deal with being different  and the conflict that rises from bigotry.In the not too distant future Prof. Charles Xavier has a school for socalled mutants people who are different. Generally these mutants possess abilities that normal people do not have  which causes fear and hate in the hearts of the American people. Hence Senator Robert Kelly proposes a law that calls for mutants to register themselves. Xaviers frenemy Erik Magneto Lensherr is appalled by this law and plots to spread mutancy among world leaders at a UN summit. Xavier's XMen Cyclops Storm and Jean Grey struggle to stop Magneto. In the middle of these conflicts runaway mutants Rogue and Wolverine take refuge at the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters...It's a brilliant movie with tons of easter eggs and nods to the fans. While not lacking action or fantastic elements the movie plays the brain card. It is clever slightly dark. Remember how recently the second installment of Captain America The Winter Soldier was described as a political thriller? Well XMen did it first.But what really excels XMen is how it captures the emotional impact of being different. How the daily struggle of minorities is portrayed through the metaphor of Mutancy. It is what sets XMen apart from other super hero  comic book movies it is their Trump Card. Therefor it's a shame that this element is being shoved more and more to the background as the XMovie franchise expands. I hope in the future they will look back at this first one from time to time if only to remember what the XGene of this series is.All in all XMen brought back comic book movies. It did for the genre what Star Wars A New Hope did for Space Movies. So maybe there are comic book movies you enjoy more than this... they would not be here if it wasn't for the XMen and their first movie. I have never granted a 1010 to a movie before but this one deserves it.".

I was very disappointed in APT PUPIL Singer misjudged that one so I was unsure as to what to expect with XMEN.  Would it be more like USUAL SUSPECTS or more like APT PUPIL?

	schema:headline " Startlingly Fun Movie To Watch";
	schema:reviewBody "XMen surprised me with its intelligence marvelous direction and wonderful characters.A startlingly fun movie to watch XMen is one of the better comic book adaptations out there. In fact I'd say it was the best one made until SpiderMan came out. Even then it's a close call. XMen does really well with balancing the terrific number of characters it features on screen. I think this is the movie's best aspect. It gives us a lot of depth to every character on screen. Including Wolverine who I was not pleased with when I saw XMen Origins Wolverine. It's a little ironic that there was more depth given to Wolverine in a film that was not strictly about Wolverine than the character study film did that was supposed to be solely about Wolverine. I started to feel an interesting connection to this character. This is incredibly important because this is the first time I had ever thought much of anything for Wolverine including in other films TV shows and comic books. Excellent development.I was even more impressed with some of the side characters like Rogue. Rogue was portrayed beautifully by Anna Paquin. I was unprepared for the level of intensity that this young actress was able to bring to the table with her character. She seemed frail but independent. Strong and weak at the same time. And there was so much emotional strength given to her that by the time we got to the climactic battle I was genuinely concerned for her. I also really loved the friendship that was played out between her and Wolverine. It was done extremely well and the two shared some really impressive scenes.Cyclops Storm and Jean Grey were a little underplayed but I was still satisfied with the level of character development that we still got from them. I was able to take all these characters seriously and I was able to follow each of their own inner struggles in a way that again I had not anticipated.Ian McKellen was yet another surprise for me as Magneto. I had never held much stock in the villain believing him to be nothing particularly special. And when I saw the old man who was to play him I couldn't hold back my scoff. But the surprises kept coming through and I couldn't help but love this guy's performance. He plays the villain Magneto very well giving a powerful and poignant performance. That's nothing to scoff at.And while I am talking about the actors and characters I cannot forget Patrick Stewart who played Professor Xavier. I think this was the best performance in the film. Patrick Stewart really brought this character to life giving the audience an incredibly powerful performance. There was a scene when he was talking to Wolverine and Cyclops and I suddenly realized I was leaning forward in my chair to hang onto every word this guy had to say. A brilliant and underrated performance.Then there were the incredible visuals in this story. Whether they were all CGI or not I did not know and neither did I care. This film was still made before everything had gone to such gargantuan lengths in the computers and I could tell the effort that was put into the visuals. And they looked really darn good.But what impressed me still more than anything else about XMen was the direction. This film was directed by Bryan Singer and he gives the audience some really intense direction. I was blown away by the cinematography among everything else. Singer is a wonderful director. I haven't seen any of his other films but I want to now.XMen is an entertaining andabove everything elsefun ride that is sure to grasp comic book fans and noncomic book fans alike.910".

	schema:headline " Perfection";
	schema:reviewBody "Unbelievably I have recently learned that some people don't like this first movie very much. I don't know why because I did not want to learn I will just write what I think. XMen is the best one in the series including XMen Origins Wolverine by far even if the second one is deeper and it comes from perfect direction mostly. The movie is very consistent no uneven material it has at all it is very stylish and very enjoyable also. The tone the atmosphere of the movie are so different from the comic book orand the animation it is like Bryan Singer creates his own XMen world but somehow it does not turn into a flaw or disappointment. Visually it looks like a thriller rather than a colorful fantastic super hero movie but this works somehow. Personally I did not complain about it. Instead it makes the movie eccentric idiosyncratic. I like the snowy shots and despite it is short one of the best action scenes of the movie the fight after the accident. As for Magneto Ian McKellen was made for Magneto and of course for Gandalf too As I know some people complained about Sabretooth but may be even if he was not made for the character like McKellen Patrick Stewart as Professor X and Halle Berry as Storm Tyler Mane looks great as Sabretooth. I saw the original character I watched the animation but I don't know why they were not satisfied with Tyler Mane's Sabretooth what was wrong? He is as harsh as the original character too. Halle Berry is so cute by the way. There are a few smart moments like the steel balls or the metal floors related to Magneto by the way I liked it. The action scene takes place in the station is my second favorite. Just a note there is a shot with a weird angle it was amazing. Visually XMen is one of the most stark plain movies ever made probably. The last parts are amazing too we see some cool fight scenes everyone encounters with each other. Every time it is so fun to watch thanks to Singer's stark eccentric direction and the colorful characters. The Wolverine Sabretooth clash is not the focus of the movie but better than XMen Origins Wolverine. On the Statue of Liberty there is a spiral camera shot loved! And XMen has much more.".

	schema:headline " XMen  Indepth Comment!";
	schema:reviewBody "I have always liked the movie XMen! Its a serious movie with a deep story and a dark nature! Ithas a very different cast and some incredible action! The special effects are top notch! The movie also has a unique score by Michael Kamen that fits this film perfectly! Below in a small but Indepth look at the characters of the film.The XMenHugh Jackman as Wolverine  There is not much information that is known about Logan or as he is called by another name which is Wolverine because of his hair and his raw fighting skills and not to mention his great sense of smell and like his arch nemesis Sabertooth he too has an incredible healing rate! He also has the outstanding ability to have three steel claws in each hand that comes through the knuckle area. He uses these thick blades for weapons and they do the task well! What kind of mutant is Wolverine? How can he possibly have this painful but yet great advantage that literally shoots out of his hands? Will Professor X and his XMen help Logan find out or will Wolverine have to find out on his own?Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier  Professor X The head of the School For Gifted Youngsters. He helps mutants with their powers by teaching them many things. He is a kind man and he seems to be more of a father or parent than a mentor. He is a very intelligent mutant and he can do many things with his mind! In fact he just may have the most powerful mind on Earth. Unlike Magneto Charles Xavier believes in peace!James Marsden as Cyclops  Scott Summers has such powerful eyes he needs a special visor to control it. What causes this red beam is unknown and his visor helps him maintain this dangerous red light but he can control the beam with the help of a knob as he can adjust this to help him whenever he needs to use it however but without the special visor look out for an incredible blast! He is also a skilled pilot!Famke Janssen as Jean Grey  She also has a very powerful mind though she needs more time on how to master it with the help Professor X! She likes Cyclops but she also cares about Logan.Halle Berry as Storm  This Egyptian beauty has the power to create all kinds of storms! Ororo Munroe has long white hair and whenever she uses her great power her eyes turn white as well!Anna Paquin as Rogue  She has the unusual power to drain the life out of anyone she touches! She must wear gloves to prevent this from happening!The BrotherhoodIan McKellen as Magneto. A very intelligent man that is Erik Magnus Lehnsherr. Where he hails from is unknown but what is known he has an extraordinary power that he can magnetize anything that is metal! Whether its as small as a key or as large as a car it becomes no problem for Magneto!Tyler Mane as Sabertooth  The huge maniac that is known as Sabertooth has incredible senses and is able to heal from injuries faster than anyone except Wolverine! This giant lunatic loves to hear women scream and he has a passion to hear the scream or none other than Storm! Victor Creed is a psychopath and with his long claws and razor sharp teeth he is out for blood!Ray Park as Toad  The green skinned Mortimer Toynbee has a real long tongue and can grab a hold of an animal for lunch and also can use it to grab and use to swing out of danger. He has great leaping ability and fighting skills!Rebecca RomijnStamos as Mystique  Though her real name is Raven Darkholme she prefers to be called Mystique due to her mysterious shape shifting. The blue skinned woman can change exactly into anyone and even duplicate the clothes they wear! She is incredibly agile and She has excellent fighting skills and she'll give the greatest fighters the planet has to offer a great challenge!Other CharactersBruce Davison as Senator Robert Kelly  Unlike some people he is a believer in mutants and knows what they can do. He is captured by the lovely Mystique as it was a mission to her. Magneto shows the Senator what its like to be a mutant!I really like the XMen movie and I think Bryan Singer did a good job on the characters. Though X2 is arguably better than this and I would love to have the XMen franchise to spawn more than a trilogy. Though it may never happen but I think about this a lot that wouldn't it be awesome if they would have these great comic book characters together with other Marvel characters from movies like The Hulk SpiderMan Blade The Punisher  Daredevil? Think of the epicness and possibilities! I hope you have enjoyed this Indepth look at The XMen!".

They change your life subtly altering your perceptions of reality almost always for the better.Dead Poets Society is one of those few films.I saw the movie back when I was in High School. I had a teacher who told us that we really needed to watch it in fact it was our homework for the day. We didn't need to bring back a report or talk about it in class. All he asked from us was to watch it make up our own mind about it and that was it. As you can imagine many friends of mine didn't watch it at all I did. And yes I feel I changed a bit from there on.Back when you are young you never really stop to think what in the world you are doing with your life. You simply live for the day hope your grades will be enough to pass and that's it. Long term thinking involves maybe flirting with a girl. Nothing more. What this film showed me was that we have the responsability and the joy of being alive in this planet. That we are dust and we will go back to it so we have precious little time to make a difference. That we have a moral obligation to seize the day and make our lives extraordinary my favorite quote in all movie history. That the world basically is ours. That the only limitations are within ourselves and that we owe it to us to fight to rebel against conformity to change what we hate and keep what we love. That living in this world is a beautiful responsability and that only cowards dare not to change it for the better.The fact that the cast was basically my age and was passing through the same dilemmas and situations I was facing made it all so much more powerful.So here I sit 12 years from that day. I still don't think I have seized the day completely. But I keep on trying I always will. I wonder how many people were transformed by this gem of a movie I hope many.10 out of 10. A definitive masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dead Poets Scoiety. I suppose if you were in High School sometime between 19902008 one of your teachers thought I'd be a good idea to watch this movie and I still remember my reaction and the ones of our fellow classmates Yeah probably a boring movie that will try to make the school look better and encourage us to do our homework and study for our tests. I couldn't have been more wrong. This movie definitely changed my way of thinking to a certain extent and there are very few films who have moved and touched me like this one.The movie plays in 1959 and centers around a private academy somewhere in New England. The curriculum is extremely difficult and the teachers have no humor and are very strict. The new English teacher though Mr John Keating Robin Williams who graduated from the very same school uses unorthodox but quite effective methods to teach the students about literature and poetry. During their first lesson he tells them that they can either call him Mr. Keating or Oh Captain my Captain based on a quote by Walt Whitman. He encourages them to come out of themselves use their energy to make their lives worth living and beautiful  Carpe Diem Seize the Day! The plot also centers around two students Neil Robert Sean Leonard who is funny and popular but fails to gain his fathers pride because of his wish to become an actor and Todd Ethan Hawke who is very shy and unsure of himself and is inspired by Keating to use his imagination and eventually we find out that he is very talented when it comes to poetry. After they find out about a club Keating was a member of while he was a student the Dead Poets Society which was forbidden by the school they decide to reestablish it what ultimately gets them into a lot of trouble.There are several key factors that make this movie as brilliant as it is. First of all there is the acting. Robin Williams who I really like as a Comedian really proves that he is a great actor who can get deep into a character and play him with such passion and energy that you will forget he's an actor. Keating whose teaching methods are indeed unusual and will probably make you laugh a couple of times is a very interesting role the teacher we all would have wanted but not because he doesn't give homework or makes up very easy openbook tests. No because Keating shows us that we have to come out of ourselves make the best of our lives and especially that there is a poet in everyone of us. Then there is the terribly underappreciated Robert Sean Leonard who also gives a very moving performance as a student who is kept back by his father and therefore fails to make his dreams come true. In my opinion he is very underused as an actor and should have gotten a lot more leading roles. As for Ethan Hawke he definitely was the best choice for the character he plays. We can literally feel his fear and shyness when he stands in front of the class and gets no word out because he's so embarrassed.Peter Weir who is probably most known for his recent movie Master and Commander shows what a great director he is with this film and it definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and the nominations for Best Picture Director and Leading Actor for Robin Williams.Some of you may have heard about Roger Ebert absolutely negative review of this movie and that he wanted to throw up at the end of the film. I can understand why people might not like the ending I won't put any spoilers but I think it just adds to the the beauty and drama of this film a film that should definitely be on the IMDb Top 250 Movies. This is a movie you must have seen!!".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all this is movie is my alltime favorite out of all the hundreds of films I have seen. However every time I mention this film I have to answer most people's quizzical looks with It's a beautiful little 80s film that stayed in the 80s. After seeing it for the 24th time since I first saw it 5 years ago on my 13th birthday I can gladly say that this movie went far and beyond the 80s and the power and inspiration of the message can be felt every day.Dead Poets Society is a most underrated film by a most underrated director whose inspiring uplifting and moral tales firmly grounded in reality are not nearly as appreciated as they should be. Here we see one of his very personal and cradled projects and he shows the visual style and concentration on characters in which he is so affluent. His control of the camera and the characters are very strong and very smooth. The cinematography is near perfect with every shot along with the editing seamless. Also very compelling are the colortones in every scene perfectly matching the mood and events of the scene. Could you say this is art? Absolutely.Then we have the performances. Robin Williams continues in stride as one who has todate remained the most touching heartwrenching aweinspiring comedians with inarguable acting talent he still remains my most favorite performer on the film screen. His Professor John Keating is a man who embodies every professor who you thought was cool and respectable every person who taught or enlightened you in something out of the ordinary. In fact  dare I say it?  he teaches something EXTRAORDINARY! We have the tragically underrated Robert Sean Leonard in his role as the freethinking catalyst student Neil. Why is this man not a household nameHollywood heavyweight? His roles are always full of inspiration energy and tragic emotion that never fail to move an audience. His role in this movie is fresh unhindered and never pretentious as the cautionary tale of the movie. And then we have Ethan Hawke in one of his earliest roles as the pointofview character. The entire supporting cast is very strong also providing the foundation and serve as the various emotional ties that further involve us in the story. Josh Charles's role as Knox Overstreet is a role that almost all guys can relate to wholeheartedly. And of course all the actors who are in that Dead Poets Society do a fine job.And lastly the story. I won't summarize it since it's been summarized many times here but I will say that it is one of the best coming of age stories for not only adolescents but anyone. I have personally heard from ninetofivers who were inspired by this movie to change the situations of their jobs careers relationships for the better. I first saw this movie when I was 13 and immediately stamped crowned and elevated this movie as my alltime favorite. Now that I am 18 and living on my own with very different concerns than back then I turn back to this movie over and over again to find inspiration solace and of course entertainment. It is still my alltime favorite and it still inspires me to seize the day and make my life extraordinary.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have no need to summarize this movie seeing as how most people tend to do that anyway so therefore any addition of such would simply be frivilous. However I am somewhat disappointed to see how people tend to misinterprate this film by proclaiming that the movie's message of carpe deium is derailed by the fact that those who apply it end up losing.  This could not be further from the truth.  In the beginning when the young men are first introduced to this idea of sucking the marrow out of life it is applied by the students when its results prove to be fun and joyous.  The point really driven home by the movie though is to stand up for one's beliefs throughout all of life no matter how hard it may prove.  Now while the character of Neil does try to do what he feels he must without regard to his father in the end he doesn't stand up at all but simply accepts his father's authority.  Some may not like it but his story serves to prove just how important it is to stand one's ground no matter how hard it may be.  It's not only his character but in fact every character in the film that does not fully understand Mr. Keating's message until the very end by finally doing what they feel is right now matter how much the opposing forces deny this basic truth.  I urge everyone to give this movie a chance and to see it for what it really is.  It may just change your life.".

	schema:headline " A masterful tribute to teaching at its best";
	schema:reviewBody "Dead Poets Society is to use a clich a cinematic masterpiece. I can watch it over and over absorbing more nuances of meaning every time. As a former teacher myself albeit of science I view it as a tribute to the profession at its best...teaching not merely the subject but also the person and having a lifelong impact on students' lives.The setting is Weldon Academy a very traditional New England boys' prep school in 1959. If I can find one flaw with the movie...and there certainly aren't many...it's the underlying premise that seems to worship free thought and implies that ALL tradition is of necessity undesirable and thus to be avoided. Frankly compared to modern classrooms which are bastions of free expression I found the Weldon students' respectful treatment of their teachers rather refreshing. But perhaps that's just the exteacher in me coming out! Some of Weldon's ideals generally referred to in mocking tones are actually qualities to which parents rightfully DO hope their offspring will aspire.Robin Williams plays Mr. Keating the English teacher we all wish we'd had. He brings warmth passion and an endearing quiet humor to the role as he fosters individualism in a school environment of total conformity endeavoring to teach these young men both the beauty of the English language and the importance of living life to the full of seizing the day. How many of us mentally revolted at the dissection of poetry when we were in school? Many a viewer will both chortle and rejoice when Mr. Keating has his class rip out the methodical emotionless Introduction to Poetry from the time honored Pritchard textbook! The Dead Poets Society and the boys on which Mr. Keating has such a profound impact include an interesting mix of characters...Neil Perry the passionate young man at odds with his father's clearly defined expectations for his son's life Todd Anderson the classic shy adolescent through whose eyes we view the unfolding drama Charlie Dalton the quintessential rebel Knox Overstreet the teen with whom most viewers can identify deep in the throes of first love and Richard Cameron the mindless conformist.Ethan Hawke gives a moving performance as Todd the younger brother of a former Weldon valedictorian and my personal favorite who undergoes a character transformation as the plot unfolds. In a sense this movie is really Todd's story. As another reviewer has wisely pointed out his best scenes are sometimes when he has no dialogue at all. Your heart will ache for him. The subplot of young Overstreet's romance with a girl from a nearby school may not be brilliant but it provides some light entertaining relief from the main drama. Needless to say Mr. Keating's unorthodox approach meets with obstacles...from his fellow teachers from the school's ultra traditional Headmaster from Neil's overbearing father and the other parents who are depicted as a conservative status conscious lot. His encouragement of adolescent individualism leads to dramatic consequences for one student in particular triggering a dramatic scenario that engulfs most of his classmates. I don't want to give the plot away but Dead Poets Society has the most powerful ending I've experienced in the cinematic world. I could watch it over and over and tears would either come to my eyes or virtually stream down my cheeks every time.It's an intelligent film both gripping to watch and thought provoking afterward. Engaging plot memorable characters meaningful theme wonderfully done scenes and atmosphere...Dead Poets Society has it all. A special tip of my hat to the cinematography clearly it should have won an Oscar for the final scene alone.This is a mustsee movie especially if you're a high school student who hates English. It might just change your view of the subject even if your actual teacher doesn't quite measure up to Mr. Keating. And for everyone...not only Carpe Diem but a certain phrase from a Walt Whitman poem will take on incredible meaning and be remembered forever.".

	schema:headline " Thank You Captain";
	schema:reviewBody "It was with a sad reason that I re watched Dead Poets Society as we lose yet another talent and an all round good person in Robin Williams. This being my favorite Williams film I took it upon myself to honor his memory by remembering his best body of work in my opinion. Mr. Keating is the teacher that I wish I had and granted this might be a mixed opinion within the film's context but the matter of the fact is that he was no ordinary teacher and that's something you don't see very often.The thing about this film is that it doesn't shorten its importance to Williams's performance. The supporting cast is one that balances the film like no other. Every one of those students that revived the DPS is in one way or another influenced by Mr. Keating be that positively or unfortunately negatively. The story being an Oscar winning screenplay is one that I think mostly resonates with younger people and with this movie being part of my 10th grade Portuguese course I personally embraced its essence and of course its driving message of seizing the day.As I've seen here on IMDb this movie might not gather nearly uncontested praise but it is very much highly regarded today as it was 25 years ago. The final scene still gives me chills to this day and in the midst of our sad goodbye to Mr. Williams I just wanna say Thank You My Captain. It was a pleasure learning to become my own motivated person. May we all Carpe DiemRating 910".

Now I've seen it again and watched Peter Weir's filming and timing which is also great. Robin Williams is a terrific actor when he's serious. He proved it in Good Will Hunting but he proved it first here. If you liked that movie and your liking it had something to do with Williams than you will like this one. The plot is about a number of students who are taught by Williams about life. They are taught how to enjoy themselves. This ends up causing great controversy among the heads of the school. The students are terrific and even the dialogue is great. This is a movie that I can't imagine anyone not liking. It is good in every way.".

A magical film and despite it being made in 1989 still completely and maybe even more relevant to today's society. In a world of mass conformity largely created by social media and smart phone technology especially among the young and teenagers it is ever more important to be inspired by and pursue what this film teaches us. We need to find our own voice among the crowd. Make your life extraordinary. It renews inspires and restores a feeling of passion for words poems literature and life! Passion for learning and excelling  expressing ourselves. Keeping your eyes open looking backwards and forwards never down. Life is not 1 dimensional. Life is about expression expressing those many layers and dimensions which make up the fabric of life. This film completely encompasses that sentiment. Striving to find your own voice. Finding words and meanings to best depict the inner workings of your life and mind. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine law business engineering these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry beauty romance love these are what we stay alive for.You can learn a lot from this movie. In society schools nowadays we are constantly being bombarded  told how to do things why and what they mean. we are filling up our brains with junk yet we have a world of knowledge quite literally right at our fingertips. Yet have we lost a sense of curiosity? Have we stopped asking why?My favourite scene was the one in the dormitory room when the boys are playing jumping across beds and desks chasing each other round the room round and round in circles. I think the directing and camera work is fantastic here with the camera positioned in the middle of the room shooting upwards and following the boys in a rather dizzying way  it completely encompasses the ultimate freedom and spirit of the film. Powerful directing. Magical visuals autumnal lake scenes and old New England buildings. Dead poets society made me both laugh and cry a lot. Almost a therapeutically good movie. It will stay with me for a long time to come. Robin Williams was wonderful too. RIP.10 out of 10 and I want to watch it again already. Remember you are here  that life exists and identity that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. That the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. What will your verse be?Oh one extra thing. Here is my inspired 5 min poemYour verse? Quick fast tick tock Skim swipe tick tock Glowing face tick tock Head down tick tock Marching stomp tick tock.Each day tick tock Faced with a question tick tock Your verse tick tock Two roads tick tock Diverging Follow your path tick tock Open your eyes tick tock Face the world tick tock Seize the day tick tock ListenOne day tick tock Lie with the daffodils. Food for the worms. Forever Tick. Tock. Thank you for reading my short verse. Post a reply in the message boards if you too felt inspired. Oh also I'm not claiming to be Tennyson here....just an enjoyable way to spend a Sunday morning reflecting on this wonderful film I watched last night. Think of those boys at the front of the class before you choose tear it apart!  ".

On a rainy day back in 1980 something my mother sat my brother sister and me down and put on the movie Dead Poets Society. Little did I know what a profound impact that movie and its characters would have on me. The film is bursting with quotable material and my siblings and I quote it to this day O Captain My Captain Carpe Diem Seize the Day and of course Make Your Lives Extraordinary. It's not until we grow older that we can look back on a teacher like John Keating and see what he really meant to us the chances he made us take the way he made us feel alive. I look back now on Robin Williams' performance and see one of the most flawless performances of all time. When you watch the movie it's hard to think of hammy manic Robin Williams giving such a nuanced and subtle performance. It's almost as though Sean Maguire in Good Will Hunting is who John Keating became. And funny how his most subtle performances may be the ones he's most remembered for. When I heard the news of Robin's death I was taken back to this film and really felt how integral this movie actually was to my childhood. I think it was the first time my 10 year old self was truly moved in the way that adults can be moved by art. All I can say is watch this movie. You won't be sorry.".

He realized that these young men were going to be shaped in either a bad way or could shape themselves into the type of men they wanted to become.Sure everyone around them were jerks and stiffs but that is the environment of the school. People just didn't go up against all odds and everything was OK. That is exactly what Dead Poets Society was showing. Even though there were consequences to the boys being inspired and reforming Dead Poets Society they still learned to march to their own drummer. They could be boys and go for their own dreams and ambitions. This movie showed Williams in a different light and i have so much respect for his character. He believed enough in these boys to loose his job. Standing on desks may not make everything better but it shows the real meaning of the movie. These boys had been taught to conform and put their beliefs aside but Williams opened up their hearts and made a lot of people whether they liked it or not realize that tradition is not always the way to push your children. If all you can look at is the expression on Neil Perrys fathers face when he realized what his son had done then you really didn't get the point. This was not Mr. Perrys life and Williams knew that and was not about to cover up Neils dreams and tell him exactly the opposite of what he had been teaching him all along. Dead Poets Society was an unbelievable movie that showed how this teacher believed so much in his students that it changed their lives.".

Some of the best that do are perhaps Frederick Wiseman's High School High School 2 and State Legislature Laurent Cantet's The Class Nick Ray's Bigger Than Life Olivier's Term of Trial 2002's To Be and To Have and The Prime of Mrs Jean Brodie with Maggie Smith. For the most part though cinema has failed to produce many interesting teaching movies.And so Dead Poets is another mushy teacher flick which advocates independence and non conformity by sticking to a very generic and clichd movie formula. Here the maverick teacher is played by Robin Williams a wacky guy who inspires his band of students to seize the day and chase their dreams.The film was directed by Peter Weir and so it has a certain classiness which at first glance seems to differentiate it from the pack it's lowkey at times well acted and beautifully shot. It's only during Poet's last half hour that we realise how much we've been conned. And so as Weir's plot draws toward a typical I am Spartacus! ending you'll know it when you see it we begin to grasp how goofy the picture really is the film populated by one dimensional adults villainous kids ridiculously stuckup parents and a plot which reduces the art of poetry to a couple selectively chosen one liners all designed to illicit rebelliousness and non conformity.So serious is the film in its message that it even has one kid commit suicide because he is unable to break free of his father's wishes. In other words conformity literally kills physically as well as spiritually. This is a worthwhile message but the film is so conventionally manipulative in its final half that all power quickly fizzles out.For a film which pretends to profess a love for poetry you might even call this flick antipoetry. Early in the film Robin Williams draws a graph on a blackboard which he says is used to measure the worth of a poem. On one axis of the graph is a poem's importance or depth on the other axis of the graph its perfection or technique the implication being that a work of art which succeeds on both axes or very highly on one is discernibly better than others. Williams then erases this graph and orders his pupils to tear it out of their textbooks. You cannot measure the objective worth of art he says only what that art means to you personally.Later one kid who spends hours and hours toiling over his poems discarding them all because he doesn't think them any good is put in front of the classroom and told to let go and just say what comes into your head. Suddenly he becomes like all the other students in the film able to magically and whimsically create great poetry. What the film is advocating is not some kind of objectively great poetry which artists strive for and toil to create but misusing poetry as a metaphor for a kind of whimsical freedom of expression nothing matters other than your own subjective feelings and opinions. Nothing matters other than you conforming to your desires embracing your right to free speech and impulsively doing and saying what you want at any particular moment. This isn't poetry this isn't artistic expression it's just a kind of selfobsessed narcissistic rash impulsiveness.Now look at all the things the students in the film use poetry to achieve. It's all sex girls dancing or throwing things away. Very simple egotistical hedonistic or impulsive things. Children and people with bipolar disorder have been shown to act with more impulsivity than other people. Artists of course are themselves often described as being childish or possessing a child's imagination and are more prone to being bipolar. What the film is unconsciously doing is tapping into the whole artist as free and art as childish impulsiveness clich without marrying it to anything truly substantial.The limits of this approach are best observed in the film's final scenes. The young artists are given the chance to save their teacher but instead choose to save themselves. They've never been taught through poetry or art to really stand up for anything of value external to themselves. Only later when their teacher is kicked out of school do they impulsively stand on their desks and show him support. But of course now it's a wasted gesture.Significantly the one kid who stands up in defence of his teacher is the one kid who was serious about poetry and seemed sceptical of William's character. His act of standing up is the only true act of rebellion in the film the artist putting himself on the line standing up for something worthwhile. Weir completely misses the implications of this. 7.910 Generic. Worth one viewing. See If and The Magdalene Sisters.".

He is an amazing teacher the one most students would want to have but of course too great and a bit of an outsider in this boring and traditional school. He doesn't tell the students what to do he doesn't give advice he just helps them release their spirit of freedom leave their comfort zone and try new things. And the students love him look up to him trust him.And then in the end he is the one who gets punished. Not Neil's father who couldn't even be honest to himself and admit what he had done to his son. And the school didn't need the truth neither did the other parents. They all seemed soulless and heartless.I did love the last scene. It was honest and brave.

His particularly unorthodox methods of teaching soon make one realize that poetry is not something to do with rhyming words or fantasy lands but that poetry is in effect a direct means to ones disposition in life a disposition which would ring success in all avenues. His students soon change their very outlook towards life indulging in activities much to the displeasure of the academically unbending deans of the school. Harvesting discontent against Keating the deans soon latch on to the one opportunityor misopportunity I must say that comes their way in the form of Neils death to see the removal of Keating from the school and the teaching profession. The last few minutes celebrate every individualistic spirit to let you segue into a illusive reality.

To this end he orders them to tear out of their text books pages which feature commentary by the book's editor. Think he seems to be saying but first let me censor this book. Free thought through censorship? I can only assume the said literature book includes Orwell's 1984.In Orwellian fashion hypocrisy is the order of the day in DEAD POETS SOCIETY. It gives a rousing inspirational sermon Seize the day! is the teacher's motto. yet the story itself mocks the film's supposed intentions. DEAD POETS SOCIETY is about failure but it won't admit it worse it seems to believe it's own inspirational PR. The film serves up a tacked on and utterly false moment of triumph at the end but everything that proceeds that is a lesson in failure. Williams fails to teach the students to show moral courage. One student commits suicide rather than fight for his beliefs. When Williams is wrongly accused of something his supposedly adoring students turn on him like a pack of weasels. The one student who stands up for his ideals is expelled from the school and forgotten by the film. A father fails his son. The school fails its students. And the film fails its audience.Yet for some inexplicable reason people remember the film for its inspirational message Seize the day! Carpe Diem! Fine words but at no time are they supported by the empty pessimism that the film displays. The characters who do take chances are immediately and soundly punished. Those who knuckle under  showy petty acts of deviance aside  plod along.Williams is okay as the teacher but all credibility is lost when he stops to toss in imitations of Marlon Brando and John Wayne. Robert Sean Leonard comes off best as the doomed student though his suicide seems remarkably undermotivated. Kurtwood Smith offers up a wholly unconvincing stereotype as the doomed student's martinet father. Thanks to Peter Weir's efficient direction and some nice cinematography DEAD POETS SOCIETY has a facade of class but only if you don't pay too close attention to Tom Schulman's dreadful though Oscarwinning script. The irony is that a film that begs you to think is best enjoyed if you don't.".

Thanks to Peter Weir's efficient direction and some nice cinematography DEAD POETS SOCIETY has a facade of class but only if you don't pay too close attention to Tom Schulman's dreadful though Oscarwinning script. The irony is that a film that begs you to think is best enjoyed if you don't.";

	schema:reviewBody "Actually the topic of this film could be quite interesting. Its narrative as I view it is characterised by the move from bad to worse. It offers considerable psychological insight into how easily students in a very strictly ordered environment that gives them very little freedom can fall pray to a kind of sectarian leader who demands that they worship him as their 'captain' and lose the sense of reality.Two very different faces of totalitarianism are contrasted in a very interesting way. In principle it should not matter that much that this is probably not what was intended.Dostoyevski for instance was a staunch conservative who propounded a conservative nationalist and religious ideology which did not prevent him from writing novels that show an astonishing variety of ideological and philosophical topoi. Therefore it should not matter that much that as it seems the totalitarian action of the teacher was probably intended as a positive contrast to the strict order that is there at the college. But in my view in this case the ideological purpose nevertheless affects the quality of this film. It is good for provoking thought about sectarian totalitarianism but that's all. The pervasiveness of the ideological purpose dominates the whole story so much that most of the interesting qualities of the situation get lost.I would say that this is a most typically American film in the slightly derogatory sense this word often has to Europeans when used in cultural issues It is dominated by ideas such as freedom but the words remain empty devoid of liveliness and there is not the slightest hint of the idea that flight from authoritarian order could mean something else than following a sectarian leader. I do not object to depicting such bleakness in movies and it must probably be regarded as an achievement of this film that it can produce such repulsion in people who are not familiar with this kind of authoritarian society but the bleakness is disguised in such a nice and kitschy American stereotypes such as striving for freedom that I find it just bad taste.".

Tom Hanks of course can convincingly act any part in the world and his role in Apollo 13 is no exception. All of the actors involved seemed to have been given parts that they were born to play because they were so successful in the roles. The true events of the historic Apollo 13 mission are amazingly recreated here and the results are spectacular. Not only is this film wonderfully acted it also presents a nearly flawless portrayal of the time period even down to the slide rulers that were used to do calculations. The audience is literally taken back in time to the 1960's and all of these universally exciting events are brought back to life and this is one of the things that makes this movie so special. So many films try to do this and the vast majority of them fail miserably so it just feels so good to occasionally see it done right.Another thing that was used in the perfect amount in Apollo 13 was the special effects. I am entirely against excessive special effects because if they aren't justified in being in the film they can sometimes ruin the film by themselves remember The Perfect Storm?. The special effects in Apollo 13 however served the film very well. Of course the most significant special effect in the film aside from the space scenes was the zero gravity which was done flawlessly. I'm just glad that they decided to go up in one of those ZeroG planes for these scenes rather than have the actors drift lazily around and act as if they are in zero gravity because that would have taken a lot away from the film. Apollo 13 has an excellent story made even better by the fact that it is true it has great acting skillful direction and plenty of tasteful humor. It is not only a highly entertaining film but is also educational which should please parents as if they need any more pleasing than seeing their younger years brought back to life on the silver screen. Definite mustsee Apollo 13 is a contemporary classic.".

I was fortunate enough to have been a Project Engineer on the Apollo Program and I am familiar with the technical aspects of the program. But this movie was not as much about the technical aspects of the program as it was about a thrilling reallife drama that just happened to take place during a glorious time and a onceinalifetime project. Despite all of the little technical errors Ron Howard and his crew have put together a superb film one that deserved the 9 Academy Award nominations which it received. I wish that presentday filmmakers would concentrate on happy situations like this one instead of the constant barrage of drivel to which we the moviegoing public are made subject.

I was fortunate enough to have been a Project Engineer on the Apollo Program and I am familiar with the technical aspects of the program. But this movie was not as much about the technical aspects of the program as it was about a thrilling reallife drama that just happened to take place during a glorious time and a onceinalifetime project. Despite all of the little technical errors Ron Howard and his crew have put together a superb film one that deserved the 9 Academy Award nominations which it received. I wish that presentday filmmakers would concentrate on happy situations like this one instead of the constant barrage of drivel to which we the moviegoing public are made subject. Long live NASA and long live courage!!";

	schema:reviewBody "This was a very welldone true story of a space mission that came extremely close to being a disaster but the astronauts miraculously made it home safely. Except for some language problems it's good storytelling and so interesting that it made me want to study the real Apollo 13 astronauts.The movie is fairly long at 140 minutes and there is not much action but there is a lot of suspense and firstrating acting both of which should keep anyone's interest. Knowing this was a true story makes one all the more involved with it. You can usually count of Director Ron Howard putting out an interesting and wellphotographed film.What also was interesting to me too was to see these actors most of whom usually play volatile characters or did prior to this film  act in such lowkey roles. I refer to Ed Harris Gary Sinise Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon. By the way one of the young Lovell children was played by Miko Hughes who became a co star in a film  Mercury Rising  several years later.For such a tense story with these astronauts lives on the line none of the astronauts or people at NASA or anyone's family members are ever seeing praying throughout this ordeal! You can bet in real life a lot of prayers were answered on this mission. Overall this is good moviemaking and recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many would argue that because it is based on true events history ruins the ending of Apollo 13 and thus its thriller aspect is worthless. I will confess to ignorance here I knew next to nothing about the reallife mission and thus I was able to really enjoy the movie's thriller aspect.The first half hour of Apollo 13 basically introduces the main characters. Its slow pace actually helps it in the long run it plods along and finds its own comfortable pace. Some mightn't like this but I did. As soon as a little complication is introduced involving Gary Sinise's character the movie skyrockets forward and doesn't stop. Characters that we've gotten to know and care for are then involved in one scary series of events making the film that much more thrilling.Ron Howard really knows how to direct. The suspense sequences of Apollo 13 work out fantastically. He doesn't add unnecessary material to the film to make it more popular to the masses. There is no asteroid field sequence that a superficial teen audience would go crazy over. As a result the film really feels like it is taking place in outer space. This adds a layer of realism to the fantastic special effects and the film is that much better.An added bonus is Tom Hanks in the lead role as Jim Lovell. He is one of the few popular actors who really deserve all the praise. Hanks adds a touch of humanity to his role he doesn't feel like an unerring invincible protagonist and he doesn't feel like a Gary Sue who will mess up at all the appropriate times. As the ship's crew begins to argue Hanks joins in the shouting trying to break it up. But it isn't his voice that stops the arguing. Hanks makes his character and the danger he is in feel real. That takes real talent.But Hanks is not the only one who deserves praise. Every single actor in the film from Gary Sinise to Ed Harris does a fantastic job. Their characters are not imitations of reallife personages they are their own. Everyone seems to fit their character perfectly even Jim Lovell's elderly mother who is introduced lamenting that her son's broadcast is not on TV.Arguably Apollo 13's most pleasant surprise is found in its gentle inclusion of comic relief. It doesn't seem intrusive or inappropriate. The best way to describe it is gentle. For instance two worldfamous astronauts are introduced to Jim's mother as regular ordinary young men. It's funny and doesn't seem forced into the plot.The Verdict Apollo 13 is a splendid little film thrilling when it has to be comic at times and carried all the way by splendid performances from all the actors. Solid direction and superb visual effects just add to make it the great film it is.Overall Rating 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "This review is designed for people like me who have seen Apollo 13 dozens of times. Apollo 13 is one of my favorite movies for several reasons and here is a short rant the movie was robbed at the 1995 Oscars. It could have been Best Picture and either Ed Harris or Karen Quinlan could have won best supporting actoractress. At the time the movie was released people wondered whether it would be Tom Hank's third Oscar in a row. The role of James Lovell was too normal and the movie too much of an ensemble film for him to have had a chance. Of course that doesn't take anything away from his brilliant understated performance.The movie premiered around Memorial Day 1995 and I saw it that first weekend in an oldfashioned multiplex before stadium seating. Seen in a theater this movie wraps you in and rockets you back to 1970. It also puts you in a fourth chair in the Command and Lunar modules. I was around for the original Apollo 13 incident I was the same age as the younger Lovell daughter. Yet even knowing the whole outcome I was still enthralled with the intricacy of the whole plot and all of the characters. The corridor control burn where the astronauts have to floor the engines and get the LEM back on course was especially exciting in the theater. I think all of the air got sucked out of it by people gasping! Last year I was lucky enough to meet Tracy Reiner who played Mary Heise. She told me some neat insider information about the movie such as how they filmed the Lift off scenes at Long Beach CA and not Florida. Tracy also said that in the arresting scene where she and Marilyn Karen Quinlan gaze upward at the ascending rocket with tears in their eyes they are actually watching a hanky being hoisted up a flagpole. She also said she filmed most of her scenes with a broken toe.One of the movie's best scenes was the docking sequence. In the hands of a lesser director it would have been a hohum forgettable scene. Yet Ron Howard rachets up the drama by crosscutting between Ed Harris and the actor playing Deke Slayton as they worry about Jack Swigert a last minute replacement performing a critical command module maneuver C'mon rookie park that thing. As many other reviewers have said the producers did a perfect job recreating 1970. I laughed at the part where the one Lovell daughter says about the other She's still moaning about the stupid Beatles breaking up! The older daughter swishes the door open and shoots back They're not stupid you're stupid! This brings up another point whoever did the costuming for the movie absolutely nailed the look of 1970 clothing and hair fashions. Yet the movie was not nominated for a costume Oscar. I guess you have to be an 1800s or earlier period drama to be considered for that category.At the time the incident originally occurred we followed along in social studies class. I always knew that they would get the astronauts back safe and sound but of course I was an innocent kid. Still the way the producers handled the reentry was absolutely breathtaking. I can still see the condensation from the instrument panels dripping down on Lovell Heise and Swigert. There was such a dramatic buildup of the broadcast delay from reentry it had me and everyone else in the theatre going Wait a minute... until the static crackled and James Lovell's voice triumphantly booms over the speakers. Everyone in the theater cheered just like the people in mission control.Apollo 13 didn't get the credit it deserved in the year it was released but it is still one of the best movies ever made period.".

There was such a dramatic buildup of the broadcast delay from reentry it had me and everyone else in the theatre going Wait a minute... until the static crackled and James Lovell's voice triumphantly booms over the speakers. Everyone in the theater cheered just like the people in mission control.Apollo 13 didn't get the credit it deserved in the year it was released but it is still one of the best movies ever made period.";

	schema:reviewBody "As if to prove that the number 13 is truly unlucky  as superstitious people have been telling us for years  the 13th Apollo space mission was a catalogue of disastrous mishaps from start to finish. Ron Howard directs this film version of the events surrounding the illfated mission with great attention to the technical detail making it almost documentarylike in approach. But while some documentaries are rather cold and distant Howard remembers to keep the emotional drama in his film tense and involving just as it must have been as the events unfolded for real back in the spring of 1970.Astronaut Jim Lovell Tom Hanks has long dreamed of setting foot on the moon and gets his chance when chosen to be a member of the Apollo 13 moon landing mission in 1970. The three man team also includes Jack Swigert Kevin Bacon and Fred Haise Bill Paxton. During their flight to the moon the three astronauts make regular live transmissions that they believe will be televised down on Earth. However their TV slot has been axed without them knowing it as noone seems particularly interested any more in the rather dull and technical terminology associated with space travel. The mission is destined to become the centre of everyone's attention however when a routine oxygen tank procedure goes awry and leads to an explosion. The Apollo shuttle is suddenly marooned in space with little power little control and little air. The objective of landing on the moon is replaced with the sole aim of getting the astronauts back home alive. In Houston scientists struggle against the odds to plan a way to bring the astronauts back to safety working around the clock to solve various logistical problems facing them. Meanwhile Lovell's wife Marilyn Kathleen Quinlan must hold together her family as they face the terrifying possibility of losing their beloved Jim. And aboard the shuttle itself the three astronauts endure several days of unrelenting doubts and fears as their very lives hang by a thread.Apollo 13 is a superb recreation of the true story. Its most impressive achievement is that it manages to generate genuine gnawing tension in spite of the fact that most viewers already know the outcome. The performances are firstrate throughout with Hanks Bacon and Paxton exceptional as the endangered space travellers Quinlan totally convincing as Lovell's distraught wife and Ed Harris in commanding form as the mission controller sweating it out down in Houston. William Broyles Jr and Al Reinert provide an excellent script which makes absolute sense of the potentially confusing technical dialogue and also explores the emotional toll of the ordeal realistically and effectively. The final scene especially in which communication is lost as the astronaut's reenter the Earth's atmosphere is so taut that you can feel your heart thumping inside your chest. The film is a celebration of human determination  some have criticised it for its unapologetic flagwaving and patriotism but such criticisms seem to me to be missing the point. This is not so much about America conquering the odds more a film about the human spirit in general conquering the odds. And that's a message that we should all take from the film with open arms. Apollo 13 is an outstanding film indeed.".

The truth is Jack Swigert wrote the emergency procedures for the command module the very ones the crew used when the emergency happened. It was said they were lucky Swagert was on the flight as he was one of the best to handle the situation.

It's the true story of the 1970 mission to the moon where the famous Houston we have a problem quote originated. Other documentaries tell the same story but this 1995 version directed by Ron Howard is a mustsee masterpiece.The lead character of mission commander Jim Lovell is played by Tom Hanks. My 10thgrade students watched it and recognized Hanks' voice as Woody from Toy Story. Lovell refuses to be superstitious about the number 13. When his crew is moved up from Apollo 14 to 13 his wife asks Why does it have to be 13? Because it follows 12 he replies. Lovell is funny smart and a good leader. He was a step ahead of mission control and always had his crew working ahead of mission director's requests. Before this mission Lovell had flown three missions for NASA but now he wanted to walk on the moon in the worst way.Unfortunately the crew winds up facing a catastrophe that threatens their mission to the moon and their lives. Instead of using the lunar module to land on the moon they have to first live in it to survive their flight. The amazing thing is how director Ron Howard lets us experience everyone's journey not just the astronauts. We also see the mission controllers arguing and problem solving. Lovell's wife Marilyn is shown each step of the way constantly adding depth and emotion to balance the technical NASA speak.Emotional balance and master pacing is a hallmark of Ron Howard's films. All of his movies which include Cacoon Splash Backdraft A Beautiful Mind etc. have emotional cores that anchor them. You come away feeling like you've had a truly human experience.I am addicted to this movie once I see a scene of it while flipping through channels it's impossible to turn it off. I have to watch it to the end. I have almost studied it frame by frame for the unusual camera angles and another time for the pacing of humor to make the tension bearable.I'm not sure I'll ever grasp all the magnificence of this movie but I think if I keep trying all my storytelling will improve.Ultimately there's something for everyone in this film so watch if you haven't seen it. Watch it again if you have!".

I would'nt cross town in one of these but men of determination dedication vision and belief set off for what has been until now the greatest adventure of all time.Inevitably something was always going to go wrong and this was Apollo 13. That through ingenuity analysis and bravery under fire so to speak the crew returned to Earth is every bit as remarkable as what the story suggests.The settings are realistic down to clothes hairstyles and the like. The fusion of the event with the more mundane aspects of family life add to the realism. The acting is strong and believable and I particularly liked the interpretation of Lovell's wife who manages to blend support of her husband with fear and concern while trying to run a relatively normal household.The parts of the three astronauts are well portrayed. Hanks who I wax and wane on does a good job and Kevin Bacon is plausible as Swigert even if his bachelor status is a bit overcooked. Gary Sinese as always is terrific and his role in the rescue of the mission is a little overstated but he is just as good here as he was as Capt. Dan in Forest Gump. Ed Harris also as is usual is very good and I particularly liked his waistcoat.This makes a great companion piece to The Right Stuff another of my favourite movies and anyone interested in the space program and where it came from should have both in their DVD collection along with the documentary piece In the Shadow of the Moon and the TV series From the Earth to the Moon.".

Down on the ground the acting is also exemplary Kathleen Quinlan as the fraught Marylyn Lovell is fantastic with Ed Harris Gene Kranz and Gary Sinise Ken Mattingly adding emotional weight to the unfolding drama. With Howard reining in his trade mark sentimental flourishes Apollo 13 relies on its story and its craft to steer it safely home and safely home it gets just like the men of Apolo 13. To give us a punch the air joy that comes as much out of tension relief as it does because of raw human emotion quite a picture indeed. 810".

No from Sean Connery are really my top three all time favorite James Bond 007 films. This was originally the first James Bond film I saw as a kid. Goldfinger was also my dad's favorite James Bond film and in years it become a cult classic. Even for 53 year old movie it still a classic the best 007 flick. I love it to death I am enjoying it and I have so much fun watching it. This movie has so much action action action and more action. Sean Connery does an excellent performance as James Bond 007 I'm a hardcore James Bond fan. I make no apologies for believing that even the late Sean Connery is the closest thing we've seen to IAN FLEMING's James Bond. Everyone who watched this movie know is a really good Bond movie.The reason why is this movie so good  James Bond has new cool car Aston Martin DB5 build with smoke screen in which can throw a co driver seat out of the car and the revolving licence plate. The car also has other applications such as 30 calibre machine guns Tireshredding blade Oil smoke and water emitters. Actress Shirley Eaton as the murdered Jill Masterson is one of the most enduring images in cinematic history. The girl is painted with gold and dies. Memorable and cool villains like are Auric Goldfinger and Oddjob  Goldfinger's second henchman. Oddjob wears a Sandringham hat with a sharpened steel rim he is using it as a lethal weapon in the style of a chakram. The movie has great sexy beautiful girls like Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore Shirley Eaton as Jill Masterson and Tania Mallet as Tilly Masterson. Cool dialogues I love it so much.Do you expect me to talk? No Mr. Bond I expect you to die! This was directed by director Guy Hamilton it was his first James Bond 007 film the first two films were directed by Terence Young in which he directed Thunderball next Bond movie after this one. This movie also didn't evolve around SPECTRE this time like was in the first two film it was about a brilliant mastermind criminal in which he planed to blow off Fort Knox to get more profits for his Gold brilliant! It has beautiful great music score by John Barry I love it. The car Aston Martin DB5 James Bond 007 was driving was so cool it has so many accessories it was beautiful to watch it.Investigating a gold magnate's smuggling James Bond uncovers a plot to contaminate the Fort Knox gold reserve.This movie has so much impact it is well acted it has great brilliant plot.Gert Frbe R.I.P was brilliant and excellent as Goldfinger the original villain. He gave his powerful performance as the bad guy from the title of the movie. I love him in this movie.Harold Sakata R.I.P. as Oddjob was great villain just like Goldfinger he was really strong and excellent in hand to hand combat. Oddjob and Jaws are two great Bond villains.Honor Blackman is the first of a long line of James Bond females with patently sexual names And ho could ever forget Shirley Eaton's introduction in the film? She is lying on a chaise longue on the balcony of Goldfinger's Miami Beach hotel suite attired in black bra and panties while she observes Mr. Simmons' Austin Willis gin hand through binoculars.What more could you ask for? Well how about a film in which Bond actually does something? For the whole 2nd half of this movie he's just a prisoner who fails every attempt to escape signal his superiors or even deactivate the bomb himself. Even killing Oddjob at the end is ultimately meaningless as he's still trapped in the vault with a bomb he can't disarm until the Army rescues him.Goldfinger is a 1964 British spy film and the third instalment in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions starring Sean Connery as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. It is based on the novel of the same name by Ian Fleming. The film also stars Honor Blackman as Bond girl Pussy Galore and Gert Frbe as the title character Auric Goldfinger along with Shirley Eaton as the iconic Bond girl Jill Masterson. Goldfinger was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman and was the first of four Bond films directed by Guy Hamilton.1010 Goldfinger and The Spy Who Loved me has such a great villains and they are both in my top 10 James Bond favorite films. I just love and enjoy watching this film. Goldfinger in my opinion is MILES way better then Daniel Craig's last three films he did. This movie deserves a cult classic status movies like this will never be so good like was Goldfinger. It is quintessential James Bond 007 action cult classic film I love this movie to death it is my number one favorite Sean Connery's James Bond 007 film.".

	schema:headline " Best Bond movie ever.";
	schema:reviewBody "Goldfinger could best be described as the quintessential definitive Bond film the first of the series to set the necessities of the entire saga in motion. It is also the best of the Bond movies arguably the most suave and sophisticated far superior to the Roger Moore era and those who followed in Connery's footsteps. It is the Bond ultimatum so to speak.Goldfinger was the first of the iconic legacy to feature Q Desmond Llewelyn as a recurring comic relief figure. He was introduced in From Russia with Love the second film in the series where he was credited as Major Boothroyd and given little screen time. It was also the first to truly setup the suave nature of 007 the tongueincheek humor absent in the first movie Dr. No the farfetched gadgetry including fast cars this one being an AstonMartin and arguably the first of the series to feature the famous line Bond James Bond as a 007 catchphrase versus a mere line of dialogue. When Bond storms out onto the patio of the motel room the camera zooms in towards his face the 007 theme song roars through the speakers and he says his motto with cool confidence. It's Bond baby.Both of Goldfinger's predecessors were darker more serious motion pictures  more intune with the writing of Fleming versus the suaveness to later be salvaged from the series with the third installment. Although Dr. No was a terrific movie and although From Russia with Love is exciting Goldfinger beats them both. It features the best and most famous Bond villain to ever grace the screen constantly spoofed in countless productions Goldfinger Gert Frbe the target of Austin Powers in Goldmember and according to IMDb referenced and spoofed in well over 100 other productions.There isn't much of a plot really. Goldfinger plans to rob Fort Knox and become the richest man in the world. Bond finds out and tries to put a stop to his mission. What entices us and what makes the film so entertaining despite the absurdity is its leniency towards itself. It doesn't mind being silly because the entertainment value far outweighs any flaws. Plus it has some of the most memorable scenes in history and arguably the best Villain Explanation Scene to ever be recorded. Do you expect me to talk Goldfinger? Bond Sean Connery asks as a laser beam slowly makes its way towards his groin. No Mr. Bond I expect you to die! he says with mock ridicule before walking away. The following shots is one of the only sequences in James Bond history where the iconic character actually seems fairly worried that fate may be playing a deadly hand.Released in 1964 forty years later it stands as one of the most risqu Bond films to date. Especially for its time there is brief nudity during the opening credits sexual scenes constant innuendo including a Bond girl named Pussy Galore played by Honor Blackman and implications of lesbianism.Galore's sexual orientation is not delved into as deeply and explicitly as it may be dealt with in today's day and age but the inclusion exists.

	onyx:emotionText "Goldfinger could best be described as the quintessential definitive Bond film the first of the series to set the necessities of the entire saga in motion. It is also the best of the Bond movies arguably the most suave and sophisticated far superior to the Roger Moore era and those who followed in Connery's footsteps. It is the Bond ultimatum so to speak.Goldfinger was the first of the iconic legacy to feature Q Desmond Llewelyn as a recurring comic relief figure. He was introduced in From Russia with Love the second film in the series where he was credited as Major Boothroyd and given little screen time. It was also the first to truly setup the suave nature of 007 the tongueincheek humor absent in the first movie Dr. No the farfetched gadgetry including fast cars this one being an AstonMartin and arguably the first of the series to feature the famous line Bond James Bond as a 007 catchphrase versus a mere line of dialogue. When Bond storms out onto the patio of the motel room the camera zooms in towards his face the 007 theme song roars through the speakers and he says his motto with cool confidence. It's Bond baby.Both of Goldfinger's predecessors were darker more serious motion pictures  more intune with the writing of Fleming versus the suaveness to later be salvaged from the series with the third installment. Although Dr. No was a terrific movie and although From Russia with Love is exciting Goldfinger beats them both. It features the best and most famous Bond villain to ever grace the screen constantly spoofed in countless productions Goldfinger Gert Frbe the target of Austin Powers in Goldmember and according to IMDb referenced and spoofed in well over 100 other productions.There isn't much of a plot really. Goldfinger plans to rob Fort Knox and become the richest man in the world. Bond finds out and tries to put a stop to his mission. What entices us and what makes the film so entertaining despite the absurdity is its leniency towards itself. It doesn't mind being silly because the entertainment value far outweighs any flaws. Plus it has some of the most memorable scenes in history and arguably the best Villain Explanation Scene to ever be recorded. Do you expect me to talk Goldfinger? Bond Sean Connery asks as a laser beam slowly makes its way towards his groin. No Mr. Bond I expect you to die! he says with mock ridicule before walking away. The following shots is one of the only sequences in James Bond history where the iconic character actually seems fairly worried that fate may be playing a deadly hand.Released in 1964 forty years later it stands as one of the most risqu Bond films to date. Especially for its time there is brief nudity during the opening credits sexual scenes constant innuendo including a Bond girl named Pussy Galore played by Honor Blackman and implications of lesbianism.Galore's sexual orientation is not delved into as deeply and explicitly as it may be dealt with in today's day and age but the inclusion exists. Bond struggles verbally with Galore trying to woo and seduce her and she subtly implies from their very first meeting that she will not be seduced claiming it is impossible for Bond to get very far with her thereby insinuating that she is in fact a lesbian. According to the director of the film Guy Hamilton the entire situation is given much more emphasis in the novel by Ian Fleming but it was simply too foul a subject for audiences back in 1964.

	schema:reviewBody "First of all I must state for the record Sean Connery is THE James Bond. Even though the first Bond film I ever saw was For Your Eyes Only with Roger Moore. I was very young and very much drawn in. I have seen every one of the Bond films and without a doubt Goldfinger is the finest the 007 saga has to offer.Before I had begun an appreciation of the Connery films i.e. before I'd seen them a good friend and cartooning mentor Ross Paperman sorted me out. He helped me see how Connery's Bond was suave and sophisticated but also demonstrated a quality the other Bonds do not portray fear. Not a panicky soilyourpants kind of fear mind you. But Connery's Bond actually has a few anxious sweatsoakedbrow moments. A perfect example is when Bond is strapped to a table as Goldfinger's captive with a laser beam primed to cut him in half. 007 has to think fast. Do you expect me to talk? No Mr. Bond I expect you to die! A famous scene and line from Bond's most enjoyable film.Perhaps what makes the earlier films more enjoyable is that they had fresh innovative elements that have now become clich and gimmicky. The new films are often stale and already covered ground and they don't even appear to be trying anymore.But it's more than that. Even watching Goldfinger today having seen all the latest in special effects and technology that Hollywood has to offer it still is riveting and thoroughly entertaining. That is also without the added advantage of being overly nostalgic about Goldfinger. How could I? I hadn't even been born when it first hit theaters and it was far from my first 007 experience. The story the characters and the fun of Goldfinger is timeless and if given a chance could probably rope in a whole new generation of fans. It just doesn't seem likely to happen.Much of the satire from the Austin Powers films is directly derived from the Connery films especially Goldfinger and Dr. No proving their lasting effect on popular culture. As well John Barry's scores from the Connery films are finding their way into the ears of a new generation through pop music as snippets from his soundtracks are sampled by such artists as Robbie Williams Mono and Curve to name a few.But if by some fluke you read this and you haven't seen Goldfinger yet do yourself right and acquaint yourself with the real James Bond. You'll probably be hooked by the time you hear Shirley Bassey's voice in the famous opening theme.".

	schema:reviewBody "Goldfinger was the third Bond film and on its release in 1964 proved itself to be the first blockbuster of the series firmly establishing OO7 in the public imagination. Dr No and From Russia with Love had both been successful but Goldfinger outperformed both at the Box Office and in the process laid down the guidelines for nearly every Bond film that has followed since.There is undoubtedly much to admire about the film not least the memorable Shirley Bassey theme song still one of the best. Guy Hamilton directs with impressive assurance the locations are excellent and  Sean Connery is once again the epitome of cool as Bond although he is not as menacing as he was in the first two films. He is however still a believable character and finds himself in genuine danger during the film having to rely on his wits to survive.  Goldfinger is one of the great Bond villains played with real bonhomie by Gert Frobe who succeeds in making him a more fleshedout character than many of the onedimensional baddies of later films. The wonderfullynamed Pussy Galore meanwhile is one of the best Bond girls. Honor Blackman plays her as a woman with real spirit and intelligence and it is a pity she does not get more screen time.Goldfinger also introduced several elements which have since become cliches of the Bond series. For the first time Bond visits Q's workshop to pick up his equipment and for the first time he receives some fancy gadgets packaged up in the famous and stylish Aston Martin. The film is also injected with a lot more humour than its predecessors with OO7 throwing out oneliners more frequently and a somewhat camper tone being introduced to proceedings. As Oddjob Howard Sakata is the first in a long line of totally silent but lethal henchmen. He is not as good as Red Grant in From Russia with Love who spoke but his deadly hat is memorable and he is a formidable opponent for Bond.Good as it is however it could be argued that Goldfinger had a malign influence on many of its successors. Because it was so successful the Bond producers became convinced that later OO7 releases should follow the same gadgetled tongueincheek style but on a grander scale. As a result Goldfinger began the shift away from the relatively serious hardedged tone of the first two films towards the lighthearted visual spectaculars that would come to dominate the franchise in the 1970s. Taken on its own terms though Goldfinger certainly ranks as one of the best Bond films and is much better than the later ones which tried hardest to mimic and outdo it. Personally I like the tougher films in the franchise the best especially From Russia with Love but Goldfinger is the most enjoyable Bond film of its kind and deserves its classic status.".

He is however still a believable character and finds himself in genuine danger during the film having to rely on his wits to survive.  Goldfinger is one of the great Bond villains played with real bonhomie by Gert Frobe who succeeds in making him a more fleshedout character than many of the onedimensional baddies of later films. The wonderfullynamed Pussy Galore meanwhile is one of the best Bond girls. Honor Blackman plays her as a woman with real spirit and intelligence and it is a pity she does not get more screen time.Goldfinger also introduced several elements which have since become cliches of the Bond series. For the first time Bond visits Q's workshop to pick up his equipment and for the first time he receives some fancy gadgets packaged up in the famous and stylish Aston Martin. The film is also injected with a lot more humour than its predecessors with OO7 throwing out oneliners more frequently and a somewhat camper tone being introduced to proceedings. As Oddjob Howard Sakata is the first in a long line of totally silent but lethal henchmen. He is not as good as Red Grant in From Russia with Love who spoke but his deadly hat is memorable and he is a formidable opponent for Bond.Good as it is however it could be argued that Goldfinger had a malign influence on many of its successors. Because it was so successful the Bond producers became convinced that later OO7 releases should follow the same gadgetled tongueincheek style but on a grander scale. As a result Goldfinger began the shift away from the relatively serious hardedged tone of the first two films towards the lighthearted visual spectaculars that would come to dominate the franchise in the 1970s. Taken on its own terms though Goldfinger certainly ranks as one of the best Bond films and is much better than the later ones which tried hardest to mimic and outdo it. Personally I like the tougher films in the franchise the best especially From Russia with Love but Goldfinger is the most enjoyable Bond film of its kind and deserves its classic status.";

In fact its somewhat ridiculous the amount of times its been repeated and having seen it so many times after more than 25 years I find it impossible to say much on it.I will say however that future Bond production teams seem to have taken all the lesser bits of GOLDFINGER while completely ignoring all the good elements . The lesser bits are the awful puns like  Shocking  and  He blew a fuse  . How many times have you watched a Bond movie where the hero has dispatched a bad guy and youve made your own pun which is ten times better than the one Bond says to camera ? Exactly . Of course in 1964 these one liners might have been ground breaking but after the franchise has gone on you feel that the screenwriters have been ordered to write a sequence so that Bond can make a groan inducing one liner . Oh and I havent even mentioned Pussy Galore  Insert your own joke here   this is another thing that the producers seem obsessed with  woman with completely unreal names  everytime someone makes a Bond movie we get a Plenty O Toole or some such weird name . The novelty wears out very quickly .What I liked about GOLDFINGER is that James Bond is shown as being vulnerable  its about the only film in the franchise when he is unable to save the lives of his lovers for example  and lets not forget the classic scene of the lazer beam creeping up the table where he has to use his wits  and has anyone noticed that he doesnt actually save the day at the Fort Knox climax ? He doesnt even need to be there . Compare that scenario with the later Bond movies  Especially the Roger Moore ones  when he stops the baddies single handed in a ridiculously contrived and OTT manner  such a pity they dont make Bond films like this anymore .Despite seeing GOLDFINGER more times than I care to mention Ill no doubt watch it again next time its on British television".

Goldfinger lacks the suspense and intrigue Dr. No and From Russia With Love had as well as the well staged action. The plot of Goldfinger while good on paper is executed without any type of suspense or build up. Everything just sort of happens. Goldfinger himself is also highly overrated as a villain. Even the most cartoonish of villains like Scaramanga and Drax feel more threatening than Goldfinger. Another overrated aspect in my eyes is Pussy Galore. Whats so great about her? She does next to nothing the whole film and she is regard as one of if not the best Bond girl. I guess its just the name.All in all I find Goldfinger completely unremarkable. It lacks the suspense and well executed plot of the previous two films and the sheer fun later films had.510".

The plot of Goldfinger while good on paper is executed without any type of suspense or build up. Everything just sort of happens. Goldfinger himself is also highly overrated as a villain. Even the most cartoonish of villains like Scaramanga and Drax feel more threatening than Goldfinger. Another overrated aspect in my eyes is Pussy Galore. Whats so great about her? She does next to nothing the whole film and she is regard as one of if not the best Bond girl. I guess its just the name.All in all I find Goldfinger completely unremarkable. It lacks the suspense and well executed plot of the previous two films and the sheer fun later films had.510";

NO and THUNDERBALL the best of the Sean Connery as James Bond movies.The story is simply one of the best for a Bond movie the movie is full of action sequences the acting is great and the theme song by Shirley Bassey is just a delight to hear at. And there are lots of great gadgets too!The characters are the best in a 007 movie. James Bond is charming and womanizer as ever Pussy Galore is stunning and so Jill Masterson. And the villains Goldfinger and henchman Oddjob are topnotch and Goldfinger is bizarre because he is obsessed with gold objects.I liked in particular the gadgets like Oddjob's hat that cuts everything and liked also Shirley Eaton's silver death the fight between Bond and Oddjob and Goldfinger's death sucked from a plane!!.And the acting is great. Sean Connery is great as always Honor Blackman and Shirley Eaton are very SEXY and perfect for their roles and Gert Frobe is a perfect villain!In the end a masterpiece and one of the best movies ever in the James Bond franchise!".

Many people put forward their actor who they think is the best Bond but in Goldfinger and Thunderball Connery shows he IS James Bond. Goldfinger is perhaps one of the greatest villains in Bond history as his plans are evil and ingenious. The Bond girl played by Honor Blackman is superb and probably the first Bond girl who shows she can hold her own and is very much his equal.

The Masterson sisters are in the film only briefly with Jill of course being painted with gold in a classic image.Auric Goldfinger is one of the best Bond villains ever and is played with panache by Gert Frobe. The scenes between him and Bond are filled with genuine tension. His henchmen Oddjob is also one of the best villains of the series. Along with Jaws he is the most invincible of the Bond henchmen.The plot while not as gritty or serious as From Russia With Love is very engaging with Goldfinger's classic plan to raid Fort Knox. The production set is delightful taking place in places such as Miami and Kentucky.From the opening scene to the chase scene with the Aston Martin Bond's best vehicle ever! to the battle at Fort Knox to the climax in the plane the action scenes will have you on the edge of your seat.The script is witty and the film moves at a brisk pace. There are too many classic scenes to name and the title song by Shirley Bassey is one of the best.This is unquestionably the most iconic Bond movie and for my money it was also the allaround best Bond movie until Skyfall came out.

In my opinion Goldfinger is one of the best films of the Connery era and is certainly superior to Dr. No and From Russia With Love.Bond fans will love this movie. Bond fans like the series because of the gadgets the girls the cars the villains the humour and the action. This Bond film had all that...and more.In the film Bond goes up against gold smuggler Auric Goldfinger played by the late Gert Frobe. Goldfinger is a great villain equal to Blofeld in my opinion. He is joined by the mute Oddjob played by the late Harold Sakata. Oddjob is an invincible and deadly bodyguard who gives Bond a real run for his money.The dialogue in this film is superb. In one scene Bond is strapped to a table with a laser heading for his groin. He asks Goldfinger Do you expect me to talk? No Mr. Bond I expect you to die replies Goldfinger. It certainly was a tense scene as the laser headed for Bond's groin area.Connery is great in this film. His humour is just brilliant always defying danger and death with a sarcastic comment. As for the fight scene in Fort Knox between Bond and Oddjob well it was a fantastic scene and credit must go to both actors for it.I would be committing a crime if I didn't mention Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore. She is probably the most intriguing of all the Bond girls and she isn't one of those typical Bond girls who caters to 007's whims.All in all a classic Bond film. I would recommend heading to the video store and buying it to keep.".

Let me list them 1 The number two person in the conspiracy to nuke Fort Knox changes sides and betrays her comrades...because Bond slept with her? Gimme a break. Judging from her personality she'd be about the last person in the world I'd expect to do such a thing. It's obvious that the writers couldn't think of any way of getting out of the corner they'd written themselves into so they tossed in a deus ex machina copout ending.2 Bond just doesn't do much of anything in this movie. He spends the last half of the movie sitting in a cell while other characters run around and do things that don't advance the plot one bit. It's boring. I appreciate the fact that he uses his brains to get out of trouble but he never really gets out of trouble he just turns a bad situation into a slightly less bad one. This is about the only Bond movie where he's so ineffectual and it makes for a very unentertaining film.3 Bond allows himself to be captured by the bad guys so that he can go and check on the condition of a woman who got hit with a flying hat? He barely knew her! He gave her a ride to a gas station that's it. It makes no sense that he'd jeopardize his mission in order to check on the condition of a stranger. What was he going to do give her CPR? He certainly didn't want to be captured as part of any sort of plan as he spent the next ten minutes of the movie trying to get away again.4 Why didn't Goldfinger just kill Bond? He hit the nail right on the head when he said that Bond only knew the name of the operation blockbuster but he didn't know any of the details. Then Bond tells him that if he is killed they'll send another agent. Well obviously. Goldfinger certainly must have assumed as much. But how would anyone even know if Bond was killed? It was just another poorly thought out scene.5 Pussy Galore is a really unlikable character. Not only is she just plain homely but she brags and brags and brags about herself.6 The ending on the plane felt very tacked on and silly. Are we to believe that a woman and a fat guy overpowered all the soldiers in a military aircraft hanger and stole a plane right out from under their noses?Oh there are a few good things about the movie. The Swiss Alps are beautiful even in Summer. The car is really cool. And of course the theme song is fantastic.Overall this is easily the worst Connery Bond film. Much worse than any Roger Moore or Timothy Dalton or George Lazenby Bond movie. I can't for the life of me understand why people hold it in such high esteem the writing is just so ridiculously sloppy. I enjoy most of Connery's other Bond films but this thing sticks out like a big stinky sore thumb.".

I won't go too far as to say that it's the worst one because there are a few moments just a few that make it ok.   The precredits sequence is cool. The title song is cool. Oddjob is cool.....But that's it!!Auric Goldfinger turns out as a bumbling nonthreatening menace. I mean after he's been outsmarted by Bond at the card  golf games he no longer appears as a super villain and his character becomes worn out. And besides from turning Pussy Galore into a heterosexual what does 007 actually DO in this flick? He destroys the Aston Martinthe only exciting scene in the flick. He gets locked up for half of the movie. Escapes. Gets caught. Gets locked up again. Yawn Gets his a kicked by Oddjob until he uses his smarts.And then sits back  lets Leiter deactivate the bomb. Geez! And I know deep down that you GOLDFINGER lovers have to let out an embarassing chuckle when the Fort Knox army gets gassed. Yet this was the one that paved the way for the comic book approach for Bond. That can be considered good or bad. It depends on what can of James Bond fan you are. But FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is and will always be  the best of the early 007 adventures.  'Nuff Said!".

Goldfinger's allblonde alllesbian pilots violate the airspace of a United States military base crop dusting death from their Cessnas and they're not shot down by a squadron of F100's. They gas all the soldiers in Fort Knox who in turn are not really gassed because they are faking it. James Bond is held captive for what appears to be half the film. Cheesy battle between members of the armed forces and a group of Chinese criminals recruited by Mr. Goldfinger. Bond practically raped the head lesbian she turns straight and betrays all the other lesbians. Bond forces a girl to pull over in her Mustang by slashing her tires with his bladeequipped wheels on his trickedout Aston Martin. He nearly kills her in the process much like Messalah did in the chariot race in Ben Hur. The whole plot is silly and the movie is ultimately too dumb. Opening sequence was cool the Aston Martin tooling around in the Alps was cool and the theme song was incredible. Other than that it sucked. And the fat Japanese dude with the metal frisbee derby hat? Very dumb. A heavy metal derby hat is not aerodynamically designed to float like a frisbee.".

A Mondoshawan spacecraft is bringing The Fifth Element back to Earth but it is destroyed by the evil Mangalores. However a team of scientists use the DNA of the remains of the Fifth Element to rebuild the perfect being called Leeloo. She escapes from the laboratory and stumbles upon the taxi driver and former elite commando Major Korben Dallas that helps her to escape from the police. Leeloo tells him that she must meet Father Vito Cornelius to accomplish her mission. Meanwhile the Evil uses the greedy and cruel JeanBaptiste Emanuel Zorg and a team of mercenary Mangalores to retrieve the stones and avoid the protection of Leeloo.

Well forget the plot it's the weak point of the film.  But hey who ever said comic books had to have strong plots? Willis Jovovich and the rest do a fine job.  I especially like the casting of Jovovich she exudes innocence vulnerability sex exotica intelligence and kung fu machismo all at the same time. So turn off the cynicism sign as you watch and just enjoy the ride.  Great stuff!".

Set in a not so far future the eternal battle between good and evil is shown to us in an extravagant setting. Flying cars aeroplanes that go at the speed of light weird creatures and ugly aliens are only a few things that are present during this film. The story has never been seen before  Good has only one weapon to defeat evil it is composed of four stones representing the four element water earth fire and air and a perfect creature. These five elements have to be united before the forces of evil arrive to earth. But evil has found help and the stones have disappeared. Bruce Willis one of the best action actors of our time Milla Jovovich Ian Holm and Gary Oldman make the suspense even more intense. Chris Tucker is incredibly funny and ads a lot to the comic side of the film. The story is extremely imaginative and is in my opinion one of Luc Besson's best. I have never seen anything else like it. The costumes designed by JeanPaul Gaultier are unbelievably imaginative and fun. They are a big part of the extravagance and originality of the movie. The score by Eric Serra one of my favourites is simply a work of art. And last but not least the special effects are absolutely excellent adding to the quality of the movie. If you are looking for action and a good laugh this is the film to see. But the actors are not the only things that make this film worth seeing. Click here".

On the surface a leave your brain in the cloakroom scifi yarn you may well find wanting!  As far removed from STAR WARS as Austin Powers is from DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. this film is pitched uniquely at those who can laugh at life but who have deep down an unquenchable desire for adventure and the romantic.Set on a futuristic earth where really nothing has changed except the technology Bruce Willis is STILL John McLane a hasbeen stormtrooper reduced now to driving aircabs for a living...same old premise for him  nothing's changed much since STRIKING DISTANCE except maybe the yellow hairrinse. Now legend has it that in a time long long ago the forces of darkness visited earth and were repelled by the unification in close proximity of four stones representing the four elements. earth wind fire and water together with a fifth element of unknown origin.Dear old Ian Holm is Priest Cornelius an expert authority on the five elements and keeper of all knowledge on things magical and mysterious. Gary Oldman in arguably his most wayput role is General Zorg who has done a deal with The Dark Side and whose sole purpose is to take possession of the elemental stones. The scene wherein he demonstrates the new weaponry to his alien henchman from which the oneline summary quote above is taken is an absolute classic of cinema. Milla Jovovich Married to Besson at the time of the flick is absolutely rivetting as Leeloo the clonedunzipped humanised fifth element. She must have practised long and hard perfecting her ancient language dialog....it's amazing. She strikes exactly the right note as a being of purity femininity and warrior woman. As the film progresses she assumes the identitiy of the perfect girl any man would wish for and want to protect.The comedy angle is hysterical the action sequences in your face and the fx generally impressive if not mega weird at times. Color and visuals play a major role in this proEuropean production the continent where not surprisingly it was most successful. The outcome naturally is predictable and in the best traditions of will love save the day? as if it wasn't always going to???So there u have it. Watch it onedimensionally and that's what you'll get back. let it flow immerse yourself in IT and you couldn't fail to have a good time unless of course you are clinically dead or devoid of any sense of fun or fantasy ....but in that case you'd be wasting your time anyway it wasn't MADE for you!".

The imagination and creativity is awesome! I love the colors and the ideas they came up with especially how the design of the city. The futuristic clothing is cool too. The only thing I was disappointed in was the enemy aliens. They looked a little too artificial.My favorite thing about the whole movie was the music. It went from techno to opera to jazz and to all over. I loved the music partially because they used Engima and Vangelis. Many people are like what the heck was that? when they hear the music but it fits the movie perfectly and leaves you with a feeling more than a theme. I like the randomness of the music it works well with the quirkiness of the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Fifth Element is another fine example of the filmmaking talents of Luc Besson. Luc Besson a creative genius and the director of classic films such as The Big Blue Nikita and Leon The Professional has returned to the genre that started his filmmaking career scifi. In The Fifth Element Luc Besson realises his life long ambition to make a film based on a story he thought of while still at school Zaltman Bleros. Writing and directing the film he skillfully mixes humour with action and amazing visual effects that put The Fifth Element in a class of it's own. Stunning performances are put forward by Milla Jovovich Bruce Willis Ian Holm Chris Tucker and Gary Oldman who returns to work with Luc Besson after playing Norman Stansfield in Leon. The Fifth Element show us how well comedy action and romance can be put together. Overlooked at the Academy Awards Luc Besson won the Cesar for Best Director at Cannes in 1998 for The Fifth Element. Simply an excellent film 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "After making heavy movies like La Femme Nikita and Leon it is somewhat of a departure for Luc Besson to do this comic pulp scifi film The Fifth Element. Looking at his work now with such highoctane humor as the Transporter series among others written by Besson but not directed it doesn't seem that out of place. He just must have decided to only direct his more serious fare and leave the fun stuff to others. However The Fifth Element is by no means a slight film without a fan base. As far as scifi goes this is a very capable installment. With its mythology creatures action and special effects the movie has everything going for it. The humor that's infused just makes it better vaulting it through genres and making it accessible to almost everyone who gives it a try.Like most of its ilk the story revolves around an evil force about to devour Earth and the rest of life itself as it increases in size and power with each influx of destruction and hate thrown at it. Every opportunity to blow it up only makes it stronger. Through a series of fortunate unfortunate happenings depending on who you are aligning with we have the paths crossing of a priest who holds the answers for survival an exmilitary cab driver bent on having some fun and excitement a strange woman from another place at the center of it all an evil mercenary out for money and the government of the galaxy trying to save face in front of inevitable extermination. It is good versus evil traveling through space in order to either shed light or death out to the universe as victory.In what is a nice little introduction to the myth of the fifth element that will unite with the more common four to wipe out evil we learn of those who keep the secret of its location. We don't quite know if these aliens are good or not until later but we do find out the impetus for their coming to the temple on display. A cut forward in time introduces us to the president of the galaxies played in what would seem to be horrible casting but ends up being pretty good with Tommy Tiny Lister Jr. and our head priest in the guarding of the truth Ian Holm. Holm explains what the dark force coming after them is and goes on the quest to find the fifth element and her four stones needed to combat it. This supreme being played wonderfully by Milla Jovovich with a childlike glee and discovery falls into the unwitting hands of cabbie Korben DallasBruce Willis at his sarcastic badass best. Willis must join with Holm and Jovovich on a mission to recover the stones and find a way to save the world.A lot of the success lies with the man behind it all Luc Besson. His script is made up of a pretty solid plot line as far as the world destruction goes. Everything makes sense and is explained in a way to not bore us but instead in tidbits culled from the numerous characters running about it this singularly unique landscape. The art direction is spectacular and for being a decade old still has some nice special effects that stand up. I've always been a proponent for prosthetics when able at the expense of computer graphics. Reactions are always better from actors who have something real to play off of and the lighting and environments just become more realistic. Even so when computers are used the effects are more subtle than flashy and never take away from the story that is being told. No matter what spectacle is on display the script is what is important.All the personalities on display also lead to much of the greatness that The Fifth Element has to offer. Bruce Willis is the king of this kind of role. His quips and rapport with those around him are priceless. Other standouts are Chris Tucker in an early role for him and the great Gary Oldman. Tucker takes loud and obnoxious to a whole new level but it works flawlessly. His radio DJ has no shame when it comes to working a crowd or chasing the ladies but his utter fear of danger is hilarious. As for Oldman I have to believe Besson just said create something fresh. This villain is a pastiche of so many crazy components. His futuristic hair complete with plastic half shield is plain weird the southern accent and buck teeth look is just the right amount of hillbilly and the disposition of greed and ambivalence is perfect for a bad guy. When he explains how destruction allows all the little machines that man created to finally have work cleaning up the mess it's fantastic. The real beauty though is that no matter how many strong lead roles are here the little guys steal scenes as well. Singer Tricky is great as Oldman's Right Arm and Mathieu Kassovitz partakes in one of the best scenes in the film when he attempts to mug Willis at his apartment.Even with all its camp and fun Besson keeps it all grounded in drama as any fantasy tale does. He has a real vision for aesthetics and has changed his scope often as he goes from film to film. From the mobstercorrupt cop world of New York to the countryside of war with Joan of Arc he never pigeonholes himself in a style. I am still holding out hope that his newest AngelA with all its black and white stylish noir feel will hit the big screens here in Buffalo. It will be a real shame if the rumors are true and the completion of his children tale Arthur and the Minimoys will be the final work by him as a director.".

I liked every scene every moment in this movie. The movie opens in Egypt 1914 and we meet some strange creatures. From here on we know this is not going to be a normal or very serious scifi action movie. The creatures tell a priest that the stones are no longer save on earth and they take some things. They tell the priest they will return in 300 years when evil arrives.300 years later. The strange creatures return but they are attacked by other strange creatures. The only thing that survives is reconstructed and turns out to be Lee Loo Milla Jovovich. She is the fifth element the ultimate weapon against evil. Evil here looks like a great ball of fire. Lee Loo escapes from the authorities and in an astonishing shot we see how a city looks like now. She jumps of a building and ends up in the flying cab of Korben Dallas Bruce Willis. He saves her from the police she asks for priest Vito Cornelius Ian Holm he brings her there.We learn a little more about Lee Loo here. She needs four stones the four other elements to save the world. The stones are on a vacation resort where we meet DJ Ruby Rhod Chris Tucker. He has some funny scenes as well. We have also met Zorg who is played by Gary Oldman in a great way. The attack on the strange creatures early in the movie was planned by him. He wants the stones as well he is offered a lot of money for them. How the story develops from here I will not reveal.The story doesn't even matter. In every scene we have something to like. Beautiful settings great visual effects Gary Oldman the beautiful Jovovich or the funny moments from Bruce Willis Chris Tucker and Ian Holm.

But when I stopped taking the movie so serious I really started to enjoy it. I thought it was a very fun movie.THE FIFTH ELEMENT is about an evil force coming to destroy the world. Five elements are needed to destroy the evil force and save the Earth. Four of them are stones and one of them is a beautiful woman named Leeloo Milla Jovovich who is absolutely perfect. A priest named Cornelius Ian Holm seeks the elements to try to save the world while the military sends a the retired Major Korben Dallas Bruce Willis to find the elements and stop a bunch of alien bounty hunterlike bad guys and a very evil man and of course very rich man who is under the employment of the evil force named Zorg Gary Oldman.And of course there is the insane but loved radio DJ Ruby Rhod Chris Tucker who gets trapped in the middle of this whole thing and becomes the comic relief of the movie even though this movie really does not need comic relief. At first you will probably find him annoying but he will grow on you. At least this happened to me.The acting is fair but nothing special. Chris Tucker does a good job as the nutcase radioman and Ian Holm does a pretty good job as the priest set out to save the planet. This was a very different type of role for Gary Oldman. He was still a bad guy of course but it was a much more comical part. It surely wasn't his best work but it was still OK. Bruce Willis did a great job playing his part and Milla Jovovich was excellent as the sexy but strong fifth element.The special effects were fantastic. The story to this movie is nothing big but like I said the main purpose of this movie is for the viewer to have fun.

	schema:headline " Plot wise it is weak and rather silly but for all its weak points it is great fun with a good sense of energy and wonderful design";
	schema:reviewBody "Three hundred years ago the powerful weapon of the fifth element was removed from Earth. Three hundred years later and pure evil has stirred in the far reaches of space  and is heading straight for Earth with traditional weapons unable to stop it. When the Fifth Element is returned the ship is attacked and seemingly lost  but scientists are able to recreate the fifth element and are surprised to find it is a beautiful young woman Leeloo. When Leeloo escapes custody she is helped by exarmy taxi driver Korben Dallas. Korben takes her to the priest she names but he finds that everyone wants her for one reason or another  then he finds that both the army and the priest need him to go on a mission to reclaim the missing four stones and save the Earth from evil.I have seen this film several times and will usually come back to it if I find myself in the mood  but yet I also find myself thinking of its flaws whenever anyone asks me about it. I can't understand why I do this because I really do enjoy this film even though there is much I sort of dislike about it. The plot is one of the weak points generally it is quite good as an idea but it has many weak points that make it seem rather silly and overly busy. While this is not enough to really damage the film I know that it has put some people off in some audiences but for me it was only a minor problem as these rather silly bits were all part of a film that had a great sense of fun running through it. Some of it didn't make much sense and at times I got the feeling that the film had more ideas than it really knew what to do with but the majority of it worked well. The action is good but you should be prepared for the fact that like much of the film it is done with a certain amount of tongue in cheek humour. Suffice to say I never found it dull and it has plenty going on for the majority of the filmVisually is the area where the film is strongest and I could watch it for this alone. The effects are great and are full of imagination as well as looking very impressive. The design work of Dan Weil is very well used and compliments the effects used  the film looks lavish and rich all the way through and matches the wonderful costumes from JeanPaul Gaultier. Of course much of the praise goes to Luc Besson who has managed to pull this together really well to produce an endlessly impressive film which manages to be a fun and exciting scifi.The casting also backs this idea up and features many performances that are spot on with tongue in cheek performances that match the tone of the film perfectly. Bruce Willis delivers the same great mocking performance that he tried in Hudson Hawk but here he does it in a film that is better structured and less silly than that one and it works a lot better. He still delivers the goods as an action lead but he puts his tongue just far enough in his cheek so as to be there without hurting the film! I don't want to overdo it after all  he is Bruce Willis! but I thought he was very well cast here. Oldman is very hammy but this also works as it matches the humour of the piece. Jovovich had a very difficult role and it is easy to laugh at her baby talk etc but I think she made it work well and gave a good performance against the odds. Holm is pretty good and brings humour to his role as well. Tucker sadly fails to do the same as these and his overblown performance doesn't even fit well within this film god knows where it WOULD fit! and he only succeeds in being shrill and very annoying throughout  not all his fault his character is a wholly unnecessary part of the film. The support cast is roundly good and features a raft of famous faces in minor roles including Lee Evans Brion James Tricky Luke Perry and Kim Chan. Generally the cast seem to be right on the same page as their director and compliment the material and tone perfectly.Overall this is far from a perfect film and some may find the humour to be at odds with the scifi action but for my money the fact that most of the film backed up this tongue in cheek tone made it all work. Some of the plot has too many ideas or unnecessary elements but most of it is really good and combined with mostly good performances and stunning designs and effects make for a film that I will watch many times even if I cannot help but see the weaknesses that many others cannot get past.".

	onyx:emotionText "Three hundred years ago the powerful weapon of the fifth element was removed from Earth. Three hundred years later and pure evil has stirred in the far reaches of space  and is heading straight for Earth with traditional weapons unable to stop it. When the Fifth Element is returned the ship is attacked and seemingly lost  but scientists are able to recreate the fifth element and are surprised to find it is a beautiful young woman Leeloo. When Leeloo escapes custody she is helped by exarmy taxi driver Korben Dallas. Korben takes her to the priest she names but he finds that everyone wants her for one reason or another  then he finds that both the army and the priest need him to go on a mission to reclaim the missing four stones and save the Earth from evil.I have seen this film several times and will usually come back to it if I find myself in the mood  but yet I also find myself thinking of its flaws whenever anyone asks me about it. I can't understand why I do this because I really do enjoy this film even though there is much I sort of dislike about it. The plot is one of the weak points generally it is quite good as an idea but it has many weak points that make it seem rather silly and overly busy. While this is not enough to really damage the film I know that it has put some people off in some audiences but for me it was only a minor problem as these rather silly bits were all part of a film that had a great sense of fun running through it. Some of it didn't make much sense and at times I got the feeling that the film had more ideas than it really knew what to do with but the majority of it worked well. The action is good but you should be prepared for the fact that like much of the film it is done with a certain amount of tongue in cheek humour. Suffice to say I never found it dull and it has plenty going on for the majority of the filmVisually is the area where the film is strongest and I could watch it for this alone. The effects are great and are full of imagination as well as looking very impressive. The design work of Dan Weil is very well used and compliments the effects used  the film looks lavish and rich all the way through and matches the wonderful costumes from JeanPaul Gaultier. Of course much of the praise goes to Luc Besson who has managed to pull this together really well to produce an endlessly impressive film which manages to be a fun and exciting scifi.The casting also backs this idea up and features many performances that are spot on with tongue in cheek performances that match the tone of the film perfectly. Bruce Willis delivers the same great mocking performance that he tried in Hudson Hawk but here he does it in a film that is better structured and less silly than that one and it works a lot better. He still delivers the goods as an action lead but he puts his tongue just far enough in his cheek so as to be there without hurting the film! I don't want to overdo it after all  he is Bruce Willis! but I thought he was very well cast here. Oldman is very hammy but this also works as it matches the humour of the piece. Jovovich had a very difficult role and it is easy to laugh at her baby talk etc but I think she made it work well and gave a good performance against the odds. Holm is pretty good and brings humour to his role as well. Tucker sadly fails to do the same as these and his overblown performance doesn't even fit well within this film god knows where it WOULD fit! and he only succeeds in being shrill and very annoying throughout  not all his fault his character is a wholly unnecessary part of the film. The support cast is roundly good and features a raft of famous faces in minor roles including Lee Evans Brion James Tricky Luke Perry and Kim Chan. Generally the cast seem to be right on the same page as their director and compliment the material and tone perfectly.Overall this is far from a perfect film and some may find the humour to be at odds with the scifi action but for my money the fact that most of the film backed up this tongue in cheek tone made it all work. Some of the plot has too many ideas or unnecessary elements but most of it is really good and combined with mostly good performances and stunning designs and effects make for a film that I will watch many times even if I cannot help but see the weaknesses that many others cannot get past.";

Better later then never  the movie is pure and marvelous fun. It smiles at itself does not take itself seriously and it is outrageously beautiful. It is a perfect mixture of Action  Adventure  Romance  SciFi  Thriller with the comedy and the funny one too. It seems to me that Steven Spielberg might have used some ideas of The Fifth Element in his great Minority Report. The story's five elements four stones that represent water earth fire and air and a perfect human creature  a girl must together fight the absolute evil. Bruce Willis is as good as ever doing what he does best fighting the bad guys ugly scary aliens and very bad Gary Oldman with a hairdo you have to see to believe and saving not just a hotel or one big city or even the great country but the Life as we know it. Luc Besson the director also wrote the story and the screenplay and I read that he had written it when he was 13. I think it is great that he adapted his own early writings because there is so much joy in it the joy and happiness that only can be felt in one's childhood. The visuals the sound and the music to the film are terrific. The costumes created by another boygenius enfant terrible of Paris haute couture JeanPaul Gaultier will grab your eye and attention  so shockingly creative and unforgettable they are  the garment Milla was wearing in her first scene for example. Who would think the wide bandaids can look so sexy yet innocent yet crazy when wrapped around a beautiful girl? Bruce Willis's orange top that matches Milla's blinding red hair absolutely hilarious outfits DJ Ruby Rhod Chris Tucker was proudly wearing? I am smiling now when I just think of them. Milla Yovovich possesses a rare exotic unusual beauty and the eyes radiant and green like a new spring grass  she was a perfect choice for a perfect creature the Mankind's only hope for survival in the eternal ferocious struggle between Good and Evil Creativity and Destruction Life and Death Love and Hatred.".

There's so much originality in this and a lot of creativity. You know how when you watch a James Cameron movie and at the end of it you're like holy crap this movie feels as if it came out this year. Well this is exactly how I felt about this movie. It's just like a James Cameron movie way ahead of its time well the 90's.The city with the flying cars floating Chinese takeout and cigarettes that have the filter backwards I love this film! I can watch this movie over and over again and it would still feel new to me. Thanks to bluray technology I can see it in beautiful high definition followed by some nice surround sound system.The visuals and special effects were very amazing for a 90's movie. And this is 1997 you wouldn't expect much from movies in the 90's in terms of nice special effects with the exception of T2. But this movie delivered on a massive scale.Gary Oldman is the villain. Not the brightest villain but he's cool. We have cameo appearances from trip hop artist Tricky as Gary Oldman's sidekick I guess? Bruce Willis one of my favorite actors plays the role of the sarcastic action hero. He pairs up with the hot and sexy Milla Jonovich. That scene where she was created by the machines got me a little excited cause she's just so sexy. Chris Tucker is in it and he's just such a goof. It's kinda hard to tell whether he's straight or gay because of weird fashion the world of the Fifth Element serves its citizens but nonetheless it fit the world because it needed something new.The plot is another save the world from the bad guy scenario with a twist. You have this deadly planet coming for earth which looks like an asteroid but apparently the planet speaks because it's alien and the main group of hero's must gather all the stones which would be placed in a temple in Egypt to stop the impending attack on earth. You have a gang of mercenarytype aliens who can shapeshift into humans and use any means of violence to accomplish their goals.The main group of hero's are also joined by a priest by British actor Sir Ian Holm who does a phenomenal job on his part. The worlds and locations in this film are just stunning and beautiful it's like you wish the world looked like that today but sadly it doesn't look anything close to what the Fifth Element looked like.Overall this movie gets a 1010 for originality creativity and stunning visuals. If you haven't seen this then you should because this should be on the list of movies you should watch before you die. Buy this movie it's worth every penny. I look at other scifilms today that involve a similar plot and I can't enjoy it as much as I enjoyed this movie. I wish the director had the ambition to make a sequel for this because it's underrated. Long live the Fifth Element.".

From the bright colour schemes to the constant use of shapes  angles to the imaginative  still pretty impressive special effects which were probably a mixture of traditional model work  CGI computer effects to the cinematography The Fifth Element has to be one of the best looking scifi films ever  it's a film I could watch purely on an aesthetic level regardless of the story. I love the look of the film the design of the spaceships  the outlandish costumes designed by JeanPaul Gaultier in which Bruce Willis goes from his trademark white vest from Die Hard 1988 to a bright orange one here which I thought was a nice little touch  maybe a nod to his earlier success. The aliens look good too  as a whole this is a joy to watch.With a supposed budget of about 90000000 The Fifth Element at the time it was made was the biggest budget none Hollywood film  one has to say the money show's on screen with plenty of special effects  a convincingly realised futuristic world it was largely shot in England  has high production values. The cinematography is great but please please please make sure you watch it in widescreen. The acting is pretty good I've always liked Bruce Willis  I like him in this Chris Tucker is sort of annoying but not enough to totally spoil it.The Fifth Element is a fantastic scifi action film that's as good to look at as anything out there the style together with an entertaining story  Bruce Willis pretty much means The Fifth Element is a personal favourite of mine what can I say? Watch it as soon as you can.".

The tasty blueorange combination may linger in your thoughts for some time. Plenty of action but not overloaded. The futuristic metropolis is loaded with visual effects that are excellent so you'll have to look hard to point out inconsistencies. But I'm glad the special effects stop with spaceships and scenery and do not continue with the making of the alien characters. There is a plethora of costumes and makeup which gives the movie life. However you can load a movie with art and still suffer by way of plot dialog and acting. But this is where The Fifth Element excels. The story is simply one of good versus evil but along the way there's a dose of unpredictability as far as where the good guys are headed and who they'll encounter. Just add in the scifi flavor and you get a tale of wonderment which doesn't let up. Bruce Willis Gary Oldman Milla Jovovich and Ian Holm all produce the necessary passion for their deep characters and the splendid dialog. My appreciation for all of this has increased since when I first saw it at the theater in '97. There was a lot for me to process so it took me several views to fully absorb this fine experience. Actionadventure comedy love and drama have been intertwined into this mesmerizing work of art for the eyes and ears. Do enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Fifth Element 1997 Directed by Luc Besson set in the 23rd century is a CyberPunk film bursting with hilarity technology electrifying music and flying cars. It ridiculously screams scifi so much that it can be mistaken for a spoof of which it certainly is not. Besson ever the eye for detail creates the future in a fantastically zingy way that draws the audience in to its colourful world of fast paced mingleaninga.Korben Dallas Bruce Willis is former special agent now taxi driver turned special agent again in order to save the world from an ever growing evil in the form of a giant burning evil 'scare the pants of The President' ball of fire. In order to save the world from this said evil he needs five elements 4 of which are unknown to everybody except the fifth element who he predictably meets after she falls into his taxi after being chased by cops.Leeloo Minai Lekarariba Laminai Tchai Ekbat De Sebat otherwise known as Leeloo is the Fifth Element that predictably falls into Korben Dallas' taxi cab. She is not human not robot not anything really although she is very much a human. She was built from strands of DNA to create what scientists called 'The Perfect Being' and she is really. She was built to 'Protect'. She is a likable character her flaming orange hair accentuates her unique personality. She is the brainiest character knows everything and learns everything by just looking at pictures and text for just one split second possibly due to the fact that she was made with a photographic memory.Ruby Rhod Chris Tucker is a squeaky voiced overdramatic confusing Radio DJ whose hair is really eccentric and unpredictable. He follows Korban around like a bad smell and annoys the living daylights out of him. If it's not the plot of the film that keeps you entertained it's Ruby. While he may seem annoying and you may think that you will hate him I can assure you that you won't. There's just something about him that makes you want to see this film over and over again. In all the scenes he's in he speaks in his own way and will not shut up. Most of the time you can hear nothing but him blabbering on. He is a great character for a film like this.The film is largely dependant on its fast paced music to keep the audience enthralled the punky pop music is extremely enjoyable and helps keep the film bouncing on its toes. In one electrifyingly gripping scene an opera singer known as the Diva is singing classical opera and then suddenly BOOM! She starts singing opera but with a punkish popish side to it zingy waves of fast paced electric pop music flying into your awaiting ears and through your brain instantly changing the mood of the scene. Whilst the Diva is singing the scene cuts back and forth on time with the beat of the music between the Diva and a fight between Leeloo the Fifth Element and aliens bent on stealing the other 4 elements the music greatly affecting the feelings happening in the fight.This film entertained me all the way through and has burnt itself with great detail and a lot of smoke into my memory I could never forget the colourful electric eccentric hilarious fast paced world of this film. If you ever get the chance to see this film you should definitely watch it you will be thoroughly amazed.".
