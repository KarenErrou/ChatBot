Although he was a star in the french cinema for years Grard Depardieu was an unheardof unknown in the United States prior to the success and critical acclaim of this french language film. This film also won 2 Academy awards in 1990best foriegn film and best costume. If you have ever seen this film then you know that this was the role that Grard Depardieu was born to play. After seeing this I cannot imagine another actor in the world playing this role but Grard Depardieu. This movie will make you laugh and it will make you cry. You cannot help but to experience all of Cyrano's passions and his lust for life as well as his heartache for never getting Roxanne to fall in love with himand his anger and embarassment he feels about his selfcontiousness about his large nose. As the film moves foward you grow to love the Cyrano de Bergerac charactor as you experience his emotions with him.There is some good battle scenes and some action scenes and even some killingbut what little bloodshed is done in this film is done with good taste and relavence to the story instead of a bunch of meaningless killing like as seen in other films in this genre. This is about as well done as any film will ever get. I give it 5 out of 5 stars a perfect film A masterpiece".

First it was in English and the thing is that the whole play is written in verses that rhyme. Of course you just cannot do that in English. Second Rostand's story was seriously altered.Now with this version we finally get the real Cyrano de Bergerac a man whose nose is as great as his courage and skill at sword play his talent at writing beautiful love poetry and his will to resist all temptation to become the servant of higher powers. We get to follow his adventures to feel his wonderful love for beautiful Roxane his attempt to win her love in ways that nobody would ever consider and his struggle to keep the freedom of his spirit.I admired the acting the direction the lighting and the costumes. There is so much in this movie to applaud. But the best of it all is that it keeps so close to the original text. I read the play and I just couldn't believe how good this adaptation is. Watch this movie if you have the heart of both a lion and of a lover and you can appreciate excellent French poetry.".

I really didn't know what to expect of a French movie with unknown actors at least to me by then with a story I didn't previously know and with the only reference of some Cesar awards. After all it was an european movie it was French it was based in a classic book and with a romantic theme. But something attracted me.I was shocked.Actually it was the first movie I ever went to see to the cinema more than once. I purchased it on VHS as soon as I could and I am getting it on DVD now that it's available in Spain. After all this time I know by heart almost every scene of the movie and it keeps on bringing tears to my eyes in the final scenes no matter how many times I've seen it.The movie has so many things so nicely put together it's almost impossible not to be hooked on some of them.To begin with I was very surprised with the fact that the whole movie is spoken in verse. I think it was the first time I had ever seen something like that and it is probably also the last since I can't remember any other movie like this! I don't know how well it was done in English but I can say it was translated into Spanish awesomely. I can only wonder how beautiful it is in the original French version. Everything is so musically coherent and adequate that you really enjoy watching the movie spoken in verse. I loved it.Then there is the absolutely magnificent performance by Gerard Depardieu. He perfectly resembles at every moment the personality of the eager and sometimes naive but at the same time extremely intelligent romantic desperate and vulnerable Cyrano. His physical look his facial expressions his voice... everything makes him the perfect Cyrano de Bergerac. You really share his suffering and at the same time you admire its strong personality and determination. He makes Cyrano an admirable man an enjoyable human being. Wonderful.Apart from that there is many more things in this movie that make it absolutely enjoyable. The humor. The sets and props all the environments created. The music. And the story is an absolute classic that many people will feel related to the struggle of a man than even though not physically gifted wants to live and love with no limits... to the person who is not ready to correspond him. Maybe it's the reason why it was so touching for me when I was a teenager and maybe that's why it still brings tears to my eyes even today All in all a beautiful romantic tale with great sets and performances and that will touch almost anyone's hearts. My favourite movie of all time and definetly a classic.".

Indeed it is his larger than life robustness that makes his futile towering defiance at the resolution so poignant the ignoble end of a hero is a classic theme right from Beowulf through John Wayne's The Shootist to 2000's Crouching Tiger Hidden DragonThe lyricism in the English translation of Cyrano is commendable the filmmaking technically sound the sets and choreography well presented. Depardieu's portrayal of the legendary swordsman as a bullish brawler rather than a delicate fencer is an interesting take and I find it works.The downside is that the character of Roxanne is so utterly insipid and moronic that you wonder why Cyrano is so taken with her.  The tragedy of this Cyrano isn't that his love is unrequited but that it's so misplaced. An interesting contrast is with Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon which replaces the Roxanne character with a peer for the hero a companion battleship as Henry Higgins would say.  This makes for an even more heartwrenching story and makes you realise that Cyrano could have been even better if Depardieu's superb performance had been tempered just a little in favour of a Roxanne who was more worthy of his regard.".

Grard Depardieu was absolutely brilliant as Cyrano himself and it was such a refreshing pace from the garbage I've seen recently. This was definitely one of the most brilliant performances in late film history. Yes the acting was theatrical but that was the only real way to carry it out...it would've stunk if they modernized it just for the cameras I'm sure other versions have done this and that's why you don't hear too much about them. I thought it was funny that Vincent Perez was such a proper performer in this and then they made him Eric Draven in The Crow sequel which was far from good. Just everything about this movie was well done and while it was very romantic it didn't do it in a mushy kind of way that'd turn off guys that aren't really big on that stuff such as myself. There was some decent swashbuckling but it's not one you'd choose for the action itself per say. Just watching this made me really want to read the book because the script was simply genius and nothing less.The poetic lines sounded like silk feels and I highly recommend this to any couples out there that are looking for a little revitalization!Final GestureMovies It's long but I think I'd make it through just to give it due credit.DVD Purchase The idea is gnawing away at the back of my mind.Rental YES!".

Here this is JeanPaul Rappeneau's turn to transpose in pictures Edmond Rostand's famous play. With the help of his scriptwriter JeanClaude Carrire this is a faithful and especially modernized version that he offers us. Rappeneau and Carrire have deleted difficult or oldfashioned verses and they have even written necessary verses for understanding. In short a substantial work has been made and it is better this way because the result is very convincing. It enables to make the movie easier to follow and dialogs partly constitute the success of the movie.As for the directing it's very tempting to make a comparison with another movie Molire 1978. Both stand out by a witty vivid and sometimes poetic directing full of liberty and movements that  does everything to avoid filmed stage production and succeeds in it. And of course the movie enjoys a performance of a high quality. Beginning with Grard Depardieu whose performance is absolutely convincing and he will remain an unforgettable Cyrano de Bergerac. He is very well followed by the whole of the distribution.At last it was a surprise to see this movie gain a triumph 11 French cinema awards in 1991 and a huge commercial success. Ultimately a smart and subtle movie... but not Rappeneau's best movie. His finest achievement was to come five years later with le hussard sur le toit 1995.".

It usually is apparent when watching actors that they are simply acting  they are not really being the character they're playing. I love watching Depardieu because he gets into the part and you forget that anyone is acting at all.This movie definitely ranks among my favorite movies of all time.

	schema:headline " A sad story of why you should not let love go unspoken";
	schema:reviewBody "Now this is interesting because I have a feeling that Roxanne the American version of this film was released first. I am not sure as to the release date of the first film for I believe it to be a 80's movie as opposed to a 90's movie. It was on recently but I think no I know that I threw out the television paper so I do not know. Anyway Cyrano de Bergerac seriously romps all over Roxanne as most French movies tend to do to their American counterparts.Cyrano de Bergerac is about the captain of the Gascony guard who has a big no a whopping great nose and he is very sensitive about its size. He considers himself a freak and that nobody will see past the nose to his soul. Cyrano is a poet and a great lover but he feels he can never be loved because of his physical appearance. The woman that he loves Roxanne is in love with another man Christian who is in Cyrano's battalion but Christian does not know how to be romantic so Cyrano becomes Christian's romantic side and uses his romantic words to create an intellectual depth to Christian that does not exist.Cyrano de Bergerac is a tragedy in a number of ways. There is no fulfillment in the romantic sequences. Christian is not what Roxanne wants and they can never really be together because Roxanne loves Christian's words and his looks and nothing else. She claims to love his soul but it is a soul that says the words that she wants to hear. When Christian tries to confront her without Cyrano's help she sees a brute that she wants nothing to do with. She does not love his soul but rather his words the words that Cyrano speaks. The further tragic part deals with the Duke who also loves Roxanne and wants to marry her. Instead Roxanne marries Christian with Cyrano's help and upon discovery the duke sends them off to the Spanish Front where there is little hope of survival. They are married in word but it is not consummated and the duke makes sure that it is not and never will be consummated.The greater tragedy is that of Cyrano. He holds a love for Roxanne though it is really only attraction to her physical appearance yet he does not speak of it to anyone. Christian learns before his death and he is the only one that knows that Cyrano loves Roxanne. This he learns from the letters that are sent in his name. He has read the letters and soon realises that Cyrano gives Roxanne a love that he never could but Cyrano is constantly held back by his deformity. There is constantly reference to love in spite of a deformity but Cyrano feels that he is not for Roxanne and remains silent. He spends time with her every Saturday and even manages to crawl to visit her on his death bed but it is a love that remains silent and the only person that knows and can reveal it is dead.Roxanne was a comedy Cyrano de Bergerac is a tragedy. There is no hope in the film and everything is spiraling down to a very bloody conclusion. Cyrano is a master swordsman who defeats a hundred men by himself but he cannot stave off the anger of a duke. He is able to fight the Spanish hordes but he is taunted by a love that he feels that can never be fulfilled. He speaks only of it on his death bed and even though is very reluctant. This is a very sad movie nothing like the Hollywood rubbish that is splattered over all of the screens. This is a movie with depth that deals with the real emotions of people. It is not one where the couple get together and live happily in the end but one in which pain strikes through it right until the end. It is a poetic movie though much of it will be lost in the translation. In essence I see Cyrano de Bergerac on the level of a modern Shakespeare for it seems to have lots of Shakespearian elements including a very deep poetical language  even though it is in French.Cyrano de Bergerac is a film that has one overriding theme and that is Carpe Diem  seize the day. Though such a thing does not happen in this movie it shows us that it is something that we should do. We cannot let our love kindle unspoken especially when the woman that our love is focused on so dearly wants to hear. In my opinion it is not something that should be done for I feel that we need to be tactful in regards to the woman that we speak with and shouldn't overwhelm them but in Cyrano's case he feels that his nose makes him hideous and that Roxanne won't want anything to do with him which is not true as you learn at the end. When it comes down to selfdoubt then it should be cast away. One should be tactful but one should not attack oneself in belief that no woman would even want him.".

Anyway Cyrano de Bergerac seriously romps all over Roxanne as most French movies tend to do to their American counterparts.Cyrano de Bergerac is about the captain of the Gascony guard who has a big no a whopping great nose and he is very sensitive about its size. He considers himself a freak and that nobody will see past the nose to his soul. Cyrano is a poet and a great lover but he feels he can never be loved because of his physical appearance. The woman that he loves Roxanne is in love with another man Christian who is in Cyrano's battalion but Christian does not know how to be romantic so Cyrano becomes Christian's romantic side and uses his romantic words to create an intellectual depth to Christian that does not exist.Cyrano de Bergerac is a tragedy in a number of ways. There is no fulfillment in the romantic sequences. Christian is not what Roxanne wants and they can never really be together because Roxanne loves Christian's words and his looks and nothing else. She claims to love his soul but it is a soul that says the words that she wants to hear. When Christian tries to confront her without Cyrano's help she sees a brute that she wants nothing to do with. She does not love his soul but rather his words the words that Cyrano speaks. The further tragic part deals with the Duke who also loves Roxanne and wants to marry her. Instead Roxanne marries Christian with Cyrano's help and upon discovery the duke sends them off to the Spanish Front where there is little hope of survival. They are married in word but it is not consummated and the duke makes sure that it is not and never will be consummated.The greater tragedy is that of Cyrano. He holds a love for Roxanne though it is really only attraction to her physical appearance yet he does not speak of it to anyone. Christian learns before his death and he is the only one that knows that Cyrano loves Roxanne. This he learns from the letters that are sent in his name. He has read the letters and soon realises that Cyrano gives Roxanne a love that he never could but Cyrano is constantly held back by his deformity. There is constantly reference to love in spite of a deformity but Cyrano feels that he is not for Roxanne and remains silent. He spends time with her every Saturday and even manages to crawl to visit her on his death bed but it is a love that remains silent and the only person that knows and can reveal it is dead.Roxanne was a comedy Cyrano de Bergerac is a tragedy. There is no hope in the film and everything is spiraling down to a very bloody conclusion. Cyrano is a master swordsman who defeats a hundred men by himself but he cannot stave off the anger of a duke. He is able to fight the Spanish hordes but he is taunted by a love that he feels that can never be fulfilled. He speaks only of it on his death bed and even though is very reluctant. This is a very sad movie nothing like the Hollywood rubbish that is splattered over all of the screens. This is a movie with depth that deals with the real emotions of people. It is not one where the couple get together and live happily in the end but one in which pain strikes through it right until the end. It is a poetic movie though much of it will be lost in the translation. In essence I see Cyrano de Bergerac on the level of a modern Shakespeare for it seems to have lots of Shakespearian elements including a very deep poetical language  even though it is in French.Cyrano de Bergerac is a film that has one overriding theme and that is Carpe Diem  seize the day. Though such a thing does not happen in this movie it shows us that it is something that we should do. We cannot let our love kindle unspoken especially when the woman that our love is focused on so dearly wants to hear. In my opinion it is not something that should be done for I feel that we need to be tactful in regards to the woman that we speak with and shouldn't overwhelm them but in Cyrano's case he feels that his nose makes him hideous and that Roxanne won't want anything to do with him which is not true as you learn at the end. When it comes down to selfdoubt then it should be cast away. One should be tactful but one should not attack oneself in belief that no woman would even want him.";

Gerard Depardieu's talented acting has a knack for captivating the viewer. The personality of his character is the personality that any man wishes he could have... witty sharp and of course excellent with words and finding comebacks for insults which are constantly thrown at him because of the size of his nose. His charming ways of speaking would make any woman fall in love with him as we saw with Roxanne though his physical appearance is one to put many off. The extremely good looking Christian played by Vincent Perez has the opposite qualities. A very handsome appearance but finds it very hard to express his feelings in words. Then there is Roxanne Anne Brochet who was supposed to be beautiful though I do not find her at all appealing and was the one who both these men were in love with. Out of all the actors I think that she did the poorest job out of all of them. She seems to be extremely ignorant and naive and she is portrayed just as a silly little girl.I heartily recommend this movie for anyone who appreciates the arts and has an interest in comedy and has an interest for history.".

I'll deal with the Ferrer version more fully on its own page but will of course touch on comparisons  the nonrhyming translation of 1950 versus for English viewers the rhyming couplets of Anthony Burgess in 1990. WriterDirector JeanPaul Rappeneau has been sparing with his enormous talent since his first screenplay 'Signe Arsene Lupin' produced in 1959 he has authored a mere fourteen more including one cult film  Zazie dans le metro  produced the following year and the wellreceived wellremembered JeanPaul Belmondo vehicle L'Homme de Rio. Since his directorial debut the exquisite La Vie de Chteau he has given us only six more culminating in his latest masterpiece 'Bon Voyage' released in 2003. He has worked twice with two of the greatest talents in French cinema with Yves Montand he made Le Sauvage and Tout feu tout flamme and with Gerard Depardieu he made Cyrano de Bergerac and Bon Voyage and in between the stately elegant Hussard sur le toit Horseman On The Roof. With a painter's eye for detail and composition Rappeneau does not shrink from the large canvas andor crowd scenes witness the gorgeous shots of a teeming Bordeaux in Bon Voyage and gives us here a Paris wellstocked with setdressing and extras but he is also at home in onetoone intimacy and knows how to use both sound and music to express andor heighten a mood. On paper the ultimate romantic story of a doomed romance is actorproof after all how difficult can it be to apply a prosthetic organ and spout some of the most eloquent language ever bestowed on a character already drawn larger than life. On paper is one thing on stage or set it is quite another and the role requires acting of the highest order to bring off  witness the current fiasco at England's National Theatre  and in both Ferrer and Depardieu the role finds the actor. Much has been made and rightly so of Ferrer's magnificent timbre and vocal calisthenics but he WAS speaking in English which meant that Englishspeaking filmgoers could sit back and bask in his magnificent delivery without the need for looking beneath his image to find out what he was saying. For native Frenchspeakers Depardieu is more than up to the comparison despite the odd complaint of his machinegun delivery. In full color and sumptuous production values Depardieu IS Cyrano and if you haven't seen or HEARD Ferrer then there is nothing here  no inadequacy in performer or director  that will make you feel shortchanged and want to seek an alternative version in Black and White with virtually no production values to speak of Ferrer was forced to rely almost totally on his great voice. In Rappeneau Depardieu and for Englishspeaking viewers Burgess this version has three no trumps which it exploits to the full. Like the Ferrer version it doesn't waste much of its budget on highsalaried support though both Ann Brochet currently appearing in support in Patrice Leconte's 'Confidence trop intimes' and Vincent Perez who suffers from either typecasting or a penchant for costume roles viz Le Bossu La Reine Margot and the remake of Fanfan la Tulipe continue to work in films. The DVD version complete with Booklet is currently available in cutprice outlets in Paris for 10 Euros which has to be a snip. 910".

	schema:headline " Greatwith the heartwrenching story funny rhyming script and a terrific Depardieu lead";
	schema:reviewBody "Cyrano de Bergerac 1990This is Gerard Depardieu's shining moment in an up and down career. Some say the movie makes a blur of the subtle writing and emotional power of the original play by Edmond Rostand of the same title written in 1897. And as much as the English version by Jose Ferrar 1950 is the acclaimed English language version the play was originally French. And it's all in verse including the subtitles which in this case use the translation by Anthony Burgess of Clockwork Orange fame.But the story the story. It's all about the simple amazing plot about which Rostand was convicted on slim evidence of stealing from a Chicago amateur writer. The year is something like 1680 in France. A man of great talent and fighting skill a deep emotional life and poetic sensibility and also with a gigantic nose is in love with Roxane. This is poor Cyrano who has everything but good looks. And Roxane happens to be in love with a very good looking young man who is a bit of a talentless fool. Cyrano out of love for Roxane steps in to help the fool by writing letters for him that succeed in wooing the beautiful Roxane.If this sounds like that crazy movie called Roxane starring Steve Martin well you've got it. That's the Cyrano story and Martin's movie sort of kicked off the contemporary deluge of Cyrano movies in 1987 three years before this one. Of course his is a comedy and there are some changes from the play and this 1990 version which tries even in its grandiose production to be true to the tightly written and scripted original.It's all pretty terrific. In a way if you like Shakespeare it's the play that holds the whole thing back a bit lacking oddly enough complexity. An example is the funny but thin asides with the cake maker who wants to be a poet. There is no shortage of characters there is a constant turning of events and it does never quite ever slow down but the main trick and drama of the situation is so central and gripping you end up waiting for it to find some kind of denouement or twist and surprise. And you do eventually get that with great beauty and pathos this is no comedy. But that's sort of all you get in terms of narrative flow.And that's almost all you need I have to admit. This production pulls out all the stops and scene after scene is amazing in its set design and lighting in its huge range of characters and gritty lovely evocation of 17th Century France. You could watch a bad play with such sets. And the photography is fluid active and formally terrific too which layers up the ongoing beauty of the filming. And Depardieu is terrific in his bloated leading man way I say this because he has detractors those who have seen searing and cutting intensity in stage versions but I have nothing to compare it to except Steve Martin. The two other main characters are actually a drag overall and avoidably I should think with all the talent being lavishly expended. Roxane is more delighted than delightful ornamentally pretty but also so stiff emotionally you wonder what all the fuss is about. And the foolish pretty boy is probably meant to be a bit shallow as a character but it does leave his parts a little cardboard.Anyway I overthink this. See the movie. If you don't like subtitles see the American one from 1950. Don't think the Steve Martin one is enough. For one thing the original ending is one of the most moving and memorable in all of cinema. For me the Depardieu version of this last great scene is unmatched.".

	onyx:emotionText "Cyrano de Bergerac 1990This is Gerard Depardieu's shining moment in an up and down career. Some say the movie makes a blur of the subtle writing and emotional power of the original play by Edmond Rostand of the same title written in 1897. And as much as the English version by Jose Ferrar 1950 is the acclaimed English language version the play was originally French. And it's all in verse including the subtitles which in this case use the translation by Anthony Burgess of Clockwork Orange fame.But the story the story. It's all about the simple amazing plot about which Rostand was convicted on slim evidence of stealing from a Chicago amateur writer. The year is something like 1680 in France. A man of great talent and fighting skill a deep emotional life and poetic sensibility and also with a gigantic nose is in love with Roxane. This is poor Cyrano who has everything but good looks. And Roxane happens to be in love with a very good looking young man who is a bit of a talentless fool. Cyrano out of love for Roxane steps in to help the fool by writing letters for him that succeed in wooing the beautiful Roxane.If this sounds like that crazy movie called Roxane starring Steve Martin well you've got it. That's the Cyrano story and Martin's movie sort of kicked off the contemporary deluge of Cyrano movies in 1987 three years before this one. Of course his is a comedy and there are some changes from the play and this 1990 version which tries even in its grandiose production to be true to the tightly written and scripted original.It's all pretty terrific. In a way if you like Shakespeare it's the play that holds the whole thing back a bit lacking oddly enough complexity. An example is the funny but thin asides with the cake maker who wants to be a poet. There is no shortage of characters there is a constant turning of events and it does never quite ever slow down but the main trick and drama of the situation is so central and gripping you end up waiting for it to find some kind of denouement or twist and surprise. And you do eventually get that with great beauty and pathos this is no comedy. But that's sort of all you get in terms of narrative flow.And that's almost all you need I have to admit. This production pulls out all the stops and scene after scene is amazing in its set design and lighting in its huge range of characters and gritty lovely evocation of 17th Century France. You could watch a bad play with such sets. And the photography is fluid active and formally terrific too which layers up the ongoing beauty of the filming. And Depardieu is terrific in his bloated leading man way I say this because he has detractors those who have seen searing and cutting intensity in stage versions but I have nothing to compare it to except Steve Martin. The two other main characters are actually a drag overall and avoidably I should think with all the talent being lavishly expended. Roxane is more delighted than delightful ornamentally pretty but also so stiff emotionally you wonder what all the fuss is about. And the foolish pretty boy is probably meant to be a bit shallow as a character but it does leave his parts a little cardboard.Anyway I overthink this. See the movie.

Grard Depardieu is a nice actor but he simply can't compete with all Jose's eloquence and posture. I mean Jose IS Cyrano while Gerard have more talent with comedies and romances. The actress who plays Roxanne in the 50's version is much more beautiful then Anne Brochet and all the emotion from the classic version it's not followed in this one Cyrano played by Gerard doesn't look to be in love with Roxanne and neither does Roxanne played by Anne looks sad when Cyrano dies in the last scene.But to be a little bit optimist I need to say that this version has better scenariosclothes and locations as also has much more sense the story about Cyrano be in french then in English.".

If you need a driving soundtrack to tell you exactly what mood you're supposed to be feeling for each scene you're going to hate this movie. If you can't accept the fact that flawed characters develop but don't always overcome in the end you're going to hate this movie.OK now that the summer action flic viewers have stopped reading this review in disgust just as they left this movie early we can get on with the review. I think Gillian Anderson was a good pick for the part and did a very good if not quite excellent performance. Part of Guilded AgeEdwardian uppercrust behaviour was the semblance of civility under the most trying of circumstances such as saying Thank You when you've just been fired or otherwise dissed. Add that to the stylized English and you end up having to PAY ATTENTION to understand what is going on to get it.One of the brilliant aspects of casting is the Gillian Anderson pick. Instead of a brilliant blonde or smouldering brunette you have a nonconventional look short voluptuos and redheaded that jolts and excites the modern eye but actually better fit in to the preChanel standard of beauty of that time.At its heart the novel is a morality tale describing the pitfalls of being beautiful manipulative and shallow while failing to be cunning and wise. Lily Bart is callous to her suitors at first only to fall into multiple social traps. In the end she relies solely on her integrity and dignity which is insufficient to extricate her from her circumstances. This may offend many who expect the heroine to prevail in the end due to a simple basic morality which is there in Lily perseverance which is also there a clever plot twist and a 40mm grenade launcher both missing.Lavish sets beautiful backdrops gorgeous costumes good acting with the possible exception of Akroyd all make this a surreal if sad journey for the cognitively aware and patient. I say possible exception because of one subtext of the novel  movie is the interplay of the American Nuveau Riche and the old nobility of England and Europe. Thus the wealthy American Entrepeneurs are depicted as brutish and obvious though this is tolerated in society because their path was already blazed in the 1890's by the first wave of gold miners oil drillers and electric company tycoons that swept through Europe and married into storied if not monies bloodlines. Thus Akroyd's blatant and crude manipulations and language are somewhat justified.But if you don't like period pieces costume dramas and identifying with wealthy people who have never worked a day in their lives all this will be lost on you.".

For example when Lily was flirting with Seldon you somehow could feel her discontent.Her descent into hell was  heartbreaking.  One scene when Lily is at her lowest will stay with me for a long time.

Davies has created the suffocating cosseted and unforgiving social milieu of New York and Tuxedo Park circa 190507. The sets the sense of place the stunning cinematography of Remi Adefarasin Elizabeth and most of all Gillian Anderson's virtuoso performance combine with Davies' excruciatingly seductive pacing and scoring cues to track in loving detail the missed opportunities and downfall of Lily Bart. Every line Wharton used to describe Lily's inner life is there in Anderson's face and in Davies screenplay and direction. If the film feels stiff to younger viewers it's because it's deadly accurate socially. That gilded society WAS stiff unforgiving and precoccupied with keeping out the nouveau riche. Anyone who has tried to gain entry to a social register or the DAR might have a easy time understanding the upper class world of New York in 1905.I must commend Davies for the risky choices he made in casting Eric Stoltz as Lawrence Selden and Dan Ackroyd as Gus Trenor. Ackroyd's boisterous girth works here because Gus Trenor is both gatekeeper and gatecrasher of this social circle. He and his wife are major forces in deciding who's in and out.  Ackroyd is not the deepest actor but neither is Gus Trenor deep. In fact he's to great degree a backslapping facade. Despite his wealth and high standing Trenor is pragmatic and doesn't turn his nose down at courting filthyrich newcomers desiring social elevation  men like Sim Rosedale Anthony LaPaglia  if it means Trenor makes a buck. And yes Eric Stoltz is not a convincing choice for a romantic lead yet he's perfect for the role of Lawrence Seldon since Seldon balks repeatedly at being Lily's leading man anyway. The sexual charge and arch ambivalent fencing between Lily and Lawrence is intensified by something indescribable that happens between Stoltz and Anderson in every scene played between them. I can't figure out why it works except that these two fine actors found each other. Stoltz's tenor crispness  his not quite boy not quite manness  adds to his character's elusiveness cowardice and vulnerability. Finally Laura Linney is devastating as Lily's reptilian nemesis Bertha Dorset. For me she evokes some of Glenn Close's lethal devilishness and charm. It is Lily's sense of propriety her fine upbringing that makes her incapable of finishing off Bertha in when she can and should.Davies' laser accurate sense of place and character sets House of Mirth apart. He's successfully created the last years of Wharton's treacherous gilded world when carriages were what fine people still rode and automobiles were considered vulgar. Davies' production designer art director and set decorator have created sumptuous yet stifling enviroments where Davies and his players can move us back one hundred years into a time we can only imagine and smell when we tour a Vanderbilt Mansion. And he did it without Titanic's budget. It's clear from his commentary that Davies had to repeatedly make do and it sounds like this production was a struggle. All I can say is limitation is sometimes a fortunate mother. I hope Davies now 57 will soon be up and running with a new film. I'm suprised to see no new project listed yet. If I were a producer I'd pounce. This director has the magic. And excuuuse me...! No new projects listed yet for Gillian Anderson?A short note to the Snatch fans that have dissed this film here  I loved Snatch too loved it but where's your freakin' RANGE kiddies? SNATCH and HOUSE OF MIRTH were my TWO FAVORITE films of 2001. Tell ya what. Go back to your videogames and Hollywood spectacles and only comment on classic adult film when you've spent a few more years watching much of the worlds great film literature. If HOM is too slow for you let your hormones rage for a few more years and come back when you're ready to pay attention to human not cartoon reality.  Meanwhile don't drop your smirking restless impatient and limited verbiage on films like this one.".

The precision and depth with which the director and actors go is absolutely true to the novel in almost every respect.Gillian Anderson is a revalation here she perfectly captures the repression and pain of being a woman stuck in that time and place with no way out. You can feel her pain and torment in every quivering close up and the passion contained in her kissing scenes or to be more precise her NON kissing kissing scene with Eric Stoltz is something to behold.Eric Stoltz is equally amazing in one of the most complex and difficult roles for a man to play. I must disagree with the viewer from China Mr. Seldon is NOT meant to be terribly masculine or deep voiced or unbearably handsome those are modern readings that perhaps we expect from the role of the 'male hero' in modern films but here Mr. Selden is written exactly as he is played walking a fine line between what is correct behaviour for the time and what he was or wasn't allowed to do in regards to her rescue. He is torn by love of Lilly Bart and the realization that he is not the right man for her as the all important social scene would frown on their union. The actor portrays this ambiguity perfectly and I for one found it a relief that the man didn't ride in and save the day in that cliched movie way.I also must commend the supporting players of Anthony LaPaglia whose role Sim Rosedale is originally written as a Jewish man one of the few changes made to the n script adaption of the novel and Laura Linney as Bertha Dorset the 'bad girl' of the story. They both bring a life to the story that is rare to see in a period film most actors seem to be too afraid or respectful of the material to really bring it to life.I even enjoyed Dan Ackyroyd in a role that I didn't see him in or expect to like him in. I suppose my feelings about him are coloured by old Saturday Night Live shows or Driving Miss Daisy but I think he was terrific in a role that is not the most explored in the novel or the film.Everything about this film held my interest and moved me and I'm a very tough audience as far as Wharton goes. The pacing is indeed slow but if you give yourself over to it it is like taking a warm bath in a quick shower world.Very well done!".

	schema:reviewBody "House of Mirth is a richly painted tapestry of a piece of early American Society all but unrecognizable to most Americans. It's a great story and great looking but the real surprise in Terence Davies' adaptation of Edith Wharton's novel is how deftly Gillian Anderson among others manages to gracefully convey the stilted rigors of the period language. The film is largely about the traps and deceits verbal gamesmanship and class oneupsmanship. It is a deadly and vicious internal warfare that goes on with the upper class bourgeois in New York City in the early 20th century. The price one pays  particularly that a woman pays  for straying too far from the unwritten laws of that society can be severe. Lillie Bart's flaw is not really in her indiscretions but in her inability to compromise at the right time. Her timing is fatally flawed. That the film is so relentlessly tragic really takes the viewer by surprise partly because Anderson gives her character such spunk and vivaciousness that you find yourself surprised by the endless bad luck that she brings on herself. Anderson's remarkable beauty poise as an actress facility with the dialogue in my mind bring her to a whole new level as an actress.It is also wonderfully cinematic.  There are rich colors and textures beautifully framed scenes marvellous costumes. Though steeped in tragedy and melodrama you'll find yourself so swept away in this world that it will seem centuries and not merely decades removed from our time. Perhaps this is why the titles at the beginning and at the end are New York 1914'  you need this reminder by the end.With a host of good performances and a rich sense of place you will get emotionally and imaginatively swept up in this world. Just be prepared for the landing.".

Althought the movie is set in the early 1900's her struggle with making a life for herself while surrounded by treacherous friends with their own agendas feels completely relevant. Working from a terrific script Anderson draws nuance meaning and emotion from her lines and the circumstances in which she finds herself as she puts it doing the wrong thing at the right time. The journey she took me through in this movie was invigorating thought provoking engrossing and ultimately heartbreaking. The supporting cast including Day Akroyd Anthony LaPaglia and Terry Kinney hold their own and fill out the movie beautifully. But Laura Linney deserves special mention as Lily's cunning manipulative rival posing as a friend. Although very much a period piece the film goes beyond some of the best pictures of MerchantIvory in bringing to life Wharton's novel presenting a darker movie about the consequences of choices and the cost of guilelessness in a ruthless world. It also pulls Scully out of her basement and into the spotlight where her talents deserve to have her.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story that this film is based upon is almost unbearably tragic and as the film is a reasonably literal adaptation of it then prepare yourself accordingly. Though it seems there is no relief from suffering for Lily Bart once she starts her tragic descent to say that this film is an unrelenting grievefest would be unfair. The film is basically divided into two halves and the first half showing a somewhat frivolous Lily amongst her many suitors contains many upbeat moments and is peppered by some witty exchanges between the characters. The second half of the film is very effectively introduced by the kind of long tracking shot that Terence Davies is renowned for as the action shifts from America to Monte Carlo and Lily's descent becomes the main focus of the movie. One thing that is very obvious about the film is the almost total lack of incidental music. Everything is driven by dialogue and the subtle interactions of the characters. The lack of music creates many moments of silence or near silence with ticking clocks etc and this gives the film a hermetic quality which may not be to everyone's taste. A certain claustrophobic feel is not unknown in Davies' films but the lack of music is a new departure. Another feature about the film is the emotional restraint required of the characters particularly Lily who despite undergoing grievous torments does not break down until close to the conclusion. Fortunately Gillian Anderson proves to be perfect for this sort of role. The nuances she brings to her character with an unending variety of subtle expressions and delicate movements of the eyes allow us to see how Lily is repressing the emotions and passions within her until it is far too late. Only the most hardhearted could fail to be moved by her performance and it is in the middle part of the film where the compromises she endures start to chip away at her frivolity where she truly begins to shine. Other performances are suitably accomplished particularly Laura Linney as the sinister Bertha Dorset who is central to Lily's downfall. Davies' insistence on a literal and austere interpretation in part due to the miniscule budget may mean that this film is not geared up for being a massmarket vehicle. Those whose idea of a period drama comes from watching Gwyneth Paltrow may find the genuine authenticity that House of Mirth supplies with it's clipped accents and formal constraints of behaviour a little too hard to take though I find Davies' interpretation far preferable to that of others in the genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a slow paced mesmerising film. If your only knowledge of Gillian Anderson is as Dana Scully in the XFiles then you are in for a big surprise. Firstly the lady can act and secondly with great subtlety. If you have read the book then clearly the writerdirector Terence Davies has taken a few liberties. But so much script has been lifted word for word from the novel that I think he can be forgiven any eccentricities. This is a story of manners in early twentieth century New York and environs. Everyone seems so decent and 'proper' but each plays their own manipulative game. Noone with the exception of Sim Rosedale tells the truth. As a morality tale it seems as relevant today as when Edith Wharton wrote it. Davies has succeeded in losing none of its mood or punch by transferring it to screen. Unfortunately I think this is a film that requires watching more than once as some explanatory scenes appear to have ended up on the cutting room floor. Generally the acting is excellent throughout though I felt that at times Davies's enthusiasm for detail hamstrung some actors where others appeared to have relished the close direction. This is a film to add to your personal collection.".

'House of Mirth' belongs to this iconoclastic group.  If the period film is traditionally concerned with offering pleasure  costumes big houses and estates decor dialogue etc.  than 'Mirth' is not traditional  it is a relentlessly observed depiction of one not particularly remarkable woman's fall from grace lingering particularly on her decline into the working classes quelle horrible surprise!.  It is a rigorously austere film  the surface trappings are minimised made deliberately artificial or obscured by dull lighting the use of music is economical what little there is comes from over a century before the drama is set less lush less wallowing more ascetic brittle thin than contemporary late Romantic music would have been there is no witty dialogue  the dramatis personae are either bores or monsters all speak with elaborate stiltedness.  Moments of epiphany or beauty are rare what few there are usually end in artifice banality or irony.  This is a gruelling film to watch especially in the second half this doesn't mean that it isn't very moving or beautiful in a nonsuperficial sense much of the emotion comes not from the plot or characters' reaction to it but Davies' subtle camerawork.Edith Wharton's story is basically an elaboration of Henry James subject matter a showing of what he conceals or implies.  There is the same horrified fascination with the machinations of class  a viewer has to be quick and alert to catch what's going on the rules and transgressions only acknowledged by a look or a seemingly irrelevant sentence but which have devastating lifethreatening consequences.  Davies doesn't offer us a traditional fall from grace narrative  it is clear from her opening scenes that Lily is no grande dame about to be felled she is barely hanging on to a hierarchy that barely notices her. Her first appearance announces Davies' intentions as she emerges from the dense steam of a railway engine in a dank railway station.  As she walks in the centre of a perfectly symmetrical composition against a neoclassical background to neoclassical music she looks out of place almost out of time a dark silhouette with no visible features like the shadow or ghost she will eventually become or like a strange mocking figure of 18th century Venetian theatre with her strange birdlike hat. This sense of weightless rootlessness also makes us enquire about her elusive background  Lily literally seems to emerge from nowhere.  She is slowly but definitely thrown from the unwritten laws of society to a very real material social order reduced to making hats badly for a living.  Her sense of time altars radically too  although society life seems a distinct realm from the 'real' world there is a noticeable narrative flow in spite of all the gaps and this is a film so full of narrative holes you often think you've been nodding off and temporal elisions. But when Lily joins the world of work and timekeeping narrative time seems to suspend  narrative events don't seem to follow coherently but in a blur when Lily first takes laudanum and the camera floats out the window to the babble of voices from Lily's life we assume she is dead.  Of course in a sense she is and this painful second half is like a nightmare hallucination as Lily floats away from whatever tenuous moorings she ever had.  Her opening scenes with Sheldon have a brittle nervous quality that initially seems false and irritating until we realise the full extent of Lily's plight her ineptitude for the role she is required to play  Gillian Anderson's performance is remarkable as quietly tragic as those great actresses of the 30s and 40s her face doing all the acting as she registers the horrors she cannot verbally acknowledge.".

	schema:headline " The heart of fools is in the house of mirth";
	schema:reviewBody "The House of Mirth is that rare thing a British film about America. Officially it is an international coproduction but it was not only made by a British director Terence Davies but also shot on location in Britain even though most of the action is supposed to take place in and around New York. As a keen birdwatcher I have to say that I could tell that it had been shot on this side of the Atlantic from some of the typically European birdsong in the background. It is in fact a good example of the sort of costume drama at which the British film industry has traditionally excelled although there have been some notable American examples such as Scorsese's The Age of Innocence also based upon a novel by Edith Wharton.The action takes place in 1905. At the opening of the film its heroine the socialite Lily Bart appears to be living a charmed life. She is young beautiful and the niece of the wealthy Mrs Julia Peniston. Yet her position is more precarious than she realises and the film traces her downfall from wealth into poverty and from respectability into social disgrace. The title is deeply ironic this is a tragedy not a comedy and there is nothing about Lily's position that might arouse mirth. Wharton took her title from the Biblical book of Ecclesiastes The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.The implication of this title is that those who live merely for mirth or pleasure are foolish and certainly Lily's downfall is partly the result of her own folly she incurs for example large gambling debts which she is unable to meet. Yet it is also partly the result of the hypocrisy of American high society in the early years of the twentieth century. Although some Americans tried to pretend that theirs was a classless society the ultrarich of New York could be just as ruthlessly snobbish as their counterparts in London Paris or Berlin and just as ruthlessly unforgiving of those who fell foul of society's unwritten rules. Lily's reputation is damaged not only by her gambling habit which alienates her puritanically religious aunt but also by an untrue allegation of an affair with a married man. The allegation is made by the man's wife who wants to distract attention from her own adultery. At times Lily's own good nature works against her she has the opportunity to revenge herself on the woman who has unjustly accused her but refuses to take it because to do so would also compromise Lawrence Selden the man she loves.The star of the film is Gillian Anderson which surprised me when I first saw it in the cinema as I had previously only though of her as that bird from the XFiles or the girl who a few years earlier had been voted Most Beautiful Woman in the World by the readers of FHM magazine. This aroused some ungallant comments from members of the antiredhead brigade who opined that Gillian had only won the title because readers had confused her with her namesake Pamela. The House of Mirth however proved two things. Firstly it proved that Gillian was a much more versatile actress than I had hitherto supposed. Secondly it proved to my satisfaction at least that she was far more ravishingly beautiful than Pamela Anderson ever knew how to be. Her Lily Bart is one of the great tragic heroines of modern cinema I was reminded of Nastassia Kinski's performance in Tess another period drama about a beautiful young woman who struggles vainly to escape a cruel and inexorable fate.There are other good performances from Laura Linney as Lily's accuser the spiteful Bertha Dorset from Dan Aykroyd an actor I more normally associate with comedy as the financier Gus Trenor who unsuccessfully attempts to seduce Lily Jodhi May as Lily's quiet but scheming and hypocritical cousin Grace Stepney who eventually inherits Mrs Penistone's fortune and Eric Stoltz as Selden.Like many British period dramas the film is beautifully photographed and makes use of some sumptuous sets and costumes. My one criticism would be that in the early scenes it moves too slowly but the pace gradually quickens as Lily's tragic drama is played out to its climax the ending is particularly moving. This is one of the finest period dramas of recent years. A film to savour. 910".

Anderson is perfect in the role and we feel all of her emotions. The superb cast includes Dan Aykroyd and Eric Stolz as two of her suitors and Anthony LaPaglia great as always as a man who tries to help Lily out despite her pride winning over.Davies' direction is incredible one scene is simply of an empty house as it rains and it is just mindblowing.

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't read The House of Mirth by Edith Wharton yet but I intend to now. This movie interpretation captured Wharton's acidity towards NY society more than Scorcese's Age of Innocence did which focused more on personal failings. Here a magnificently beautiful Gillian Anderson's character is stupid and stubborn but doesn't really do anything wrong that society manipulates and revenges on her. She is absolutely superb with a very wideranging performance and it's a real shame she's being overlooked in end of the year awards.The costumes are absolutely gorgeous. Having worked at a Hudson River estate museum I thought the movie absolutely captured the feeling of those hazy summers out of the city then was astounded to see it was all filmed in Scotland which would explain the rocky coasts that were the only thing that confusingly didn't look like the Hudson.The long movie is a bit slow and I think my mind wandered such that I missed a crucial plot point here or there  not sure we needed all the twinkling on the water shots. Laura Linney plays against type as a practically evil duplicitous friend worse than her wife in The Truman Show.It was interesting to compare this to Jane Austen interpretations which tend to emphasize the humor of her pot shots at silly society figures but those folks were in small towns not the big leagues where raised eyebrows affect fortunes. For society types this is The Show. Ebert and my mother gave it negative reviews because they absolutely refused to believe that a woman in her social class in 1906 had no other choices besides marriage but I think it was historically accurate as Wharton was writing bitterly about a society she had observed in a line from George Eliot to Hardy's Tess and Crane's Maggie. The women coming out of the theater agreed that we'd want to see it again.originally written 1282001".

Ebert and my mother gave it negative reviews because they absolutely refused to believe that a woman in her social class in 1906 had no other choices besides marriage but I think it was historically accurate as Wharton was writing bitterly about a society she had observed in a line from George Eliot to Hardy's Tess and Crane's Maggie. The women coming out of the theater agreed that we'd want to see it again.originally written 1282001";

	schema:reviewBody "POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD.Director Terence Davies sensitively directs a fine group of actors who portray the characters in Edith Wharton's most famous novel.   THE HOUSE OF MIRTH is an excellent art house presentation with the added allure of Gillian Anderson in the uncharacteristic role of Lily Barta beautiful vulnerable but shortsighted woman who knows what she wants but is driven to pass up every opportunity for a brilliant marriage to a scion of New York society.  Miss Anderson's personality is a bit too modern for the role of Lily but she does a commendable job in the part.  There is perhaps a bit too much of a feminist message in her comments on a woman's role in society. We are after all seeing the events of a century ago and judging the past by present day standards always gives the sense of belatedly condemning history.  But despite the crosscutting of emotions class and subtle sexism the general theme of the story is that most people find out the truth about themselves and their milieu too late.  Eric Stoltz is remarkably affecting as Lawrence Seldom a man who understands Lily the world but not himself.   The scene in the garden at the Trenor party where he and Lily almost declare their love for each other is one of the most memorable I've seen in years.   Anthony LaPaglia as the social climbing businessman and Dan Aykroyd as the lustful Gus Trenor are right on the mark with their characters.  Terry Kinney as the weakwilled George Dorset has an understated intensity that few actors could successfully convey.  Laura Linney as his malicious and scheming wife Bertha turns in an excellent performance as the woman who dramatically delivers the coup de grace to Lily's social ambitions.The standout for me though is Jodhi May who plays Grace Stepney.  Her face can show conflicting nuances of emotion that deeply affect the viewer. Where has this actress been hiding?  There are scenes between her and other actors where she is saying one thing yet conveying quite a different meaning to the audience through her facial expression that are positively heartbreaking.  One scene in particular has her turning Lily down for a desperately needed cash advance in the full knowledge that her denial will end in tragedy for Lily.  She denies her the money for supposedly moral reason yet has tears of regret in her eyes because of the jealousy that is making her do it.  Portraying a conflict of emotions in a single character is a rare talent and Miss May's ability is magnificent.Let's hope we see more of this very gifted actress and that her next role will be more prominent.  Hers is a performance not to be missed in a film of great emotional depth.Jay F.".

It is not the kind of adaptation that will suck people in straightaway but the slow pace and how subtle a lot of aspects are actually add to the storytelling rather than distract and shouldn't be reasons to dismiss it. While I can understand completely why not everybody will like The House of Mirth some of how the detractors express their opinion reek of ignorance like with the I'mrightyou'rewrong attitude. The House of Mirth does have a slow start and Eric Stoltz's performance can seem rather lightweight for such a complex character though he is not without his affecting moments. The casting does have the is this going to work thought initially but the performances come across really well. Laura Linney sinks her teeth into her role and is suitably bitter Eleanor Bron is formidable Dan Aykroyd also comes across surprisingly well in a menacing and cunning turn and Jodhi May is charming and sympathetic. Terry Kinney Anthony LaPaglia Penny Downie and Elizabeth McGovern are also very good. The best of the lot is Gillian Anderson whose performance is magnetic and truly heartfelt her last scene with Stoltz is just heartwrenching. The House of Mirth is shot very elegantly and the whole adaptation's period detail looks gorgeous. The lack of music is a good choice allowing the intimate understated atmosphere of the storytelling speak for itself. The dialogue is distinctively Edwardian and very literate without being stilted how it's adapted is very thoughtfully done and any observations of the attitudes and classes of the time are sharply done. The story takes its time to unfold which is not a bad thing period dramas often benefit from this especially when it's adapted from complex source material and thankfully this deliberate pacing is not done in a selfindulgent way. Narratively The House of Mirth is incredibly touching and rich in theme and character allowing you to identify with the characterswritten and characterised believably and with the interactions and the emotion it always maintained my interest. The direction is very intelligent and subtle. All in all a truly beautiful adaptation. 910 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Terence Davies has done a magnificent job of recreating the turn of the century in The House of Mirth a 2000 film starring Gillian Anderson Eric Stoltz Dan Ackroyd Laura Linney Anthony LaPaglia and Terry Kinney.Anderson is Lily Bart a beautiful young woman of good social standing traveling in the best circles who throws away her opportunities for a good marriage because she wants something more meaningful. However her reputation begins to suffer due to her circle's misreading of an innocent situation and things go from bad to worse for her as she descends down the social strata. She has it in her power to win back everything she has lost but refuses to stoop that low due to her love for one man.It's obvious that Davies took a great deal of care with this film. It is not infused with modern sensibilities the period look is authentic as is the look of the cast. By that I mean Gillian Anderson's sumptuous red hair full beautiful face and lovely figure are much more period than say Gwyneth Paltrow's  and yet films are rarely cast with an eye toward capturing the period in that way. The casting of Dan Ackroyd as Trenor is unusual but very right  he's not truly of the class he travels in and a real gladhander. Eric Stoltz is Selden  handsome without being drop dead gorgeous gentile without being effeminate who has good chemistry with Anderson.The villainess of the piece is Laura Linney as the awful Bertha Dorset a cunning witch and as usual Linney is perfection  smiling subtle and you can just see the knife going in. In the book she is more responsible for Lily's troubles than in the film. In the film we see her making initial trouble for Lily in the book she continues to work on destroying her with a whisper here and word there.What makes the story of Lily so frustrating is that she can ruin Bertha in five minutes but refuses suffering instead which drove me crazy. That's not the film's fault.This was an era where no one expressed emotions so when someone says thank you or I understand there is a world of meaning to be read in the eyes. It's a world of artifice and Davies obviously worked at getting this from his actors. Everything is in what lies beneath.The acting is uniformly excellent only Gillian Anderson falls a little short of the mark. Lily is an extremely difficult role and Anderson at least in 2000 did not have all the necessary skill to completely pull it off. She has the look the bearing and the intelligence. What she lacks is the ability to actually become someone of that era rather than putting it on like an overcoat. She does much better in the latter part of the film which calls for a different set of acting muscles than in the beginning.Reminiscent a bit of Sister Carrie The House of Mirth points up the difficulties of women in that time period to make their way of the boundaries of class and the rigidity of the upper class. Highly recommended but not an easy cheerful film by any means.".

	schema:headline " Beautifully done central performance carries another Wharton wallow in misery";
	schema:reviewBody "If this film adaptation depicting lives ruined by the social mores and hypocrisy of turn of the century upper crust New York society seems to have a lot in common with the similarly plotted The Age of Innocence it would be because authoress Edith Wharton was responsible for both novels. Unfortunately like The Age of Innocence this is yet another wallow in victimization and misery that Wharton seemed to specialize. However unlike The Age of Innocence where director Martin Scorsese seemed psychotically obsessed with the elegant trappings at the expense of his story director Terrence Davies is actually more interested in the players of his piece.The primary player is one Lily Bart played by Gillian Anderson a lovely elegant young woman who not only bungles her chance at true love but comes to realize to her detriment how much she is at the mercy of a fickle high society filled with pettiness envy and jealousy.Lily is at heart that rarest of beasts  a genuinely decent person. She has had the misfortune of accumulating a sizable debt from card playing which she anticipates paying back with the inheritance to be left her by harridan aunt Eleanor Bron. As Bron is infinitely more taken with dishrag ward Jodhi May it is questionable how much Lily can count on this development. Lily pines for scandalous attorney Eric Stoltz who is the sometime lover of society grand dame Laura Linney but finds bad timing and circumstance consistent obstacles to a relationship. In fact bad timing and bad luck seem to relentlessly dog Lily in every endeavor. Trusted friends and companions reveal themselves to be bitter enemies beneath the surface. When some scandalous letters fall into her lap that would prove to be her personal salvation Lily takes the high road to her further detriment.The House of Mirth does not have much mirth in it. It is depressing gloomy and leaves the viewer in an utterly hopeless state. It is a despairing experience to watch the destruction of a person who did not invite it does not deserve it and is left broken and battered by life while some appalling specimens of humanity glide past unscathed. This is by no stretch of the imagination an enjoyable viewing experience and one would imagine that it would be an even more trying reading experience.All that aside there are definitely reasons to watch the film. Davies' assured direction and the fine literate screenplay being two of them.Another compelling reason would be Anderson's central performance. Anyone who is only familiar with Anderson from The XFiles and oblivious to the stellar acting she has also contributed to British TV and films will most certainly be impressed with the appealing nuanced and heartfelt performance she contributes here. What makes Lily's inexorable downward spiral a spirit crushing blow is that until the final moments where she confronts her dismal future Anderson never plays Lily as a victim. She seems entirely too selfassured and confident in her quest to do the right thing. The climactic moments where her emotional walls crumble at what life has in store for her is a powerful sequence. The entire performance is a demonstration of understated grace.The supporting cast is strong with one notable exception. Linney is matteroffactly monstrous as society force of nature Bertha Dorsett who throws Lily to the wolves on a whim to make herself look better. Terry Kinney is sympathetic as Linney's cuckolded husband. When he makes an offer to Lily late in the film that would make both of them whole it comes across as a meeting of two lost souls and one is disappointed that Lily does not take him up on it. Dan Aykroyd is terrific playing against type as a joyfully manipulative scoundrel.Unfortunately the film is thrown offbalance by the miscasting of Stoltz in the pivotal role of the scandalous lothario that inspires so much consternation among the female characters. I usually find Stoltz underrated but here he is all wrong. Pastyfaced and limp Stoltz adopts an effete fey attitude that is more offputting than attractive. It reminds one somewhat of the miscasting of John Malkovich in Dangerous Liaisons. It is difficult to believe that one woman would find him irresistible but the fact that three women are in such ardor over him as to launch campaigns of betrayal on each other strains credibility at every turn. Worse Stoltz barely registers a pulse when Anderson shares the screen with him so that it hardly seems that Lily is letting much pass her by with this colorless smelt. He seems less like an unrequited love than a chance acquaintance. When Lily makes the ultimate sacrifice to spare his reputation it seems like a wasted effort. This casting leaves the important unrequited romance between the two characters a bust. And while it may be believable that a milksop like May would be enamored of Stoltz in this film it is inconceivable that a being depicted with the voracious appetites of Linney's Bertha Dorsett would stoop to inspect him much less expose herself to vulnerabilities to chase him. A really foolish bit of casting here that nearly throws the film off balance.".

	onyx:emotionText "If this film adaptation depicting lives ruined by the social mores and hypocrisy of turn of the century upper crust New York society seems to have a lot in common with the similarly plotted The Age of Innocence it would be because authoress Edith Wharton was responsible for both novels. Unfortunately like The Age of Innocence this is yet another wallow in victimization and misery that Wharton seemed to specialize. However unlike The Age of Innocence where director Martin Scorsese seemed psychotically obsessed with the elegant trappings at the expense of his story director Terrence Davies is actually more interested in the players of his piece.The primary player is one Lily Bart played by Gillian Anderson a lovely elegant young woman who not only bungles her chance at true love but comes to realize to her detriment how much she is at the mercy of a fickle high society filled with pettiness envy and jealousy.Lily is at heart that rarest of beasts  a genuinely decent person. She has had the misfortune of accumulating a sizable debt from card playing which she anticipates paying back with the inheritance to be left her by harridan aunt Eleanor Bron. As Bron is infinitely more taken with dishrag ward Jodhi May it is questionable how much Lily can count on this development. Lily pines for scandalous attorney Eric Stoltz who is the sometime lover of society grand dame Laura Linney but finds bad timing and circumstance consistent obstacles to a relationship. In fact bad timing and bad luck seem to relentlessly dog Lily in every endeavor. Trusted friends and companions reveal themselves to be bitter enemies beneath the surface.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a humorously brilliant little film from renown Japanese director Nagisha Oshima with dialogue which flows between French and English and a storyline all about Zoophilia. Nicely compliments the newly released R100. They would make a nice double feature together.The film follows a French diplomat who suspects his wife is having an affair after he finds out she has been secretly renting a second apartment from a private investigator he had hired.When he goes to investigate for himself he walks in on his wife....naked...in bed with a Chimpanzee.Flabbergasted by the whole thing he doesn't know what to think.But out of sheer curiosity he accepts his wife's kinky fetish...and even asks her to bring Max the chimp which is more likely some dude in a chimp costume...or a puppet to come and live with them and their son.The most awkward and hilarious scene occurs when the couple has friends over for dinner during which they hear Max screaming. Curious themselves they ask to meet him. But when they bring him out he pretty much molests his human lover in front of their friends.The film focuses less on the lustful aspects of the humanchimpanzee relationship though than it does on the psychological journey which our protagonist is swept through as he tries to understand his wife's psychological condition...not to mention an attempt to fathom what exactly goes on between them behind closed doors. He needs to know...and it's driving him mad.The entire spectacle is hilarious and filled with bestial and zoophilic innuendo. Like when Peter's secretarymistress set's the Queen up to visit a stud farm. At one point Peter the husband hires a prostitute and pays her to attempt to get Max to have sex with her...so he can watch although as it turns out....she wasn't his type...totally mine though!.While hilarious from start to finish I wouldn't exactly qualify this explicitly as a comedy. It's comedic element is more a result of the truly bizarre nature of the thematic content from the perspective of general normality if such a thing exists than it is from a brazen attempt to make you laugh. The jokes require a bit of reflection at least.When all is said and done this a truly imaginative and deviant piece of cinema that should be experienced by everyone. It will make you think. It will make you laugh. And it will make you go WHAT THE FK!?. What more can you ask for really? Oshima has nice framing too! 8.5 out for 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Seen with an audience in a theater Max Mon Amour can be a surprising and satisfying parable. When a womanizing diplomat Anthony Higgins realizes that his wife Charlotte Rampling may be having an affair he's shocked then disgusted that this lover is in fact a fullgrown chimpanzee. At first it appears that Rampling may be using the simian to exact emotional revenge on his wife then it seems that a special kind of love might be in play  which inflames his jealousy to the point of violence. Nagisa Oshima frames the film as an offbeat comedy but it's hard to ignore ignore its themes which include the blindness of love questioning to what degree we're human or animal. To the very last scenes it's difficult to predict that will happen to the chimp or the strange romance. It's presented almost entirely without music and filmed in French and English  as if to say the language spoken here is beyond words speaking the language of the heart. Of particular note is the rendering of the chimp which is presented so realistically that you almost believe it's real. Charlotte Rampling is enigmatic and sensual as Max's lover.".

So he hires a detective to follow her and the detective finds she does have a lover...a chimp! Instead of getting a divorce the very openminded husband invites her to bring her lover home to live with them! The most important thing you need to know about this film is that it is NOT explicit or pornographicat least when it comes to the chimp. Additionally it's quite the absurdist film because everyone plays it straight and the couple are so chill about the whole bestiality angle...as are many of their friends. This is typical of many of the writerdirector Nagisa shima's films. The overall effect is bizarre to say the least but at least the acting is good. NOT a film for everyone...in fact not a film for MOST people. Mostly because there isn't a lot of meaning behind all this...it's just absurd for the sake of absurdity and isn't actually that entertaining! More one for folks with serious head injuries and unnatural affection for animals! Or for folks what watch it on a dare!By the way the 'chimp' in this movie is VERY obviously some guy in a crappy chimp costume. Also if some woman was inclined to have a bestial relationship with a chimp it wouldn't be especially satisfying. Chimp sex routinely lasts less than 5 seconds and the whole beating the woman to death because they are vicious would be a real turn off as well! Also the detective is played by the legendary French comedy film director and actor Pierre taix.".

The story is rather ambitious and though it does not always fit together as well as it could have it has a number of interesting aspects centering on Lamarr's character Madeleine.Madeleine is an interesting and complex character starting out as a harddriving selfabsorbed art editor confronting an emotional crisis and then starting a new life that brings its own challenges. It's a great role and Lamarr fills it pretty well and makes good use of the material. The character is welldrawn enough to make the movie as a whole worthwhile despite a number of flaws elsewhere.The supporting cast is solid though most of the secondary characters don't have as much depth. They usually serve mainly to drive the plot andor to develop the main character further. The psychiatrist character seems just a little exaggerated now since the assumptions he makes are no longer accepted unquestioningly. The character would still work all right if he were made less infallible and inflexible.The first part of the story probably works the best painting an interesting picture of the changes in Madeleine's life. The courtroom sequence in the second half sometimes seems a bit contrived but dramatically it works all right. Overall the movie seems as if it could have been better with a few improvements but it's worth seeing and Lamarr provides a good reason to watch it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The most beautiful woman in films was the epithet generally bestowed upon the amazing Hedy Lamarr. But she might equally well have been called the most intelligent woman in films because she was the coinventor with George Antheil of radioguided torpedoes for the U.S. Navy using a frequencyhopping method of communication which is now fundamental to the technology of all mobile cellphones. The story of this is well told in Antheil's autobiography Bad Boy of Music. This film is excellently directed by English director Robert Stevenson director of several classics such as Owd Bob 1936 see my review. Hedy is as usual fascinating to watch and because the real Hedy was a somewhat disturbed character she was twice arrested for shoplifting and once convicted the slightly mad flicker in her eyes may not all have been acting. We have recently learned that she was really Jewish not Austrian and that makes a lot more sense as she did not exactly look like an Alpine Yodeler her real surname was Kiesler although strangely enough in this film at one point she dresses like one. In fact the clothes worn by Hedy in this film are all so amazingly spectacular that they amount to nothing less than a fantasy fashion parade. At one point she walks into the snow in a white fur coat which is so large one almost imagines her to be a polar bear masquerading as a human. The gowns and jackets are a cross between Dior and Dali. Opposite Lamarr as the serious love interest is of all people Dennis O'Keefe better known as a tough guy and who went on to make TMen see my review in the same year. O'Keefe was always underrated and here does very well as a gentle young scientist who always has his nose up a test tube and only occasionally notices how beautiful his girlfriend is. But Hedy is a gal with a past and what a past. In those days sexual compulsion bordering on nymphomania had to be treated delicately in films never overtly stated. So we have here a film heavy with innuendo and lots of emphatic ambiguities from Hedy's psychiatrist to worry us. Morris Carnovsky always played a very convincing psychiatrist and if he looked at me in that stern way and told me I was a nymphomaniac I might almost believe him even though I am a man. So poor Hedy never had a chance but to get well. Why was it that she could not resist the oily John Loder? And everyone else for that matter? Her attempts to reform by moving to a Greenwich Village hideaway and becoming a simple artist where she meets O'Keefe are threatened by all those guys who just won't leave her alone. And cocktails do terrible things to her. This is a very gripping film and Hedy Lamarr was perfect for the lead. Wrongly accused of John Loder's murder Lamarr sits in court refusing to defend herself because O'Keefe doesn't love her any more or does he? and the tension goes right up to the end. Will she be convicted? Will O'Keefe overcome his disgust? Can her psychiatrist sway the jury? Will can love conquer all? Good stuff.".

	schema:reviewBody "I too have been a fan of Hedy's for a long time. All of her movies are very watchable because of her beauty and a few are better than others because of the production quality story etc. But Dishonored Lady was made by a director that knew absolutely what he had. Every scene has the very best angle with lighting and expression. A lot of her movies have her looking great most of the time how could she not look greatbut this one maximizes her beauty in every single scene. The copies I have seen are a little rough and that is a shame. This is the movie that makes you wonder why she wasn't in higher demand. The story is great drama with a respectable supporting cast and allows her to be the working girl the bad girl the sad girl the girl next door and the accused murderess. Can it get any better than this with every scene suitable as a still? There is not an actress today that comes close to having the screen presence that Hedy had in her heyday.".

	schema:headline " Gorgeous Hedy Lamarr Outshines Glizy Fashions and Psychology on the HalfShell";
	schema:reviewBody "It would be a mistake to say that Hedy Lamarr was just a pretty face for two reasons. 1 Pretty would be a gross understatement. She had a gorgeous face and all the rest of her was likewise if you get what I mean. 2 She really could act as she proved taking on a complex role in Dishonored Lady. Okay she wasn't in a class with Bette Davis. But then Bette Davis would not have been believable in Hedy's role because no one would believe all those men would have been so obsessively attracted to the frumpy Ms. Davis.Dishonored Lady is an early example of the pychodrama and possibly one of the best in that typically dreary and not so entertaining genre. The average American of the late 1940's wasn't really sure what a psychiatrist was unless he was a WWII veteran suffering from what is now called posttraumatic stress syndrome. But the highliving Hollywood crowd knew all about that shadowy type of doc. So it is not surprising we started seeing movies about people with structural problems in the upper stories. Joan Crawford at this stage of her career glommed on to this overwrought type of dramas. Not surprisingly since it would be a major shocker if a dame like her didn't have a shrink on the payroll.In Dishonored Lady the shrink played with great verve by Morris Carnovsky is the pivotal character. Hedy's character is a highpaid advertising designer surrounded by shallow dishonorable men who take advantage of her promiscuous nature. I say promiscuous but I mean by the standards of the late 1940's when the world was only just starting to go mad. By today's dropyourdrawersifsomebodyjustlooksliketheywantyouto standards maybe she would be regarded as a prude. At least she has some guilt feelings about it. In fact she becomes so disgusted with herself that she tries to commit suicide by ramming her speeding car into a stone fence. She has the good luck 1 not to be seriously injured and 2 to fall right into the attentions of psychiatrist Carnovsky who owns the house behind the fence. He proceeds to help her get over the suicidal urge and to put some corners on her round heels.Turns out she has found in this psychiatrist one of the best of that iffy bunch. Though we see the couch business in his office as if he were a practitioner of the nowdiscredited Freudian branch of psychoanalysis he is in reality a common sense psychologist. Like one of those good oldtime tough priests he doesn't mind telling someone he or she is doing wrong and just needs to straighten up. Best line in the movie  when one of Hedy's rich carnivorous exboyfriends takes offense at Carnovsky's criticism of his ways the psychiatrist replies I usually get paid for insulting people. It goes on from there and this is a very entertaining movie. It's part psychodrama part crime drama part courtroom drama part love story. All works well. Heddy's supporting cast led by Carnovsky and Dennis O'Keefe are all very good. O'Keefe cast somewhat against type plays a nice medical research doctor who thinks of nothing but germs until he falls in love at first sight with Hedy and what man wouldn't. But we get to see a little of his tough guy side before the end. To say any late 'forties movie has good cinematography and fluid editing is redundant.Dishonored Lady is an enjoyable watch and a good showcase for Hedy Lamarr's beauty and talent.".

I will  not provide a spoiler but a murder is committed and Hedy is accused.Examined in the film is the power of love and belief in that person when all the evidence points against them.Hedy's supporting cast are only adequate as this film evidently could only support one star.I am not familiar with the director Robert Stevenson. Certainly he is not of the first  order but ...adequate a bit like the film.My motive to own the DVD was to see the mature Hedy Lamarr after seeing her as a 20 year old in Exctase1933.She comes over as rather enigmatic even when she resolves her love with Dr. David S.

In some ways this film is rather oldfashioned but in other ways it is pleasingly ahead of its time. On the one hand Hedy Lamarr is so upset that she has succumbed to the desires of the flesh that she tries suicides. In this day and age her behavior would not rate particularly scandalous but in 1947 society's judgment weighed heavier on people's public morals. Consequently Madeline's suicide attempt. Fortunately she fails in her attempt and makes a very modern decision  removing herself from what might today be termed a toxic environment and retreating to get in touch with herself. She gets to a better place and then everything comes crashing down on her. How will she respond? I found this a very enjoyable movie. Hedy Lamarr is gorgeous and this is a fascinating role for her  getting to be vulnerable a tigress a very successful businesswoman and a woman happily in love. I found her love interest to be very good as a mildmannered scientist. His love for her was apparent when the police came and it seemed his dreams melted away before his eyes. I also found psychologist Dr. Caleb to be great. I thought his insights were the strongest point of the script and I thought Morris Carnovsky injected the character with the requisite fire and probably even more than one anticipated from a doctor which made the performance all the more noteworthy. I thought John Loder as reptilian Felix Courtland was also excellent as was William Lundigan as a spoiled jealous callow rival of Madeleine's in the office.I really liked this film and think the score it has on IMDb should be a lot higher.".

I never heard those attributes given to other leading actress's of that period...Rita Gene and etc. So there must have been a reason for her to get that title of 'the most beautiful woman in films. Aside from her looks I always thought she was a fine actress and a fine comedienne when given such roles which were few... . In this movie she had one 'drunken' scene that I thought she was great. I actually believed she was 'high'. it was the scene in the night club where she was suppose to help her gossipy excoworker. It's not easy to portray someone that is 'high' on a few drinks..one can actually see when one is overdoing it. Another trivia ...it took another studio Paramount to put her in a Technicolor movie Samson  Delilah for the first time after being at MGM since 1938...11 years later. During that same period Betty Grable was making technicolor movies one after another musical and Dorothy Lamour with her Jungle roles.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hedy Lamarr once remarked I believe that most of her films were pretty forgettable. If she didn't then most of her critics did. Maybe looking back on them none stood out as exceptional. But they can be called good for what they were. This film Dishonored Lady is one such example. It may not win any awards and may not be that important in the long scheme of things but this is a good little programmer or 'b' picture that really packs a wallop and entertains for about 90 minutes. We open on Hedy sitting in her car and after a time and after a cop asking if she's okay she rams her car into a tree. A psychiatrist saves her and tries to get her to tell him her problems. She's thankful for his interest but leaves not planning on going back. We then see how things develop as she ultimately leaves her job wanting to find peace somewhere. She changes her name for a fresh start and meets Dennis O'Keefe who's another tenant in the apartment. John Loder who was one of Hedy Lamarr's husbands in real life plays a client of hers from the fashion job who finds her in her new place and from there things happen. William Lundigan Morris Carnovsky as the psychiatrist Natalie Schafer from Gilligan's Island Paul Cavanaugh Douglas Dumbrille and Margaret Hamilton the Wicked Witch of the West from The Wizard of Oz make up the rest of the cast. Their names may not mean much to the average person today but these are all very reliable actors who make the film even more enjoyable. What's unique about Lundigan and O'Keefe being in the same picture here is that usually they were competing for the same type of roles in films the young man usually on the right side of the law and is set on solving a murder that is thrust upon them. Sometimes they played a detective and other times they were an average Joe with a murder rap on their head to clear. If you ever get a chance to catch a Dishonored Lady see it for yourself. It may be one of the best of Hedy Lamarr's forgettable films.".

At the end of an age where it was honorable to at least want to be fooled into that illusion of innocence this film predicts a future where those around us will too much enjoy our less honorable moments ...loves company to ever let us engage our best selves. An age of candid camera in the face of ridicule an age of honor meaning you use protection.This is a film that isn't foolish or fooled. It isn't innocent even if the word excitement is used for sex. But it's about innocence in transition. Transition between innocence solidly existing even if buttressed since time by illusion to the illusion we now have that there is no such a thing as innocence at allthe latter illusion being the tool of those who would take our childhood abuses and adolescent mistakes and rule us with them or roll us with them in the dirt until our better selves seem too far away or too hard to reach.This isn't so much a film for the woman Jesus stopped from being stoned as it is a sadly correct sociopsychological analysis of how little it will mean to be holding a rock in years to comerocks made mostly of dried past that itself was full of peltings. The villains of this film are just the everyday us foiled in the last flickers of that bright illusion of innocence.Who cares if you killed him?".

In other words the film was a stinker so they didn't bother to renew the copyright. But in the case of Dishonored Lady the film is pretty good and you wonder why it's included with these clunkers.The film begins with Hedy Lamarr behaving like she'd like to diethough she denies she has a problem. She also is apparently 'a bad lady' though the film only implied what this meansand I do think this is one case where the requirements of the Production Code harmed the movie. Had they said she had been very sexually active what happened throughout the film would have made a lot more sense.Regardless a kind psychiatrist sees a sad and sick lady and offers to help. They make some progress and Hedy decides much of her problem is the company she keeps so she quits her highpaid job and leaves all her old 'friends'. With a brandnew identity she takes joy in a simpler and less salacious life. She also meets a nice guy Dennis O'Keefe and they fall in love. However she does not tell him about her pastand eventually this comes between them. I could say a lot more but I'll leave it up to you to find out for yourself.The film had some nice performances. While Hedy is a bit wooden she often was woodenand it's probably one of her better performances. While O'Keefe is a lesserknown actor he was also very goodand I liked him at the end in a very rough and tumble scene. The script was nice as wellwith my only real complaint being the vagueness of Hedy's past. Worth seeing though by no means a great film.By the way if you do see this movie get a load of the crazy wardrobe Hedy wears through much of the film. NO ONE ever dressed like thisnot that chic and wellcoiffed. In fact I found it a bit laughable that she looked like she stepped off a fashion runway every time she went to work!".

Still the theme is really modern and I was surprised it was deemed admissible at the time.

There is something about Hedy Lamarr you can never reach while Vivien Leigh is too easily reached.

She comes from Europe somewhere her home country is never mentioned she came alone with her father an artist who eventually committed suicide. You can imagine her problems started there.In New York she is highly appreciated as a successful artist maybe too highly for her own good and there is particularly a rich jeweller and millionaire who never tires of trying to seduce her mainly by insisting on giving her a ride in bad weather and instead of driving her home driving her to his place where he insists on her having some drinks. The problem is that with all her dangerous beauty she is totally innocent and can't defend herself due to her complexes as a severely selfcritical artist  like many sensitive and true artists she can't believe in herself unless someone else does. Fortunately she gains a very true friend in a psychiatrist who actually is the hero of the plot. Dennis O'Keefe is all right but he is second in importance to the turn of events. There are many other fellows as well one good and one bad and the bad one is entirely without character and it's an interesting moment of truth that she instinctively leaves the home of the seducing jeweller the moment she hears the other entering  without recognizing his voice. There are many such poignant moments of immense psychological interest in the film which makes it an extremely fascinating study and thriller for that matter although there is never any blood.

Luckily for Lamarr her career wasn't quite over because Cecil B. DeMille later cast her as Delilah in Samson and Delilah. Before that and her time at MGM over Lamarr made Dishonored Lady in 1947 starring the aforementioned O'Keefe as well as her husband John Loder Morris Carnovsky William Lundigan Natalie Schaefer Paul Cavanaugh and Margaret Hamilton.Lamarr plays Madeleine the beautiful glamorous editor of a Manhattan magazine who goes from man to man which we gather from this carefully worded script. After sessions with a psychiatrist she changes her name and moves away from her job deciding instead to concentrate on painting while getting her life and herself back together. In her apartment building she meets an attractive scientist O'Keefe and the two fall in love.However the past returns to haunt Madeleine in a particularly vicious way.Decent film and it's always a pleasure to see Lamarr. There were precious few who could even come close to her beauty even here when she's the grand old age of 32. Though she was often cast for her beauty and sexuality Lamarr had a spark as well as a very pleasant voice and here turns in a fine performance. She's surrounded by some excellent actors as well.Much has been written about Lamarr's work as an inventor but her life was fascinating even without it. There are two stories about how she escaped her first husband Fritz Mandl who was connected to the Nazis as well as getting out of Austria. One is that she drugged a maid who resembled her and changed into her uniform. Another is that she wore all of her jewelry to a party and left afterwards never returning home.Recommended for Lamarr fans.".

Kept on a string by her are accountant William Lundigan her boss and jeweler real life husband John Loder and research scientist Dennis O'Keefe whom when she first him he has no idea about her fame and character.The film opens with a suicide attempt where psychiatrist Morris Carnovsky is on the scene and she becomes a patient. With the Code in place we never get a frank discussion of her illness which is nymphomania. That in itself hampers the development of the characters who except for Lamarr are quite one dimensional.Three men are involved with her one of them dies one of them did it and one of them winds up with her. No real suspense in identifying who is who as you watch the film.Still 84 minutes of Hedy Lamarr is also a pleasure.".

Kept on a string by her are accountant William Lundigan her boss and jeweler real life husband John Loder and research scientist Dennis O'Keefe whom when she first him he has no idea about her fame and character.The film opens with a suicide attempt where psychiatrist Morris Carnovsky is on the scene and she becomes a patient. With the Code in place we never get a frank discussion of her illness which is nymphomania. That in itself hampers the development of the characters who except for Lamarr are quite one dimensional.Three men are involved with her one of them dies one of them did it and one of them winds up with her. No real suspense in identifying who is who as you watch the film.Still 84 minutes of Hedy Lamarr is also a pleasure.";

	schema:reviewBody "The movie's designed to show off the gorgeous LaMarr Madeleine and her acting chops. Note the number of loving closeups of Madeleine's rather dreamy expression. But then the exart director for a big magazine is having problems. Seems as though she can't resist having sex with the wrong kind of guys Loder and Lundigan even as she tries at a normal life with O'Keefe. Her problem of course can only be implied this being Production Code territory. Still it's the kind of role then identified with a 'woman's picture' that is a wayward woman's struggle for redemption.The year 1947 is when Hollywood was embracing that newfangled science of psychiatry. So the intellectuallooking Carnovsky gets a turn as Madeleine's headshrink who appears to know all. Too bad we find out so soon who killed Courtland Loder. Keeping us guessing would have heightened suspense which the rather slow pacing could use. And what's with that acrobatic fistfight near the end. It looks more like Saturday matine brawl than anything serious. Nonetheless the 80some minutes are wellproduced and shrewdly cast while LaMarr shows she's more than just a beautiful face. In passingI did have trouble distinguishing O'Keefe from Lundigan. They look a lot alike. Then again maybe that was intentional since the likeness would explain some of Madeleine's conflicts.".

In her Hollywood years she'd been glamorized and Sydney Guilaroffed to a tee. Earlier in her 1936 breakout film Extase she was a little heftier although you'd never notice it except in her nude scenes. Her real name of course was not Hedy Lamarr. Nobody's name is that exquisite. In life she was born to a family of Lichtenberger nobility and was known as Baronesse Sieglinda von Sturmen und Drangen. Really.At any rate she looks just fine in this rather drawnout romantic drama of a woman who is consumed by the need for power and money and rises to the top of the art department of a chic New York magazine or something like that. She sleeps around recklessly becomes despondent accidentally meets a psychiatrist who advises her to find herself. So she quits being rich which is always a foolish move sheds her old identity and starts life over as a struggling artist in a shabby room. Her neighbor is a fledgling research scientist Dennis O'Keefe and they fall for each other. Lamarr however is reluctant to reveal her past to O'Keefe despite the urging of her psychiatrist.A private eye hired by one of her former lovers who must be very rich because he's festooned with watch fobs discovers Lamarr's new identity. The slimy former lover gets her drunk mates with her in his apartment and after she dashes out in a guiltridden funk Mr. Croesus is murdered by someone who shall remain nameless here. Hint It's William Lundigan. Throughout poor Lamarr is in trouble. Her past imperfect life haunts her. She's hectored by that rich old satyr. She has no artistic talent. Her new life is a revelation and she beams with a tentative happiness especially when O'Keefe proposes to her but she still can't bring herself to tell him about her checkered history. But it all comes out in the murder trial.It's really too long for what it has to say. And nobody turns in a bravura performance. It must be said that Hedy Lamarr can at least do drunk better than some others like Richard Egan and Doris Day who were positive embarrassments when they tried. Doris Day in That Touch of Mink. Eww I wince just thinking about it. Good screen drunks included Jimmy Cagney and Lee Marvin but that's neither here nor there. The dialog has some bright spots. Somebody's reply is described as decidedly acidic. And when the rich jewel collector entices her into his apartment and begins whispering sweet nothings into her ear she looks at him over her shoulder and asks Aren't you going to show me your jewels? I doubt that last one was intended to be as amusing as it is.At heart this is the kind of woman's picture that was common in the 30s and 40s and always found a ready audience. There has never been such strenuous suffering outside of a war movie.".

We want to know why and it is left in the hands of a psychologist Dr Caleb Morris Carnovsky to help her to turn her life around and face the cause of her unhappiness.

For the first hour of the film we mainly concentrate on her relationships with Courtland John Loder and David Dennis O'Keefe. Then something unexpected happens.....a murder.....and Madeleine is the accused..... A first I wasn't sure where the film was heading but after a while I understood that it was about the character of Madeleine and who she was going to choose for a husband  the 2 candidates being Courtland and David. As a result of this woman's theme the film ticked along at a leisurely pace. But after an hour it took an entirely new and welcome turn with some stolen jewels and a murder. We know who the murderer is but it is still intriguing to see how the culprit will be revealed to everyone else. The safe in Courtland's apartment now takes on significance.The acting is good. Heddy Lamarr doesn't do much after the first hour  in fact she's pretty annoying as she resigns herself to being found guilty of murder. Actually she's also pretty irritating in the first hour as well with her mood swings she sacks her staff for gossipping about her  bitch! and her indecision in affairs of the heart is pathetic. Dennis O'Keefe is good as her suitor who is fooled by her as is William Lundigan who plays Geret a former work colleague of her's. The cast is also supported well by Margaret Hamilton as the landlady who has a cartoon weirdness about her. The policemen who come to arrest Madeleine are also memorable for their nononsense approach.I have to say that I found Morris Carnovsky slightly preachy and smug in his psychological interpretations. Madeleine knows what her problem is.....she's a slag.I enjoyed this film  the memorable scenes coming at the beginning with Madeleine's suicide attempt and in the last half hour where the film picks up a gear.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Corny but interesting movie involving fashion magazine editor Madeleine or Maddie for short Damien played by who was considered the most beautiful woman in the world at the time Heddy Lamarr who's got serious problems about her life career and future. Maddie has been hounded by one of her advertising clients diamond and jewel collector Felix The Wolf Courtland John Loder who's got the hots for the pretty lady. Feeling confused and vulnerable to Felix's unwanted advances Maddie decides to quit her job and become an artist moving into a walk up flat or apartment in Greenwich Village. While there Maddie meets and falls in love with struggling medical student David Cousins Dennis O'Keefe after finding his prized rat that David uses for his experiments in the hallway and to David's surprise in her being a woman not being scared to death of it. It was love at first sight but that love was soon to be interrupted by the hot in the pants Felix who just couldn't get the beautiful Maddie out of his mind and went out of his way to make a play for her.Bumping he wishes into Meddie at a swanky restaurant that was rearranged by her friend Ethel Natalie Schafer Felix gets Maddie good and drunk and practically kidnaps her in his limousine to his pad on the Upper East Side to make love to her. It just happened that Filex had an unexpected guest his male secretary Jack Garet William Lundiganwhom he accused of stealing a 5000.00 worth diamond out of his wall safe. With Felix threatening to expose his crime to the police Garet while Felix's head is turned bashes his skull in killing him. This all happens as Maddie is dead drunk on the couch from all the booze that Felix in softening her up forced on her.SPOILERS In the end Maddie is charged with Filex's murder and her lover and fiance now Doctor David Cousins totally disowning her in suspecting that she's been fooling around with the now dead Felix behind his back! It's Maddie's understanding and kindly holocaust survivor psychiatrist Dr. Dick Caled Morris Carnovsky who sets David straight in what kind of a mind set Maddie was in at the time.

Simultaneously the AngloPortuguese command organizes the evacuation of the entire territory between the battlefield and the lines of Torres Vedras a gigantic burned land operation which prevents the French from collecting supplies.

The Franch army now entered the center of the country and marched to the south with relative facility despite having been beaten at Buaco by the AngloPortuguese troops who began to withdraw to the south till they reached the Lines of Torres Vedras a huge mass of fortifications built in secret by Wellington in the previous one and half year behind which they entrenched themselves always under Wellington command. The French army after being before the Lines for some time realized they were unconquerable and retreated for good. This movie is about that but who is hoping to see a historical movie may be somewhat disappointed because though the story develops itself having that war as a background it is much more about the personal adventures and misadventures of its characters not only the main ones but some minor ones too. It is very good from the technical standpoint I mean the scenes camera movements sequences angles of view framings and visual details are very good indeed. The acting is also excellent with a luxury cast with such actors like John Malkovich as Wellingtonand the Portuguese Nuno Lopes. The reproduction of the epoch atmosphere in sceneries and costumes is also excellent. The main flaw that can be appointed to this movie is that the story somehow lacks a thread losing itself among scattered and diverse episodes although very well shown and developed. And in terms of social usages certain love scenes for instance and language employed there is some inadequacy to early 19th century seeming much more as belonging to our contemporary meanings and values.".

One can get confused easily.Despite its flaws I find the film watchable for the settings for the costume and for certain portions of the human dramas depicted.

	schema:reviewBody "Like The Mysteries of Lisbon this film was adapted by Raoul Ruiz from a novel by Camilo Castelo Branco. However after Ruiz's death it was directed by his widow Valeria Sarmiento. It depicts the retreat of the AngloPortuguese army under the Viscount as he then was Wellington to the Lines of Torres Vedas and the civilians forced to retreat with them as a result of the scorched earth policy imposed by Wellington. Malkovich's Wellington isn't much like the original. Malkovich is twenty years too old for the part and looks nothing like the original to begin with. He is shown almost entirely in his relations with a French exile painting his portrait complaining about too many corpses and not enough panache in pictures of battles and wondering whether being known for inventing Beef Wellington is a compliment. About the only suggestion that Wellington was a military genius is the repeated emphasis that he had ordered the Lines to be built over a year before and had anticipated his eventual retreat to them before the start of the campaign. There are only two curious scenes which suggest other aspects than buffoonery to his character one where he watches through a telescope an aide has given him an idiot boy stagger through the retreating mob of civilians looking for help. Does he know the human cost of his policy and escape it in absurdity? The other his last appearance where he gazes at a portrait of Bonaparte. Does he want to look like Bonaparte? Does he want to be Bonaparte? Is he getting into the mind of his opponent like Montgomery with Rommell? It's impossible to say.Fortunately Wellington himself is a small role. The main emphasis is on individuals caught up in the retreat a Portuguese sergeant his wounded lieutenant the Irish widow with a cutglass English accent unfortunately of one of Wellington's soldiers a Portuguese whore an AngloPortuguese girl with a taste for incest an atfirstunidentified French soldier the French general Massna's transvestite mistress in a hussar's uniform the idiot boy an aristocrat fleeing with his library and searching for his vanished wife an apparently unscrupulous pedlar...these are just a few of the characters involved. On the one hand they are often so interesting that we'd like to know more about them on the other they never stay long enough to bore or annoy. A plot does emerge gradually with quite a few characters involved but it is the line to connect the various events a series of horrors and atrocities some recounted in a grimly comic way. I've never seen any of Sarmiento's films so I can't say how this differs from the way Ruiz would have directed it the grim humour or its openness is hers rather than Ruiz's I think and a certain lightness of touch. One astonishing thing is the effects obtained from a fairly small cast and a small budget we are never aware that we are watching 'armies' of a few dozen people. One complaint the Portuguese T.V. version is three 60 minute episodes the film is 151 minutes long only thirty minutes shorter. Given that why not let us see the lot? It would still be shorter than The Mysteries of Lisbon.".

Actually this is a collection of soap opera sketches set against the grim background of the general evacuation brought about by the French advance.This bleak background provides the contrasting point to the light humorous often implausible and generally unhistorical approach that characterizes the sketches. They are centered on different individuals involved in the evacuation and they bear an unmistakable and irritating to me feminine touch. The character of Wellington is not made an exception and the filmmakers make no attempt to portray his personality or his military abilities.Another annoying touch is that the French are portrayed as involved in all kinds of base butchery. These acts of cruelty are partly exaggerated for the part that they are true no attempt is made to explain that this was the normal trend in this era and that the English and the Portuguese behaved in exactly the same way. Historical exactness plays no part in the movie since all characters are English or Portuguese and they are presented sympathetically the director needed some bad guys on the other side of the pond.In conclusion a successful attempt at duplicating American soap operas set against a historical background. Go to the box office if you are interested in comedy don't go if you have any serious penchant for history.".

The character of Wellington is not made an exception and the filmmakers make no attempt to portray his personality or his military abilities.Another annoying touch is that the French are portrayed as involved in all kinds of base butchery. These acts of cruelty are partly exaggerated for the part that they are true no attempt is made to explain that this was the normal trend in this era and that the English and the Portuguese behaved in exactly the same way. Historical exactness plays no part in the movie since all characters are English or Portuguese and they are presented sympathetically the director needed some bad guys on the other side of the pond.In conclusion a successful attempt at duplicating American soap operas set against a historical background. Go to the box office if you are interested in comedy don't go if you have any serious penchant for history.";

	schema:reviewBody "A historical drama coproduced by Portugal and France. The plot takes place post Battle of Bussaco 27091810 while the population and the AngloPortuguese troops make the strategic withdrawal for the Lines of Torres Vedras erected by order of General Wellington in an attempt to make a final decisive stand against the advance of the Napoleonic Army lead by Marechal Massena.A film that had everything to be extraordinary and perhaps even a striking epic of the Portuguese cinema with a budget around 5 million Euros it is revolting that it does not contain a single battle scene just two brief skirmishes. It follows too many characters none of them of consequence on the grand scheme of the theme portrayed except Wellington and Massena so the audience does not empathize with any of them even with a length time of 151 minutes 2h31m. I guess all the money went to scenery costumes and some 'big name' actors that hardly show for a maximum of 5 minutes to quickly disappear and never be seen again. I know that the focus of this movie is on the common folks their plights and efforts during such a terrible event but the movie is called Lines of Wellington not Evacuation to Torres Vedras! Therefore the title is misleading being more a soapopera with a thematic backdrop then properly a movie about the title's theme.So I assumed the plot would revolve around the two most influential personalities related to the event Massena Melvil Poupaud and Wellington John Malkovich. But Massena hardly has any screen time and when he does he rarely talks! He also should have been played by someone at least ten years older just as the real Massena was during that time. And Wellington who also should have been played by someone at least twenty years younger like the real Wellington was during that time just comes out as a pompous ass which really annoys me sure he was pompous due to his historical social and upbringing context but I doubt he was an ass even more amidst a military campaign as portrayed by Malkovich! And then when comes that scene where he recites the Beef Wellington recipe I swear I never before in my entire life felt so compelled to punch the screen! There is no proof that the two are related! John Malkovich you are a nice actor but I will never forgive you for making an ass out of one of the greatest European heroes the man who defeated Napoleon Bonaparte! And your hair is ridiculous Wellington was ahead of his time and already wore it short.I really have no clue to what was the producers' idea behind this grotesque travesty. Have they made any minimal research? The majority of characters are purely fictional. The acting is just ordinary except Victoria Guerra that really uplifts the scene when on screen. The soundtrack is nice but nothing epic and a bit monotonous. And don't even tell me about the 'not so' outstanding technical aspects because nowadays it is no hardship to get outstanding settings and costumes for period movies so that does not count!  I know it should but I won't.For those who want to have a true historical perspective of this event and its most outstanding characters please buy a book on the subject or consult Wikipedia because from this movie you learn nothing. The only payoff is 2 or 3 interesting dialogues and to see Soraia Chaves and Victoria Guerra naked but not even that is sufficient to save this movie from being on my short list of the most hated ones.".

Strictly stock footage and poor rearprojection for the race scenes.  Some nice touches in the dialogue.  It's actually surprising that this film emerges as watchable but it even ends up being likeable.  Well it took me years to find it but I can't say I ever expected it to be any good so I guess I wasn't disappointed. First film for American International Pictures then known as American Releasing Corporation or ARC under the auspices of the infamous Alex Gordon Jim Nicholson and Sam Arkoff whose only producers at that time were Gordon Corman and eventually Herman Cohen if I got all the names right.  Anyway as most drive in fans know these guys changed the world of movies and I guess this little film is where it all started.

Most of the movie consists of this journey together to freedom.When I saw that John Ireland starred in this film I made extra sure to see it as he's one of my favorite unknown actors from Hollywood in the 40s and 50s. I love his films because he was a great Film Noir starkind of ugly and toughexactly what you'd expect for the genre where pretty boys are unwelcome. However while this film has a few Film Noir qualities after all it's about a man wanted for murder it really isn't exactly Noir and Ireland's character lacks the delicious evilness that I'd hoped to see. While tough and full of snappy dialog his character is just too likable and the plot too upbeat to be considered Noir by us purists. In addition having Malone and Ireland fall in love was just wrongmaking no sense and thereby damaged the film's sense of realismsomething imperative to have in Noir. Plus all the grainy stock footage of auto races just seemed cheap and out of place. As a result of all these factors I was very disappointed and so would be other fans of Noir and it's a low budget timepasser and unfortunately not much else.".

	schema:reviewBody "The mid1900s was a time when film was still working its way into being less conservative for certain thematic material. Unlike today when somebody hears the term fast or furious in the same sentence many people think of the Universal Studios' billion dollar franchise that has soared to endless heights with its insane car stunts and character driven writing. Jumping back into the middle of the 20th century there's this film that Universal had acquired the title rights from and it's important to understand times were much different then. Not only is it super tame in its action and stunts but several other elements are slimmed down as well. Kiss those 130blockbuster minutes goodbye this feature rolls in at a tiny 72 minutes barely enough to pass as a theatrical film these days. Believe it or not these points don't sound promising but the film does stand on its own. It's just not anything beyond a onetime watch.The story is about a wrongly convicted truck driver named Frank Webster John Ireland who is trying to escape to Mexico before the authorities can get a hold of him. Upon leaving a diner he takes a lady named Connie Adair Dorothy Malone and her brand new Jaguar cruiser hostage in order to escape quickly enough from being arrested. The film was directed partially by main actor John Ireland and Edward Sampson both of which were relatively new to directing. This was Sampson's first credit Ireland's second and their last for both. For directing quality it's focused but more or less uninspired. The script that was originally conceived by Roger Corman and then adapted by Jerome Odlum and Jean Howell is slightly better because the viewer will get an understanding of how and why Frank Webster is who he is. Also those who fondly enjoy The Fast and the Furious 2001 will be able to see what pieces of the script of this film were lifted from. Other than the title and fast cars sabotaging trucks street races and wrongly convicted individuals go handinhand with that of the 2001 film.The screenplay still has its problems though with character motivations and dialog. Most likely due to the short run time the speed at which characters change their opinion on certain matters feels unnatural or is just illogical. The problems with the dialog are simple to notice too. Much of the dramatic heft and delivery of lines range between cheesy 50s acting to stiff as a board. The cheesiness comes from when police officers are trying to get information from a suspect and it feels overly silly. The actor that is the most rigid in their role is surprisingly John Ireland. Considering Ireland had practically a decade to hone his acting chops his deliver is emotionless here. Plus what may be annoying to some viewers is that Ireland's character was written to always have the last word in a conversation. Yes we understand Frank Webster is not a man to be messed with but making him get in the last word to every conversation makes him sound immature.For racing action a lot is seen that it is all stock footage. For 1955 people most likely believed or found this to be adequate special effects. For today's standards of course not but it should be appreciated for what is depicted and the effort that went into making it look as realistic as possible. There are some moments where producerwriter Roger Corman did act as a stunt driver and its not the easiest to tell actually. The time when Corman is a stunt driver is about as equally concealed as to today's films that try to hide certain stunts into a film. Either way there is some swift moving sleek looking cars shot in this movie. If there's one thing this film highlights it's how races used to be conducted back in the 1950s. Something of which many people don't see anymore and is a much different experience. There are also some crash and burn moments too but again it is much less than what today's audiences have seen.The cinematography handled by Floyd Crosby was decent too. Crosby best known for working on House of Usher 1960 along side Corman demonstrate his ability to keep the camera focused on what's important on screen. Unfortunately it does suffer from shaking occasionally but not from today's shakycam issues. The problem arises more from the fact that some shots are filmed of which looked like the camera was physically on the back of a car. At that point in time back then it is most likely that the right technology hadn't been created yet or the budget did not allow for such fancy gadgets. But for as problematic as it may sound those shots are actually the best because they feel the most real in the film without using green screen or other cheap effects. The music composed by Alexander Gerens was okay. It wasn't anything special with a main theme but it did give the film that classic 1950s sound that only a certain era of film making could provide. Can't knock that.It's by no means even a very involving film but it does have decent effects camerawork and music. It also showcases retro cars along with other things that are different from that time. It's screenplay even gives somewhat of an understanding to where the parts in The Fast and the Furious 2001 came from. However the rest of writing has shifty character motives and some unimpressive acting. At least it's only an hour or so long it'll go by quick.".

The music composed by Alexander Gerens was okay. It wasn't anything special with a main theme but it did give the film that classic 1950s sound that only a certain era of film making could provide. Can't knock that.It's by no means even a very involving film but it does have decent effects camerawork and music. It also showcases retro cars along with other things that are different from that time. It's screenplay even gives somewhat of an understanding to where the parts in The Fast and the Furious 2001 came from. However the rest of writing has shifty character motives and some unimpressive acting. At least it's only an hour or so long it'll go by quick.";

Was it just me or did it seem like the race announcer was describing action that should have been well out of his vision after a couple of minutes. I mean the race was heading ninety eight miles into Mexico and not on a circular track. How did the guy keep up? It all seemed pretty moronic to me that a guy John Ireland with a murder rap hanging over his head would take the chance of entering a race to begin with. Why put yourself in the limelight like that especially since the car and gal you kidnapped were fairly well known within her circle. After all most of her friends were going to be there.But since it worked out that way what was it about the door of the shack that Frank Webster Ireland locked Connie Dorothy Malone in that made it impossible for her to get out? I mean seriously the guy who got her out just tugged on the doorknob. She couldn't push that same door open from the inside? There's more stuff like this happening but if I went into it you'd accuse me of piling on. Oh well what the heck. In the early part of the picture what happened to the FIRST car key? And where did Webster get the sandwiches and coffee thermos for the picnic with Connie? And the race itself  simply impossible to follow. Like when Webster veered off the race course onto an entirely different road followed by driver Frazier Bruce Carlisle credited as Faber. Why would Frazier do that if he wanted to win the race? I mean I'm assuming that but gee.And the best  and I've seen this before and I don't know how movie makers think they can get away with it. Having been detained for who knows how long burning shack remember? Connie borrows a race car to get on a main highway to Mexico to meet up with Webster after the race but catches up to him on the closed off race course!

The dialog is stilted and unconvincing and the performances border on amateurism. That's too bad because both leads John Ireland and Dorothy Malone were firstrate actors in their day. Malone won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar and Ireland had once been nominated in the Supporting Actor category. But neither of them really fit the bill for this flimsy exploitative movie. The plot revolves around escaped convict Ireland who was framed for murder. He just wants to get out of the country and head down to Mexico. He's in a bad mood and doesn't crack a smile or change his nasty tone of voice for the entire running time of the movie. The thin plot thickens when he gets into another fracas during his attempt to get south of the border and he ends up inadvertently kidnapping Ms. Malone. The rest of the film mostly takes place with the two of them driving around in Malone's fancy white convertible Jaguar sportscar. There are some dull racing scenes to kill time as Malone and Ireland try to keep a low profile while becoming contestants themselves. Even though Ireland treats Malone like the kid sister he never wanted they eventually fall in love. The only other actor of note in the film is ancient Snub Pollard as a park caretaker. Pollard had been appearing in films since early in the Silent Era. Ireland codirected this movie on a shoestring budget so the production values are minimal. Luckily for viewers Dorothy Malone who was about thirty years old when this movie was released never looked better even in black and white so she's almost worth the price of admission. In the end she convinces Ireland to trust the law and turn himself in which he does after some prodding. Whether they live happily ever after is left to one's imagination. You could call The Fast and the Furious a misfire on all cylinders.".

She pulls into a roadside caf and goes inside. As the waitress takes her order the radio announces that one Frank Webster has escaped from jail where he was being held for murder accused of running a truck off the road. There are two other men in the caf a slightly obnoxious trucker and a taciturn man who turns out to be Webster. After a confrontation which leaves the trucker unconscious Webster kidnaps Connie and steals her car. He is determined to get to Mexico but it won't be easy there are numerous police checks on the way. It seems the only chance is to join a race that crosses the border surely the police won't expect that!This low budget film might not be as action packed as its more recent namesake but it is still rather fun and at just over seventy minutes in length it doesn't outstay its welcome. John Ireland and Dorothy Malone are solid as Frank and Connie developing a good chemistry as the film progresses. There isn't a huge amount of action just some fast driving and some crashes during the race. There are some mildly tense scenes when it looks like the police will try to arrest him and when Connie tries to get away. There are quite a few continuity errors but to be honest that didn't bother me it just added to the low budget Bmovie charm. Overall this is hardly a must see but it is certainly fun enough.".

If you're ever planning on watching the Puppet Master movies watch this one first. This was actually the last Puppet Master film that Guy Rolfe starred in which really is a shame he portrayed the role of Andre Toulon better than any of the previous actors. Guy Rolfe passed away in the year 2003 so that means that if any more Puppet Master movies are made other than Puppet Master vs Demonic Toysan other actor will have to play as Toulon. Let's hope that person is as good as Guy Rolfe although that will be impossible.".

This old man was Afzel a sorcerer that stole the secret of life. Afzel is being hunted by servants of Sutekh because of this secret. These servants kill all of the friends and fellow puppeteers of Andre but they live again in the puppets of their own creations.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1989 writer Charles Band and director David Schmoeller created Puppet Master an inventive horror film about a group of puppets magically brought to life by its maker Andre Toulon and took to America during World War II. While the original film and its sequel were basically straightforward slashers the third film made an important big change in the format moving away from horror to fantasy and setting the movie in the WWII explaining how Toulon escaped from the War and moved to America. The following three films in the series had the Puppets as heroes and took place in the present returning the gore and violence to the series by walking the fine line between horror and fantasy. Retro Puppet Master the seventh chapter of the Puppets' saga takes the series again further into fantasy telling the story about the origins of Andre Toulon and the Puppet's first adventure.In turn of the century Paris young puppeteer Andre Toulon runs a small puppet theater where every night he and his crew make a living. One night after a show he meets Ilsa the Swiss Ambassador's daughter who secretly watched his act however the circumstances of their meeting are not nice as Ilsa found the body of the mysterious Afzel after he was brutally attacked by a pair of thugs. Andre takes care of the wounded Afzel who claims to be a 3000 years old sorcerer but while at first he believes the man is crazy soon Andre begins to believe as the dying Afzel tells him the secret that will put Andre in danger for the rest of his life the ancient gods' secret of giving life to inanimate things.Ever since it was released Retro Puppet Master became quite a controversial movie among fans of the series as the screenplay by Benjamin Carr is definitely more a fantasy adventure than a horror film making it receive many critics due to the lack of gore and suspense. Personally I think the move really helps to the story as for the first time in years the focus of the film is not on the Puppets but on the Puppetmaster himself so the toning down of the horror is a reasonable change. The story is also about how he met his future wife Ilsa so romance plays a very important part of the story another difference with the previous installments.Directed by a long time Full Moon regular the notorious David DeCoteau Retro Puppet Master is surprisingly a change of tone from the typical late 90s Full Moon releases. It's a lot subtler and even classier than other DeCoteau films and is probably his best film in a long time. While the cinematography looks like the average TV movie and the special effects are of a terribly bad quality due to budgetary constrains the movie looks very good considering its a period piece and even the score by John Massari fits the new tone of the film as a glove.Newcomer Greg Sesstero has a big challenge when playing the younger version of a character that basically was created by the great Guy Rolfe who has a cameo however Sestero makes a terrific job and adds a lot of charm to the role. Brigitta Dau makes a good job as Ilsa and like Sestero often make sup her lack of experience with her charming personality. Jack Donner does a terrific lowkey performance as Afzel but the efforts of these three actors get ruined by the average performance of basically everyone else in the film. Worth to point out are the terribly bad performances of the three servants the main villains of the movie who easily are the worst part of the film. While some of this may not be entirely their fault as their lines are also the less inspired part of the script their lack of talent make a bad role atrocious as it literally kills what could had been a good movie. While I praised Carr's original take on Band's idea it's safe to point out that his work does not help the film to reach its true potential as some lines of dialog are simply awful. Many has been written about the simplistic special effects and while sadly they are not on the level of the previous films they are of TV Series quality at best at least there isn't an overuse of them through the movie.Retro Puppet Master has received a lot of what I think is an undeserved bash through the years however it's safe to say that it's one of the best film sin the series. While it certainly could had been a lot better it really shows that Band was concerned in saving his beloved franchise he would do a better job in Legacy and DeCoteau's direction is remarkably effective almost reminiscent of his better earlier work. While many fans don't like the change to fantasy I think it was what this particular chapter needed. Watch it with an open mind and low expectations and you'll be rewarded.610".

This seventh instalment is well made and excellently acted with the last actual performance of Guy Rolfe not just as Andre Toulon but ever. Rolfe is without doubt one of the world's greatest actors and as Andre Toulon the most fantastical performer of Full Moon Productions' entire catalogue. This film travels back to early 20th century Paris to find the origins of the Puppets there are a few extra puppets here that  as yet unexplained  do not appear in other films. Our favourites here such as Pinhead Torch and Tunneler are more traditional wooden puppets not yet fully developed and very low on personality and colour  their oak finish makes them seem far more sinister though. For the first time Richard Band's amazing Puppet theme does not appear and is ultimately the only major error of judgement in a fun and fantastically produced addition to the series. Watch the dead homeless man on the steps though who first gives his 'life' to the puppets  though dead and looking almost like a puppet himself he can't help blinking in full camera shot. The film is old fashioned and almost Sunday afternoon family fun like an old detective drama or something. Surprising.".

Creating a period piece obviously creates complications in filming so this as with Puppet Master III is admirable the simplest route was not selected.On the downside the puppets themselves move especially badly in this entry it's a far cry from the beautiful stopmotion animation of earlier films we really are talking about movement like a 4 year old's Barbie. Also considering these are meant to be early versions of the puppets we know and love some of these wooden versions really miss the mark. Blade especially. When looking at the cover I actually assumed Dr Death's skeletal appearance was an early and quite impressive early version of Blade when in fact he's this bizarre trollfaced puppet with only the hair and costume in common. Quite sad really as the puppets are after all the stars. And the male lead Greg Sestero as a young Andre Toulon is perhaps more wooden than the puppets.Still it's worth renting perhaps rather than buying I'm not sure how much replay value it has for those who have to know how it all began.

One of it's better features in here is that cheese which is not quite as bad as the others since it's a little more serious in tone but still can't escape the cheese. From the puppet performance at the beginning to the scene of the puppets giving him a tattoo to how they react in battle it still can't avoid doling out the cheese. That also segues into one of the best parts of this one just like all the other entries in the series which is the efficiency and realism of the puppet effects. These here match up to the high standards of the others since the dolls move interact and react to their surroundings with a great sense of realism. Each one is allowed to shine at least once and they all leave an impression with distinct personalities that can't be ignored and provide some fun. This is most apparent in their resurrection sequence which maintains the same type of mystique and aura that had been previously utilized in the series which gives this a lot to like. The last part of the film that works is the exciting ending which is where the film really kicks into highgear as this is packed with nonstop action including the battle on the train a few tense moments and a great sense of fun it's a great way to end the film. These here are the film's main points. Even though it's decent this one does have a few substantial flaws to it. The biggest one here is that it's so tame with its rating. That is incredibly limiting to a film especially one where it's main appeal is in seeing homicidal puppets in action so that the rating limitation means that they're handicapped in here and aren't really allowed into the story to do what they're here for. It stops the biggest feature here by forcing other ways to kill which are done rather lamely by having the creatures merely touch someone or point in their direction say a spell and then a wave of CGI overcomes the victim and they fall flat. It's a disgrace to see something like that in a film about killer puppets and with their tools and special powers being the main attraction for these films to neuter it by having the specific rating is a complete slap to the other entries in the series. The shortness of the film is also a problem as it's barely over an hour and doesn't leave a lot of time for a whole lot so this here has a very compacted feeling that can be distracting at times. It's also not helped out by the confusing nature of the story which is here is completely hard to understand. From the cutting of the story at the end of the old man to the story of the helper which is set in earlier times but still older than the main story to the switch over to the main story it's quite confusing and doesn't really make a whole lot of sense. All of these here are what really kills the film.Rated PG13 Violence and Language.".

Not so perfect for movie nights with friends high expectations high energy days tiny children.

	schema:reviewBody "Retro Puppet Master starts in Kolewige during 1944 where puppet master Andre Toulon Guy Rolfe  his living puppets plan to escape Germany hold up in an Inn puppet master Toulon reminisces about his early life  the point at which he learned the secret of giving life to dead objects way back in 1902 in Paris when his younger self Greg Sestero ran the Theate Magique. He describes the fateful night when he met a 3000 year old Egyptian sorcerer named Afzel Jack Donner  the eventual love of hi life the young  beautiful Ilsa Brigitta Dau. He tells the story of how Afzel passed the gift of life to himself  gave life to his own wooden puppets that were part of the Theatre Magique show. However the gift of life was also a curse as the ancient God Sutek whom the secret was stolen from in the first place by Afzel wants it back  everyone who has learnt it dead...As of late I have been on a bit of a Puppet Master bender as being a big fan of the first three I decided to watch the rest of the franchise  as such I have seen Puppet Master 4 1993 Puppet Master 5 The Final Chapter 1994 Curse of the Puppet Master 1998  now Retro Puppet Master in the space of a couple of weeks  boy was it tough to get through them all especially this one as it's the worse of the series so far. Retro Puppet Master feels like a cross between Puppet Master III Toulon's Revenge 1991 with it's period setting  Puppet Master 4  Puppet Master 5 The Final Chapter with Sutek trying to kill everyone associated with his stolen life giving secret. There's not much continuity here either again there's none of the green serum featured in the earlier films  despite Andre Toulon committing suicide in 1939 at the start of the original Puppetmaster 1989 he is seen alive  well during 1944 in this. The majority of the story is told as a flashback  concentrates on Andre Toulon himself rather than the puppets the film focuses on his relationship with Ilsa  him learning the secret of life  it's all rather dull  tedious stuff to be honest. Even at only 80 odd minutes Retro Puppet Master feels long  padded with no real pace  the no central concept as the plot never really settles down  generally hops around a lot. Then of course there's the baffling decision to totally redesign the puppets which I found incredible I mean why would the makers take the one basic thing that made the Puppet Master films so memorable  completely do away with it? The puppets are seen briefly at the start  the end but otherwise we get these rubbishy looking wooden caricatures that are nowhere near as cool as their modern reworkings. It's never even explained why these puppets were used rather than the ones all Puppet Master fans have come to love although one suspects that Full Moon was hoping to make yet another sequel which dealt with that very question.If a poor story  a complete lack of our favourite puppets wasn't bad enough Full Moon decided to go with a PG13 rating for this making Retro Puppet Master the only Puppet Master film not rated 'R' in the US obviously other countries have their own film ratings systems  therefore there's not a single drop of blood in the entire film the puppets don't kill anyone there's no swearing  no nudity either. This is tamer than tame kids stuff all the way. Besides the puppets themselves being rubbish the special effect are the wost of the series too there's no stop motion animation at all in this one no CGI computer effects surely in 1999 CGI was cheap enough?  all the effects are of the stiff rod puppet type effects. I mean whenever you see a puppet 'walk' the camera is always positioned above it's wait so it's legs don't have to be shown  there's obviously some production assistant just pushing the thing along that's as complex  state of the art as the special effects get.The one positive thing that Retro Puppet Master does have going for it is that it looks rather nice the period production design costumes  props are actually quite impressive  it's a fairly handsome film to watch at times. Apparently filmed in Bucharest in Romania which doubles up quite nicely for turn of the last century Paris. The acting here is awful  maybe the worst of the series.Retro Puppet Master is more or less the final Puppet Master film as the next one Puppet Master The Legacy 2004 basically edits together footage from the previous seven films  it's a pretty crappy way to round the series off which started so well with three excellent  distinctive little killer puppet flicks. Don't bother with this just watch one of the first three again  just remember the good times... The killer puppets would return in the terrible spinoff flick Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys 2004.".

It's never even explained why these puppets were used rather than the ones all Puppet Master fans have come to love although one suspects that Full Moon was hoping to make yet another sequel which dealt with that very question.If a poor story  a complete lack of our favourite puppets wasn't bad enough Full Moon decided to go with a PG13 rating for this making Retro Puppet Master the only Puppet Master film not rated 'R' in the US obviously other countries have their own film ratings systems  therefore there's not a single drop of blood in the entire film the puppets don't kill anyone there's no swearing  no nudity either. This is tamer than tame kids stuff all the way. Besides the puppets themselves being rubbish the special effect are the wost of the series too there's no stop motion animation at all in this one no CGI computer effects surely in 1999 CGI was cheap enough?  all the effects are of the stiff rod puppet type effects. I mean whenever you see a puppet 'walk' the camera is always positioned above it's wait so it's legs don't have to be shown  there's obviously some production assistant just pushing the thing along that's as complex  state of the art as the special effects get.The one positive thing that Retro Puppet Master does have going for it is that it looks rather nice the period production design costumes  props are actually quite impressive  it's a fairly handsome film to watch at times. Apparently filmed in Bucharest in Romania which doubles up quite nicely for turn of the last century Paris. The acting here is awful  maybe the worst of the series.Retro Puppet Master is more or less the final Puppet Master film as the next one Puppet Master The Legacy 2004 basically edits together footage from the previous seven films  it's a pretty crappy way to round the series off which started so well with three excellent  distinctive little killer puppet flicks. Don't bother with this just watch one of the first three again  just remember the good times... The killer puppets would return in the terrible spinoff flick Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys 2004.";

It was neat seeing the puppets really work together it was neat seeing them interact and communicate with humans in a friendly way for a change and it was also neat that there was sequel that I could actually watch with my family. keeping in mind that I was young and that the other films were much more hard core not that I didn't love the carnage candy myself The point is we know that while these puppets are good they have done a million ultraviolentperversemaniacal and destructive things which makes a perfect stand off between our little antiheros and the absolutely evil demons. And a lot of fans seem to forget that the puppets did not turn good but in fact were always good. If you've seen part 3 you would know that they were nice people in life and if you are a steady viewer in the puppets adventures you should notice the fact that the puppets up untill know have killed for only two reasons survival or because their masters forced them to.

Chapter 5 pretty much follows on from the fourth film as they were virtually shot backtoback by director Jeff Burr with the same cast and crew and I found it a little more enjoyable than previous instalment. After recapping what had already occurred again the new puppet master Rick Myers must face up against the ancient Egyptian God Sutek who wants to destroy any sort of evidence about its reanimated ancient magic that Toulon had stolen and also cope with an interfering scientist played with devious glee by Ian Ogilvy. The outlandish story layout is simply as before repeating what happened in the fourth chapter even with a storm brewing but the pacing is a lot better and energy much more spruce with the Gothic seaside hotel having a little more of an impression. The thing was that the sequences involving Sutek just didn't seem to work with its unconvincing voice reciting ridiculous dialogues and the dramatic body movements. It looked good it detail but I preferred when it wasn't focusing on that demon. Director Jeff Burr ably constructs some atmospheric setpieces creating more a nightmarish tone like a very odd but jarring dream sequence that was just as darkly unpleasant as any of the scenes from the original. Quite uneven in mood due to its unbalanced material of humour and horror but at times the goofiness does take away from it. Like some of the attack  death setups follow a formula run fall on ground begin crawling and wrestle than die a bloody death. Not much else to it.The illuminating special effects are just as potent as before with it colourful optical work and masterful puppet creations. The creativity shows in the puppet work forming their own characteristics from the animation and the effective movements of the puppets. All the iconic puppets return also with the new creation Decapitron that's inhabitant by the spirit Andre Toulon when resurrected by electricity. Modest acting by returning leads Gordon Currie and Chandra West. Teresa Hill returns in a lesser part and Guy Rolfe. Ian Ogilvy is great and Clu Gulager makes a cameo appearance. There's good support by Nicholas Guest Willard E. Pugh and Duane Whitaker.".

Ogilvy plays a villainous doctor wanting to steal the puppets secret but of course has to battle with the lovely puppets their saviour Gordon Currie and the Egypyian God Suketh and Mr Totem from the third film. Many of the extras in this one including the thugs that Ogilvy hires to steal the puppets are actual animators and special effects people so its fun to see them acting alongside that which they normally create. Toulon barely features again and its truly a pity that the team at Full Moon couldn't produce a stronger story and one where Toulon could truly feature Guy Rolfe was deceased before any demanding sequel was made. Not sure why this seemed better than volume four but it is less dull and the EnglishCanadian cast make good viewing. Top scenes include menacing SixShooter fires the fingers from Totems' claws and a dream sequence usually so tedious where Teresa Hill the psychic from number four who is in a coma now is orgasmic in a blood filled bath tub as Pinhead holds her head as Tunneler drills her skull  it's a job to explain why this scene is so great but see it and you'll probably agree.

One interesting thing is that Torch is in this one but not in Puppet Master 4 even though on the box I've got for Puppet Master 4 he's shown with the other Puppets.The plot sees Richard Myers under arrest since they think he killed Dr. Baker and Dr. Piper and the others with the Puppets since they think he programmed them to. He then meets the boss of the company who is interested about Puppets with a mind of their own and after leaving he comes up with a plan to go to the Inn and steal the Puppets with the help of a few people meanwhile Richard's girlfriend pays bail to get him out and Blade who was taken in the evidence room escapes and goes into their bag. That night Richard sees Blade and finds out that the other Puppets are still in the Inn so they go to get them while Sutek plans to get his secret by sending his own Totem to the Inn Richard goes into the Inn to get the Puppets and soon his girlfriend helps him the psychic keeps on having nightmares and through telekinesis informs Richard to make more of the formula. Meanwhile the Puppets are trying to stop the thieves while the Sutek Totem is killing them off and searching for the secret. Soon Richard reactivates the Decapatron and with the help of Toulon's Spirt stop the Sutek Totem for good and then Richard Myers is the new Puppet Master.Puppet Master 5 The Final Chapter wasn't really the last in the series because four more films was made Curse of the Puppet Master Retro Puppet Master Puppet Master The Legacy and Puppet Master Vs Demonic Toys.

While trying to sort out all of this crap Rick finds out from Lauren that more puppetrelated chaos is on the way.It appears Suteckh the villian from the previous chapter has decided he has no choice but to take things into his own hands after lastnight's failure.  He transfers his power and mind into a single totem and sends it to the human realm.  This doesn't settle all that well with our protagonists.  A totempuppet tustle erupts.Since this was shot right with PM4 it is more or less the same movie. Same actors same puppets except for Torch who for some reason was conspicuous by his absence in the last same villain same everything. Which brings up a question.  If Suteckh could just put himself into a totem or more why didn't he do that in the first place?  What did he want to get paid for TWO movies?I really can't find myself to recomend this to anyone except hardcore Puppet Master fans.  Even a large group of them dislike.  Not that it's any worse than the previous which is unpopular as well.  But it doesn't bring anything new to the table.

	schema:reviewBody "This Film was a Perfect Horror Movie and a Mighty Fine Addition to the Puppet Master Series. It's not Different From Puppet Master 4 except a few Things. One of Them Being that Torch is Back! This Film However is Also a little Different from Part 4 because Now the Puppets are back to Slaughtering Humans. Why? Because as Well as Demons from another Dimension after the Secret so are a Team of Scientists who The New Puppet Master was Working With. Stupid Traitors! But. Do you really Think a Team of 5 people can Outsmart a Gang of Killer Puppets? The Puppets are just nothing but a Pure Pleasure. Part 3 was a Masterpiece and Part 5 is not too far Behind.Why Did People give parts 4 and 5 Such a Hard time? I think it is the Simple fact that The Puppets are Good Guys. But So What? I am Fine with That as Long as They just look Scary and Chase Things Around The Old Hotel. Another Reason The Critics Dumped The Whole Series is That it was Labeled as a Rip off of The Child's Play Series. Even If It was Who Really Gives a Jumping Fish? They are Cool and Scary that is all that Should matter! People. Wake Up! If you Haven't seen a Puppet Master Movie I highly suggest you Do.The Movie Itself Consisted of Many good Qualities. One of Them Continuing The Plot from Part 4. But That's Not All! The Hotel was Dark and Spooky and Really just Gave Me The Creeps. As Well as A Bunch of Psychic Stuff that I Would never want to Spoil for You. The Puppets also Looked Like they were Walking. In Parts 2 and 3 The Puppets Sometimes looked as if They Were Hovering or Floating. At Least on Digital Video This Film had Outstanding Sound and Picture Quality.Be Sure to Remember that it is Not the Scares or Thrills That Make The Movie It's the puppets! The Puppets' Names are as Follows Blade Jester Pin Head Torch Decapitron and My Favorite Six Shooter. Blade has Very Interesting Hands. One is a Knife The Other is a Hook. Jester leads the Puppet Gang and When he Gets Violent He Throws or Picks up Things such as Hammers to Use as a Weapon. Torch has one Arm that is Really a Flame Thrower. Decapitron has a Head Which shoots out Electricity He is The Most Powerful of Them All. And Finally Six Shooter always has You In His Sights with his Six Pistol Packing Arms. All in All There's no Escaping The Killer Puppets! The Demons are Also a Good Flick But It's Hard to see the Puppets Become the Prey. I Liked The Directing Done by Mr. Jeff Burr Who has Given us Such Pleasures Like Stepfather II and Puppet Master 4. Good Acting Done by All Cast Members. The Score is Also Perfect. It's Better Than Any Other Sound track In History. It even Bets out Halloween and Friday the 13th.Was It Gory? To a Certain Extent. There was some Blood and A lot of Knife Wounds But Nothing New. Perfect Movie. I Give it 10 out of 10. 20 out of 20. 100 out of 100. and so on. Not The Best of The Series But I'd Say it is Probably The Fourth Best. Recommended to Any Horror Fan Highly Recommended to Any Puppet Master Fan. If You Like Scary Movies You Need to See This. Also Recommended The Dead Hate The Living. For more Recommendations please Check The Other Movies I Have Reviewed By Clicking on My Name above This Review Section.".

As this one manages to followup on the storyline from the previous effort in effect leading through the events of the last film to start this one off with as it deals with the ramifications of their actions dealing with the police this one feels the most logically connected and cohesive entries here by finally giving some answers as to what's going on. There's a lot to like here about how that in itself corresponds to the different elements of the past movies with the connection found between the serum's mechanical frequencies and the gateway into the other dimension which finally solves the riddle of how they worked and why they were initially targeting the computer group from before. That also leaves the film with some enjoyable action scenes as the confrontations that arrive here come into play quite nicely against the storyline here with the majority of the film afterward dealing with the robbers' attempt to snatch them up inside the hotel and resorting to plenty of great encounters protecting themselves leading to the demon puppet arriving along the way which generates not only their encounters with the puppets but also with the demonpuppet creature getting involved with the series of encounters in the hallways as it tracks down the group in some fun chilling stalking scenes. Still the majority of this time is used with the puppets in control leading to some suspenseful stalking scenes of them looking for the puppets throughout the darkened hallways of the house the fun of the kitchen encounter with the robbers or the great sequence in the lab trying to resurrect the main doll to help them fight off the creatures providing the big finale battle with the puppets and the demon puppet being that ends up resolving the entire storyline quite nicely. These here give this one enough to like to hold out over the few minor flaws here. The main problem here is the fact that there's quite a large amount of time here spent without bringing the demon puppets as there's very little screentime here that it almost makes the film forget they're even involved much in the film. There's a point where it could've easily brought them into play here as they're attacking the puppets for the main storyline and the entrance into the dimension happened quite early so there's little excuse as for what there's little need for it to be as uninvolved as it is in that manner. That also highlights the fact that the main puppet doesn't have a whole lot of screentime anyway as the entire film comes off like the last one where they spend the whole film trying to reanimate it when it was already alive so it all builds up to that fight. It's a little repetitive which is what holds this back somewhat from the previous effort.Rated R Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.".

I digged the writing and characters in this entry some funny moments too but the deaths could have been better. The continuality was nice to see too bring back the two main leads from the last movie however there wasn't much new development between the two of them. The growing of characters seemed to happen with the puppets were Blade could start speaking a bit saying Yeah! when he was excited to go back to Bodega Bay Inn with his fellow puppets.

But the survivors from PUPPET MASTER 4 are going to try to stop them. This makes a cool movie.It is not as good as any of the predecessors except for PUPPET MASTER III TOULAN'S REVENGE. That was the crappiest of the series. So with that crap there in the middle this movie makes a worthy fifth addition.Not much of a shock factor here unless you are very easily frightened. There is not that much gore either. So if you want a nice mellow horror film that will most likely satisfy your appetite for horror this is probably the best movie to pick.PUPPET MASTER 5 gets 35.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been a fan of Puppet Master for many years now. Despite this I only very recently watched Jeff Burr's two entries in the series 4 and 5. 4 I felt was similar in quality to the other puppet master films it was hokey sort of cheesy and the story took its time until the very end then rushed headlong into a rather jumbled conclusion. It was the sort of pleasure and pain reaction that I've had to most of the series. Thus I expected the same from 5 as 4 and 5 were filmed backtoback. Then I watched the fifth film and I can say I've never been so pleasantly surprised by Puppet Master. I was all smiles.I watched the film about the final battle between the new puppet master and the Egyptian demonlord Sutekh who has manifested himself in the form of the mightiest totem of all a lastditch attempt mind you and I thought to myself that this is what the series can and should be. The foremost thing about this film that makes this film superior to most other Full Moon productions is the same thing that made The Avengers better than most other movies of its kind it's fun. I had lots of fun watching the puppets at work against the evil they faced I had lots of fun watching Ian Ogilvy's character and his bumbling henchmen I had lots of fun watching the cute romance between Chandra West and Gordan Currie. The special effects by David Allen and Mark Rappaport are by far their best in this series and in the script by the five?writers more does in this case mean more. Jeff Burr made this a very fun little movie which in only the briefest of moments struck me as Bbudget it would have been good for theaters in my book.Puppet Master 5 ends on what is probably the best note possible a nearnonstop special effects extravaganza in which the puppets truly shine if only for a time followed by a heartwarming moment between all the leads. This was originally intended as the final film and I almost wish it was as it would have been a fun note to end on. However although the series might have soured after this I'm holding out for another Puppet Master as good as this one. Puppet Master Forever.".

	schema:reviewBody "This Film was a Perfect Horror Movie and a Mighty Fine Addition to the Puppet Master Series. It's not Different From Puppet Master 4 except a few Things. One of Them Being that Torch is Back! This Film However is Also a little Different from Part 4 because Now the Puppets are back to Slaughtering Humans. Why? Because as Well as Demons from another Dimension after the Secret so are a Team of Scientists who The New Puppet Master was Working With. Stupid Traitors! But. Do you really Think a Team of 5 people can Outsmart a Gang of Killer Puppets? The Puppets are just nothing but a Pure Pleasure. Part 3 was a Masterpiece and Part 5 is not too far Behind.Why Did People give parts 4 and 5 Such a Hard time? I think it is the Simple fact that The Puppets are Good Guys. But So What? I am Fine with That as Long as They just look Scary and Chase Things Around The Old Hotel. Another Reason The Critics Dumped The Whole Series is That it was Labeled as a Rip off of The Child's Play Series. Even If It was Who Really Gives a Jumping Fish? They are Cool and Scary that is all that Should matter! People. Wake Up! If you Haven't seen a Puppet Master Movie I highly suggest you Do. In Addition to This These people Probably don't Hate Part 5 they hate the Whole Series. I can Assure you that if you like Any other Puppet Master Movie you'll love this one. The most popular two Words that Weird people Say About this Movie with are Stupid and Lame. First off this Movie isn't Stupid. The Plot is Highly intelligent and well Thought out. And Lame Give me a Break! This Movie Is Completely Entertaining. It kept my Eyes Glued to the Television. Beginning to End!The Movie Itself Consisted of Many good Qualities. One of Them Continuing The Plot from Part 4. But That's Not All! The Hotel was Dark and Spooky and Really just Gave Me The Creeps. As Well as A Bunch of Psychic Stuff that I Would never want to Spoil for You. The Puppets also Looked Like they were Walking. In Parts 2 and 3 The Puppets Sometimes looked as if They Were Hovering or Floating. At Least on Digital Video This Film had Outstanding Sound and Picture Quality.Be Sure to Remember that it is Not the Scares or Thrills That Make The Movie It's the puppets! The Puppets' Names are as Follows Blade Jester Pin Head Torch Decapitron and My Favorite Six Shooter. Blade has Very Interesting Hands. One is a Knife The Other is a Hook. Jester leads the Puppet Gang and When he Gets Violent He Throws or Picks up Things such as Hammers to Use as a Weapon. Torch has one Arm that is Really a Flame Thrower. Decapitron has a Head Which shoots out Electricity He is The Most Powerful of Them All. And Finally Six Shooter always has You In His Sights with his Six Pistol Packing Arms. All in All There's no Escaping The Killer Puppets! The Demons are Also a Good Flick But It's Hard to see the Puppets Become the Prey. I Liked The Directing Done by Mr. Jeff Burr Who has Given us Such Pleasures Like Stepfather II and Puppet Master 4 as Well as the Third installment in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Good Acting Done by All Cast Members. The Score is Also Perfect. It's Better Than Any Other Sound track In History. It even Bets out Halloween and Friday the 13th. I Think that the Whole Mad Puppet Master Thing kind of Reminds me of Vincent Price.Was It Gory? To a Certain Extent. There was some Blood and A lot of Knife Wounds But Nothing New. Perfect Movie. I Give it 10 out of 10. 20 out of 20. 100 out of 100. and so on. Not The Best of The Series But I'd Say it is Probably The Fourth Best. Recommended to Any Horror Fan Highly Recommended to Any Puppet Master Fan. If You Like Scary Movies You Need to See This. Also Recommended The Dead Hate The Living Head of the Family ALL Other Puppet Master Movies Halloween Hannibal Child's Play Bride of Chucky The Texas Chain Saw Massacre Bloody Murder Can't Wait for Part 2 to Come out! House Stigmata House on Haunted Hill Night of the Living Dead and The Pit and The Pendulum.

Poor director Jeff Burr a true talent who has been relegated to lower level horror sequels. This just features folks walking around the hotel getting killed. The saddestfunnieststrangest thing is the point of this entry is to once again resurrect Decapitron and have Toulon tell Rick he is the puppet master. Didn't we already do that? Ron O'Neal and Clu Gulagher both have small cameos. Subtitled The Final Chapter on the VHS box this was the last PUPPET MASTER film released by Paramount.

Poor director Jeff Burr a true talent who has been relegated to lower level horror sequels. This just features folks walking around the hotel getting killed. The saddestfunnieststrangest thing is the point of this entry is to once again resurrect Decapitron and have Toulon tell Rick he is the puppet master. Didn't we already do that? Ron O'Neal and Clu Gulagher both have small cameos. Subtitled The Final Chapter on the VHS box this was the last PUPPET MASTER film released by Paramount. The next entry CURSE OF THE PUPPET MASTER would appear in 1998.";

Again directed by Jeff Burr  written by the same five! people responsible for Puppet Master 4 this is a disappointing entry in what was a fantastic series of horror film up to  including Puppet Master III Toulon's Revenge 1991  you can see why the series has died a death if you compare this with the earlier entries. For a start the plot is all over the place at first it directly contradicts Puppet Master 4 as the reason for Sutek wanting to kill Rick  destroy the puppets is because he wanted to protect the secret of life that Toulon had stolen from him but at the start of Puppet Master 5 it is said Sutek wants to kill Rick  destroy the puppets to learn the secret himself before reverting back to the premise of Puppet Master 4 for the final twenty minutes. Then there's the odd plot hole which states that Sutek can't travel between dimensions yet where did all the creatures he sent in Puppet Master 4 come from? The body count is again far too low several of the main character's from Puppet Master 4 return including Lauren who manages to psychically control computers while she is in a coma! Also what happened to the murder charges against Rick? Did the police just forget about them? Again the once cool killer puppets don't kill anyone aren't evil  generally are portrayed as the heroes which to me is just all wrong  evidence the makers wanted to tone things down for a newer  younger audience. Although the duration of the film is just over 80 odd minutes there's a fairly long compilation of footage from Puppet Master 4 to act as a recap or to fill those in who haven't seen it.After his absence in Puppet Master 4 the cool puppet Torch makes an appearance here as does Blade Jester Pinhead Tunneller Six Shooter  the new puppet Decapitron. They are still very cool  the film picks up whenever they are on screen but not much is done with them  they don't get to be evil anymore which just doesn't sit right with me. The special effects are alright there are less of them than in Puppet Master 4  a lot less stopmotion animation. Like Puppet Master 4 the violence gore  nudity of the excellent first three Puppet Master films have been reduced to virtually zero there's a few cuts seen on someone's face  a bit of blood splatter  that's it. If not for some strong profanity this would pass as a PG. The final fight between the Sutek creature  the puppets looks a bit silly  like the sort of thing your six year old kid brother would setup  stage with his Star Wars figures.Like Puppet Master 4 the Bogeda Bay Inn scenes are well lit  shot but the rest of it looks cheap  Sutek  his liar look absolutely awful  feel like they belong in a different film for some reason the actor playing Sutek is not credited in either Puppet Master 4 or 5. The acting is OK the two girls from Puppet Master 4 barely feature this time around while British veteran actor Ian Ogilvy brings a bit of class to things.Puppet Master 5 The Final Chapter wasn't the final chapter at all although considering how poor it is  what the makers have done with a once great franchise it maybe should have been. Followed by Curse of the Puppet Master 1998  you know a series is in trouble when the makers stop numbering them...".

	schema:reviewBody "Puppet Master 5 1994  12 out of 4 Number five picks up right after the events in the previous film. This one starts off with Rick Gordon Currie behind bars accused of killing those poor souls from part four. He gets released and he and his girlfriend Chandra West get caught up with the puppets who are once again doing battle against the evil Demon God and his smaller creatures. PUPPET MASTER 5 is certainly a step up from the previous film but that's really not saying too much. Director Jeff Burr filmed the two installment back to back and this one here certainly has a better path as to where it's going even if the story with the Demon God was incredibly silly. The middle of this film has some thugs breaking into Toulon's hotel where they're searching for the puppets who of course have to use their weapons to destroy them. As with the previous film this one here has the puppets playing good guys so the film offers up some bad guys that they can kill and still consider themselves as good. At least this section of the film enters the horror trappings of idiots being locked up inside a creepy hotel where they're picked off one by one. With that said the story itself really isn't anything special as once again the human characters aren't interesting and I think the puppets too get the short shifted. The puppets at least get a few more kills under their belts but the film has pretty much milked them of any personality with the exception of Blade who gets a few good scenes. Both Currie and West are pretty bland as the leads but horror fans will enjoy seeing Clu Gulager from THE RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD. Once again the special effects have clearly lost some of their budget from the first three films. The effects aren't nearly as effective and they're also used a lot less than the previous entries. Don't even get me started on the Demon God outfits that looks to be something made for a high school play.".

Great characterisation ! It's unfortunate because the initial set up Rick Myers looks very guilty of murder Dr. Jennings a scientist being corrupted by a big organisation to find the the secret of the puppets could potentially have led to an intriguing film instead of the uninspired ' people wandering around a dark hotel and getting killed' number.Yes it's a formula that worked in the earlier puppet master films but the characters had actual character and weren't just cardboard cutouts.

But back at the lab the head has developed a chemicallyinduced psychic link with another one of the doctor's experiments this one so hideous that it is kept locked out of sight in a handy laboratory closet.

The cuts made before the film went into release are forever lost but the cuts made for television have been restored in the Alpha release and while the film and sound quality aren't particularly great it's just as well to recall that they probably weren't all that good to begin with.Now this is one of those movies that you'll either find incredibly dull or wildly hilarious depending on your point of view so it is very hard to give a recommendation.

The acting ranges from very poorthe two strippers barely professionalHerb Evers as the leading man gothic overstatementLeslie Daniels as the assistant Kurtto firstrate with Virginia Leith in the title role as the headless victim alive against her will for the benefit of science and her fiancee's lustful passions.  The scripting though is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this ilk.  Issues abound about what role science and medicine have in our lives and what their boundaries should be.  This film is a thinking film in many ways.  However don't be too fooled by its real intent.  It is a sleazy story about a man obsessed with his aptitude in medical science who wishes to fuse together his dead girlfriend's head with the perfect body thereby creating the perfect woman for a man with the best of both body and soul. One other very bright aspect of the film is the sax music which resonates strongly every time the doctor scours town for female beauties.".

That gives you an idea of how much effort went into this '60s schlockfest.But that doesn't mean it's not worth watching if you're in the right mood. Jason Evers who would later lend his considerable talents to such memorable efforts as A PIECE OF THE ACTION and A MAN CALLED GANNON stars as a wacky doc who thinks it'd be just super to keep his fiance's head alive in his laboratory after her untimely decapitation in a car accident. He's understandably not content marrying a head so he seeks out an appropriate though not necessarily willing! body donor.Much of the action takes place in the mad doc's basement lab likely marking one of the final times the traditionally cheesy horror film lab set was put to use. Jan Compton Virginia Leith or Jan in the Pan as she's called spends an awful lot of time yapping and whining. Another IMDb reviewer wasn't far off when he likened her to THE HEAD THAT WOULDN'T SHUT UP! Can you blame her? She's understandably not content to live this sort of life. But what's really holding her interest and mine... there I admitted it is the doctor's other monstrous creation which keeps trying to pound its from behind its singledoored prison. Will our hero find a body for his woman? Are the authorities on to him? Why am I enjoying this so much? Those are just some of the questions you'll find yourself asking.THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE comes to us in the tradition of PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE and THE BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS though it's not quite on par with those films in terms of so bad it's good appeal. As incredible as it sounds the picture is legitimately able to hold the viewer's interest with its outrageous plot and suspense built up over the creature behind the door. Sure it goes on a bit too long and sure there are dull moments but what did you expect?Admit it. If you haven't seen this one at least part of you wants to. It's probably that part that yearns for pure unadulterated stupidity from grown men and women from time to time. So indulge that inner glutton with THE BRAIN THAT WOULD'T DIE.".

I remember watching this for the first time on TV in the early 70s and being amazed they used to make movies like this.Better than average camera work also trying to get a sense of vertigo and movement throughout. This film with its hellbentforleather pace is a feverdream that works because it doesn't let go or tip you to the fact that the makers thought it was ridiculous as it certainly is. Be sure to get the restored version with the monster in the closet finally grabbing the doctor's arm and making a bloody mess at the end. A great cathartic bloody end to this near Shakespearean morality play about how man should not meddle in god's business.".

Its eerie effect because of the crappy production and the weird sexual angle when the scientist looks for the bodies complete with porno sound track scares the hell out of innocent children while the ridiculous aspects make it prime material for watching talking and laughing.

I grew up seeing it occasionally on Detroit's WKBDTV50 Saturday night Chiller Movie Double Feature during the 1970s. It was the perfect thriller to watch late at night in those days stores closed and people went to bed early after a long sunny week in school and playing outside. There were no computers cellphones video games cable TV or videos back then. You had three or four channels and they signed off after the news. If you were still up after 1130pm you felt like the last person on earth the perfect setting in which to watch this type of picture.The film sets a nightmarish tone immediately with its moody creepy score and grim BW cinematography. Yes it's a lowbudget independent film produced by people mostly just starting out. Given that it was most of the production's first screen credit it is outstanding.Despite the comedy relief stripper scenes the film was one of the more violent gory and shocking at the time and for years that followed. Everyone's stomach turned over at the arm tearing out scene and my mother used to excuse herself from the room at that point she found it so disturbing.Like Abbott  Costello before themand MST3K after themthe Medved brothers ruined films like this by burlesquing them in their 1980 book The Golden Turkey Awards. This and the post Star Wars culture have doomed these movies to an eternity of sneering contempt from a younger audience weened on endless laser blasts propane explosions and hyperactive CGI effects.Happily I got to see and enjoy Brain That Wouldn't Die while it was still considered relevant.

It has a cult following but it should have really become a cult classic in my opinion. As far as I know this came out a little before Blood Feast came out making this probably one of the first true gore films. In fact this movie has elements of Hershell Gordon Lewis AND a little Russ Meyer thrown in for good measure.Anyway I recommend this for anyone who likes trashy sleazy black and white horror films from the early '60's I think the date at the end of it read 1960.".

It is very difficult to imagine how a script this repulsively sexist could have been written without the intention of selfparody. And the themes that are expressed repeatedly by the female lead Ginny Leith  a detached head kept alive by machines IVs and clamps  seem to confirm that the film was meant to simultaneously exploit and critique gender stereotypes. Shades of the underrated Boxing Helena.The genderisms are plentiful and about as irritating as an army of angry ants. The dialog is hyperbolic overdramatic and unbelievable and the acting is merely OK but not consistent. Why have I given this film a 4? Because some thought clearly went into it. I am really not sure what point the film was really trying to make but it seems clear that it strives for an unusually edgy and raw sort of horror without the blood and guts today's audiences expect.Another unique and interesting aspect of the Brain is that there really are not any heroes in this film and none of the characters are particularly likable.All considered this is a fairly painful and disturbing look at early 1960s American pop sexuality from the viewpoint of a woman kept alive despite her missing body after what should have been a fatal car crash. Her lover is threatening to sew a fresh high quality body onto her and force her to continue living with him. She is understandably nonplussed by all of this and forced to befriend a creature who is almost as monstrous as her boyfriend. Oh there are also some vague references to the 1950s60s clich about the evils of science run amok.Recommended for B sci fi buffs and graduate students in gender studies. Ow not recommended.".

I was expecting to witness really lousy dialogues and ridiculously illogical plottwists but the script and elaboration of this film pleasantly surprised me for sure. If you can't get passed the cardboard set pieces and weak photography that's your loss but it certainly isn't a reason to entirely neglect this film. The story focuses on the overly ambitious surgeon Bill Cortner decent performance by Jason Evers who likes to experiment with transplanting limbs organs and even complete heads! When a car crash he caused decapitates his fiance her artificially keeps her alive while searching for a decent still walking donor body. The plot is enriched with a horrible monster in the laboratory's closet a previous experiment of Dr. Cortner that went wrong a traumatized model and the stubborn head itself that hates not being dead. Granted The Brain that Wouldn't Die features a couple very boring sequences that lead nowhere. In an overlong sequence set at a nudie bar for example Cortner seduces two possible hot bodydonors but his attempt is eventually fruitless. This along with the abrupt ending and fuzzy camerawork is the only real letdown in an otherwise entertaining and enthusiastically made horror quickie. Experienced horror fans will certainly appreciate the maker's attempts to serve us gore and morbid humor in a hilarious sequence Dr. Bill tapes the talking head's mouth shut!. Please don't let the negative comments and the ranking in the bottom top 100 keep you from watching it. It's an okay movie that you won't regret wasting time with. If you really want an awful film with a more or less similar premise check out The Frozen Dead Herbert J. Leder  1966. Very tedious nonsense in which the experimenting doctors are vicious Nazis and the separated heads are a lot less lively.".

	schema:headline " Something of a trash classic";
	schema:reviewBody "The Brain That Wouldn't Die is pure unadulterated schlock. It's one of those old Zgrade movies that sort of lives up to its reputation. It's another mad doctor movie of which there were countless examples in the 50's and 60's but this one is quite a bit more entertaining that almost all of them. The plot line is basically about a surgeon who is experimenting with reanimating dead tissue. He is in a car accident where his girlfriend dies and is decapitated. He takes her head from the crash site and brings it back to life. Meanwhile one of his monstrous creations lurks in the cupboard in the lab...Like a number of similar cheap scifihorror productions of the time this film includes a lot of scenes with scantily clad women in this case dancers and a photographic model. Our crazy doctor prowls the strip clubs and the models studio looking for women with the perfect body for his disembodied head back in the lab. Obviously these scenes aren't exactly racy by today's standards but they are fun nevertheless. They are in contrast to perhaps the film's most famous element  the scenes of graphic gore. Again to a modern gorehound these scenes will be very tame indeed but for a film released in 1962 they were very extreme  a man has his arm ripped off and another has a lump of his cheek bitten off! In other words this was a true schlockfest of a movie at the time.With the exception of Virginia Leith in the role as the head the acting is atrocious. But this damages the film in no way whatsoever as this is truly a trash classic. It moves along at a good pace and it has some imaginative camerawork especially in the external scenes leading up to and after the car crash. The makeup effects are crude but the monster is pretty memorable. As is the film in general. I certainly recommend it for fans of the trashier and schlockier side of scifi and horror.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Brain That Wouldn't Die is pure unadulterated schlock. It's one of those old Zgrade movies that sort of lives up to its reputation. It's another mad doctor movie of which there were countless examples in the 50's and 60's but this one is quite a bit more entertaining that almost all of them. The plot line is basically about a surgeon who is experimenting with reanimating dead tissue. He is in a car accident where his girlfriend dies and is decapitated. He takes her head from the crash site and brings it back to life. Meanwhile one of his monstrous creations lurks in the cupboard in the lab...Like a number of similar cheap scifihorror productions of the time this film includes a lot of scenes with scantily clad women in this case dancers and a photographic model. Our crazy doctor prowls the strip clubs and the models studio looking for women with the perfect body for his disembodied head back in the lab. Obviously these scenes aren't exactly racy by today's standards but they are fun nevertheless. They are in contrast to perhaps the film's most famous element  the scenes of graphic gore. Again to a modern gorehound these scenes will be very tame indeed but for a film released in 1962 they were very extreme  a man has his arm ripped off and another has a lump of his cheek bitten off! In other words this was a true schlockfest of a movie at the time.With the exception of Virginia Leith in the role as the head the acting is atrocious. But this damages the film in no way whatsoever as this is truly a trash classic.

He finally wants to come clean on what it is he does there that has been such a secret. On the way he gets in a terrible car accident leaving the car in flames and soon to be wife beheaded. He grabs the head out of the car and takes it to his laboratory. He's experimented on decapitated people before and had success and this would be his most brilliant achievement. Bill and his lab partner who helps the doctor in hopes he will get his amputated arm treated keep the head alive with a special device and a new type of liquid they invented that works like blood. The lab partner has a fake arm now but it is very deformed from the doctors previous attempt to help. It works! The head is alive and bitching every second that she should have been left for dead. Dr. Cortner's plan is to find a worthy body for her so he goes out looking for nice bodies in a strip club. That's the gist of the story and believe it or not the movie isn't bad. It's pretty well filmed besides the fairly lame car accident and main actors Jason Evers as the doctor and Virginia Leith as Jan the fiance are pretty good. The movie even has a decent scene or two of suspense and found that watching this late at night in the right mood was not amazing but definitely entertaining.".

I grew up watching copies of the earlier Puppet Master movies behind my parent's backs they didn't approve of the gore until I was a teenager so when I recently got the Puppet Master boxset as a nostalgic gift from my father I popped this one in thinking it would be an interesting film.Oh... my... god.Words cannot describe this movie.Puppet Master The Legacy is essentially a 15minute long short film that is padded with about an hour of footage from the previous films as a character explains the plot of the series to another person. Yup that's right... this is the horror movie equivalent of a sitcom clipshow. You know? Those lame episodes where the producers would run out of money and just string together a series of clips from prior episodes with a lame bookend scene of the characters recalling the old clips? This movie is one of those!And what makes it even sadder the story that is used to string together the clips is one of the most poorly written insanely plotted and hilariously cheaplyshot plots I've ever seen.The abundance of old footage actually serves two purposes to actually be fair. One for the reason I stated above to give the producers fodder to release a new DVD of this awful clipshow and Two to try and fix a few continuity problems that existed within the series. This film does this by making the overall plot even MORE confused and convoluted so now the first film is technically the third film and the second film is technically the eighth film? and by flatout disrespecting characters and ideas from previous entries. Including a moment where the main character from the fourth and fifth film is killed by a single line of dialog our villain says Oh I uh... killed him. and that's it. So disrespectful to the fans.The plot of the new footage is this a man named Eric Weiss unknown actor who we'll never hear from again is captured by some rogue agent chick named Maclain unknown actress who we'll never hear from again who forces him to tell her the story of the puppets from the movies. That's it. It's stupid.The kicker is that the new footage doesn't even try to LOOK good. It's some of the laziest cheapest footage I've ever seen. It looks like it was filmed on an 80's VHS camcorder the lighting is abysmal there is no real setdecoration or design to speak of and the acting is hilariously bad.As a fan of the series this film just felt like a cheap cashgrabbing insult. This is a 1 out of 10 plain and simple. Yet somehow isn't as bad as the paininducing Puppet Master VS Demonic Toys. Saw that once about five years ago and it still makes me angry.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Puppet Master movies were among the best movies ever produced by Full Moon Entertainment in the early 90s. They were about a group of living Puppets who followed the orders of their master the main concept was that if the master was good the puppets were good and used their skills for good but if the master was evil the puppets were evil killers. The movies were of good quality but when Full Moon's budget started to be lower the movies' quality went downhill with bad effects and awful scripts. The Puppet Master series was severely affected by all this. A shame indeed because from being one of their best series it ended in the lowest of the low. To end quickly the Puppet Master storyline was a chaos with the only things that tied the movies together were the Puppets and its original master Andre Toulon. The rest of the characters had been forgotten changed or disappeared with no explanation. So Charles Band the mind behind most of Full Moon Entertainment successes and failures gives us Puppet Master The Legacy as a way to fix the problems of the series and finally putting an end to his beloved story.In Legacy we find Peter Hertz the boy who as child during World War II was helped by Andre Toulon and escaped with him from Nazi Germany. Now named Eric Weiss played by Jason Witkin in the present he has finally discovered the fate of his friend after many years of lost contact. In the Bodega Bay hotel he found Toulon's notes and his beloved Puppets but he was found by a mysterious woman named Maclain Kate Orsini hired to find the Puppets and Toulon's secret.The movie follows a discussion between the two of them remembering Toulon and his actions since he learned the secret of life until his death and rebirth. While Weiss remembers Toulon as a great man whose life was destroyed by the Nazis Maclain knows him as a mad psycho who enslaved the puppets.The movie works very well in terms of giving sense to the storyline trying to fix the enormous plot holes the series had. To do this the movie uses clips from all the Puppet Master movies although this has to do more with the fact that it had almost no budget than with a creative decision.The new material barely 30 minutes is well acted and in fact is better acted than most of the acting in the series. It really shows how hard Band tried to fix his most successful series as the clips from previous movies are very good edited and work better than watching the entire awful movies clips from Parts 4 5 and Retro Puppet Master for example. We also get to know the fate of characters from all the movies as they are mentioned in the conversations between Maclain and Weiss.As a fan watching the movie was kind of sad because it was very obvious that this was a desperate attempt to fix a series that has been badly damaged over the years nevertheless the effort is very appreciated because it finally gives a fitting conclusion to Full Moon's best selling movies.30 minutes and clips of previous movies is not my idea of a good movie but this movie is definitely a must see for every fan of the Puppet Master series. 610".

Macclain breaks into Toulon's final resting place Bogeda Bay Inn where she finds Toulon's old friend Eric Weiss Jacob Witkin  threatens to torture  kill him unless he hands the secret over as the two argue the truth about Andre Toulon is revealed as his entire life  the events surrounding his killer puppets are told...Directed by Charles Band under the pseudonym of Robert Talbot Puppet Master The Legacy is the eighth  to date final film in the Puppet Master franchise that started with the excellent Puppet Master 1989 all those years ago the series carried on with Puppet Master II 1991 Puppet Master III Toulon's Revenge 1991 Puppet Master 4 1993 Puppet Master 5 The Final Chapter 1994 Curse of the Puppet Master 1998  finally Retro Puppet Master 1999 before this instalment which went straight to video in '03. The script by C. Courtney Joyner under the pseudonym of Gene Yarbrough tries to tell the tale of Andre Toulon in chronological order  make some sense out of it unlike the series as it stands at the moment  is basically an excuse to use as much footage from the previous seven Puppet Master films as possible Puppet Master The Legacy features clips from all of the previous entries. It would be interesting to know just how much original footage this contains at a rough guess I'd say no more than fifteen minutes worth  that's being generous. The clips are reasonably well edited into into a new film there are a few sudden jumps in logic  location there are numerous occasions where character's just come  go within the space of a few minutes  it's a bit choppy as you would expect a 70 minute film made up from seven other films would be. I was going to start this comment by saying that I was a fan of the Puppet Master films but then I realised I have only seen the first two which I thought were both great unfortunately judging by some of the footage from the other sequels the series obviously went downhill in a big way. I must admit I rather liked Puppet Master The Legacy they at least keep things moving the clips used are good I've only seen the first two so most of the footage was new to me anyway  rather surprisingly the twist ending was rather good in fact I'd go as far as to say it was pretty clever hell I doubt there are many instances in any Puppet Master film you could describe as clever  was a nice way to round things off.Director Band doesn't do anything as there's hardly any new footage here what is here is reasonably well shot  there are some OK shots of the puppets. Various special effect  gore highlights throughout the series are present including face slashing brain tunnelling hook impaling head bashing shooting burning crotch drilling throat slashing  Leech regurgitating. The puppets themselves are cool  probably the best bunch of killer toys ever to grace the silver screen!The budget stretched to one room some scientific lab equipment  the services of two actors that's all there is to Puppet Master The Legacy. These parts look fine even though the digital video used looks odd whenever it uses clips from the first two films which actually had budgets  were obviously shot on 35mm film. The distinctive sinister  rather good Puppet Master theme music is used throughout. The acting was alright.Puppet Master The Legacy isn't for everyone that's for sure as most of it is just footage taken from the other Puppet Master films. However I quite liked it as I really like the first two in the series the killer puppets themselves have real character  personality  are some of the best  most memorable seen in this type of film  if you like the Puppet Master series  know what your getting yourself into then I'd say it's worth watching but probably not worth buying as you'd only want to watch it once. As if that wasn't enough the murderous Puppet Master dolls returned in the madeforTV film Puppet Master Vs Demonic Toys 2004 which sounds erm interesting.".

The problem is instead of answering some questions such as why Toulon was out of character in part 2 and what Curse of the Puppet Master was about.  They seemed to always dodge those things.  The main problem is the ending it makes little sense.  Hopefully now that Full Moon is back on it's feet the Puppet Master series will return to the glory days of the excellent parts 15.  Unlike most though I thought retro puppet master was cute yet nothing great. My rating5 out of 10".

It showed an appearance of Torch which can turn things and humans which is cool and showed the return of the puppet master from part one.

It's not a good movie at all the eighty percent of old scenes were boring and the new twenty percent were highlighted with a couple of horrible acting and more questions than answers. The lady agent is just horrendous and her story is completely farfetched and laughable.

It has about 90  of old clips narrated by someone who is being held at gun point because ... well that would be a spoiler.Not that it does matter in the end of course. Because this is just a cash in. On the other hand maybe this is sufficient and you don't need to watch all the previous entries to get you up to speed before the next three installments formed a trilogy that could've been shortened and was too long for it's own good and also kind of feels like a cash in? Then again I'll be awaiting entry number 12 now which is supposed to be really good fun".

But do not be fooled...While this movie was released in 2003 much of the visuals are taken from another two movies in the series.So nothing unusual there you might say... Well yes there is when they did not get released until 5 years LATER!!! Yes one was released in 2008 and the other in 2012.The best guess possible is that production problems struck but the studio still had to put out a film as per contract so a Quick story was put together to try and plug the gaps until the later films would eventually be realised.As such this film is one giant Spoiler!!!What makes me think that the Later movies were in production but put on hold? Well having watched them in chronological order  Some Post Production effects are missing from some of the cobbled together scenes as well as some small dialogue changes.Compared to the last movie the editing is far far better... So even though this is just a Greatest hits and those yet to come episode in the franchise it works out OK!Sadly its not a story as such... Continuity wise its hard to know where this actually fits in the series as once again it seems to ignore events of previous films in the franchise... But at least its not as badly edited as Curse of the Puppet Master.Random IrritationsThe stolen scene from one of the old Sinbad Movies...Some of the cobbled together Post Production scenes give a little too much away about the inner workings of the film... You can actually hear the small explosive charge used to shatter a window!!!A scene boarding a train taken from another entirely different Movie.Random Superb Moments Revisiting the far superior Puppet Master 3 Toulon's RevengeSo this is rightfully the LAST in the series regardless of what the Wiki says... To relive the best moments and get a final great twist is good... Could have been a bit better and who knows there may even be yet one final sequel.".

I used quotations because The Legacy isn't really a movie per se but a series of clips of stock footage from previous films framed by 25 minutes of new footage to form a pointless new story. I am a forgiving critic usually able to appreciate the effort put into a movie but this one has no effort to speak of. It is a celluloid parasitic byproduct designed to leech money from fans. If this were a TV special on SYFY channel I could forgive it because it does recap the series with some competence for those who are too lethargic to watch the real movies. But if you're one of those sloths then I pity you because this Puppet Master is not seeing the series at its best. This is seeing schlock moneygrubbing at its worst.

	schema:reviewBody "Puppet Master The Legacy 2003 12 out of 4 Ultracheap eighth entry in the series starts off with a woman taking Eric Weiss the boy from PUPPET MASTER III hostage and demanding him to tell her the secrets of the puppets. From this point on we start a whole string of flash backs to earlier films in the series with constant looks at the present time as the woman becomes more and more demanding. It turns out that SILENT NIGHT DEADLY NIGHT 2 isn't the cheapest horror film ever made. No that honor goes to this installment which runs 74minutes and being generous I'd say that at least sixtyminutes are nothing more than clips from the previous seven movies. Diehard fans might enjoy seeing a cut down version of the previous movies with a few new scenes added in but to me this is about as cheap as you can get and I really see no reason to applaud the cheapness of a film like this. The only reason I could see this film being important is for those people who aren't really interested in the series but want to see what story all of the movies told. Instead of seeing the previous seven movies you could just watch this thing and get the general idea of what the series was about. Unlike watching the previous seven movies in order this one here would at least allow you to see the story in chronological order. Since the series jumped around so much none of them were in order so the clips here are as followed RETRO PM3 PM PM2 PM4 PM5 and then CURSE. The new footage isn't all that well shot but the two actors aren't that bad. THE LEGACY is an ultracheap film that's only purpose was to milk an already dead series. With that said two more films would follow so I'm guessing this at least made the company some money.".

The acting ain't to bad either but the psychic girl is a tad annoying. There are three issues I had with the film. The first a small bug is the buildup which like in 1 or 2 takes a bit. The second a much larger issue is that the plot seems to feel very scrapped together like a bunch of little pieces of a script. So when it's all patched together it feels a little disjointed. The third another problem is the lack of blood. I don't mean gore I mean blood. Other than a severed finger the action is never violent or bloody enough to be horrory. Even so this film is entertaining and I recommend it to fans of the series 'sept for gore hounds and the younger horror audience too.".

	schema:headline " 80's Horror meets 90's Cheese in Puppet Master 4 a fun but very uneven entry in the series.";
	schema:reviewBody "If there's one thing to be said for Charles Band's longrunning horror franchise Puppet Master it's that it is a franchise that has proved to have a high degree of staying power lasting near three decades thus far and with no signs of slowing down. Even now there's talk of not only another sequel to the original franchise but even a full fledged theatrical reboot to the sometimes beloved series.Of course the series has needed to change with the times to remain culturally relevant and in no place is that more apparent than in 1993's Puppet Master 4. Also known as Puppet Master 4 The Demon. It's an entry to symbolizes a lot of change for the overall story both in subverting expectations and also finally taking the steps to update and modernize the overall franchise by injecting it with that grand old 90's cheese that so many now nostalgically look back on with a big grin.It's also the first entry in the series to toy with the idea of the killer puppets being fullblown heroes in their own film. Whereas they typically had been previously portrayed as villainous and murderous or at best as antiheroes out for revenge at the call of their master as was the case in the third film here they are finally at the hands of a decent master with no dark or selfish motivations who is merely seeking to survive and uses the puppets for good. It's a nice refreshing change of pace... especially as it fulfills the typical audience desire to see the villains win at least a little bit without making us directly route for them to do terrible things.We follow Rick Myers a caretaker at the Bodega Bay Inn who also happens to be working in a research project to create artificial intelligence. 90's Alert! Techno babble and bad 90's computer programming scenes imminent! However as the project is getting dangerously close to discovering the secret to life that had previously been found by the Puppet Master Andre Toulon the demon lord Sutekh sends a group of evil diminutive totems to kill all involved. Once Rick and his friends discover Toulon's puppets they are forced to bring them to life to battle this new threat! And they will also finally have to animate Toulon's hidden incomplete masterpiece of a puppet Decapitron in order to survive...Part of the fun of this entry is the subversion in finally making the puppets the goodguys thus allowing a sortof fullon war between two miniature factions. It supplies for a lot of fun moments and creative sequences. Our cast of human characters are also reasonably good leads for a lowbudget horror feature and you care just enough about them to keep you invested in the human drama. Even if there are some clichs that will make you groan like the hot chick in glasses scientist. Ugh. There's also a lot of fun to be had looking back on it in that nostalgic time capsule way. This is very much the product of its time with cheesy 90's style cheesy 90's dialog and cheesy 90's effects running rampant. It's quite charming as a result especially for those who grew up in that decade.That being said this is a very uneven film and it does suffer quite a bit for its faults. Many aspects of the story are dated to the point of going beyond the nostalgic charm. The pacing is all out of whack. Certain major elements seem out of left field. And it all does feel just a bit silly even for a Puppet Master sequel.Still there's plenty of fun to be had. The series was never anything more than trashy goofy Bmovies with some blood and boobs and creepy puppets... And you certainly get that here for the most part.So I'm giving it a middleoftheroad 6 out of 10. If you're a series fan a Charles Band fan or just a Bmovie fanatic like me you'll get your money's worth.".

Considering it's shortened length this one offers up a lot of good will with the fact that the puppets are placed at the forefront of the film for a majority of the time here. This impressive amount of time gives the film a rather blistering pace here that starts off nicely here with the two separate individual attacks against the scientists featuring the rather cool new demon puppet the enjoyable game against the puppets during the blackout as he attempts to find out the true nature of their powers which leads into the rather fun search throughout the house with the puppets helping out as well as the leadin to the fun and enjoyably cheesy attack inside the car outside in the rain. As that itself leads into the later scenes where the puppets are tasked with holding off several big action scenes by themselves it gives this one an extra boost as there's so many vivid and impressive scenes that rely solely on the puppets fighting each other from the impressive battle in the kitchen where they team up against the demon in a threeonone battle or the race to get their lifeless leader reanimated while holding off brawls with several of the demonic creatures still after them gives this one a life and energy that's quite exciting and enjoyable. Along with the fun and utterly creepy demonicpuppet look there's a lot to like here that makes this one good enough to hold out over the film's minor flaws. The main issue here is the fact that this one really belies it's purpose as being the first part of an origin story by really running through a lot of the unsure elements of the story as there's a lot to this one that doesn't get explained. From how they manage to tie in the events from the second film which is the true predecessor in the series the introduction of the strange demon cult that protects the entirely different set of magic that was used to originally animate the puppets and the need for a new puppet master all go by with little information if any is given at all so that on the whole this one suddenly becomes quite confusing whenever it goes into the underworld which just doesn't make any sense. As this one was all about the action scenes anyway it isn't a surprise that many of these would go unanswered but as a stand alone film just before the answers are given in another film yet it's still a very noticeable facet about this one. It's really the main thing holding this one back.Rated R Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.".

Nevertheless I didn't really liked how the puppets are turned into the good guys although you could say that was the case in the third film but I preferred that one's revenge angle facing off against a Sutek the ancient Eygptian God and its minions that can control totems but credit is due to somewhat as some familiar staples do crop up not completely repeating itself. Directed by Jeff Burr a regular to the genre and to sequels who would also direct the backtoback made filth film does quite competently polished if mechanical job knowing that it's the puppets themselves that are the main attraction as the animation is wellexecuted and the personalities of each one of them standing out with Blade taking centre stage. I always find something unsettling about the puppet Six Shooter and his laugh and again it's no exception here. The only two that didn't appear were leech woman and torch.The whole angle has the puppets finding a new master and protecting him from the demon who wants to destroy the late Andre Toulon's work and the tone has kind of changed while some dark glimmers I didn't find it all that creepy with nastiness mainly occurring offscreen and even the cliff side hotel they occupy doesn't have that dominating presence either. Some instances fell on the funny side but the change of pace and whole drama moves by quick enough. Also it looked like it had a little more money behind it and Richard Band chimes in with an airy majestic score.

	schema:reviewBody "Puppet Master is one of those franchises that every horror fan knows and has a peculiar fondness for despite the fact that it isn't very good at all. Here in the fourth instalment we see a demonic creature out to destroy anything associated with the eponymous puppet master Anton Toulon himself. The subjects of his wrath? The lethal and animate toys Toulon created as well as an improbably young scientist working on a project to bring life to the inanimate and a clutch of his witless friends and associates. Sound dreadful? Well it's not. Harking back to the glory days of American horror this is retro stuff that feels as if it was made ten years before it actually was. And that's a good thing kids. Trust me if the only horror you have seen is 'Shrooms Thir13en ghosts and other such nonsense that gets the green light in modern horror cinema you really are missing out and would do well to check out pretty much anything pre 1989 as an educational experience. Whilst the production levels and acting are bordering on the inane this has atmosphere by the bucket load.

	onyx:emotionText "Puppet Master is one of those franchises that every horror fan knows and has a peculiar fondness for despite the fact that it isn't very good at all. Here in the fourth instalment we see a demonic creature out to destroy anything associated with the eponymous puppet master Anton Toulon himself. The subjects of his wrath? The lethal and animate toys Toulon created as well as an improbably young scientist working on a project to bring life to the inanimate and a clutch of his witless friends and associates. Sound dreadful? Well it's not. Harking back to the glory days of American horror this is retro stuff that feels as if it was made ten years before it actually was. And that's a good thing kids. Trust me if the only horror you have seen is 'Shrooms Thir13en ghosts and other such nonsense that gets the green light in modern horror cinema you really are missing out and would do well to check out pretty much anything pre 1989 as an educational experience. Whilst the production levels and acting are bordering on the inane this has atmosphere by the bucket load.

For the start of the movie we are introduced to the caretaker of Bodega Bay Inn Gordon Currie and some youth friends of his many of the cast are Canadian and are all very good in unfortunately rather undemanding roles  Teresa Hill is quite yummy. Totems minions of the Egyptian God Sutek want the secret of animation life back and the puppets when they surface act with a previously unseen cleverness to attempt to destroy the ugly and very computer game looking Totems. The Totems merely complicate the series and distract from the things that previously made the series so unique  they don't share the weird beauty of the puppets and thus don't really fit in. Top scene is Pinhead using a rag to clean blood from Tunnelers drill bit classic and about the goriest this film goes. The fifth film was filmed concurrently with this one so expect similar sections of mediocre and a Toulon performance that seems to have been filmed in a different era or even galaxy. Guy Rolfe deserved better and series fans certainly do. Grrrrrrr.".

My expectations weren't high to begin with but this is cheap directtovideo stuff not even a horror movie it's PG13. The acting was not convincing the story was rather dumb without any excitement and there were not many effects. But the main problem is that there were no kills or any gore the annoying kid who gets killed in his car was supposed to be the highlight but come on..Surprisingly both Parts 4 and 5 were directed by Sequeldirector Jeff Burr who gave us the excellent Stepfather II and Leatherface Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. I liked Puppet Master The Legacy even if it was nothing else than a tribute with the best scenes from all movies.Overall Puppet Master is very much like the Hellraiser Series A great trilogy but forget the rest..".

So Sutekh the demon sends the totems a bunch of craven little creatures that look like earless gremlins.  Then it's up to the puppet troupe to take care of the interdimensional threat that's trying to kill there new friends.Like most low budget movies this film is rife with continuity problems. How did the puppets get put back in the trunk?  How come nobody remembers the last rasche of killngs in the hotel?  Who bought the hotel?  Why would a contractor by a building with a history of mass murders?  All this and many more questions  will not be answered...ever.The real suprise of this movie is the acting.  It's actually pretty good.  The actors take it with a enthusiasm unusual especially for a bunch of Full Moon nonames.  Teresa Hill was especially impressive as the shy nervous psychic Lauren.  Chandra West Susie was also a pleasant suprise also.  Gordon Hill was a tolerable protagonist.  But Cameron was far too annoying to stomach.  Thank the norse god he dies before halfway through.The puppets are there usual animated selves.  With some improvements as well.  There emotions especially Jester's are much more human due to the sounds that have been given to them.  Blade's hisses Pinhead's grunts and SixShooter's snicker have all been improved and sound much better.  The stopmotion animation is only average at best especially the totems. They just don't seem to move as fluidly as the previous installment in the series.  Also the Sutekh costume is absolutely awefull.  How are we supposed to afraid of a creature so humorous looking.The story seems a bit juvinile for the series.  I think Charlie Band was looking to focus in on a younger demographic.  The violence being toned down in this movie also seems to speak the same.  Gore fans will be disappointed.I think the above is the main problem this movie can't really stick with many people.  It doesn't have the violence for gorewhores.  The language is a little cleaner.  Yet it's too violent and harsh for the wee ones.  Which is why the movie gets low ratings.  I have to say that the common reviews are mostly fair.".

The Graphics were also Remarkable because The Actually looked like They Were Walking as to Where in Scenes from Previous Films They looked Like they were Floating or Hovering.

This Film was so Fun to Watch and I Would Hope that There wasn't a Person in the World who Didn't Like it.

	schema:reviewBody "From the mind from Charles Robert Band writer  founder of Full Moon Features a company known for its directtovideo BList horror  scifi movies comes 'Puppet Master 4' AKA Puppet Master the Demon a film so outthere stupid that it makes the previous three film seem tame in comparison. Directed by Jeff Burr the film tells the story of Andre Toulon Guy Rolfe's animated puppets once again serving as protagonists as they fight against demons avatar minions called 'totems' sent from hell looking for the secret life formula. Without spoiling the directed to video movie too much much like the previous entry 1991's prequel 'Puppet Master III Toulon's Revenge' the timeline for this film is also mess up and doesn't really follow any of the continuous set for it after the events of 1990's 'Puppet Master II His Unholy Creations'. One such example is the serum McGuffin. In the last movie they were running out of it and had to make more or the puppets would cease to exist. In 'Puppet Master 4 the many writers just avoid that conflict in order to make a more confusing one. Instead of running out of vials the formula is now suddenly available unexplained in order for out of place robotic scientists who happen to be caretaker for murder houses such as Rick Myers Gordon Currie to use it to create artificial intelligence life despite the previous movies saying the puppets are human souls trapped in puppet form not inanimate objects given life. Also why in the hell would they need a lightning rod to reanimate one of the newer puppets when they have the serum!? It's seems to me that the writers don't know the hell they're talking about. Since they're writing for Rick. It makes young scientist seems like a total idiot for not knowing the different between spiritualism  basic science. To make it worst the writers chose to have an odd whimsical moment of him playing laser tag with the puppets knowing full well after reading Toulon's diary that these marionettes had killed people in the past. Rick would have to be a major moron to give a gun to a murderer and ask it to shot at him to prove artificial intelligence  then later use a fake gun to try to combat a real threat! Are you sure writers that Rick is a scientist!? You wrote him so stupidly. It doesn't help that the actor that plays him is not that good of a performer. He never once seem like he belong in the same group of scientists at BioTech who has least gave a fighting chance against the creatures. For the most part he's pretty useless against fighting off the demons making the puppets have to do his dirty work even if he's six feet taller than the totems. Also the movie doesn't really explain why the demons would send little avatars versions of themselves over in the first place. Wouldn't it make sense to send themselves since they're taller and more powerful than the humans!? Also why did they kill Rick's buddies at BioTech in the opening of the film!? It's not like he open the trunk containing the puppets yet. I guess the demons doesn't like other people trying to create life. Also another plot hole the movie doesn't really explain that good is how in the hell was the trunk in which Rick pull the puppets out looks like it hasn't been touched in 50 years despite evidence that shows this film to take place sometime after 'Puppet Master I  II'. Also what happen to one of the parapsychologist Camille Kenney Nita Talbot that got her soul transfer into a womansized mannequin Julianne Mazziotti from the last movie? Better yet how did the puppets get back to the hotel!? She drove off with them in the last movie. None of these things are really explained. Besides that the other faults of the film are the lousy visuals effects. The costumes for the demons are really low budget and not well made. They really come off as very fakelooking. Not only that but the ventriloquism is really awful for them. The demons don't really move right. Although the demons are not great. The puppeteering for the totems  the puppets were a little better. However the stop motion sequences kinda hit a down grade. You can really tell that this movie had a budget cut because the filmmakers reused previous small clips of stop motion footage from the other 3 films a little too much. Even the gore effects have die down since the last movie. Lots of offscreen kills  barely any blood use. I guess Full Moon Studios tame the horror down to get a PG13 rated in order to get parents to buy the movie for their kids but the plan backfired. Not only did it not bring that much new viewers for this film and its sequel 'Puppet Master 5 The Final Chapter' which were both shot back to back but it also kinda irritation the original fans in how tame the violence has gotten. Sadly Full Moon retired the franchise after this in order to try a spinoff trilogy 'Puppet Master Vs Demonic Toys' but it never got off the ground until 2004. It wasn't until the sixth entry 1998's 'Curse of the Puppet Master' that the main franchise got revived. Nevertheless this is the movie that almost killed the franchise. That's how disappointing it was. Overall 'The Puppet Masters' film series is always been one of my guilty pleasures. It is by no means a series of puppet masterpieces but it did entertains me as a kid of the 1990s. This movie is not one of my favorites. In the end this is one movie worth punching away with Judy. Not worth seeing.".

	onyx:emotionText "From the mind from Charles Robert Band writer  founder of Full Moon Features a company known for its directtovideo BList horror  scifi movies comes 'Puppet Master 4' AKA Puppet Master the Demon a film so outthere stupid that it makes the previous three film seem tame in comparison. Directed by Jeff Burr the film tells the story of Andre Toulon Guy Rolfe's animated puppets once again serving as protagonists as they fight against demons avatar minions called 'totems' sent from hell looking for the secret life formula. Without spoiling the directed to video movie too much much like the previous entry 1991's prequel 'Puppet Master III Toulon's Revenge' the timeline for this film is also mess up and doesn't really follow any of the continuous set for it after the events of 1990's 'Puppet Master II His Unholy Creations'. One such example is the serum McGuffin. In the last movie they were running out of it and had to make more or the puppets would cease to exist. In 'Puppet Master 4 the many writers just avoid that conflict in order to make a more confusing one. Instead of running out of vials the formula is now suddenly available unexplained in order for out of place robotic scientists who happen to be caretaker for murder houses such as Rick Myers Gordon Currie to use it to create artificial intelligence life despite the previous movies saying the puppets are human souls trapped in puppet form not inanimate objects given life.

The casting is strange and the acting is poor but the effects are decent. Not great as they never are in the series but the introduction of the demons is nice and they're way better than any of the puppets. Apparently Burr had only limited impact on the casting as he wanted Judy Geeson for a role but Charlie Band overruled him and handpicked his own actress.If you love movies especially these lower budget movies pick up this disc with Jeff Burr's audio commentary. Burr really needs to write an autobiography as his memory is incredible and he is an excellent storyteller. He finds a way to fit 200 minutes worth of discussion into a lessthan90 minute film. His reflections on Albert Band and puppetry and everything else are priceless.".

I love the audacity with which Ray puts it in everything the painful and believable performances by three actors the cinematography and the misenscene have peculiar poetry and preciseness that often recalls John Ford's Wagon Master the rodeo footages are daring and stunning.The ending is not that hokey or fake as one critic suggested but a daring act of poetry and subtlety. In Ray's work there is always a strong need to constitute the couple and the family the emotional pull this creates is always extremely strong and never merely formal even in Bigger Than Life. That highangle shot after Jeff's death the word EXIT indicating both that the couple Wes and Louise are leaving this world and that the film is about to end. The compression here is characteristic of melodrama and of Ray. Jeff's return performance makes Wes realize that he'll never be as good in the rodeo as Jeff. So the competitive motive that has been driving Wes has been removed. Second Jeff's death relieves Wes of the need to die in the arena. It's a symbolic sacrifice Jeff in place of Wes.".

I saw this movie as a child on television and could not understand why Susan Hayworth would prefer Arthur Kennedy to Robert Mitchum.It's a dusty exhausting rodeo film so realistic that one can almost smell the horses.  Seeing how the participants usually had to pick up their winnings day money in a bar after what could have been a physically crippling time in the arena shows how easy it would have been to start drinking to kill the pain and the fear.  Also the rodeo groupies so ready to soothe the pains and massage the ego have probably changed very little since the early '50s.  The character of Jeff McCloud has obviously been there and done that and Mitchum plays the weariness with authenticity and sympathy. He also reveals his ability to play comedy in the scene in Rosemary's trailer with Frank Faylen.I heartily recommend this film to anyone wanting to see a realistic slice of Americana and good performances by all the leads.".

Mitchum plays Jeff McCloud a burned out rodeo rider who spots some potential star talent in Wes Merritt. He also spots Merritt's wife and the Merritts are played by Arthur Kennedy and Susan Hayward. Mitchum's been thrown by one too many bulls and horses and he's a burned out man. Still the allure of the circuit holds him in sway. He mentors Kennedy until they come to a parting of the ways and not just over Susan Hayward. The part is a perfect fit for Mitchum his own footloose past made him understand the character of Jeff McCloud and bring it to life. This was the first of two films Mitchum did with Susan Hayward. She's clearly in support of him and she knows it. Her big moment on screen is dispatching a rodeo groupie at a party who had designs on Arthur Kennedy. Her footage had to be shot first according to Lee Server's biography of Mitchum as Hayward had a commitment in Africa to shoot The Snows of Kilimanjaro.Among the supporting cast Arthur Hunnicutt one of the biggest scene stealers around is very good as another burned out rodeo rider. Mitchum looks at him and sees that is his future. In fact in the end so does Kennedy.The Lusty Men is a fine depiction of rodeo life ranking up there with the later Junior Bonner and 8 Seconds. Good entertainment all around.".

He becomes attached to a man working as a cowhand in a nearby ranch and his lovely wife and soon convinces the man to make him as his rodeo mentor.

Ray's direction is good the rodeo setting provides an exotic backdrop of western Americana which should appeal to lovers of open vistas and wild landscapes and the performances are ace all around. Mitchum is at the top of his game playing the kind of character he could play with eyes closed. It was redhaired Susan Hayward who was the big revelation for me though.

Her role as Louise mirrored her own real life attitude to love and marriage. She tried to stick to her marriage both in the movie and in real life and it could have been Susan saying about her own circumstances Men!!  I'd like to fry them all in deep fat!!! Even though the movie garnered excellent reviews and rated a movie review page in the prestigious Look magazine it wasn't as big a hit as her other releases.Rodeos are Jeff McLeod's Robert Mitchum reason for living and when he is gored by a Brahma bull he is emotionally and physically spent. He desperately wants to rebuild his life and returns to his childhood home. Remembering some buried treasure he had hidden under the floorboards as a kid he retrieves it only to find an old rodeo program and a couple of coins. Wes and Louise Merritt Arthur Kennedy and Susan Hayward are keen to buy Jeff's home and Wes who recognises him as a former Rodeo star gets him a job as a ranch hand. Wes has won a few events himself and feels that with Jeff as his manager they would be a great team. Louise is unimpressed with Jeff's cool and lacksadasical attitude she wants Wes in one piece and to save his money for a house deposit.Wes with childhood memories of a father who was never his own boss quits his job for a life on the rodeo circuit and what he thinks is easy money. What with busted legs and faces scarred from Brahma bull hooves Wes is getting a taste of grim reality  and it's only their first day!!! The film creates an exciting atmosphere with wild horses bucking broncos and leisure time spent carousing in the bars where a day's prize money could be lost in drinking and gambling. Louise sees Wes being sucked into the itinerant way of life and Jeff after being taunted by Wes for sponging on his earnings signs up the next day for all events even though he is far from being in good shape. He hits trouble when his foot gets caught in a stirrup and his death sets up a pretty contrived ending where Wes realising Jeff had only his best interests at heart gives up the circuit for a little home in Texas.Susan gives an unusually restrained performance as Louise except for one hilarious cat fight in this movie that shows not only the downside but the excitement that drives cowboys to give their all in the ring. It goes without saying that both Kennedy and Mitchum give superlative performances but a couple of the women step up as well  Maria Hart and Lorna Thayer actresses I have never heard of. Actual shots of rodeos were filmed in Tuscon Arizona and Pendleton Oregon with some of America's most famed rodeo stars including the appearance of Cy Taillon  The World's Greatest Rodeo Announcer. In fact I can heartily recommend Cyra McFadden's wonderful memoir about life on the rodeo circuit as well as what it was like to be the unofficial mascot as well as Cy Taillon's daughter  Rain or Shine.".

But she glowers and snarls with the best of them and topbilled in this man'sman movie she's great fun. But even she's dominated by a supremely confident and virile Robert Mitchum as a hasbeen rodeo champ trying to turn her husband a rather miscast but hardworking Arthur Kennedy into a king of the saddle. It's locationfilmed and has no traces of studio hackery and Nicholas Ray keeps it wonderfully outdoorsy with some fabulous stuntriding footage and an authentic atmosphere of the hardscrabble rodeo life. The initial HaywardMitchum shower scene has to be one of the sexiest in all 1950s cinema and there's a great sexual undercurrent to all their encounters. Kennedy seems a little pallid by comparison and is playing a character that's hard to root for but he does try hard. I didn't know this movie and am grateful to TCM for running it  it's a real discovery. However their print has awfully uneven sound and you'll have to keep adjusting your volume up down up down.".

But even she's dominated by a supremely confident and virile Robert Mitchum as a hasbeen rodeo champ trying to turn her husband a rather miscast but hardworking Arthur Kennedy into a king of the saddle. It's locationfilmed and has no traces of studio hackery and Nicholas Ray keeps it wonderfully outdoorsy with some fabulous stuntriding footage and an authentic atmosphere of the hardscrabble rodeo life. The initial HaywardMitchum shower scene has to be one of the sexiest in all 1950s cinema and there's a great sexual undercurrent to all their encounters. Kennedy seems a little pallid by comparison and is playing a character that's hard to root for but he does try hard. I didn't know this movie and am grateful to TCM for running it  it's a real discovery. However their print has awfully uneven sound and you'll have to keep adjusting your volume up down up down.";

Arthur Kennedy has always been one of my favorites and Susan Hayward who was born on my birthday is amazing always. Whew in this movie she beats up another chick TWICE! With good reason of course. I am really glad I never saw this movie before because although Leonard Maltin called the ending hokey in his video guide I liked it so much that it made me cry. Maybe it's a 'girl thing.' Robert Mitchum was incredibly handsome and sexy  if I owned the movie I just might watch it again TO SEE HIM WALK whew. I bet he had the girls heated up in the 50s. Sorry I didn't tape it for my own use then. I feel that this film is an example of why Nicholas Ray has a following. It's a beautiful work of art and I thank him for it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie's a real sleeper. Rodeos were never a popular theme for Hollywood outside of Saturday matines. Maybe that's why the studio came up with a misleading title that cheapens expectations. The movie certainly doesn't glamorize rodeoing. In fact it's a pretty scathing look at both the inside and the outside. Jeff's Mitchum character is brilliantly conveyed early on as he drifts across the empty field along with other windblown discards. He's going back to his roots now that he's quit the circuit with no other place to go. So he hooks up with ambitious Wes Kennedy and his nononsense wife Louise Hayward. For half of Wes's winnings veteran rodeoer Jeff can guide the talented newcomer as he joins the circuit. The trouble is Jeff is attracted to the loyal Louise even as Wes begins to live the fast life on his big winnings. Louise however only wants what she's always wanteda little spread of her and Wes's own where they can make a home. But Wes is forgetting those plans as he succumbs to the hardpartying of the rootless circuit. So what will Louise do and just as importantly what will the lovelorn Jeff do now that the marrieds are growing apart.The partying scenes are particularly well done conveying just the right touches of cheap booze loose women and tall tales. Note that telling camera angle of the grizzled Booker Hunnicutt as he gazes up a shapely leg from floor levelone shot can speak the proverbial volumes. Note too the subtle way the script implies that trickrider Rosemary has been sleepingaround apparently an approved practice in these circles contrary to the mores of the time 1952. Also the shower scene when Al Faylen walks in is a neat bit of implied humor that depends on audience savvy for its chuckles. It's quite an intelligent screenplay except for maybe the abrupt but oddly satisfying last scene. Cult director Ray oversees with his usual artistic sensibility though it looks like he was still suffering intermittent illness since an uncredited Robert Parrish gets a credited appearance from IMDb. And of course Mitchum is Mitchum so lowkey here it's hard to read his feelings at any point. No in my little book it's Susan Hayward's movie. By golly she's escaped that deadend tamale shop and nothing's going to stop her little dream. The guys may be physically tougher but none can match her inner strength and Hayward brings it all off in thoroughly convincing fashion. I can't conceive that the movie made money as downbeat as it is. And I wonder what audiences lured in by the lurid title thought once they saw rodeo. Nonetheless the film remains an outstanding example of moviemaking in a minor key.".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't let the title fool you. Apparently part of the studio's design to tempt a broader audience in to see this film 'The Lusty Men' is just not a very good title for it. Two other titles were considered  one even worse This Man is Mine and one that was better if not exciting Cowpoke. Briefly this is the story of a young ranch worker Arthur Kennedy and his new bride Susan Hayward trying to save up money to buy a ranch of their own. Faded rodeo star Mitchum crosses their path and changes their lives showing the young husband Kennedy a shortcut to big money by riding in the rodeo. There's a lot of friction resulting as time goes on with Kennedy hooked on the easy money and attention while Hayward fears for his safety and blames Mitchum for driving a wedge between the couple. I won't give away any of the story beyond that.I do want to give a broader review of this movie for the type that it is. I don't think I've ever seen a seriouslymade movie which depicts rodeos or bull riding that was not at least fairly compelling as this one is. Whether it's 'The Lusty Men' or 'Eight Seconds' or 'The Ride' those who ride rodeo put their lives and safety on the line for relatively little pay in most cases. They pursue their sport with an intensity that may be hard to understand for those who live a more ordinary existence. Just as a compulsive gambler gets that little rush every time he scratches off a lottery ticket or pulls the handle on a slot machine every time the bull or bronc rider nods his head and the chute gate swings open he has a brief chance at success and a win and the thrill that goes with it  but he has hundreds maybe thousands of people playing the game along with him. If he has a great ride the crowd goes wild. If he gets bucked off or gets hurt  maybe even killed  he has done so trying to please all those people in addition to himself. The complexities of the motivation of the rodeo rider belie what some may feel to be a very simple or even 'dumb' pursuit. It is these motivations which create the opportunity for fascinating characters living lives that follow different rules. They live outside the box even now as they have for decades in pursuit of their dreams. That's why 'The Lusty Men' and the other rodeo  bull riding films I've seen have been so good. When you start with characters filled with the 'heart and try' to compete at rodeo people who are not so bound to logic and commonsense the storyline possibilities are nearly endless. Things in the world of rodeo have changed since this movie was made. As one other reviewer pointed out a rodeo rider of the past having to retrieve his winnings at a saloon after having gotten banged up riding that day would be the perfect formula for the start of a drinking problem. Fortunately they don't get their winnings at a saloon anymore. On the other hand the 'buckle bunnies' who pursue rodeo riders are still drawn to the lean lanky quietly courageous cowboy no matter whether he rode for eight seconds or got bucked off in two. He doesn't need to be a big money winner because the cowboy's appeal has never been about money. To the contrary  his lack of wealth may be part of his appeal by making him seem more downtoEarth and approachable maybe even vulnerable because he is nearly broke. In this movie however the young cowboy  rising rodeo star does attract the wrong kind of women because he has amassed some money winnings.You don't have to be a fan of rodeo or bull riding to enjoy this movie. While it does revolve around those sports the real story is what happens to the young couple and the old rodeo star who enters their lives.".

He meets up with the current owner Burt Mustineverybody's favorite old man and they chat a bituntil a cowhand and his wife Arthur Kennedy and Susan Hayward come to Mustin's home. It seems they'd love to buy it but have little if any money.When Kennedy recognizes Mitchum as a rodeo star he gets a bright ideahe can get Mitchum to train him so he can take up rodeo. That way he reasons he and his wife can buy the property much sooner. The problem is Kennedy's wife hates the idea of Kennedy breaking his neck this way! Yet despite her misgivings he pushes ahead. Surprisingly he is a successand every step of the way she is miserable as she knows it's only a matter of time until he's hurt. Throughout the film he promises to quit...but the longer it takes the less likely it is that he'll ever stop...until it's too late.As for the stars they are all very good. Hayward is emotional but good and plays a great dame Mitchum is his easygoing self and Kennedy surprisingly machosomething you don't see very often. The script is dandy and entertaining as wellespecially as you see Kennedy becoming more and more of a butthead. I also appreciated how the rodeo footage wasn't the usual grainy footageand they did a pretty good job of making you think it was the actors actually doing these crazy stunts. I also liked the endingit was downbeat but worked very well.By the way there are two bit parts to look for in the movie aside from Mustin's. The foreman of the ranch near the beginning is Glenn Strange. While you probably won't recognize his craggy face he's the last guy to play Universal's Frankenstein monsterhaving last appeared in this capacity in 1948's Abbott  Costello Meet Frankenstein. Also a few times throughout the film it's Jimmy Dodd of The Mickey Mouse Club playing one of the rodeo contestants. At a party later in the film he's playing a guitar. If you'd just given him some mouse ears he would have looked more familiar.".

Mitchum does his usual fine job Arthur Kennedy was an excellent Blist actor who here shows his talent well. Susan Hayward unfortunately is a bit miscast she is too much the East coast debutante to fit into the Western locale. Another quibble would be the many traveloguestyle bits meant to educate the viewer as to the various rodeo events they should at least have had a trained actor narrate these bits rather than using the obviously local talent. Also the production values are not the highest seeming at times more on the level of television. On the whole though the movie keeps us involved.".

Masterfully shot in black  white by Lee Garmes  NIGHTMARE ALLEY PORTRAIT OF JENNIE CAUGHT etc it has a beautifully livedin look that enhances the exotic world it portrays. The performances are all sterling and the dialogue provided for them most likely compliments of Horace McCoy one of the most remarkably and honestly expressive writers of the period rings remarkably true even in the midst of some overtly romanticized it is a Nicholas Ray film after all moments.The rodeo sequences are exceptionally exciting. Of course the movie is quite atmospheric and nicely captures the lifestyle of the rodeo crowd. There are some exciting moments like Wes riding YoYo and some great lines. Men...

	schema:headline " Usual Understated Mitchum In Ray Rodeo Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Nicholas Ray directed this excellent melodrama about ordinary folks trying to make their American Dream happen by utilizing the rodeo circuit. Arthur Kennedy and Susan Hayward star as Wes and Louise Merritt an ordinary couple living an ordinary life as a ranch hand and a ranch hand's wife respectively. In walks Robert Mitchum as Jeff McCloud a virile stranger who may be an opportunist and a lothario as well as an ex rodeo champion. Director Ray known for his strong characterizations excels at meshing the three lives of the principals in this film. Kennedy tires of ranch life just as Mitchum enters the picture worrying his wife Hayward.Mitchum is outstanding as usual in the role of Jeff McCloud and fits right in with the rough and tumble rodeo world. Kennedy is perhaps too old to play a new rodeo star and he certainly does not have the athleticism and physicality of Mitchum to be as believable as a rodeo star. However Kennedy's character changes as the film progresses from an ordinary ranch hand to an egotistical star becoming more distant from his wife's perspective. Hayward's character character changes too from a dutiful spouse to a woman willing to fight to keep her husband and in one piece. Mitchum's character change near the end is not quite believable and as a result the ending is not entirely satisfying.Director Nicholas Ray was always ahead of his time focusing on characters' conflicts with themselves as well as each other in that the conflicts served as catalysts for action andor change. Ray filmed the rodeo scenes with a 16 millimeter handheld camera a device that modern filmmakers have returned to with digital cameras in recent years in filming within close quarters to intensify emotionhorror or to portray an environment with more realism. Ray made an interesting choice to film in black and white in between two films in color he did Flying Leathernecks and Johnny Guitar mirroring the very real black and white results of his characters' decisions in The Lusty Men. Arthur Hunnicutt has a supporting role as an aging ranch hand. Horace McCoy contributed to the screenplay.  of 4 stars.".

I'm not so even though Suzy's one of my favorite actresses and Bob is as hunky as a man can be this isn't my favorite movie. Arthur Kennedy is cute in his own way but up against Robert Mitchum there's no contest. So why put him in a role where he's clearly not the love interest when everyone in the audience wants to see him make Susan Hayward swoon? I don't know.

But I will give it credit for having more complexity both in character and theme than the typical romantic drama of the time.What I think makes this feel more like a Ray film than anything else is that though the female protagonist at the film's center played by a miscast Susan Hayward or rather the males' feelings about her are the catalyst for the plot the principal relationship in the film is between Robert Mitchum as a retired rodeo celebrity and Arthur Kennedy as the man who idolizes him. At certain times the love triangle at the film's center shifts perspective and Hayward is replaced at the apex by one or another of the men. It doesn't feel homoerotic to me rather the film does a pretty good job of realizing a complex male relationship equal parts admiration and jealousy. This male relationship also feels distinctly like a product of and response to the postWWII generation full of men who had bonded with other men in life and death situations and then were asked to settle down into the boring tedium of family life. Hayward isn't remotely convincing as a simple country girl who wants nothing more than a ranch and a man but both Kennedy and especially Mitchum give very good performances.

	schema:reviewBody "One thing was very clear to me as I was watching this movie. It was extremely difficult to try and imagine Miss Susan Hayward living in a trailer traveling around with husband Arthur Kennedy and his best pal Robert Mitchum and in constant fear that her husband will be injured while riding the bull. Throughout Susan establishes friendships with the other women following their own husbands around another interesting aspect because normally in her movies Ms. Hayward was more the rival to other women than friendly with them. Of course with Robert Mitchum topbilled over Susan's onscreen husband there's bound to be chemistry between them even though Susie really can't stand Robert's character. But the lust in the title isn't just for the men risking being gored it's also for the frustrated women and while Arthur Kennedy may not seem the most sensual of love interests for someone as heated as Hayward their marriage isn't shaken by Mitchum's presence.While this has more of an interest perhaps for the male fans of rodeos it will stir up controversy as a part of America's past that today animal rights activists look on with in disdain. Yes the whole point of man risking life and limb by riding the hottempered bull simply to win a large monetary prize or the even more controversial calf roping not seen here seems somewhat ridiculous when compared with other sporting events and the idea of it as entertainment for the masses is also bewildering when compared to other distractions. So while this might not be for all tastes it gets by merely on the casting and the unconventional relationship of the leading man and leading lady. Some interesting supporting players particularly Arthur Hunnicutt round out or round up the cast to offer the little details to make it better than it would have been without them.

	onyx:emotionText "One thing was very clear to me as I was watching this movie. It was extremely difficult to try and imagine Miss Susan Hayward living in a trailer traveling around with husband Arthur Kennedy and his best pal Robert Mitchum and in constant fear that her husband will be injured while riding the bull. Throughout Susan establishes friendships with the other women following their own husbands around another interesting aspect because normally in her movies Ms. Hayward was more the rival to other women than friendly with them. Of course with Robert Mitchum topbilled over Susan's onscreen husband there's bound to be chemistry between them even though Susie really can't stand Robert's character. But the lust in the title isn't just for the men risking being gored it's also for the frustrated women and while Arthur Kennedy may not seem the most sensual of love interests for someone as heated as Hayward their marriage isn't shaken by Mitchum's presence.While this has more of an interest perhaps for the male fans of rodeos it will stir up controversy as a part of America's past that today animal rights activists look on with in disdain.

There are these dolls strange looking ones that move by themselves. One with a knife a top's head pinhead and a cowboy with six arms. I assumed that they were evil but they only seemed to kill humans that seemingly deserved to die. Two sheriffs and a bully were the victims. The most evil of the beings turns out to be Dr. Magrew who is turning an innocent man named Tank into some puppet. Jane Magrew is also innocent and for some reason loves the Pinhead doll. This doll loves her more than the human Tank whom she falls in love with. A very strange ending as Tank's anger gets the best of him with Dr. Magrew receiving his wrath. Poor Jane just survives but with many questions to answer with all the dead bodies laying around her house. If you like strange then this film is for you.".

You got this wacked out scientist who got hold of Toulon's puppets and who obligingly let him know they're alive and willing to help him.  Why they're willing to initially kill for him isn't clear.George Peck's offkey performance is another problem  he acts like a thirtyyear old in bad aging makeup.  Maybe he is 6070 like he is supposed to be but he looks and acts really odd.  And why does he have a 25 year old daughter?!?There are very few people to like here which also hurts.  The romantic leads are vaguely sympathetic but the scientist the obnoxious town sheriff the local town bully etc. are all very unlikeable making them slaughterfodder.The worst problem though is the end.  The movie just...stops.  run credits!  Whaaatt?  Who knows.  Catch the sequel 7 when it comes out I guess.The uninteresting human characters mean that the puppets have to hold center stage.  They're pretty much relegated to the odd gory slaughter or two though.  Even they seem somewhat confused as to what their motives are here. Jester and Leech Woman are relegated to the background as always Blaze is missing despite as noted his appearance in the opening credits and the only new puppet we get is the new TVTank puppet which appears for about 30 seconds at the end of the movie.Definitely the weakest entry in the Puppet Master series.  Even at the worse of time the others in the series have had something to contribute.  But Curse... just hangs there with nothing to support it or recommend it.".

I found David DeCoteau's sequel somewhat a stepdown in quality which at times looked very secondrate but probably a little more enjoyable if a tad creative in its story despite a silly script unintentionally humorous plotting and an abrupt ending. While still being one of the weakest it skipped that childish feel of the recent ventures to only deliver on the nasty and gory quota with its nightmarish details resembling the tone of the original features but while the jolts and cruelty is there it seemed to meander on its characters interactions and the constant mystery surrounding a disappearance which is rather predictable to figure out. The puppets have always been the stars and that's nothing new here as the creations are wellused despite some obvious stock footage from other features. The uncanny appearances and personalities come through although some are underused The Jester and especially Leech woman. However there are plenty of images of the puppets cementing how they are best of pals. DeCoteau's practical direction is raw and threadbare but there's a lyrical guidance that shows in some atmospheric visuals. Most of the performances are particularly lousy and overenthusiastic but Emily Harrison seems to be an exception to the trend.".

And what bothered me the most was two things one was why was their a doll under that girl it was a useless scene that needed to be deleted.

And why was this movie rated R because only one person did in a not so bloody way and not so much cursing in this movie. And what bothered me the most was two things one was why was their a doll under that girl it was a useless scene that needed to be deleted. And why was that old guy trying to get his worker in a toy up to know I don't understand both of those things. Al I'm saying is don't make more Puppet Master movies because after part 4 if was boring stupid and pointless.";

Sadly where this is done it is VERY noticeable and it does ruin the immersion in the story.With that said it is far from a terrible film but has marked a new direction which has upset long standing fans... My guess is they could not get a good enough script for a true Sequel or the cast were not willing to come back after Puppet Master V.Either way this is a new story arc in itself.A doctor has now taken possession of Andre Toulon's puppets and seeks to recreate the work that his predecessor had done but the opening scenes suggest all is not well.While the change of story arc is unwelcome If you wanted to fit this movie in Chronologically it would appear somewhere early on as Leech is still alive... the overall quality is good and the acting is actually better than some of the rest.Joss Green who pays 'Tank' is brilliant in his role which makes it surprising that he has not had more roles overall  He has the potential for great things...

I'm not even going to go through what the movie is about as other reviewers have already explained it. So much more could have been done with this series.

One of the better features here is the fact that there's a return to the original puppets after introducing either new ones or different designs for the classics. This is something to appreciate and it gives the film a more natural slot with the rest of the series pitted back with its familiar assortment of puppets who get to engage in their familiar antics. The stronger rating definitely comes into play here making it much more graphic and violent by really letting loose at times with some solid action scenes throughout. The initial scenes of them conducting their revenge during a raging thunderstorm as they sneak around makes for a solid Gothic setpiece before unleashing the nice gore the revenge section at the end which is justified due to the murders in the museum and comes off as wholly satisfying considering. Likewise there's also the fun to be had of the storyline about his slowly bring corrupted towards becoming a puppet from the rather freaky dreams of him slowly being turned into a human puppet with the broken wooden legs or the chest cavity made of clock parts that goes handinhand with the revelation to be found in the second half. Coupled with the great puppet work here this one wasn't as bad as it easily could've been. There are a few problems with this one that does manage to keep it down. The main issue is the fact that their relationship with the dolls being in their possession makes no sense as this one has no scene of the elder passing on the secrets to the next generation or even give any knowledge they know how the dolls came to life to begin with. There's more emphasis on getting the structure right meaning that it has more significance than the formula which brings them to life a stark contrast from the others and something that should've been addressed. There's also how easily the newcomer takes to the revelation that they're alive merely acknowledging it and then dismissing it getting to the main crux of the story easier but also pointing out the flaw in the pacing. As is usual the short time means that it plays cruel tricks on the pacing as the police investigations with the friends the first dinnertime meal and the scene in the postal office go on for too long to beat a simple idea to death but there's the ending which just comes out of nowhere and then it's over when it should've been stretched out a little more. These here hold the film down.Rated R Graphic Violence and Language.".

I would use a different comparison with 6 Curse is like the first 30 seconds of a roller coaster it climbs and climbs up to the top then plummets to disaster terrifyingly quickly.This film saddens me because it could have been the best in the series. All of the actors are good in their roles and a visible amount of effort was put into the scriptwork. For the first 50 minutes of this 80minutelong movie you think that this film is going to be a step up for Full Moon. Then with the first murder in the picture you see the tragedy as it strikes. This is because terribly enoughthe worst element of this puppets' escapade is the puppets themselves!I don't know what Full Moon was thinking for the first 50 minutes of the film the puppets are mostly stock footage from previous films. Lazy to be sure but it soon becomes clear that this is better than the alternative when we are forced to see new footage of the puppets we are shown renditions that look like Barbie dolls being worked by hand. The walking sequences which are supposed to involve shoulder movement and something betraying life are the worst no effort was put into making our puppets look alive. What's worse there are actual technical lapses in which the rods by which the puppets are barely moved are not just visible but take center stage! Who was responsible for this rape of our oncebeloved puppets?!I won't complain anymore at least not in front of you. It just saddens me how far the puppets manage to sink their own movie here just by being there. If they had been better made this could have been the best entry in the Puppet Master franchise. But they're not and because of it this is perhaps the worst film yet in the series. Cursed indeed.".

All simply exude youthful animal magnetism and appeal.The violence is typical of a tragedy of this period with subjects like incest blasphemy obsession and revenge. Suffice it to say the 17th Century was not a time when such things were taken lightly! But there are many moments of great poetry as well. Allegory and symbolism abound and as Oliver Tobias a major British sex symbol never looked so extraordinary Maestro Griffi unabashedly exploits the actor's resemblance to a suffering Christ throughout his gorgeous breathtaking film.".

Based on the play by Shakespeare's contemporary John Ford it manages to work as an engrossing historical drama and captivate as a passionate albeit unconventional romance while still being sensationalistic enough to entertain any fan of AIPstyle Seventies sleaze. The central relationship between Charlotte Rampling 'The Damned' 'Zardoz' 'Angel Heart' and long forgotten 70s sex symbol Oliver Tobias who I grew up watching on several UK TV shows popular at the time but now too obscure to bother listing is incestuous and the movie ends up with a surprisingly bloody climax that will please splatter buffs. Like the recent controversial adaption of 'Titus' it reminds the modern viewer that sex violence and extreme imagery are are nothing new and have long been the subject of great literature. Or if you prefer socalled great literature 'Tis Pity She's A Whore' is one of the great lost European movies of the early Seventies and deserves a much larger audience. Knowing nothing about it before viewing and not being familiar with the original text I expected it to be a lighweight erotic romp worth a giggle or two but was very impressed at just how powerful a movie experience it was.

	schema:reviewBody "Well I have to say that 'Tis a Pity She's a Whore wasn't exactly what I was expecting. Given the title and the fact that it was made in Italy during the 1970's I was expecting something a lot more sleazy and bloody than this! The film is based on a stage play by John Ford and this is always obvious as it's all very stagy and the focus seems to be on the performances. This might be a good thing if you were going into the film looking for something 'great'  but I just wanted sleaze! The plot line however is about as sleazy as it gets and puts most of its focus on the sick idea of incest. There's a bit of the standard 'arranged marriage' theme thrown in for good measure and the plot focuses on Annabella a woman who marries Soranzo after it was decided she would. However this isn't good news for her brother  a man named Giovanni as he's also in love with Annabella and has managed to get her pregnant despite the fact that she's his sister.The plot is actually rather good in that the central theme is interesting. It's the way that its portrayed that was the problem for me however as the plot pace isn't very exciting and it seems to take an eternity to get to the point. There's a fair amount of sex in the movie but it isn't very graphic so fans of the rough stuff are likely to be disappointed. One of my main reasons for seeing this film was because of the fact that it stars Charlotte Rampling. She might not be as beautiful as some of the other women making trash films around the same time e.g. Edwige Fenech Rosalba Neri Barbara Bouchet but Rampling is a classy lady who doesn't seem to mind starring in unsavoury movies which is OK with me. She is joined by Fabio Testi and Oliver Tobias who apparently was some sort of sex symbol around the time. The film does get more interesting towards the end when the story opens up and we finally get to see some blood. I'm not saying this is an overall bad film  but the story and the way it's portrayed didn't work very well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Named as one of IGN's 25 greatest Batman stories of all time and one of the books that any Batman fan would swear by Frank Miller's 1987 classic Batman Year One finally comes to life as a full length animated movie. Besides inspiring elements in various Batman animated shows since the 1990s Batman Year One is also the main inspiration for the blockbuster hit Batman Begins. So with its influence seen in all incarnations of Batman in the last 15 years the producers are hard pressed to come up with anything original. So instead of just retelling Batman's origins drawing influence from Batman Year One the creative team decided to stick as close as possible to the source material and literally transfer the book into animated form.To date Batman Year One is easily the movie that is most faithful to its source material. Barring a few lines tweaked to flow more naturally in dialogue the script is almost exactly the same as in the book. Whole scenes are reproduced shot for shot as if the comic panels themselves came to life. One could literally watch this movie and read the comic side by side. Sadly the plot itself is weaker than what one would expect mostly due to the limitations of the audiovisual media.Batman Year One contains two parallel tales. One follows Bruce Wayne a millionaire playboy with a tragic past who returns to Gotham City after many years. The other follows Lieutenant Jim Gordon a cop transferred to Gotham Police Department. Crime and corruption run rampant through the city driving both Gordon and Wayne to bring justice to this lawless town through their own means. Initially they are powerless against against a world of vice and sin a world that does not want their help and would instead seek to crush their bodies and spirits. But both men soldier on in their quest. Wayne decides to become a masked vigilante striking from the shadows against those that the authorities are powerless to touch. Meanwhile Gordon knee deep among crooked Cops struggles to expose the corrupted powers that be.When it first debuted in 1987 Batman Year One was meant to be a realistic reinterpretation of Batman's origins. No fancy gadgets no Batmobile no crazy freaks. Batman does not befriend the police and is in fact wanted as a criminal at one point. Those expecting long drawn out Batman brawls might be disappointed by the lack of appearances by Batman. Remember the story is less about the icon and more about the man behind the mask. Also the voice cast is possibly one of the weaker ones from DC animation. None of the performances really stand out especially Benjamin McKenzie's Batman who seems to be doing a bad Christian Bale impression.In true comic book fashion the story is the very definition of brevity. Despite running barely over 60 minutes the movie does a wonderful job of getting to the point of how both Wayne and Gordon struggle to keep their beliefs in a world devoid of morality. The power of a comic's visuals in telling a story without words is reflected very well in the animation. Scenes are loaded with impact and potential interpretations. Sadly in an animated medium one cannot mull over a page or let the imagination set to fully appreciate a scene's impact. Perhaps some would feel that the movie is too to the point giving the audience the story instead of letting it play out over time.On the flip side what the animated medium takes full advantage of is bringing motion to static artwork. The animation by Korean studio Moi Animation is so smooth and seamless a standard usually only seen in big budget theatrical feature films along the lines of Rebuild of Evangelion and Sky Crawlers. The fight scenes are definitely the highlight of the movie. Fully animated without a single cost saving short cut it is almost like live action combat sequences out of a blockbuster. The art is no pushover either. It is David Mazzucchelli's original comic designs and characters combined with an Asian anime flaire and aesthetics. This means small tweaks like giving characters more expressive eyes sharper features and a less murky color palette. Purists would cry foul at the tweaks but they never detract from the original artwork's feel it is still dark gritty and atmospheric as ever.Being incredibly faithful to the source material means that one need not be familiar with the graphic novel to appreciate this show. If anything this film allows those who would normally be averse to reading a comic book appreciate a timeless tale integral to Batman lore. It is the same book just a different way of reading it.".

I am a fan of all the previous incarnations even The Batman with its highly stylized and simple plots that wrap themselves up in 22 minutes. In Detective Comics 27 the very first frame of the story of Batman has Gordon and Bruce sitting together talking. Gordon is an often overlooked character usually bland and boring. This goround Gordon is front and center possibly more than BruceBatman. This is more his story and it's about time it was told with so much love and devotion. Frank Miller is the first person to take Batman back to his roots. Batman was a killer in the beginning. He was no campy Batman with a Boy Wonder sidekick. This film is faithful to Miller's vision of our beloved Detective. He is untested and vulnerable. He is theatrical and vicious. He may not save you because he is not all powerful. The only complaint I have is the origin story of Selena Kyle and her G.I. Jane haircut. Selena was not sexy at all and her character was sorely out of place. She served absolutely no purpose in this film to advance the plot. She was bratty and selfabsorbed which is very Selena like but SPOILER ALERT she may or may not have been a prostitute. If gives no back story to her other than showing up out of nowhere to kick a disguised Bruce Wayne's butt when he confronts her pimp. Then for no apparent reason she later kicks the pimp's butt herself and becomes a cat burglar. Because of this side story I cannot give this my highest rating. If this was a television show I might let it slide to give it more time to develop her character. However there was precious little screen time in this hour long film and she deserved not one minute of it. Overall this outing was very well done. If you're looking for Holy rusted metal Batman then you're in for a disappointment. This is a dark story and Gotham needs a hero. Lucky for Gothamites it gets two.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is great brilliant realistic dark gritty and veryvery emotional Batman adaptation. Forget Mask of the Phantasm Return of the Joker or Under the Red Hood. They are great of course but Year one is in a completely different league than those. This is not something what you can see on Cartoon Network. It is clearly not for kids not at all. It is a serious story with real people with real and logical choices Finally Batman is realistic as a person and as a hero he is not over the top he uses his batarang the way he should. He is not god like...this was a big problem many times in the comics and also in the animated features too at many areas. He can be shot beaten and also he can't beat the crap out from 34 people easily just because he is Batman. He is a believable person here who can really exist out there in the real world.. If you know the original comics than you won't be disappointed with this. This is how Batman should be. Also Year one is more of Jim Gordon's story and it also works great. Brilliant just brilliant.1010".

They are great of course but Year one is in a completely different league than those. This is not something what you can see on Cartoon Network. It is clearly not for kids not at all. It is a serious story with real people with real and logical choices Finally Batman is realistic as a person and as a hero he is not over the top he uses his batarang the way he should.

And what an atmosphere it is too for me the best Batman adaptationsBatman The Animated Series Mask of the Phantasm 1989 Batman and Under the Red Hood have a suitably gritty tone which is what the movie does have.Batman Year One's dialogue is sharp intelligent and edgy and generally apart from the rushed subplot of Selina Kylea longer length in general might've helped the story is clever and compelling. Mostly the characters are very well written with special mention going to Gordon a character that could be bland but here he is very interesting.Voice acting is strong. Bryan Cranston is especially outstanding. Ben McKenzie is generally good and emotive if in need of more charisma in places. All in all excellent Batman movie. 8.510 Bethany Cox".

Batman and police official Lieutenant James 'Jim' Gordon.When I heard Jim Gordon was going to be one of the protagonists I had my reservations. I should have known better. This movie did not disappoint. In fact it was far the opposite.The plot follows both characters with their respective stories Bruce Wayne boy billionaire returns to Gotham City after being absent for many years following his parent's murder.

His transformation into the dark avenging angel Batman is the crux of the plot.Running parallel Jim Gordon is a honourable police officer joining a corrupt authority in Gotham City's Police Department.

The first sighting of Batman revealed his character defining raison d'etre  his upkeep of justice as opposed to vengeance and his preservation of human life over killing He knocks a man off a balcony but holds onto his leg. The expression of this point emerged from the beating he receives from two other thugs as he maintains his grip of the criminal who could die if he lets go.Jim Gordon's most challenging moment was his perseverance in the police force following a remorseless physical attack from his work colleagues. The professionalism of the directors and producers was shown through their selection in voice actor Ben McKenzie for Batman. The dialogue inner monologues and delivery portrayed a young Batman just commencing his crusade on crime and it worked. The film is definitely worth watching if you are a Batman fan but I would never recommend this as a general crowd pleaser. Animations are often seen as childish cartoons and understandably they are shunned by adult audiences. If Batman is perceived as a kid's passion then consider me a big child because I cannot ever imagine disliking this character nor ignoring any of the films be it live action or animation. Nevertheless if you do like 'the dark knight' then add this to the hitlist.".

	schema:headline " A Mature Batman for a Matured Audience";
	schema:reviewBody "A few things off the bat... I'm a fan of DC comics Animation since TAS and Mask of The Phantasm. For the most part they have done a great job delivering exciting stories. Also I have NOT read the Frank Miller 'Batman Year One' 4 issue comic from which this was adapted from.So here's my 2 cents... Animation Sharp. Minimal use of soft focus than in previous features which is an improvement. Very little 'shakey cam' shots as used in previous films to create the illusion of action. Action and scenes are set up as you would expect in a well done live action film.Voice Work Kudos to the casting team. All voices sound top notch without sounding as if they're actors reading off a script in a sound booth. They genuinely sound invested in the scene and it shows. Minor complaints on Bruce's voice but you get used to it.MusicSound Fantastic. Dark and atmospheric. Slowly plays tension through out the film. Until now I had yet to hear a composition on one of these films that matches the talent of Shirley Walker who composed for Batman TAS in the 90's. The surround sound in this feature is put to full use more so than other animated DC films. Again your getting feature film effortquality here.Story Here's where I've read many complaints. This was definitely dark and different. Bear in mind I have never read the comic but from what I hear this is a faithful adaptation of those 4 issues. The story chronicles both Batman and Gordon's first year fighting in Gotham. How their relationship evolves and the decadence of Gotham is explored in detail. Don't expect a rosy colored Batman cartoon. This is a mature and dark story that happens to be told in animation. Conclusion Those of us that grew up as children watching Batman TAS who are now adults. Many of us have admired how lately Batman's character has been presented in such mature forms as in Nolan's Dark Knight or Rock Steady's Arkham AsylumCity. This is why 'Batman Year One' stands out above the rest in terms of animated films. In part due to the excellent source material but equally in it's presentation in this particular medium. Batman Year One is the wonderful product of more than 20 years of animated excellence. Definitely a must have.".

REAL fans would know that Barbara 'Batgirl' Gordon is NOT Jim Gordons daughter but is the daughter of Gordon's brother Roger and Roger's wife Thelma. When her parents died James and Barbara his WIFE adopted Babs junior. When Jim broke up with his wife years later he took custody of Babs junior while his wife moved back to Chicago with James junior.As for him having an affair with a fellow cop AGAIN IT HAPPENED IN THE COMICS!!! He even gets married to Sarah Essen years later when she returns to Gotham. Batman doesn't respect Gordon because he's a paragon of virtue. He respects Gordon because he's an honest cop one of the few left in the cesspool that is Gotham and be counted on to do the right thing in the end. But then you'd know that IF YOU WATCHED THE MOVIE!!! IMDb isn't really the place for a lesson in Batman history I'll agree. HOWEVER when so called Batman fans who haven't the SLIGHTEST idea about the characters history use that ignorance to slate an extremely good adaptation of a cult classic then I think it's validated.I enjoyed the pace  tone of movie of the movie tremendously the only let down for me was Ben McKenzie's voice as BatmanBruce. Sure we all know that Kevin Conroy is pretty much considered God when venturing into this territory but I also loved the approach that both Bruce Greenwood  Jeremy Sisto took respectively in Batman Under the Red Hood  Justice League The New Frontier. Mckenzie lacked charisma in the role and I never felt the air of menace that I want from Batman.I was struck time and time again how faithfully various panels were reproduced in the film but without ever feeling forced. I never felt that I was watching an animated comic it serves as a movie in it's own right.Can't wait for Batman The Dark Knight Returns although I REALLY can't imagine what posters who have never read that book either will make of what they to to Batman in there!".

Essen and Miller added that he is a special forces veteran who is capable in handtohand combat thus explaining his fighting ability. As far as Gordon hunting Batman had this person actually watched the whole movie they would have seen the shift between Gordon hunting Batman to the traditional GordonBatman relationship...Excellent job from WB and as long as Bruce Timm Alan Burnett  crew have their fingers in the mix Batman will continue to be amazing. If you are a fan of Batman there is no reason not to love this movie and if you enjoyed Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins guess what it was basically based on Frank Miller's Batman Year One Nolan was reported to always have a copy of the graphic novel with him on set. Having thoroughly enjoyed the graphic novel and Nolan's film I can easily say they felt the same which is very much a good thing...Everyone should buy this DVD so hopefully WB will continue to put these films out. I for one would love to see someone pick these up as some sort of series a new movie every couple months Batman Year Two and so on I think it would be really awesome to see the progression of all the characters and the emergence of all the villains.Also check out Batman Under the Red Hood another amazing animated movie from WB Bruce Timm Alan Burnett  crew".

Sure the plot maybe a bit slow but the story is really good. The movie focuses in on two primary characters which is Bruce Wayne and Jim Gordon. Although the movie seems to focus more on Jim Gordon and his subconscious more than Bruce Wayne. It doesn't take away anything from this movie. Because I thought it was cool to delve more into the persona of Jim Gordon and where he comes from. Some people maybe against him being portrayed as this masculine though guy. But I thought it was refreshing to see him as this badass lieutenant. The animation for the most part is fluid and I just really liked the more dark and gritty atmosphere in this which has more of an adult theme going for it. Although the action sequences are well done that isn't the driving force of this movie. What drives this movie is the intricate and the direction of the two main characters and how it develops. Even the music score fit right into the environment and it actually does stand out. 8.210".

	schema:headline " Influential Batman Story is Faithful to Its Source Material";
	schema:reviewBody "Snapshot Batman Year One is one of the most influential comic book stories of all time. The directtoDVD adaptation is very faithful to the source material with excellent production values. It is well worth watching.Spoilers ahead!Batman Year One could easily be called James Gordon Year One for it is Lt. Gordon's Bryan Cranston character that provides the overriding through story Cranston even gets top billing. A worldweary Gordon arrives in Gotham City from his previous assignment as punishment for breaking the unwritten code of the policemen's brotherhood he turned in a cop on the take. What he finds in Gotham is a force that is corrupt all the way to the top. Commissioner Loeb Jon Polito is firmly in the pocket of mob boss Carmine Falcone Alex Rocco and Gordon's new partner Detective Flass Fred Tatasciore is not only corrupt but is also a violent sociopath who will do anything to intimidate crooks or Gordon himself for that matter. Meanwhile Gordon's home life is rocked when he has an affair with Detective Sarah Essen Katee Sackhoff while his wife Barbara Grey DeLisle is pregnant with their first child.And then a crazy man in a bat costume begins taking out bad guys.Bruce Wayne Ben McKenzie has returned from twelve years of mental and physical training to avenge the death of his parents at the hands of criminal scum. He finds it's not so easy and is almost killed on his first night out in a simple disguise. But a bat flying into his mansion quickly inspires him and Batman is born. At first wary of each other but ultimately realizing they are the only two morally true protectors of Gotham City Gordon and Batman begin to make a dent in the corrupt police force and the mob that controls them.In a brief appearance not very instrumental to the plot prostitute Selina Kyle Eliza Dushku decides to emulate the mysterious batman who in her mind has some kindred fetishes and literally becomes a Catwoman burglar. The directors made a deliberate decision to remain very faithful to the graphic novel making it appealing to the fans who expect a lot from one of their favorite stories. The script hones very closely to Miller's terse original. The animation keeps the spirit of the original art wonderfully carrying the action. It has an anime flow added to it from the Korean studio MOI Animation that did the production. The ugliness of the city and its inhabitants comes through in gritty detail. The city becomes a character in itself creating claustrophobia that closes in on Gordon and Batman. The voice talent especially Cranston as Gordon do a wonderful job conveying the tone of the story. The only small exception is McKenzie's Batman. I understand they wanted a younger less confident sounding voice but when we are so used to Kevin Conroy it's hard to switch. And it's not like Conroy didn't do a terrific younger version in Batman Gotham Knight 2008. But as Batman gains confidence through the course of his first year so does McKenzie's voice gain strength.Batman Year One is a nice complement to Batman Begins 2005 which took many of its elements from Miller's scenario. Batman Begins focused more on Bruce Wayne's training while Year One focuses more on Batman's indoctrination into the world of crime fighting. Be advised that Batman Year One is not watered down. The sexual situations dialog and violence are not for children! Batman Year One is a welldone tribute to one of the greatest Batman comics of all time the story of crimefighting badass James Gordon and his partner the man in the bat suit.".

	schema:reviewBody "Batman Year One is a directtovideo animated film adapted from the graphic novel written by Frank Miller and illustrated by David Mazzucchelli with Richmond Lewis. The animated version of Batman Year One is entirely faithful to Frank Miller's original comic book story to the point that differences are almost negligible. Only two minor scenes are missing and nothing is depicted out of order from the original. Some scenes are shortened and some are lengthened for the needs of telling a story on film but everything that happens in the comic happens in the movie. A few minor scenes are also added. Be aware that this is not really a movie for children  some sexual situations and violence from the original comic book also appear here.It is not expressed explicitly during the film but it is likely that this film is set in the 19861987 which was the time when the comic was published. The story follows the first year of Bruce Wayne's time as Batman. This is pretty much an origins story . The focus is very much on the parallel fates of Gordon and Wayne and the roots of their working relationship.This is a dark  gritty and realistic vision of Batman. There are no costumed villains here which many will find disappointing. Both Gordon and Batman have to fight against the mob and corrupted police. This is actually more of a Jim Gordon's story . His moral dilemmas feels real and overall it's very easy to care for him. On the other side the movie kinda fails to bring the same emotional connection for Bruce Wayne. I did cared for WayneBatman  but his emotional pain seems flat compared to the problems that Gordon is having.This plot gives the film an accessible and realistic feel. Gotham city looks ordinary and there are no super gadgets here. Batman makes mistakes and he can be hurt very easily. There are some bad things here. Some of the important lines of dialogue were cut  the ones which explained main characters motivations . The final sequence with some supernatural free running is kinda cheesy . The biggest problem here is however the subplot with Selina Kyle . The movie just like the original graphic novel doesn't really do anything with her. The subplot of her becoming Catwoman feels rushed. She really adds nothing film to advance the plot.Bryan Cranston as detective James Gordon is simply great. There is a lot of subtle emotions hidden in the words he says. I admit that I was disappointed with Ben McKenzie's voice over as BatmanBruce Wayne. His performance felt wooden and uninspired for me. The supporting cast is solid  especially Eliza Dushku as Selina KyleCatwoman  Katee Sackhoff as Sarah Essen and Fred Tatasciore as the corrupt Flass.Overall  this is a solid and enjoyable movie that works as a tribute to one of the best graphic novels made. There are a few scenes and ideas that appear in Batman Year One that also appear in Christopher Nolan's great Batman Begins which was inspired heavily by BYO. If you liked Nolan's take on Batman  you should like this one too. I give it 710.".

	schema:headline " Batman Year One mostly faithful but without any its soul";
	schema:reviewBody "At San Diego ComicCon 2011 Warner Bros held the world premiere for their new animated telling of Batman Year One. Unfortunately after the end of the film I was disappointed enough that I walked out on the panel with the major voice cast and directors.The story is faithful to the comic to the point where they could have used a little rewriting for fresh air. A few spots felt too anchored to the original page dialog in a comic explaining an emotion or a type of action doesn't need to be taken literally for a movie. Being too faithful has the film feel like it's lacking any soul or spirit it's just flatly reading lines lacking inspiration simply flipping through pages of the comic to get itself back on track. That is a complaint I had with Zack Snyder's Watchmen as well just a sense of lifelessness being stuck on the page treating the original material as cinematic gospel rather than being properly inspired by it. Unlike Watchmen Year One is a short runtime of an hour while it doesn't feel rushed there are a few elements that could have spent a little more time on most notably Bruce Wayne building up the Batman persona.Another issue I have with Year One is the art. The style is inspired by Batman The Animated Series' simplicity but not its bold styling which feels confused  it's not terrible but it's not quite anything either. Batman in costume looks pretty decent but Bruce Wayne's character art is like a classic animated Bruce Wayne in his late 30s it's a tad distracting when he's voiced as a young man and other characters talk about him that way but he looks far more mature. That's perhaps subjective but the movie's art fails in a second way that's less so the use of CGI for vehicles  it's abominable utterly terrible at every glimpse. The drawn artwork is left unsupported by cheaplooking CGI vehicles that move in an entirely robotic and stilted manner. It seems worse than any CGI cartoon TV show from the last 20 years and every time a car or helicopter is on screen it's a significant distraction.A smaller flaw in the film is the one big change to the climax of the story. This is the only SPOILER in my review but it's part of the film's final act In order to get Gordon more involved than the original they have changed the events so that Gordon now shoots an unarmed seeminglyuninvolved motorcyclist and takes his bike to chase after the kidnapper  Gordon shooting a bystander is insanity well outside of character turning him essentially into a murderer whether or not that motorcyclerider turns out to be secretly wearing armor and eventually gets back up. That chainreacts into a second problematic change for the climax Bruce Wayne now no longer has a vehicle to chase the kidnappers so he takes to the rooftops without gadgets or costume or even his motorcycle helmet leaping around like a cheesy cartoon. That comes after an hour of being a grounded fairly realistic guy  could you imagine the Batman of the Christopher Nolan movies doing that stuff? No and this story up until the end had played it pretty much the same realistic manner yet out of the blue Bruce Wayne becomes a superpowered cartoon character.My final issue is that the voice acting simply does not hold up. Bryan Cranston as Gordon is the center of the movie he's not a terrible choice but there's a natural lightness to his reading which doesn't always quite match the depth of what's called for. BatmanBruce Wayne himself is a big problem voiced by The OC's Ben McKenzie  Ben has a younger voice without a lot of weight or darkness behind it so he's directed to try to put on that Batman sound it doesn't work. He's not experienced with voice acting either and the combination of those two issues ends up really holding the character back  considering he's the titular character there should be something believable to the performance yet McKenzie often struggles with overpronunciation of his lines and keeps a light brooding going nearly all the time. And Alfred I'm sorry I just cannot get behind such a sleepy disconnected performance  it's a small part in this tale but I found it very distracting after so many years of great screen Alfreds from the Nolan films through The Animated Series and going back to the 1960s TV show only to have... this throwaway work.What does work James Gordon being a rounded character it still plays well Gordon seems quite adept at carrying these things.Katee Sackoff brings some fairly convincing voice acting for her character I've never really entirely been sold on ol' Starbuck there but she was the lone bright spot that felt like a natural performance.The movie is a period piece set in the 1980s which is an excellent choice the story exists in a specific era and this movie plays to those strengths no cellphones or modern conveniences to muck things up.

	onyx:emotionText "At San Diego ComicCon 2011 Warner Bros held the world premiere for their new animated telling of Batman Year One. Unfortunately after the end of the film I was disappointed enough that I walked out on the panel with the major voice cast and directors.The story is faithful to the comic to the point where they could have used a little rewriting for fresh air. A few spots felt too anchored to the original page dialog in a comic explaining an emotion or a type of action doesn't need to be taken literally for a movie. Being too faithful has the film feel like it's lacking any soul or spirit it's just flatly reading lines lacking inspiration simply flipping through pages of the comic to get itself back on track. That is a complaint I had with Zack Snyder's Watchmen as well just a sense of lifelessness being stuck on the page treating the original material as cinematic gospel rather than being properly inspired by it. Unlike Watchmen Year One is a short runtime of an hour while it doesn't feel rushed there are a few elements that could have spent a little more time on most notably Bruce Wayne building up the Batman persona.Another issue I have with Year One is the art. The style is inspired by Batman The Animated Series' simplicity but not its bold styling which feels confused  it's not terrible but it's not quite anything either. Batman in costume looks pretty decent but Bruce Wayne's character art is like a classic animated Bruce Wayne in his late 30s it's a tad distracting when he's voiced as a young man and other characters talk about him that way but he looks far more mature. That's perhaps subjective but the movie's art fails in a second way that's less so the use of CGI for vehicles  it's abominable utterly terrible at every glimpse. The drawn artwork is left unsupported by cheaplooking CGI vehicles that move in an entirely robotic and stilted manner. It seems worse than any CGI cartoon TV show from the last 20 years and every time a car or helicopter is on screen it's a significant distraction.A smaller flaw in the film is the one big change to the climax of the story. This is the only SPOILER in my review but it's part of the film's final act In order to get Gordon more involved than the original they have changed the events so that Gordon now shoots an unarmed seeminglyuninvolved motorcyclist and takes his bike to chase after the kidnapper  Gordon shooting a bystander is insanity well outside of character turning him essentially into a murderer whether or not that motorcyclerider turns out to be secretly wearing armor and eventually gets back up. That chainreacts into a second problematic change for the climax Bruce Wayne now no longer has a vehicle to chase the kidnappers so he takes to the rooftops without gadgets or costume or even his motorcycle helmet leaping around like a cheesy cartoon. That comes after an hour of being a grounded fairly realistic guy  could you imagine the Batman of the Christopher Nolan movies doing that stuff? No and this story up until the end had played it pretty much the same realistic manner yet out of the blue Bruce Wayne becomes a superpowered cartoon character.My final issue is that the voice acting simply does not hold up. Bryan Cranston as Gordon is the center of the movie he's not a terrible choice but there's a natural lightness to his reading which doesn't always quite match the depth of what's called for. BatmanBruce Wayne himself is a big problem voiced by The OC's Ben McKenzie  Ben has a younger voice without a lot of weight or darkness behind it so he's directed to try to put on that Batman sound it doesn't work. He's not experienced with voice acting either and the combination of those two issues ends up really holding the character back  considering he's the titular character there should be something believable to the performance yet McKenzie often struggles with overpronunciation of his lines and keeps a light brooding going nearly all the time. And Alfred I'm sorry I just cannot get behind such a sleepy disconnected performance  it's a small part in this tale but I found it very distracting after so many years of great screen Alfreds from the Nolan films through The Animated Series and going back to the 1960s TV show only to have... this throwaway work.What does work James Gordon being a rounded character it still plays well Gordon seems quite adept at carrying these things.Katee Sackoff brings some fairly convincing voice acting for her character I've never really entirely been sold on ol' Starbuck there but she was the lone bright spot that felt like a natural performance.The movie is a period piece set in the 1980s which is an excellent choice the story exists in a specific era and this movie plays to those strengths no cellphones or modern conveniences to muck things up. There are even recognizable '80s cars like the firstgen Mazda RX7.There are a handful of small moments of humor natural to the story which play pretty well in the film like Bruce Wayne's sitdown with Gordon and his wife and Selina Kyle's frustrations with the press.In the end this animated version of Batman Year One just doesn't deliver too well.

	schema:reviewBody "Animated version of the classic Frank MillerDavid Mazzucchelli comic book story about the beginning of Batman's career as a crimefighter and Jim Gordon's career with the Gotham Police Department. It's a pretty faithful adaptation with minimal changes. For the most part I liked it but I did have some problems. For starters the animation is unremarkable. I applaud them for using comic stories as source material because there's a lot of gold to mine there and Hollywood has shown that when screenwriters are left to their own devices they come up with some pretty shitty stuff for these characters. That being said adapting a comic book into a cartoon brings with it the natural comparison of the art styles. Mazzucchelli's artwork is just amazing so you would thinkhope that they would try to add the same level of creativity to the animation. But no it's just your basic DCAU cookie cutter 'house style.' It's disappointing if you admired the art in the comics. Also the voicework is full of face actors not great voice actors. Kevin Conroy and Bob Hastings are missed. Ben McKenzie who does the voice of Bruce Wayne here unimpressively goes on to play Jim Gordon in the similar Gotham TV series. Finally the story seems a bit rushed. The comic story took place over four issues but adapting that into a film you have to take into account the different pacing of the two mediums. The buildup here is kind of limp for such an iconic story. Still the source material is so good that they could only mess it up so much. It's an enjoyable animated movie. Not as great as it should have been but very watchable.".

The main character of Come Come Come Upward Kang Sooyeong who won best actress at the Venice Film Festival for I'm's The Surrogate Woman is expelled from high school after wrongly being accused of having an affair with her teacher and decides to join a nunnery. The head nun has doubts about Kang's sincerity and devotion to the Way and casts her back into the real world after a crazed man becomes obsessed with her and starts to cause ripples in the serenity of temple life. The film eventually breaks off into two trajectories one following another young surer nun of serene countenance as she too is forced by the head nun as a test of devotion to face the evils and temptations of the outside world. One woman is destined to return to the monastery and the other to forever live outside. Elegantly shot as all I'm's films are but underdeveloped on the narrative level as many of I'm's films are Come Upward never achieves the sublime heights of its similarlythemed counterpart in the same year. BodhiDharma tried to convey the experience of Buddhist temple life through images parable and mystery Come Upward is more literal and plainer.".

The movie itself is pretty tame  there's language humor gratuitous and fairly strange sex and violence but it's not marked by extreme gore well there's a questionable part right at the very end that is a little disgusting.One of the best reasons for watching this movie is the cast particularly Paul LeMat as Alex Whitaker.

	schema:headline " An often overlooked 80s classic...";
	schema:reviewBody "Charles Band and his company Full Moon Pictures are often labeled as makers of the worst bmovies in the history of the horror genre however few seem to remember they kept the genre alive and kicking with their inventive and original brand of lowbudget horror during the late 80s and early 90s. Puppet Master was the first and arguably the best example of Full Moon's 90s style a style that included a heavy use of puppetry and stopmotion animation that showed the progression of an idea that he started in his 1987' production Dolls directed by Stuart Gordon.During World War II a secret group of Nazis were sent to Bodega Bay California to capture puppet maker Andre Toulon William Hickey a mysterious old man who had the secret of giving life to inanimate objects. He commits suicide before being caught and so his secret goes with him to the grave. Until nearly 50 years later a group of psychics lead by Alex Whitaker Paul Le Mat are contacted by Neil Gallagher Jimmie F. Skaggs a former colleague who apparently made a big discovery in Bodega Bay before committing suicide under mysterious circumstances.Directed by the tragically underrated David Schmoeller Puppet Master is a very different films that its sequels. Schmoeller plays with the suspense and atmosphere of classic goth films and successfully mixes those elements with the more graphic shock and gore that was the rule for horror films of its time. With a great eye for the visuals Schmoeller makes great use of his Gothic locations and the terrific camerawork enhances the carefully crafted suspense. The special effects wizards create very good looking effects for the budget and together create what could be called a gothic slasher.Schmoeller gives life to Band's story and this mix of fantasy and horror ends up as one of the best screenplays developed at Full Moon. Each puppet has a personality of its own and that is what gives the movie life the human characters are also very welldefined and for the most part wellacted. Despite the silly premise of a killer toy already explored in Child's Play and Dolls Scmoeller and Band make the work and craft setpieces of haunting atmospheres. Richard Band's eerie score perfectly showcase the mix of horror and fantasy of the film and it's probably his most famous work. It quickly became the trademark of the series.As written above the acting is for the most part good for a movie like this and while no one really stands out they all make an efficient job. Paul Le Mat is quite good as the lead character although the rest of the team soon prove to be more interesting characters. Despite his limited screen time William Hickey makes a small but charming job as Toulon and look out for a Barbara Crampton small cameo. As a sidenote it was refreshing to watch a movie where the main characters are middleaged adults instead of young teenagers.The movie's main problem and one that marked the series since its conception is that the puppets quickly became the focus of everything. This lessen the importance not only of the final villain but also of the heroes of the movie. While this problem didn't affect that much this movie it became more notorious as the series started to grow and eventually the puppets would become the main characters of the movies.Puppet Master may not be everyone's cup of tea as its premise and the mix of fantasy with horror may turn off some movie goers. However it is a quality film that proves the talents of both Band and Schmoeller in a film that has become a cultclassic. 810".

	onyx:emotionText "Charles Band and his company Full Moon Pictures are often labeled as makers of the worst bmovies in the history of the horror genre however few seem to remember they kept the genre alive and kicking with their inventive and original brand of lowbudget horror during the late 80s and early 90s. Puppet Master was the first and arguably the best example of Full Moon's 90s style a style that included a heavy use of puppetry and stopmotion animation that showed the progression of an idea that he started in his 1987' production Dolls directed by Stuart Gordon.During World War II a secret group of Nazis were sent to Bodega Bay California to capture puppet maker Andre Toulon William Hickey a mysterious old man who had the secret of giving life to inanimate objects. He commits suicide before being caught and so his secret goes with him to the grave. Until nearly 50 years later a group of psychics lead by Alex Whitaker Paul Le Mat are contacted by Neil Gallagher Jimmie F. Skaggs a former colleague who apparently made a big discovery in Bodega Bay before committing suicide under mysterious circumstances.Directed by the tragically underrated David Schmoeller Puppet Master is a very different films that its sequels. Schmoeller plays with the suspense and atmosphere of classic goth films and successfully mixes those elements with the more graphic shock and gore that was the rule for horror films of its time. With a great eye for the visuals Schmoeller makes great use of his Gothic locations and the terrific camerawork enhances the carefully crafted suspense. The special effects wizards create very good looking effects for the budget and together create what could be called a gothic slasher.Schmoeller gives life to Band's story and this mix of fantasy and horror ends up as one of the best screenplays developed at Full Moon. Each puppet has a personality of its own and that is what gives the movie life the human characters are also very welldefined and for the most part wellacted. Despite the silly premise of a killer toy already explored in Child's Play and Dolls Scmoeller and Band make the work and craft setpieces of haunting atmospheres. Richard Band's eerie score perfectly showcase the mix of horror and fantasy of the film and it's probably his most famous work. It quickly became the trademark of the series.As written above the acting is for the most part good for a movie like this and while no one really stands out they all make an efficient job. Paul Le Mat is quite good as the lead character although the rest of the team soon prove to be more interesting characters. Despite his limited screen time William Hickey makes a small but charming job as Toulon and look out for a Barbara Crampton small cameo. As a sidenote it was refreshing to watch a movie where the main characters are middleaged adults instead of young teenagers.The movie's main problem and one that marked the series since its conception is that the puppets quickly became the focus of everything. This lessen the importance not only of the final villain but also of the heroes of the movie. While this problem didn't affect that much this movie it became more notorious as the series started to grow and eventually the puppets would become the main characters of the movies.Puppet Master may not be everyone's cup of tea as its premise and the mix of fantasy with horror may turn off some movie goers. However it is a quality film that proves the talents of both Band and Schmoeller in a film that has become a cultclassic. 810";

My first thoughts as I inserted the disc was that it'd be a cheesy laughable pile of 80's horror rubbish. So I was in for a pleasant surprise. If you can get past the initial presentation of the movie it feels every bit as lowbudget as it is you'll find it to be creepy intriguing and above all great fun. The puppets themselves could have been a whole lot worse. The effects are hardly Lord Of The Rings but through a strange combination of liveaction and extremely wellanimated stopmotion the puppets don't make you cringe every time they show up on screen. They're probably better actors than some of the live actors even it's difficult to tell who's more wooden. But it's hardly a characterdriven story. It's an unusual story nontheless and it definitely interested me enough to watch it right through  and then pick up the first sequel!If you ever saw the movie Child's Play with which comparisons are inevitable you'll know already whether you can suspend your disbelief enough to enjoy a movie about killer puppets. If you can and don't mind horrific 80's haircuts I'd strongly suggest giving this one a rental you could do a lot worse.".

	schema:reviewBody "Where do I start? Puppet Master is one of those films that if you're a horror fan you hear ripples about all the time. I'd read about it on the Internet and heard about it in countless other places but had never got round to seeing it. I really wish it had stayed that way because this is without a doubt one of the worst films I've ever seen.Now let me first say that I'm not a film snob I enjoy dumb fun as much as the next horror fan. Some of my favourite films include things like Friday the 13th and I recently saw a film called Monster Man a very low budget horrorcomedy which although terrible tickled me in the right places. Carrying on from there Puppet Master is still an extremely bad film even from a trashy gore fiend's point of view.Now I'm not going to even bother complaining about the acting in the film because lets be honest no one sitting down to watch a film about a group of murdering puppets expects great acting. The acting was believable lets leave it at that it's the most you can hope for.The direction however was one of the worst things about this film. There are a lot of overly long drawn out sequences in this film and it's not until about 45 minutes in halfway through the film that anything happens. The worst example has to be the opening sequence where Toulin the Puppet Master is collected up all his puppets and hiding them away as someone is after him. As we see him do this it is intercut with two men in black making there way to him and at the same time one of his stray puppets trying to do the same thing. This went on for about 1012 minutes it was just the two guys walking and a point of view shot from the puppet running around trying to get back to his master. About 23 into this sequence I was shouting at the television as I was so bored and frustrated that the film wasn't progressing. Another example is the scene at the end where the puppets turn on their new master and attack him in an elevator. It went on forever! It was not scary or particularly violent and quite simply bored the ass off me!There are also a lot of ideas and concepts within the film which might have sounded good on paper but do not work at all in the film. The first thing that springs to mind is the female puppet Leech Woman the whole thing of her regurgitating leeches which suck her victims dry is both utterly unconvincing and totally retarded. For a start the effects used for this scene are abysmal! You can clearly see that it's just either a real leech or a fake being forced through the back of a rubber head and out the mouth. I mean come on the rubber puppets head even distorts and bends as the puppeteer struggles to force the leech through the mouth. Another is Pinhead Hellraiser already took that one morons it is never once explained why on earth a puppet has a pair of what are clearly human hands. It looks ridiculous and the fact that we have no idea why he doesn't just have puppet hands makes it seem all the more ridiculous!All in all Puppet Master is an awful film and I cannot begin to imagine why it has such a cult following. The vastly superior Child's Play had already covered this ground the previous year anyway so I guess the keyword here is POINTLESS. It is badly directed the acting is average and the effects show the age of the film like nothing I've ever seen before.When I borrowed this film from a friend I also borrowed the sequel Puppet Master II I somehow don't think I'll be bothering!".

	schema:reviewBody "The first in an interminable series of lowbudget comic shockers from Full Moon Entertainment PUPPET MASTER is exactly the sort of horror film that you'd expect the late 1980s to produce. It's often cheesy with an extraordinarily slim plot that consists of characters wandering around a haunted hotel and getting offed in various grisly ways and the only thing that matches the fashions and haircuts for awfulness is the quality of the acting. Yet this film has something about it to distinguish it from more general runofthemill fare and that's the puppets. For those who don't know there are five different killer puppets all with their own special methods for killing. The little dolls are equipped with knives huge hands leeches and drills while the ringleader has a cool rotating head effect which is often put to good use.As mentioned the plot is little more than the 'old dark house' style of horror that was clichd back in the 1930s! Characters have boring flashbacks engaging in unnecessarily gratuitous sex sessions anything to keep the viewer's attention and generally act in less than impressive ways. With a bunch of Bmovie stars and TV actors the only one who really stands out is MIDNIGHT EXPRESS's Irene Miracle but her screen time is limited. Perpetual oldtimer William Hickey is the titular puppet master but his screen time is limited to a few minutes at the beginning of the flick.So what of the puppets? The most interesting thing is the quality of the special effects  they're fantastic. Forget all the other 'killer doll' movies PUPPET MASTER is tops when it comes to creepy animated creations and that's primarily because they're animated through stop motion with lots of all little cool tricks thrown in to keep the viewer guessing as to how they did it. Dave Allen is the guy behind the animation and he does a brilliant job as always. For a guy who began his career on a prehistoric Hammer flick and ended it on straighttovideo horror cheese he doesn't disappoint. There's a pretty outrageous level of gruesomeness on display with the sickest moment being the deathbyleeches scene which manages to outgross SLUGS. Most of the disgust is saved up for the final scene in which the puppets take their revenge on a living zombie filled with embalming fluid. The result is a viscous vicious moment. Surprisingly some of the scare scenes  like Miracle being stalked through corridors and lifts by the puppets  are effective and the film as a whole is easy to watch and pretty entertaining whenever the puppets are on screen and that's a lot.".

HahaThere is one puppet that has huge arms and a tiny head his name was Pinhead he was great. You could clearly see in some scenes that they were someone's hands poking through the body of a dummy and picking things up etc... it looked so bad that it made it great!The puppet with a drill on his head named Tunneler is good and Blade is easily recognisable. Probably the most famous puppet of them all...One of my favourites though is the lady puppet named Leech Woman... she regurgitates leeches onto her victims... really gross but cool.This film has got a cult following and about a million sequels which I have not seen... but after seeing this again and enjoying it I will be looking out for them. JNot the best horror from its time but still very enjoyable and funny.I will give this film 7 out of 10...I get a feeling though the sequels will probably get worst and worst.For more reviews please like my Facebook pagehttpwww.facebook.compagesOrdinaryPersonMovie Reviews456572047728204?refhl".

The music really sets the atmosphere for this type of fun corny movie but it still produces a creepy feel. What really makes the movie though is the characters being both the humans and the puppets themselves that have their own identity and uniqueness. Irene Miracle who plays Dana Hadley is still a Hollywood crush of mine and she played a fabulous eccentric role in the film. It's hard to nitpick on Puppet Master but if I have to say if there is a letdown it's probably the ending twist which could have had a bit more to it.

	schema:headline " This film is one of my guilty pleasures. It is by no means an puppet masterpiece but it entertains me for some odd reason.";
	schema:reviewBody "It's mindless fun written by Charles Robert Band the Founder of Full Moon Features an company known for its directtovideo BList horror  scifi movies. Full Moon's first franchise was Puppet Master inspired from an earlier Empire film Dolls and United Artists' success with Child's Play the year prior. Directed by David Schmoeller the first movie start off in 1939 at a hotel at Bodega Bay CA where the puppet master himself Andre Toulon William Hickey who commit suicide to escape being captured by Nazi spies for his knowledge of reanimation dead people and putting their souls into his puppets. Bodega Bay will be used for the settings for a lot of the Puppet Master movies. The actor that play Andre will most likely be remember to most people as Uncle Lewis from 1989's National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. Anyways cut to 1989 where a bunch of psychics are invited by a former colleague Neil Gallagher. Jimmie Skaggs who they believe has been sending them visions of the future. Only to find that Neil Gallagher shot himself and they have come upon his funeral. If they were really psychics how on earth did they not see that Neil killed himself? They must have not been the best of their trade. The first 40 minutes dragged on without any puppets on screen. Finally all of the psychics are attacked or killed by the puppets that remain at the hotel. Only two of them will find the connection between Andre Toulon's puppets and what happen to Neil Gallagher. Without giving away too much of the mess of a plot the film is a bit confusing and made absolutely no sense. I watch it a number of times and it still doesn't. It didn't explain enough in the film to the point I have to guess just to fill in the blanks on the plot holes. Metaphysically speaking Neil killed himself. Okay that really tells us a lot about why there's puppets running around the hotel killing people. What did the new puppet master had against his own friends and quickly turn against his puppets? How was he able to bring himself back from the dead when he was dead? Wouldn't it make sense if his wife use the formula to bring him back? What ever happen to his wife in the end of the film? Anyways it's never answer and the whole heavy use of psychic power was never explain in the other films. The other thing good about the plot was that they at less gave the victim characters a little bit depth. Plus the puppets seem to have more free will than the film lets on and can quickly turn sides unlike other movie monsters. They can play both the villains and the heroes. The movie got a cult following so the puppets were turn the good guys in most of the subsequent films fighting various enemies including Nazis and interdimensional alien puppets. One of the treats of the movies is when new puppets are introduced although it's always kind of sketchy as to how they come into existence considering Toulon is dead in most of them. The best thing about this movie are the puppets. Each of them having an interesting way of killing people. Blade looks like a small version of the Fisherman from 1997's I Know What You Did Last Summer with a hook. Pinhead is a Conehead lookalike muscle man mixed with Addams Family Uncle Fester who punch and strangles people. Tunneler has a drill on his head that drills into people. Last is Ms. Leech who is a Leechpuking doll is originally terrifying. Also there is Jester who pretty much just there to be there. He's pretty useless. Overall Puppet Master was enjoyable but I never bought the struggle between man and puppets. Too much rolling around. Chucky from 1988's Child's Play was certainly the superior murder toy. The puppets themselves are magnificent though but I just wouldn't see how people in this film can't overpower them. Their stop motion movement was always fantastic and creepy. Lending the film a unique eerie presence that couldn't be accomplished with CGI and this is coming from someone who thinks people are too hard on CGI. Would've been nice to see some elaboration on the sequels considering there are so many of them but this was nice none the less. I was left scratching my head for about 90 of the movie and the other 10 of the time I was freaked out by the puppets I do like the music. It fits the mood indeed. The movie is full of 1980's and 1990's stupid horror clichs. Following the ageold formula of people wandering off alone and getting killed one by one stupid scenes of nudity and pointless scenes that make no sense. It's watchable but give up your hopes for a serious horror movie here. It's not that. So check it out if you want to.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's mindless fun written by Charles Robert Band the Founder of Full Moon Features an company known for its directtovideo BList horror  scifi movies. Full Moon's first franchise was Puppet Master inspired from an earlier Empire film Dolls and United Artists' success with Child's Play the year prior. Directed by David Schmoeller the first movie start off in 1939 at a hotel at Bodega Bay CA where the puppet master himself Andre Toulon William Hickey who commit suicide to escape being captured by Nazi spies for his knowledge of reanimation dead people and putting their souls into his puppets. Bodega Bay will be used for the settings for a lot of the Puppet Master movies. The actor that play Andre will most likely be remember to most people as Uncle Lewis from 1989's National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. Anyways cut to 1989 where a bunch of psychics are invited by a former colleague Neil Gallagher. Jimmie Skaggs who they believe has been sending them visions of the future. Only to find that Neil Gallagher shot himself and they have come upon his funeral. If they were really psychics how on earth did they not see that Neil killed himself? They must have not been the best of their trade. The first 40 minutes dragged on without any puppets on screen. Finally all of the psychics are attacked or killed by the puppets that remain at the hotel. Only two of them will find the connection between Andre Toulon's puppets and what happen to Neil Gallagher. Without giving away too much of the mess of a plot the film is a bit confusing and made absolutely no sense. I watch it a number of times and it still doesn't. It didn't explain enough in the film to the point I have to guess just to fill in the blanks on the plot holes. Metaphysically speaking Neil killed himself. Okay that really tells us a lot about why there's puppets running around the hotel killing people. What did the new puppet master had against his own friends and quickly turn against his puppets? How was he able to bring himself back from the dead when he was dead? Wouldn't it make sense if his wife use the formula to bring him back? What ever happen to his wife in the end of the film? Anyways it's never answer and the whole heavy use of psychic power was never explain in the other films. The other thing good about the plot was that they at less gave the victim characters a little bit depth. Plus the puppets seem to have more free will than the film lets on and can quickly turn sides unlike other movie monsters. They can play both the villains and the heroes. The movie got a cult following so the puppets were turn the good guys in most of the subsequent films fighting various enemies including Nazis and interdimensional alien puppets.

What redeems it though is the cast. John Goodman amiably bumbles his way through his role and gives some charm into a character that could have been bland and uninteresting and Peter O'Toole and John Hurt seem to be having a whale of a time as the adviser and scheming courtier. Also the film does actually look nice the cinematography is good and the scenery is lovely. The soundtrack and score were enjoyable as well.

Richard Nixon would have been put up for a no confidence vote and out he would have been without all the drama.Drama on the other side of the Atlantic is saved for the Royals. This film might give an American some idea of what the abdication crisis was all about. John Goodman as the American born King has his own Mrs. Simpson.In fact how he got to the throne is quite the tale. On some grand occasion the extended royal family got together for what looks like a team picture like they take in spring training of the various baseball rosters. Someone left a loose electrical cable dangling on the metal bleachers and the whole lot of them were electrocuted.Genealogists poured through the Windham family tree and found some member had renounced it all and gone to America. The heir of that forgotten branch is John Goodman Ralph Jones who does a lounge act in Las Vegas and not in classier joints in Las Vegas.Of course the free and easy and thoroughly American Goodman doesn't take readily to his new found job. He can't quite comprehend that he has to serve as well as be served. And he has the same problem the Duke of Windsor had when he was briefly Edward VIII. With a lot more excuse since Windsor was brought up in the tradition.Peter O'Toole as the lord who tries to give him some on the job training and John Hurt who has his own reasons for wanting Goodman to flop both give stand out performances. Best scene the palace ball for Goodman's prospective bride when Goodman does his lounge act.It's a funny film and in its own way educational. The Duke of Windsor should have seen it.

The joke is either on the hamburger and baseball loving Americans or the stiff conservatory highclass Brits. People who describe this movie as lowbrow comedy obviously have no idea what that means. This is good quality humor no crude and tasteless jokes here. The actors are all toprate and the acting is first class. Who could have played the majestic royal British type better than Peter O'Toole? Nobody! He's perfect graceful and dignified as the King's adviser. John Goodman on the other hand is perfect as the average joe who doesn't know or care much about protocol good manners or politics. John Hurt is another excellent choice to play the part of an evil unscrupulous aristocrat hung up on power. Hurt obviously enjoyed doing this part and he's very funny. The movie tends to drag when Goodman's girlfriend shows up but Princess Anna enters the stage to compensate. There are also some unnecessary exaggerations but I didn't mind. The script is good the jokes are over the top and performances are great all around. Hilarious stuff!".

John Hurt is another excellent choice to play the part of an evil unscrupulous aristocrat hung up on power. Hurt obviously enjoyed doing this part and he's very funny. The movie tends to drag when Goodman's girlfriend shows up but Princess Anna enters the stage to compensate. There are also some unnecessary exaggerations but I didn't mind. The script is good the jokes are over the top and performances are great all around. Hilarious stuff!";

	schema:reviewBody "So I don't consider this a classic as some other reviewers have labeled it. You really have to stretch the imagination to accept the premise that the first 30 people or so in line for the crown are suddenly killed and England one of the largest and most powerful economies of the world has to ask some D list lounge singer to be their new king. But I get it this is a justforlaughs fish out of water story not a serious whatif film.John Goodman whose career was built on playing the middleaged working class every man does a decent job here portraying a beer drinking football loving regular Joe who just can't stop creating uncomfortable moments around stuffy British people.The gags are a bit of a mixed bag. When they develop in a way that's organic to the character and moment they work pretty well. But for every good setup there is the overly forced one such as when Goodman's character accidentally launches a greasy bird off his plate at a state dinner while trying to cut into it. The ensuing chaos sees every glass along a long long table fall over like dominoes for nearly 30 seconds. The scene feels so desperate to hit the laugh you can practically see the little charges going off to keep the glasses falling in comedic fashion past the horrified diners. The problem is comedy is really hard. Even a whiff of desperation for laughs like that scene has turns funny into sad really quick.The other part of this movie that's hard to swallow is the romance subplot. Hollywood knows that one of their major target demographics middle aged guys will identify with Goodman and so they supply the dream girl for the viewers alterego. In this case the movie asks us to believe that an insanely gorgeous 26 year old is just dying to fall in love with her dream guy an obese man nearly old enough to be her father. When the leading man is Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt yah OK I can believe that. But Goodman? I don't know I just think an actress more age appropriate would have been easier to believe. The two here just don't seem like they go together.My enjoyment of the film may have been effected by the fact that I don't care much for the concept of a monarchy and I find arguments that keeping families in an artificial state of wealth and privilege is a good thing because they serve the people facile and ignorant. Note that the fantasy is always that you get to suddenly become royalty never that you get to suddenly be a subject who gets sent to prison for not bowing properly or mouthing off. Monarchies are an outdated and brutish form of government best left in the history books imho.All in all I managed to watch the whole movie even if I wasn't enthralled the whole way thru. Passable entertainment.".

The movie isn't high art or genre defining. It is a simple story about a lovable slacker who discovers he is much more and embarks on a fishout ofwater journey. And as that King Ralph is a decent movie.When a freak accident wipes out the entire British Royal Family American lounge singer Ralph Jones is uncovered as the next heir to the throne. Despite being your atypical slacker he shows a certain charm and his unconventional methods along with much help from his private secretary and assistant begin to win people over. He even begins to secretly see Miranda a former stripper that he meets soon after arriving in England. But soon the corrupt Lord Graves begins a plot to disgrace Ralph and position himself as next in line for the throne. Miranda is pulled into the plot but falls for Ralph and backs out. Graves already has what he needs and disgraces Ralph at a royal ball. After Miranda admits her part in the plot Ralph is able to trace it back to Graves and repair some of the damage done. He admits to Parliament and the people that he is not fit to be king and abdicates the throne to his secretary who was secretly part of the royal line as well. Soon Ralph makes up with Miranda and the movie ends with them married as Ralph becomes a Duke and gets to live his dream of being a musician.The cast is solid all around. John Goodman is impossible to hate as the big buffoon struggling to adapt to an entirely new world. Camille Coduri is likable despite her character's part in the plot against Ralph and has good chemistry with Goodman. Peter O'Toole and Richard Griffiths provide solid backup as his secretary and assistant respectively and John Hurt appears to have a blast in his small role as the evil Lord Graves.As mentioned earlier the story is a basic fishoutofwater tale. Many of the jokes are derived from Ralph's class difference and ignorance of English culture. It is all very basic but is carried by the charm of Goodman. While my score of 8 is biased by years of popping in that old VHS tape I recommend at least giving it a try. It is definitely worth a viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching a whole royal family blown up isn't particularly funny but we must remember this is only a movie. Out of interest it would be interesting to see the real royal family's view on this movie as well as how accurately the set up is here. Enter John Goodman a piano player who plays in seedy second rate clubs in Vegas. He's scouted out by some of the surviving royalty where on the night of being fired from his gig he's given a proposition which is a dream. But really what would it be like being the new king or any royal figure having to adhere to customs and keep up appearances while also being mobbed in informal wear. No way. And this is basically what they take from Goodman in this. I think they've visually captured this originally good comedy well and it has been interestingly written. It's quite dishy. One such touch I loved was the score of punkfascists with their pink cuts and heavy jewellery watching through the t.v shop passing view on their new king. Our King too falls in love with an English girl where she too is propositioned by a corrupt royal party John Hurt in a splendid dastardly performance who was also up for king. Peter O'Toole as Ralph's royal tutor is royally solid no surprise he was cast in this sort of role. They found the right man for the job in Goodman as he displays his bumbling and clunky manner with such believability which he's very un king like where the writers have poured a lot of funny stuff into this as well poking fun at the royal traits and figures themselves. John Goodman's love interest was good too fresh off the heals of her character in Nuns On The Run. Oh and he was right about the royal woman fox looking a lot like Di he's 'spose to marry she really does have the voice of a tuba which would scare off any guy. Check out Goodman's expressions here. There will be people out there including real royalty who will take offence to this film but there's a lot of other more offensive comedies. I found King Ralph very funny but also very well made in terms of royal setting costuming whatever. And really is there such a desert as Spotted d..k. Hear and see Duke Of Earl song like it's never been played before by Goodman and band.".

One such touch I loved was the score of punkfascists with their pink cuts and heavy jewellery watching through the t.v shop passing view on their new king. Our King too falls in love with an English girl where she too is propositioned by a corrupt royal party John Hurt in a splendid dastardly performance who was also up for king. Peter O'Toole as Ralph's royal tutor is royally solid no surprise he was cast in this sort of role. They found the right man for the job in Goodman as he displays his bumbling and clunky manner with such believability which he's very un king like where the writers have poured a lot of funny stuff into this as well poking fun at the royal traits and figures themselves. John Goodman's love interest was good too fresh off the heals of her character in Nuns On The Run. Oh and he was right about the royal woman fox looking a lot like Di he's 'spose to marry she really does have the voice of a tuba which would scare off any guy. Check out Goodman's expressions here. There will be people out there including real royalty who will take offence to this film but there's a lot of other more offensive comedies. I found King Ralph very funny but also very well made in terms of royal setting costuming whatever. And really is there such a desert as Spotted d..k. Hear and see Duke Of Earl song like it's never been played before by Goodman and band.";

	schema:reviewBody "I LOVE this movie! I know that when it came out it was largely ignored...by both the critics and the movie going public...but I found this film to be just simply fun to watch...a wonderful movie to just get caught up into. It has no pretexts of social or political idealism. It doesn't try to solve the worlds problems with it's message. And it doesn't aim to make us the viewers think overly hard about where the movie is leading us. It does however present us with totally believable characters who we quickly become emotionally invested in. Sure the opening plot structure is contrived but that is half of the charm of the film's setup. It is a good absurd introduction to the twists of the movie. I must confess being half Cherokee Indian and half English I was drawn to this movie if for no other reason than I had always heard about that half of my family's history and imagined who they were and how they lived. As an American I have also fallen prey to my own sometimes myopic world view. King Ralph was an enjoyable way to contemplate the place that a monarchy holds in the hearts of their countrymen. I don't believe that there is anything inherently wrong with having a movie that doesn't try to enlighten or enrage us. I have always felt that too often Hollywood tries to insert a message or moral slant to a project just because they believe that to not include one makes the movie seem shallow or silly. I say whats wrong with having just a fun movie? To me King Ralph was just such a movie. Of course it had smatterings of political overtones and touches of social commentary but I feel that this was used to propel the story rather than to try and impart some deeper philosophical meaning to us.".

	schema:headline " King Ralph";
	schema:reviewBody "Back in the early 90's we got many family movies that offered lots of cheesy irritating laughs and child actors the odd thing was many actually did really well. The original movie would somehow manage to become a reasonable hit a different time and those movies in some cases actually turned into franchises! Those same franchises then managed to knock out a semidecent sequel or two before eventually disintegrating into utter trash with numerous straight to DVD sequels being churned out. The films I refer to would be 'Beethoven' 'Problem Child' 'Home Alone' and 'Free Willy'...mainly. 'King Ralph' was a slightly different animal though a stand alone family film that was totally stupid in concept but offered a really solid cast and by the looks of things some high production values. Amazingly its yet another novel adaptation albeit a loose one the story simply revolves around the British Royal Family getting wiped out in a freak accident. Its then down to the upper echelons to dig out a new King by rooting through the vast Royal Family tree trying to discover a long lost distant relation with true royal blood to take the throne. Once they do it of course turns out to be the most unsuitable person imaginable well for the early 90's anyway a fat loud uncouth brash American.Right so who would be the best fat loud American of the time? why John Goodman of course. The fat beerswilling checkeredshirt wearing slob from the hit TV US show 'Roseanne'. Basically take Goodman's popular character from that show the stereotypical overweight middle aged lacking of general knowledge US sports obsessed male Yank and make him a lounge singer with a knowledge of female club stripping and a penchant for Elvis style shades not much of a stretch. To counter this you need a stereotypical British gent to guide and teach this gaudy foreigner enter the stellar Peter O'Toole as the Royal secretary. You can't really get any better than O'Toole for the epitome of a British aristocrat despite being possibly Irish and you can't really get anymore of a polar opposite to Goodman. The duo play off each other superbly well considering how daft the film is and the fact its pretty much aimed at children. O'Toole puts in a sterling performance coming across perfectly as someone who would look after royalty sure we've seen this type of performance from him before but his loyal butleresque manner is so pleasing to watch and listen to. Indeed his speech to Goodman's character about what it is to be a King of England is quite stirring I must say as a Brit it did bring a lump to my throat such a shame these days patriotic talk like that is nonexistent and almost frowned upon.To add even more British star power to the proceedings we have John Hurt in an even more outrageously hideously over the top aristocratic Conservative cad who will stop at nothing to dirty the new Kings image. Hurt's slimy arrogant pompous voice and attitude is just as good as his weaselly yet smartly dressed appearance complete with a dastardly thin pencil tash. I love how he's also completely cold emotionless and kinda racist calling Goodman's character 'a song and dance man from the colonies' a real Alan B'Stard. What's more his sidekick is played by Leslie Phillips! all the old chivalrous warhorses here.So the brilliant character acting aside what's also very impressive about this apparent silly kids flick is the fact it all looks fantastic. The outfits suits and general attire of dignitaries and royals is spruce debonair and dapper all round everyone looks tip top and pristine. The locations are a mix or real stately homes clever use of small sections of real posh establishments and more obviously stock footage. Interior sequences are the most impressive with some sets looking exquisite highly detailed and extremely lavish it really looks like no expense was spared in creating these elegant royal interiors. I guess its all a bit surprising really you'd never expect such extravagant detail with a silly little comedy like this you'd think it would be all about the slapstick and raking in as much moolah as possible different times.Being an old movie I did also enjoy the retro blast I got from time to time anyone of my age will no doubt feel the same way. Its always amusing to see old fashioned British punks in these movies. You the know the types brightly coloured mohawks black leather jackets covered in badges chains and safety pins lots of makeup etc...Twas also funny to see them all watching old fashioned TV's in the windows of a Rumbelows store remember that??Yeah the whole thing is very predictable as a kind of rags to riches Prince Charming type of affair you can guess what's gonna go down in scenes and overall its all very sweet and adorable. It might sound clichd and dumb but watching the hapless Ralph trying to learn the ways of the super rich whilst attempting to chat with senior dignitaries and royalty is perfect light entertainment. That said there is a pleasant and fresh tale to be discovered here being based on a novel it kinda reminded me of 'Brewster's Millions' actually. Goodman in an earlyish presuperstardom movie role is amazingly likable as the American lounge lizard with a golden heart who is turned into a rich nobleman...with a golden heart. Supporting cast are all brilliant as said adding real quality and a hint of solid drama to the story the film is fun for kids with plenty of cutesy charm but it also has the odd snippet of fun for adults too.710".

If one plus one equals two then this combination equals a comedy that can't be matched...on ANY level.I'm not saying this is the best comedy of all time but what I am saying is that this film if you rent it is a nice quiet evening that will not offend many people and leaves the lead actor in a familiar base for him a place where he's supposed to seem unfamiliar. Everybody remembers him as Dan Connor but how many of you reading this remember he was the head football coach in Revenge of the Nerds? Goodman was an excellent choice for this part because of his range as an actor and his onscreen chemistry with Camille Coduri was priceless too as I felt that they represented the kind of relationship that everybody would like.So hats off or crowns if you will to David S Ward for this film.

	schema:headline " Good Adaption But Slightly Juvenile";
	schema:reviewBody "The bizarre and unthinkable idea of an American King of Britain would certainly make a good comedy however this one tries to hard. The film is based loosely on a novel Headstrong and the the novel was adapted to the idea of an American becoming King and the formula worked making the film interesting but with a basis to build on. The film works well with all the national stereotyping of the characters and the culture shock of the main character to adjust to his new found culture as well as the shock of being from ordinary in to exceptional.

The film is based loosely on a novel Headstrong and the the novel was adapted to the idea of an American becoming King and the formula worked making the film interesting but with a basis to build on. The film works well with all the national stereotyping of the characters and the culture shock of the main character to adjust to his new found culture as well as the shock of being from ordinary in to exceptional.

Not only that but the relationship with his daughter has started to feel the financial strain. However the unemployment agency find him a short time position at U.S. Army training base Fort McClane. The position entails him to teach basic comprehension to a class of academic under achievers. Initially he's not enthused by the job nor are the class particularly responsive to his civilian status. But just maybe this odd coupling may turn out to be good for both parties? That is if Drill Sergeant Cass Hines lets them that is?A box office flop that was first marketed as a comedy then as a drama it's very much both Renaissance Man holds no surprises what so ever. The formula remains the same as every other piece featuring a teacher and an unrulytroubledunder educated class. So with that in mind and considering the film has largely been kicked by the professional critics I'm not here to sell this movie to anyone because sometimes you have to acknowledge that a film can hit a spot of your own personal psyche yet at the same time be a million miles away from someone else's.The choices we make dictate the life we leadFor me personally Renaissance Man is one such film. It was one dark rainy night back in the mid 90s and I had the blues I popped over to the video store to see what was available I couldn't find anything that remotely sounded like something to lift me out of the stupor I was in. I then spied a copy of Renaissance Man a film I hadn't heard anything about and although I took that as a bad sign Danny DeVito's beaming smile on the cover of the box lured me in. I was thinking how much I had enjoyed him in Twins at the back end of 1988 so to me it didn't seem such a bad gamble to take. I was expecting a comedy and I got one but the bonus was that what I also got was a very uplifting dramatic tale about the human condition people learning from each other a tale that shows the power of artistry and how it can unite and lift people. A tale that shows that maybe some folk aren't as clever as others but if they can grasp a straw and be all that they can be then their heads will be well and truly held up high.Renaissance Man I believe is a sadly undervalued film on this or any other film related site. But that's just me because hey! We all got different psyche's right. Right? 810".

It's about the man who makes them realize their worth as human beings getting quite an education about life himself.Danny DeVito is that man in a role about as far removed as you can get from Louis DePalma in Taxi and Lawrence Garfield in Other People's Money. He's an advertising man who loses a couple of big clients while getting stuck in traffic and gets bounced from his job.Needing an income while looking for a job the Michigan Unemployment Department gives him an interesting job a civilian remedial education teacher for the United States Army. He's assigned to a class of eight trainees who might wash out if they don't shape up. It's their mental attitudes that need adjusting.A little trial and error and DeVito hits upon the idea to use Shakespeare specifically Hamlet as a teaching tool. Interpreting and learning life's lesson from one of the greatest works of literature in the English language apparently works and in ways far beyond making these trainees get through basic training.This is my favorite film with Danny DeVito and he's not an easy fit into army life. Cliff Robertson James Remar and Gregory Hines are some of the army people he deals with.But the eight trainees are the heart of the film. Mark Wahlberg Lillo Brancato Kadeem Hardison Richard Jones Khalil Kain Gregory Sporleto Stacey Dash are seven of them. One of them doesn't make it through and ironically because of an act of kindness. But my favorite in the film is Peter Simmons who plays Private Brian Davis from Grand Forks North Dakota. It's young men like him and his father before him in Vietnam who was killed in action who keep this country safe and secure. He gets the best recognition possible at the end of the film and you are guaranteed not to have a dry eye when you see it.Renaissance Man is a beautifully crafted film from Penny Marshall and should not be missed when broadcast.".

This is a warm fuzzy feelgood movie with a lot of wisdom in it. The character development is excellent and we really get to like the characters. The bond between DeVito and his students is strong. This movie is very touching with a few funny moments inbetween. Sure there are some corny scenes the rap scene but hey every teacher has their own way of making their students understand their material right? I would recommend this movie although not as a comedy.".

There are some great brilliant moments in here especially when DeVito says All I know is the choices you make dictate the life you lead. To thine own self be true.  There is also an excellent scene where one of the students recites Shakespeare for Hines the drill sergeant. This is a fantastic movie that I absolutely loved as did my English teacher.

De Vito's best scene is the one where he is in the office where he's going for a job. He totally does NOT want to be there because he's ashamed of being there. When he gets a teaching job offered the look on his facewhen he finds out he is supposed to teach soldiers in the army is marvelous. All the other actors are playing very good especially Gregory Hines as drillinstructor who wants Bill Rago gone. The few scenes Hines and De Vito share together are no less than hilarious that's for sure.The story is not as strong as the sometimes brilliant acting from the whole cast. To be honest the story of Jim Burnstein is predictable and boring. Not only is the ending something you know 30 minutes before it's there also the most important lines of the story are predictable and because of that boring. I can't spoil the movie but let me tell you For this film Jim Burnstein wanted all happy things and endings even when it's not appropriate.If you have read Willliam Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' a brilliant book if I may say so you'll enjoy this film a lot more.If you like this motion picture you should also see 'Dead Poets Society' with Robin Williams.".

When the camera pans across the faces of the young men as they watch a live performance of Shakespeare I am moved by their innocence and their amazement.Renaissance Man is in my humble opinion Danny DeVito's finest hour. It also features wonderfully sensitive performances from the late Gregory Hines as the drill sergeant and Mark Wahlberg as the yokel Haywood. My personal favorite character is Benitez from Noo Yahk Noo Yahk played by Lillo Brancato.Many people think that because this film did not do well in its theatrical release that it wasn't a good film. This is simply not true. It is a marvelous ensemble cast drama with enough funny moments to sustain even the shortest attention span.If you have never seen this film it is well worth renting or catching on cable as I am right as we speak.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Renaissance Man' is a film about a teacher who is hired to teach literature to a group of rebellious army recruits. It is a film about the relationship that this teacher has with the students and the changes that all of them make. The teacher learns how to appreciate the army recruits and gets a sense of understanding from them at the same time they learn how to buckle down and actually enjoy reading and learning about Shakespeare's 'Hamlet'. This is one of those feelgood films. I got really sick of watching this film as it was always on television and one of those films that my family tended to watch and rewatch at least a dozen times. This film has its share of laughter and succeeds in providing a feelgood story and a happy ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "RENAISSANCE MAN  1994 12 out of fourBy Blake French The more serious a subject is the easier and more fun it is to spoof. The comedy from Penny Marshal Renaissance Man has a great target the army. But it fails to create funny material within its concepts. The film seems to have uncertainties within its structure the scenes simply do not blend well together. It is possible to incorporate comedy with sentimental emotions but this movie does not know how to do it. It goes from straight humor to straight solemnity leaving out subtle changes in its pace attitude or character's actions. When a movie can include a scene that has Danny Devito climbing a victory tower at a military training facility and another where Army students rap to a theme of Shakespeare's Hamlet without being funny in the least you know there has been some major miscalculations.Devito is the right actor for a divorced bankrupt Detroit advertiser who applies for unemployment and gets a job as a civilian instructor for an Army training facility. He must counsel a class of eight difficult students. Of course DeVito's character has no idea of how the Army works and proves himself to be a misfit in the base. After some effort he eventually finds the students express interest in Shakespeare. He wrote plays. Plays...? he explains. You know like TV without the box. The class becomes a course on the understanding of the complex tragedy of Hamlet.We keep waiting for the movie to take off and to be about something but it never does. It simply juggles around various ideas that go absolutely nowhere. The movie feels obligatory as it follows the predictable contrived path in which the students reject their authorities then the students respect their authorities then the authorities reject then except. Except and reject what you ask? It doesn't really matter since the entire plot is an exercise in recycling story nuggets of movies like Dead Poets Society and Private Benjamin. To make things even worse for this excuse for a comedy many of the performances are horrible. Danny Devito is fine as is the rest of the more experienced cast. But the Army student cast has scenes that are down right laughable. Mark Wahlberg sits in his desk and makes childish faces to his fellow classmates reciting his dialogue as if rehearsing a part in a high school play for the first time. During one scene as the students explain the reasons of why they joined the Army one breaks down in tears because of a sad emotional past. This could have been powerful if actual actors had taken the parts. But instead we try to respect the art of filmmaking by holding a straight face while his expression of sorrow becomes so poorly portrayed we don't know whether to wince or chuckle. Renaissance Man is a contrived labored unconvincing attempt at a comedy spoof. Without a doubt if handled the right way it could have had funny results. But Penny Marshal who also directed movies like The Preacher's Wife and Big constructs scenes so awfully familiar and labored no possible talent can save them. Even the closing sequence the traditional false suspense moments when students show their loyalties and manhood feels out of place. Everything feels out of place here. I feel sorry for Danny Devito who brings a life to his character on his own. But he is stuck in a movie so mislead even he looks like he should be contributing his talents to another production.".

There were definitely weak spots in the story predictable endings and such but it was enjoyable especially for Devito's acting. There was some strong acting by the rest of the cast and some definite weak performances the worst being Gregory Hines who just didn't fit the part. For me all weaknesses were made up for in how Devito's character handled his new role as a teacher. He plays an old bitter ad guy perfectly and made me see several of my colleagues in a new light.".

	schema:reviewBody "First off the English name of the title is a little misleading it does not regard the effect of consuming sugar it's referring to plants that grow by the riverside. But don't worry it's still good! It is a film within a film although the purpose here is not so much a treatise on film making. The inner film is based on Jaroslaw Iwaszkiewicz's short story Tatarak. This concerns a melancholic doctor's wife Marta living a slowpaced life in iron curtain Poland I think the story is set around 1960. It is a very short story the movie is only 85 minutes long and half of it is the film outside the film. Marta has a measure of survivor syndrome following the war and misses having young people around the house and so strikes up a relationship with a sweet young working class man called Bogus who is the boyfriend of a girl who sees herself as superior because she is a university student. She is pressurising him to be more than he is and so his rendezvous with Marta is an escape for him too.One of my favourite shots in terms of pure image craft in the movie is in the dining room of Marta's house the set table is covered over in a white tablecloth a formality of a bygone era? and is reflected in a large ornate mirror on the back wall which tilts out at an angle as it is hung like a picture. This throws the image of the table so that it takes up almost the entire mirror and it somehow is surrounded only in darkness you cannot see any of the rest of the room. It is a shot that reminds me of the existential fragility of many of the old still life paintings for example of Adriaen Coorte.The plant in question is more commonly known as Calamus or Sweet Flag. It has two quite different odours the root is pungent whilst the blade is more sweet smelling. This is a metaphor for the transitory nature of happiness in the movie the root is death the blade is life. The rendezvous take place among the sweet rushes. The Greeks had a story for the origin of the rush told in Nonnus's Dionysiaca where upon the drowning of his lover during a swimming race in the river Calamus drowned himself in sympathy and turned into a sweet rush. So the soughing of the wind in the rushes is a lament.Krystyna Janda who plays Marta in the film was married to Wajda's frequent collaborator cinematographer Edward Klosinski. He had a rather nasty cancer during the filming of Tatarak and died. The film then becomes at some level a memorial for him. We see how the grief of the cancer infused Krystyna during the performance. We also see her deliver a monologue regarding her experiences with her husband around the time of his death which are very sad. Mostly she is in a spartan room delivering a monologue but also we see her sometimes on set of the film before or after shooting and once heartbreakingly in the rain.Tatarak won the Alfred Bauer Prize at the Berlin Film Festival the award is given to a movie which opens new perspectives in film art. Well that is exactly what this movie does. You can scarcely watch a better film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Andrzej Wajda's film tells a story of Marta a middleaged woman married to a small town doctor. Marta searches for happiness in the arms of a much younger man Bogus. Their relationship is as innocent and fresh as the smell of the sweet rush that grows in the river where Marta and Bogus swam on their first date. But just when everything seems to be going well for them Bogus drowns entangled in the roots of sweet rush he was trying to pick for Marta.Wajda's film follows a twopronged approach. On the one hand we see the actor reconstructing the last months of her husband's life in a simple but extremely touching way and on the other we follow the struggles of her fictitious character who cannot get over the death of the man with whom she was so happy. Both of them have to cope with painful experiences  the actor with the death of her husband and her character with the additional loss of her two sons who died in the Warsaw Uprising during the Second World War. Thus the two women Krystyna and Marta eventually merge to become one and the same person.Sweet RushSweet FlagCalamus not only refers to a Greek Myth that parallels the film but refers to a real fragrant weed that when rubbed wafts a calming fragrant odour that drowses the senses can lull you into a drifting soothing dream state of reverie even an hallucinatory state sharpens mental senses and clarity is a alleviating purifier an internal cleanser of the physical body nourishes the entire body relieves stress is a restorative etc and when rubbed to harshly when the reeds are crushed the reed dies and when you inhale or consume too much of the reed in any form it can supposedly cause deadly cancer.Our life is a sweet rush that vigorously flourishes along the rivers of this earth our lives are the blood of our ancestors rub us gently and our fragrance our transient ghostly reflection wafts and murmurs and ripples through the clear waters of time sweetly carrying forth the memories of our pasts and presents and futures crosspollinating our consciousness and subconsciousness carrying us down into the deepest depths and lifting us up to the sweetest heights but rub the rush too harshly we are crushed and death and death.Marta dives into the sweet rush of youth that may or may not be reality it may be her waking fantasy hallucination which she rubbed into reality as a defense mechanism to deter herself from pondering her innate feeling that her husband's death was imminent. The romance is either the recasting of a past romance she had when she was a youth or a romance she wishes she had with consummated with a young beau or a romance she wishes she had with her husband but could ave had because he was much older than her. This waking fantasy this sweet rush transports her through a halcyon summer setting where youth and beauty are truth and immortality everything is the here and the now and the light and death holds no domination. The man she breathes into life has a girlfriend her as a young girl her travelling far beyond the man's grasp sailing beyond the sweet rush of an unfilled romance and unfilled youth already generating regrets heading towards a war and marriage and children who are untimely struck down by death.Lulled into a waking dreamstate reverie by the blending fragrance of the rushes and the cadence of her memories she almost loses her complete grasp of reality she engrafts into life the mystic undulating aureate reeds of her memory and breathes the honey of it down as her reality the shadow of herself as a young women glides forth halfseen beyond her peripheral the sheer gold perfection of amour eludes her passion dimly discovered the golden young man the embodiment of elusive memories elusive dreams elusive thoughts that stream through her soul sweetly when transiently glittering but drown her when she breaks the surface reality terrifying her the dream shaken off crushing the sweet rush the golden young man the memory close to her heartMarta the middleaged woman picks up where Marta the youth rushes off and misses the sweetness of the time crushing a young man's spirit. The closer middleaged Marta comes to a sexual communion with the man the closer to the surface the reality of her husband's imminent death she nears and the moment Bogus Bogus? A Bogus man? A fictitious relationship a fictitious memory of something she never experienced the sweet rush of youth the sweet rush of a life stripped of that which made it sweet  her children and husband? Why must the lover be....Bogus? penetrates the depths of her subconscious purification begins and the rushes crush her fantasies and quench her desires the overdose of the sweet fragrance restores her to reality and she walks away from the film set into the harsh reality that she not only can no longer experience the fragrant height of life with her husband Edward Klosinski the film's cinematographer but never had the chance to experience a sweet sensual youthful romance with him because they were already well past their prime when they met and married. Shivering and wet rain and a steel gray bridge traffic and city buildings a dying body a dying life hauling the nets when a shoal of immortality swims by. Arseni TarkovskyI don't believe in omens or fear Forebodings. I flee from neither slander Nor from poison. Death does not exist. Everyone's immortal. Everything is too. No point in fearing death at seventeen Or seventy. There's only here and now and light Neither death nor darkness exists.

Beautiful score and a sensational performance from Senta Berger as the abandoned lover  I only really knew her as bosomy decoration in 60s spy movies so she was a revelation here. Ornella Muti plays the heiress so between the two of them there are some pretty steamy sex scenes Stefano Patrizi must rate as one of the luckiest actors ever to get sex scenes with both Muti  Berger in the same movie. I got a pretty poor copy but it looks potentially a really beautiful film  would LOVE to see it on the big screen. Capucine plays Muti's mother. Very neat ending. Totally unexpected lesbian seduction. To be honest I was expecting something altogether more salacious a kind of sex and jackboots epic like Salon Kitty but I was NOT disappointed. Its a very classy movie. Think Italian Chabrol. Incidentally  the visuals on the IMDb page ARE NOT from this movie....".

He first falls for the young mother Senta Berger of one of his classmates Christian Borromeowith whom the latter has a rather strange relationshipthe son calls the mother by her first name and often acts more like a jealous lover. The Richler family the mother and son are formerly wealthy bourgeois but through them protagonist meets another family they are trying to marry into a currently wealthy bourgeois family with a presumably gay dour son and a very beautiful daughter Elena Ornella Muti. The conflict arises when the hero falls for the innocent virginal Elena who turns out to be not so innocent and virginal and abandons the older woman. Jealousy blackmail and eventually murder ensue.This is one of those films that kind of fall somewhere between art and exploitation so it did not get kind of international release of either a highbrow Fellini or Antonioni art film on one hand or a Lucio Fulcitype zombiecannibal gutmuncher on the other. Still it is better made than most Italian exploitation films and at the same time. a lot more entertaining than most Italian art films even if it is much harder to find than either. The film's main strength of course is the two women Senta Berger and Ornella Muti against which the hapless protagonist does not really have chance. These were two of the most gorgeous women in the world at the time and they both have nice nude scenes especially Muti. The two actresses also have a steaming hot intergenerational lesbian scene which is a little gratuitous and not particularly believable but hey who am I to complain? 60's French glamor actress Cappucine is also pretty good as Muti's mother. And prettyboy Italian actor Christian Borromeo who's only slight less pretty than Muti and Berger gives the best performance of his career.The Italian title translates to something like Portrait of the Bourgeosis in Black while the English title is Nest of Vipers. Both are actually pretty appropriate. Good movie. Recommended".

But money seem quite good still especially for the wealthy upper classes who are all sustaining Mussolini ridiculously ignoring the imminent dangers and all the immorality that will plague seriously Europe for well over a decade. We are in lovely Venezia beautifully photographed by the great Armando Nannuzzi with saturated tones perhaps to remember 'Technicolor' then just becoming famous? still gorgeous piano teacher Carla Richter Senta Berger and her young and ambiguous son Renato handsome Christian Borromeo don't seem to be at ease with pretty much anything i felt almost as if he was attracted by the mother in any case they do not certainly seem to perceive a great future ahead. The script is a bit trite to give all this away at the beginning but this was my impression. They are actually  despite the script again keeps on mistakingly striving to depict them as immoral and morbid the 2 more benign souls of the whole motion picture. The sexy piano teacher who's been giving lessons to the gorgeous daughter Elena Ornella Muti perfecting casting and she was truly splendidly photographed here even though i would have loved to see someone like Charlotte Rampling or Therese Ann Savoy in that role has also been 'amorally' trying to push the seemingly reluctant son Renato into a marriage of convenience with Elena who gets just a kick out of the boy. Carla at this point gets to know the much darker side of one of the supposedly most 'appointed' and 'untouchable' families of that lovely Venetian Summer of 1938 and she starts fearing for the worst she is facing a true nest of vipers not only having to face the rude and increasingly intimidating comments made against herself and against Renato she also gradually grows distraught by all the corruption surrounding the same family's friends and society all representing perhaps to her a major failure into her broken dream to see both herself and her son Renato in a much better 'social' position. But here the games aren't even those of a social commentary here we are just in the middle of a true class discrimination and we stand to the verge of the notorious criminal decadence that will bring the 2nd World war it is all operated with cruelty with morbid and sordid offenses constantly perpetrated to all of those not accepting of their position and dues. The extremely wealthy and obviously Fascist aristocratic family Mazzarini is composed beside by the gorgeous Elena who 'seems' also the most innocent of the bunch also by the always classy Capucine great as the manipulative vampire alike mother by Paolo Bonacelli as usual also excellent playing characters who want to appear loyal and lawful when are instead just as corrupted as much as they are slithery and treacherousand of a son who's a bisexual misfit who seems to indulge into opium for the most part creating trouble and enjoying to watch his sister making love with playboys! Trouble arises when Renato would just one day innocently ? introduce the classic handsome stud Mattia Morandi great physique Du role but not so well played by a wooden Stefano Patrizi from Visconti's 'The Conversation Piece' a studly friend who will bring with his own games the plot to an incredible series of convoluted but truly disconcerting turns culminating to even a crime murder's mystery investigation and to a threat that could be enough to generate a so not sought International scandal. Now unfortunately as you may tell the script is way too convoluted and contrived however we must say also that this movie is just lovely to look at extremely well produced with a production design sets costumes and make up cinematography and catchy original music from Vince Temperathat are all just formidable! And of course all the stars are mostly great and lensed with an almost incredible old fashioned type of allure so if the story quite frankly never gets all completely together and there are too many things given away and very few surprises aside from the abundant dose of steamy and sometime truly morbid sexuality which at the end it ends up holding up a movie that would have maybe liked to replicate the works of Luchino Visconti or PatroniGriffi Bolognini Liliana Cavani etc. but misses instead completely into what is a complete and necessary build up of a much stronger character's development that would have helped giving to the film that boost and finally a whole different tone without having instead to rely for the most part in its erotic sideways in order to keep the interest always up. Thanks again to what we should call a first class crew sex and convolutions are never cheap and always pleasant if you don't mind erotic cinema of course but it could have been a much more poignant film with a stronger script and director. Altogether it is pleasant and always watchable it has its own moments and again its erotica is refined and as exquisite as its cast. And i personally enjoyed it quite a bit. Over all Senta Berger Borromeo Capucine and Ornella Muti especially manage to always keep the show extremely interesting and sublimating.. But it is not the masterpiece it would have clearly wanted to be. It is adapted by a novel by Peyrefitte called The Piano Teacher which was translated into Italian at the time as Ritratto Di Borghesia in Nero'A Portrait of Aristocrats in Black' more or less.. so to try to homage both Visconti's The Damned and Tinto Brass Salon Kittyand try for the same commercial success those great movies obviously had and still are today so well known for.".

The army obey codes of engagement and the goodies win. We identify with the heroes and frown at the villains we feel sad when the secondstringer dies and exhilarated when the actor with the comic role survives and so on.Civilians have no such luxury under occupation. This film deals with the dilemmas of surviving. with having to collaborate to a varying extent in order to earn a living in fact with the real dilemmas which only those who lived through the Nazi occupation can truly understand. Collaboration is a slippery slope well handled in the film as it is too in the French film 'Lacombe Lucien' where a feckless young man rebuffed by the resistance slips almost accidentally into collaboration for a bit of an adventure and some status.A recent article in the London press explained that the lengthy disquisition on the necessity of fascism in occupied Britain as voiced by an English militiaman in the film was in fact a profascist argument put forward by a real leading British fascist who made use of the film to expound his views. Within the context of the film the views are seductively subversive and dangerously convincing. Think Goebbels when he presented the war against Russia as a European effort to eliminate the Bolshevist menace. This argument appealed to many 'rightthinking' people in occupied Europe as barely a couple of years after the war many rightthinking people thought that the communist menace should be eliminated.As a result of the filmed fascist diatribe United Artists ordered Brownlow to remove this section 6 minutes I think and the film was originally screened without it.When the resistance to foreign occupation in Iraq is labelled terrorism well that is exactly what the German occupiers said about all resistance movements in Europe. Resistance movements included brigands doubleagents and ruthless operators as well as heroes. At the end of the war these movements settled scores with collaborators and presumed collaborators with unofficial executions running into the tens of thousands.Nothing wrong then in having the British resistance in this film shown as behaving mercilessly. That is what real war is about and if we can't identify with it then so much the better for those of us who never had to identify with an armed occupation either.".

To me it is still the best film about the occupation of a country by a foreign army. In his book How It Happened Here codirector Kevin Brownlow explains how he got the idea tomake this film. He just happened to be walking down a London street at themoment when a car screeched to a halt outside a shop. Four or so heavysetmen piled out of the car. They were dressed recalls Brownlow in greyovercoats in a style reminiscent of Russian KGB agents. All were bulky andacted in a furtive manner. It got Brownlow thinking what if.....On a budget that can only be described as miniscule it took Brownlow and his codirector Andrew Mollo eight years to complete the film. It's shot in aquasidocumentary style which makes it even more realistic. Their attention to detail is amazing considering the paucity of funds available  every uniform the actors wore was sewn by Mrs. Mollo. While I can't  claim to personally 'remember' those years when London wasbombed constantly I can recall the sound or should I say lack of it we were all inside a bomb shelter when a German V2 rocket nicknamed a doodlebugran out of fuel and plummeted to the ground. We were lucky it landed but a few streets away killing many many people  breaking  windows shaking chimneys and covering all our possesions in a thick layer of soot!".

Chamberlain was weak and despised and many Britons would have welcomed Hitler with open arms.In this film German troops are seen milling about Trafalgar Square but the film subtly reminds that they are Englishmen who joined the Wehrmacht  just as you can find them in the French Foreign Legion. The Germans had left the British Isles to fight the Russians. Some viewers will be offended by the newsreel footage that explains the Jewish problem. And some viewers will find it hilarious.

	schema:reviewBody "Upon first viewing It Happened Here I was struck by the poor quality of the film. However further viewings revealed the use of poor quality to be intentional. After reading of Brownlow's financial struggles in making the film I'm awed at his creative use of available funds. I say that this film is not for the average American viewer for two simple reasons. One is that the average viewer does not typically appreciate ideologicalexperimental films and this film is most certainly that. The second is because of the internationality of this film. The typical American viewer is used to seeing a quick plot development usually intertwined with some sort of attentionkeeper explosions comedy. The British of this film can be seen in its careful and to most slow development.If one however wishes to view an artistic film and has the patience and culture to do so I would highly recommend It Happened Here. I applaud Brownlow and Mollo for their vision and for their talent in presenting sensitive and critical issues in a such an appropriate manner.".

	schema:reviewBody "The history of the making of It Happened Here is pretty amazing. Think about it...Kevin Brownlow was 19 and his friend Andrew Mollow 16 when they started making a film. These two completely untrained teens worked on and off on a film and completely it about a decade laterwith a budget of only about 20000!! And you'd assume such a project would look like crapbut it doesn't. Using lots of seemingly documentary footage and mostly nonprofessional actors they made an alternative history film that looks for all the world like a traditional documentary. The premisethat Germany conquered Britain during WWII. Now I am NOT saying this is a brilliant film or that it's Oscarworthy materialbut considering all it was up against it's a wonderful film for young filmmakers and film students to watch in order to see what you can do with a minimal budget and lots of energy.The film begins in England in 1944. Although you see plenty of German soldiers running about many more of those in authority are ProNazi collaboratorsand they willingly take to antiSemetism and the usual Nazi rhetoric. While this notion offended many when the film debuted in 1966 this was a realistic scenario as locals did work hand in hand with the Nazis in many countriessuch as in France and the Ukraine. According to the film these local fascists were needed because the war against the Soviets was not going well and they needed all the troops they could spare just like what really happened in WWII.The story focuses on an Irish nurse who goes to work with the fascist British government. She is mostly apolitical but over time she is forced to take a standparticularly because her job sometimes entails committing atrocities in her role as a nurse. What is she to do? Play it safe and work with the authorities or become part of the Resistance? This is a film whose concept is far better than the actual filmand with good reasons. Because writerdirector Brownlow was filming this on the cheap he used 16mm film and the sound was often quite poorespecially at the beginning. There are also many lulls and scenes which look as if they should have been reshot. While amateurish looking it actually is surprising that the film looks as good as it does! After all the filmmakers really were in way over their heads. But they manage to produce some effectively grisly scenes involving atrocities and the killing of Nazis by the Resistance. I also was very impressed with the proNazi propaganda film that was shown in the theaterit looked quite real. And considering the film's background it's far better than it should be. All in all an amazing accomplishment but a film that could use some editing and polish. For the average person it's a bit too tedious to take seriously but for film students and cinephiles it's quite fascinating.".

Everything about it seems strikingly authentic. The attention to detail is meticulous the cinematography is inspirational the subject matter is horrific and so very nearly came to pass the poor sound quality and grainy black  white adds to the realism the dark and brooding scenes are terribly atmospheric.I was born in 1949 close enough to the end of World War II to almost feel I was a part of it. I grew up listening to my parents' recollections and 'the war' has always felt very real to me. So it chills me to the bone to contemplate the England I may have been born into. 'It Happened Here' should act as a warning to today's deluded souls who think Fascism has any place at all in our political spectrum. Anyone who thinks it glorifies Fascism and is antiSemitic has missed the point completely.First thing tomorrow I'm going to post it to my 16year old granddaughter studying Government  Politics. It should be made a compulsory part of the school curriculum.I can't thank Brownlow  Mollo enough for making this film and am just so sorry it took so long to discover it.".

	schema:reviewBody "A previous reviewer couldn't recommend the film too highly and said you owe it to yourself to see this.I can't go along with that.A lot of British people have tried to cheer themselves up with the thought that Hitlerism could never have taken root in Britain because we're all so jolly decent and we'd never have put up with Onkel Adi.This film does a pretty good job of saying Bullt! to that idea. Collaborating with the occupying power is a fairly obvious strategy for people who want a quiet life or hope for advancement in the new society because they don't believe that the occupation will be defeated.And if statemanaged news media tell you only what they want you to hear and portray things in an extremely odd light then it's not surprising that people start to believe this stuff and spout it themselves.The basic narrative device is to follow the adventures of an Irish nurse who claims to have little experience of or interest in politics. She loses her friends to an attack by the resistance partisans signs up after some agonising to nurse with the Nazi Action Brigade and then has some experiences which ought to open her eyes to the immoral horror of Nazism. It's a pretty useful device she gets to see both sides of things so the audience does too. But we don't find out really what she thinks of these things the filmmakers obviously intend the audience to draw their own conclusions.The message of this film is uncompromisingly bleak. Men and women are capable of much worse than they think fascism is a disease so virulent that one needs to adopt some of its own methods to have a chance of defeating it and very few people are immune to its temptations especially when agreement makes for a much less uncomfortable life.It's a very earnest film but it isn't very interesting dramatically. Showing that ordinary people are susceptible requires that the events be fairly routine in context otherwise the audience can put the behaviour of which they would obviously disapprove down to the effects of special circumstances. That's honest but drab ordinary lives tend to make for drab ordinary stories and this is no exception.I'd recommend watching it but don't expect it to be the highlight of your viewing week.".

That's honest but drab ordinary lives tend to make for drab ordinary stories and this is no exception.I'd recommend watching it but don't expect it to be the highlight of your viewing week.";

	schema:reviewBody "At the beginning takes place a murder of a Spanish writer called Galindo Gary Piquer denouncing crimes of the dictator  as he is executed by Trujillo's hoodlums . This is the story of Urania Cabral Isabella Rosellini a Manhattan successful lawyer  after 30 years returns to Repblica Santo Domingo to face her past and remembers her father's Paul Freeman relationship to Rafael Trujillo Tomas Milan  a.k.a El Chivo The Goat . Her life is turned upside down when she has a meeting to Dominican dictator as well as the events surrounding his assassination carried out by a motley group Juan Diego Botto David Zayas  among others . Based on the bestselling novel by Mario Vargas Llosa  it has well adapted  though adding some brief changes . It is less a feast than a somewhat rushed but thoroughly thoughtprovoking and the main difference from the source novel was the sacrifice of psychological nuance. The film deals with horrifying circumstances that altered Urania Cabral's life forever when she was a teenager well played by Stephanie Leonidas and grownup performed by Isabella Rosselini along with her relationship to Rafael Lenidas Trujillo for whom nothing in her present or future will ever be the same again . Good acting by Isabella Rossellini as a smart  kind and independent advocate at law whom returns to to face her past ghost . Terrific acting by Tomas Milian as a sadist and maniac tyrant  he steals the show playing a disgusting and loathing character  including some unsettling scenes dealing with his relationship to Urania CabralStephanie Leonidas . Being a SpanishBritish coproduction appears several fine Spanish actors such as Juan Diego Botto  Gary Piquer as well as British players such as Paul Freeman  Eileen Atkins  among others . Lavishly produced by Andres Vicente Gomez  the picture pays attention to period detail . Nice production design  all the exteriors were filmed in Santo Domingo but the studio filming was done in Spain . Colorful as well as evocative cinematography by Javier Salmones . The motion picture was professionally directed by Peruvian Luis Llosa Anaconda  The specialist  Sniper  he is cousin of Mario Vargas Llosa . The flick is based on fictional events as well as historical deeds deeds  these are the followings  Rafael Trujillo Tomas Milian was a real dictator of the Dominican Republic from 1930 to 1961 and the official President of the Republic from 1930 to 1938 and 1943 to 1952 he was the ironhanded ruler of this island paradise. Trujillo's character struggles with aging and the physical problems . During his thirtyone years of horrendous political crimes modernized the country's infrastructure and military but whose regime's attacks against its enemies overseas  particularly the attempted assassination of Rmulo Betancourt president of Venezuela led to the imposition of economic sanctions on the Dominican Republic by the Organization of American States in the 1950s. The resultant economic downturn in conjunction with other factors leads to the CIA supported assassination plot that ends Trujillo's life on May 30 1961. Trujillo's regime is supported by Johnny Abbes Garca Shawn Elliot the head of the Military Intelligence Service SIM a brutal man to whom many disappearances executions are attributed. Garca and his intelligence officers are notorious for their cruelty particularly their habit of killing dissidents by throwing them into sharkinfested waters. Trujillo's son Ramfis Trujillo R. Alamo  is a loyal supporter of the Chief. Upon Trujillo's death Ramfis seeks revenge even going so far as to torture and kill his uncle by marriage General Jose Roman for his part in the assassination conspiracy. Joaqun Balaguer Pericles Mejia  Trujillo's puppet president is also a supporter and initially his seemingly innocuous character holds no real power.".

Trujillo's character struggles with aging and the physical problems . During his thirtyone years of horrendous political crimes modernized the country's infrastructure and military but whose regime's attacks against its enemies overseas  particularly the attempted assassination of Rmulo Betancourt president of Venezuela led to the imposition of economic sanctions on the Dominican Republic by the Organization of American States in the 1950s.

It you want to know what is real and what is not then investigate about the Dominican history. This movie is a sad and interesting story of a woman that went through the same that many other women did in that time where the Dominican Republic belonged to Rafael Trujillo the Dictator for 30 years they also show the atmosphere of fear and lack of respect for the human rights. The movie is located in the last years of the period so we can see the conspiracy to kill him and the facts that leaded those people to do it. The performances of Tomas Milian as Trujillo and Stephanie Leonidas as young Urania were very convincing. The costumes were good but some of the ones Tomas Millian wears are big for him and it is very obvious. Isabella Rosellini is OK nothing to be remembered she just does the job.".

The other part Urania's history is a psychological drama history and it can be shocking but the idea is that it has to be it is the history of a trauma post raping and it's consequences in family and personal life. I think the movie is well guided and the two parallel histories are well related. But I have to say that sometimes it was a little difficult to follow context most in the scenes of the car.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie La Fiesta del Chivo Feast of the Goat actually frightened me.I retired to Puerto Rico in 1986. Most of my life I lived in New York State. I traveled frequently and extensively for more than 30 years around the United States doing trade shows for large global companies. More recently I visited the Dominican Republic a few times. I know many Dominicans living in Puerto Rico. Furthermore I vacationed through Latin and South America. I learned from this experience the difference between a Latino and an American political culture. The movie La Fiesta del Chivo Feast of the Goat actually frightened me.This movie is a about the brutal reign of Rafael Trujillo the Dominican dictator from 1930 up 1961 when he was assassinated. Rafael Trujillo was most definitely the Devil reincarnated. He was without a doubt a cruel psycho completely without decency or compassion for others. His specialty was to use his power to rape underage girls and degrade subordinates for petty reasons. Many of them would not dare protest. His subordinates followed him out of fear combined with greed that he may throw them a few crumbs as he robbed the economy of the Dominican Republic. What disturbed me the most about the movie is that I got the feeling that if Puerto Rico were not under the territorial clause of the United States Constitution it could easily be ruled today by a dictator like Rafael Trujillo Batista or any of the other Latin American dictators. The only Spanishlanguage republic in South and Latin America which never had a dictatorship is Costa Rica. The reason why Costa Rica was able to cultivate a national culture or mentality for continuous democracy is because it was never under the strong influence of Spain. It was left alone because it did not have gold or other mineral resources and was out of the way in the high mountains. It was isolated enough to avoid Spain's negative influence on its political development to be a democracy.I often wonder if these Spanish cultures of Latin Ameria do not understand how government by the people of the people and for the people functions. What is frightening is that the overwhelming majority of the Dominican people worshiped and blindly loved the brutal dictator Rafael Trujillo. When he was assassinated hundreds of thousands of Dominican people mourned and wept because of his death. Only a few knew or wanted to believe that he was the devil reincarnated. Only a very few Dominicans were joyful about his death. I will not bother to mention names but here in Puerto Rico today there is group of political power brokers who have a leader capable of becoming a Puerto Rican Trujillo. What stops this from happening is the presence of the United States Justice Department in Puerto Rico. I would not want to live in Puerto Rico if it was not under the American flag. The irony of history is that the United States government during the period of Rafael Trujillo's undemocratic rule actually supported him. They supported him because they decided he would keep the Dominican Republic from becoming communist. Trujillo knew how to use the fear factor to con the administrations of the United States regardless of whether they were Democratic or Republican presidents to support him as a leading Latin America anticommunist. He gave the false impression that he had a proAmerica foreign policy. Unlike the Dominican Republic during the Cold War years the United States government today is actually a safeguard to keep a dictator from coming to power in Puerto Rico. Since my arrival in 1986 there has been a steady parade of territorial officials being investigated convicted and sent to federal prison for federal crimes. The parade is still going on. This process of federal investigations keeps the wanttobe Rafael Trujillo's from getting too powerful. Behind his back the opponents of Trujillo refer to him as The Goat. Currently here in Puerto Rico one of the top government officials is also called The Goat. Can you guess who he is? If the United States Justice Department and the U.S. Congress did not have the power of theTerritorial Clause of the United States Constitution I would fear this Puerto Rican official called The Goat as I did La Chivo in this excellent movie.".

	schema:headline " More of a parody of the conservative movement";
	schema:reviewBody "As I read the reviews here of the film I see many comments of the type I think like that... which is further evidence of certain aspects of the hardright mindset than it is about problems with liberals. One can debate about whether something is funny or not I found this film funny for about 5 minutes the rest was boring and some of it downright offensive. First as full disclosure I am a liberal but am NOT a fan of Michael Moore. I agree with much of what he has to say but I think he loses the power of some of his arguments by being overly provocative I also find him unpleasant as a personality. But when we look at this film we see the basic problems of the conservative mindset everything is a caricature everything is so simple good guys vs. bad guys. One could argue that these could be a caricature of the movement itself but from the reactions here it would seem that those who liked the movie see it as socking it to those liberals...First let's look at the basic premise of the movie Mike Malone wants the 4th of July Holiday banned because he in his heart of hearts hates America. Um again I don't particularly like Moore but should a caricature not have some remote basis in fact? Watch Sicko watch Fahrenheit 911 watch Roger and Me. Where exactly is a hatred for America and patriotism? Exactly in which scene does this occur? What does he say to suggest this? In fact this is the typical reductio ad absurdum strawman that conservatives love to build  soinso is bad! He is fat! He hates America he loves terrorists. Don't listen to him or respect him. Take Moore's last film Sicko. Moore discusses the millions of Americans who are not give adequate help by the health care system. He touches on cases of people who have none. He compares and contrasts France and Cuba. Now instead of having a substantive discussion where conservatives say 1 I disagree with Moore BECAUSE.. 2 Moore's point on X is wrong BECAUSE... 3 The facts he presents on health care in Cuba are not true BECAUSE... instead we can engage in these childish stereotypes and name calling INSTEAD of addressing the fact that 46 million people including children have no health care in the US. Yeah let's laugh at the fat man who hates America..it's easier than addressing the issue at hand some people are literally dying because they got laid off or because their insurance company won't cover them. Thus the whole premise of the film is so flimsy and ridiculous. To the conservative mind saying it is bad that millions of hardworking Americans have no health care means you hate America. Objecting to a disastrous military policy in Iraq means you hate America. And the stereotypes abound from there. Michael Malone is taken through history a la Christmas Carol and shown that it is wrong to hate America...One of my favorite examples is how he is shown by the example of the Civil War that not all war is bad. Now let's dissect this a bit stereotype all liberals are against all war no matter what. As stupid as the stereotype that conservatives want war all the time. Fact is this is not true many liberals SUPPORTED the war in Afghanistan because the Taliban was housing bin Laden who was directly associated with the murder of our citizens. But just because you object to the Iraq war you are against every war in all cases. Yeah right. The civil war...let's think for a nanosecond about that that war was fought by people opposed to slavery in the Northern States against the conservative South. I won't go into the complex argument here about what each party Republican and others were very different then but I will point of that those red states that went Bush in 2004 almost exactly matched the slave states during the Civil War. Sure we are supposed to believe that those very conservative states where they sill want to fly the confederate flag today were the ones who were antislavery? Yeah sure. And then of course we have the portrayals of Muslims and Mexicans in the film. To the conservative mindset all Muslims be they from Morocco to Iran to Afghanistan to Indonesia to Sudan to America and Europe and Turkey are all the same...they all dress the same all talk the same...all are potential terrorists who hate America.And everything else is a silly stereotype too. Rosie O'Donnell is a fat lesbian with strong opinions. So therefore she should be laughed at and ridiculed not worthy of having an opinion. And for those who say It's a comedy lighten up... um I just found it not funny from scenes at Ground Zero real classy to cheap physical humor look at that fat pig Moore eat all in sight... it is light on the humor and heavy on the conservative fantasyAnd for those eager to say it is like Airplane um no. Airplane was funny because it was completely absurd. There were silly jokes many groups were parodied in a gentle way. Here it is all about building the strawmen and then trying to build a parody around that. Kind of like making a liberal film where George Bush is out on some hunting range shooting down Muslims for sport....Conservatives would not find that amusing and it would be as absurd as the Michael Moore hates all of America premise..And for those ready to proclaim typical liberal response you should know I expect to also pan Oliver Stone's film W when it comes out. Although I loathe Bush it is also a series of silly stereotypes which does not bring the dialogue forward...".

	schema:reviewBody "I loved Airplane! I think it's a staple on the American comedy scene. In fact I love several of David Zucker's movies but he seems to have lost his understanding of the American psyche in his last few attempts. An American Carol for instance could just as well have been a proNixon movie released soon after Watergate. I'm sure there will be a few who will find Zucker's portrayal of Michael Moore funny and they would likely find a Zucker portrayal of Martha Mitchell to be humorous as well. The irony comes in Zucker's failure to realize that most people side with Michael Moore on his opinions as well as the facts that support his opinions which Zucker pokes fun at by treating them as if they were untrue.As a Liberal I didn't expect to agree with Zucker's political views and yet I felt compelled to watch it and give it a fair shake believing that my difference in politics might not prevent me from finding it funny. Unfortunately An American Carol ended up being as disconnected from reality as I'd feared beforehand and I can't help wondering what Hollywood genius figured it would be a good idea to make fun of a controversial American political icon just as the vast majority of Americans were figuring out that his serious accusations were justified. If Zucker were around for the Boston Tea Party he most surely would have had a blast ridiculing Samuel Adams and those throwing tea overboard and I'm sure he wouldn't have spared American revolutionaries for wanting independence either because Zucker seems all about protecting the establishment no matter who it is and what faults it may have.I may sound motivated by politics but that's really not the impetus for my harsh review at all. We've all seen funny political humor that was driven by views that we didn't share but this is different because Zucker is trying to force humor that just isn't there. Michael Moore offers a plethora of opportunities for humor but there is nothing funny about portraying people as wrong when in fact they were right. And if I am wrong on this then I have a great idea for a satire about Abraham Lincoln foolishly trying to end slavery which I'm certain will have it's fans as well.".

	schema:headline " I was looking for an intelligent satire... instead I got An American Carol";
	schema:reviewBody "Because of the controversial subject of this film I will start off by saying that I am not a liberal. I am a constitutional conservative and also an Iraq War veteran. That being said An American Carol is an absolutely horrible film. Besides the type of lowbrow kindergarten humor that it shares with such films as Scary Movie Meet the Spartans Date Movie and every other modern spoof An American Carol also fails in its attempt to rebut leftwing rhetoric.I read one user review that said if you're a Republican you will find this funny. Republicans should find this comment very offensive as it suggests that a film filled with ignorant and inaccurate information would appeal to them. Any educated Republican should avoid this film because what it implies about them is almost as bad as the filmmakers are trying to say about the left.The film presents poorly thought out arguments to debunk supposed leftwing myths. An example of this is when the character of Michael Malone comments that President Kennedy would never have gone to Vietnam. In the scene Kennedy appears before him and suggests that he would have indeed gone to Vietnam and as evidence the film quotes a line from his Innaugural Address where he mentions that America will pay any price bear any burden. The speech itself makes no mention of the oncoming war in Vietnam and to use this quote as evidence for his position on that war is laughable. Although Kennedy alludes to being willing to fight a necessary war there is no evidence to suggest that he would have fought the war in question.Another example is when Bill O'Reilly and Rosie O'Connel are arguing about the terrorist threat. One of the arguments made by Rosie which is a common argument made by many liberals is that Christian terrorism is as big a threat as Islamic terrorism. Any student of international and domestic terrorism will tell you that this is simply not true. And a good way to refute that claim is to show the number of terrorist attacks and subsequent death tolls from both Christian extremist and Islamic extremist and compare them. The numbers will clearly show that in the present time Islamic extremists have engaged in far more destructive acts that Christian extremists. However that is a point that the filmmakers failed to address. Rather than approach the topic intelligently and in a manner that would educate the ignorant the film dismisses the argument and responds by pointing out the Christian terrorists don't commit their crimes with the same modus operandi that Islamic terrorists do and the film attempts to make its point in very juvenile fashion.The film carries on like this for its entire run time. Its extremely disappointing that a film that is supposed to represent the opinions of the right comes across as a Larry the Cable Guy skit. Any one looking for an intelligent argument about right versus left politics should simply avoid this film. I recommend reading The Revolution by Ron Paul instead.".

	onyx:emotionText "Because of the controversial subject of this film I will start off by saying that I am not a liberal. I am a constitutional conservative and also an Iraq War veteran. That being said An American Carol is an absolutely horrible film. Besides the type of lowbrow kindergarten humor that it shares with such films as Scary Movie Meet the Spartans Date Movie and every other modern spoof An American Carol also fails in its attempt to rebut leftwing rhetoric.I read one user review that said if you're a Republican you will find this funny. Republicans should find this comment very offensive as it suggests that a film filled with ignorant and inaccurate information would appeal to them. Any educated Republican should avoid this film because what it implies about them is almost as bad as the filmmakers are trying to say about the left.The film presents poorly thought out arguments to debunk supposed leftwing myths. An example of this is when the character of Michael Malone comments that President Kennedy would never have gone to Vietnam. In the scene Kennedy appears before him and suggests that he would have indeed gone to Vietnam and as evidence the film quotes a line from his Innaugural Address where he mentions that America will pay any price bear any burden. The speech itself makes no mention of the oncoming war in Vietnam and to use this quote as evidence for his position on that war is laughable. Although Kennedy alludes to being willing to fight a necessary war there is no evidence to suggest that he would have fought the war in question.Another example is when Bill O'Reilly and Rosie O'Connel are arguing about the terrorist threat. One of the arguments made by Rosie which is a common argument made by many liberals is that Christian terrorism is as big a threat as Islamic terrorism. Any student of international and domestic terrorism will tell you that this is simply not true. And a good way to refute that claim is to show the number of terrorist attacks and subsequent death tolls from both Christian extremist and Islamic extremist and compare them. The numbers will clearly show that in the present time Islamic extremists have engaged in far more destructive acts that Christian extremists. However that is a point that the filmmakers failed to address. Rather than approach the topic intelligently and in a manner that would educate the ignorant the film dismisses the argument and responds by pointing out the Christian terrorists don't commit their crimes with the same modus operandi that Islamic terrorists do and the film attempts to make its point in very juvenile fashion.The film carries on like this for its entire run time. Its extremely disappointing that a film that is supposed to represent the opinions of the right comes across as a Larry the Cable Guy skit. Any one looking for an intelligent argument about right versus left politics should simply avoid this film. I recommend reading The Revolution by Ron Paul instead.";

I am amazed at how many people want this movie to succeed or fail because they think that it has some great political significance. This movie is just an outrageous irreverent comedy like Airplane Hot Shots Naked Gun etc. Surely these actors and directors would have been capable of making a serious movie about their politics with serious comments on serious issues if that were their intention. Instead they made a movie that lampoons extreme liberalism with ridiculous characters on both sides of their story. News Flash Liberals are fair targets for ridicule and humor. You would think that this was a lampoon of a major religion or something the way people are reacting. Look around dudes! There is plenty of conservative lampooning going on out there! The movie is typical of its type and it is funny. The fact that it lampoons the far left makes it unique and a must see since apparently that type of Hollywood sacrilege is so rare that people don't even know how to react to this movie.Of course movies of this type never make a killing at the box office and critics typically hate them. Still there are plenty of warped people myself included who love outrageous comedy.If you are a mad dog liberal you may feel like the USSR is collapsing all over again while watching this movie. If you are a radical conservative you might feel that you are watching a documentary or maybe Best Picture of the Year. If you are a typical American with a warped Naked Gun type sense of humor then you are the target of this movie and you will find plenty to laugh at.I recommend this movie.".

Looks sort of like Michael Moore. His name is Michael Malone played by Kevin Farley brother of the late comic Chris Farley... and he is dead on as the Americahating film maker.His conversion begins when the spirit of General George C. Patton Kelsey Grammar visits him in a dream. Malone is currently leading a gang of protesters who are hoisting signs such as War never solved anything... but Patton reminds him that World War II ended the Holocaust.Later Patton plays his ace in the hole. How do you feel about slavery? Malone of course hates it. So Patton transports him back to Civil War days where Malone meets a plantation full of debased and humble blacks picking cotton... among them David Alan Grier and Gary Coleman all pleading with their white Massas to not whip them any more.Well? Patton says. Abraham Lincoln led this country in a great Civil War to eliminate the scourge of slavery. You still think war never solved anything? Not certain of anything anymore Malone just says We should all give peace a chance. So next stop is Nazi Germany where we see Neville Chamberlain Oliver Muirhead conferring with Hitler and Mussolini. The funniest scene in the movie  for me  is where we see Chamberlain polishing Adolf Hitler's boots. It's a perfect metaphor for Chamberlain's appeasement policies that handed half of Europe over to the German dictator.There are dozens of great scenes and genuine laughs in almost all of them. But the funniest involve a trio of totally inept Muslim terrorists led by Aziz the excellent Robert Davi. They aim to blow up everything in their way but end up only blowing up each other. Interestingly Aziz was also the name of the head terrorist in the Arnold Schwarzenegger comedythriller True Lies 1994.To top it off there's a line stolen from Casablanca 1942 that most beloved of all antiNazi films. At the end when Malone is finally convinced that America is on the right path he and Patton shake hands and the general says Now I know our side will win. Good proAmerican comedy that will make you think. It's rated PG13 for a few curse words and of course those exploding terrorists.Dan Navarro daneldorado93yahoo.com".

	schema:reviewBody "...apparently. That was what this movie was telling me. But rather than degenerating into the usual argument of left wing vs. right wing politics  I'm much more interested in addressing the distressingly high rate of prejudiced bigoted and downright hateful moments in the film...The first five minutes of the movie portraying terrorists in Afghanistan contain a joke that the terrorists are all apparently named Muhammed Hussien. Now I'm not expecting the screenwriters of this flick to have done any research but this is both completely inaccurate to the sects of Islam in Afghanistan and reductive and lame The Terrorists are all EXACTLY the same therefore easy to hate. Why look at them as human beings at all? Moments later we are treated to a racist depiction of Mexican immigrants seen as cheap labor for the terrorists because honestly Mexico MUST have a worse economy than Afghanistan. Joke or not this is literally the last time anyone who is not white will have a speaking role in the movie until we meet the slaves more on that later.There are no women in major roles in the film apart from the exceedingly small role of Michael's assistant. Otherwise they are either sex objects for leering screeching menstruating witches or butch angry lesbians. Sometimes a mix of those. A conservative female in my viewing group was so put off by the bigoted depiction of women that she spent half an hour muttering to herself and not watching the screen.Most egregiously this film is openly hostile to any religion that is not Christianity and I'm guessing Evangelical Christianity at that. Islam is of course shown as being simply the religion of terrorists and no one else. Judaism is given a backhand slap in a scene where Mike is shown the future if we had not fought the Civil War he ludicrously lives in the South and owns slaves. At one point they begin to serenade him with Hava Negila. Everyone in my viewing group threw up their hands at this blatant antiSemitism. Correct me if I'm wrong but Michael Moore is Catholic right? And also if there were a South that was its own country I'm expected to believe a LIBERAL would be living there and owning slaves in direct counter to his beliefs? Nice try movie... But that still doesn't distract me from wondering why you hate Jews. Later American soldiers are shown having a Christian prayer meeting just before going off to fight the good fight  which is a pretty direct insult to all our brave fighting men and women who do not ascribe to that particular belief system. My best friend who signed up for the Army days after 911 was really ticked off at the flick by this point. And nobody appreciated the slapstick humor set at the site of Ground Zero. Not cool.I don't mean to be reductive but this kind of film reflects the low level of public discourse in our country. Suddenly belonging to a political party has become some kind of moral imperative and some people now act like they are allowed to treat those who do not ascribe to their views with outright hatred  no more giving those they disagree with the respect they once enjoyed as fellow Americans to state their beliefs and live alongside them. Bob Hope snuck jokes at the expense of Democrats into his movies but always with the good humor that goes with knowing we are all citizens who love our Constitution and the freedoms we are all entitled to no matter how we differ on fiscal or social policies. If you are a conservative I would hope that you have the intelligence and decency to look past the superficial preaching to the choir in this movie to see the irrational hate below and shun it. And if you cannot do so or heaven forbid support the bigotry expressed in this film I would counsel YOU to either start loving this country and our freedoms or leave it.P.S. As a personal note if somebody who reads this who knows David Zucker please tell him that if he's going to trash on documentary movies as not being real movies over 20 times throughout his flick he might want to make a movie that looks like it cost more than a hundred bucks. My girlfriend makes documentaries  you can suck it David Zucker.".

There are so very few conservative films that are made it's refreshing to see something that doesn't paint the United States as the bad guy.I have read some very bad reviews about this movie because it treats people wrong. One scene from the movie shows Rosie O'ConnellRosie O'Donnell on Bill O'Reily's show. Her new documentary is about Radical Christianity. In it we see people having to go through immense security to board an airplane because of the Radical Christian bombers. This is a satire about all the people in America who say it is wrong to blame those of Islamic Religion for terrorist attacks. Not all Muslimsare terrorists but those who are terrorists are Islamic. That is the fact.This movie brought to light how America now is not the America we used to be. This country was not founded on fear or caution. Those who fought in the Revolutionary War and those in the Continental Congress were fighting against the world superpower. And we won. We shouldn't be painting our country as an evil nation. As Michael Moore's films say Overall this film is a must see. It is funny and truly shows us how we look when we do such unpatriotic things. For those who say the Ground Zero scene was inappropriate just remember who made a documentary about what they think really happened on 911. GOD BLESS America!!".

I also heard an interview with director David Zucker who said that his brother wanted to make sure that no one thought he was in any way involved with this.

What else do you expect from a movie with Leslie Nielsen? All Three Stooges similarities aside no minority group is safe from being a punchline here. The humor is bold and edgy at times. The point of the movie would seem to be that Michael Moore is a leftwing pinhead a bloated selfindulgent fool whose lies are shameful and hurtful to America. But there is a greater message here. Average Americans will bust a gut laughing at the silliness of the slapstick comedy.

I definitely recommend this movie it's got a great patriotic message and I believe it reflects how a lot of people feel who Aren't in the mainstream media or Hollywood. That is indicated by the fact that our theater was packed and everyone was cheering through it and applauding at the end. i expected the theater to be empty. we had to sit in the front row cuz it was so packed!!! it's nice to know that others feel how we do".

The central characters are a young workingclass gay couple who don't fit his image of the new Chueca. The film is loosely adapted from a Spanish comic book of the same title.There's strong acting all around including a charming performance by Carlos Fuentes who had previously appeared in Km0. Sard and Velasco are their usual wonderful selves the former playing a neurotic police inspector and the latter playing the motherinlaw from hell.I was particularly curious to see Soto in a film role since I mostly know him as his television alterego the manic club kid known as el Neng whom he played for years on latenight television. Here he gives a wonderfully goofy performance as a police detective.Don't look for subtlety or profound meaning in this film but it's a fun way to pass an hour or two.At the festival screening I saw in Philadelphia the English subtitles were basically good but problematic at spots. The translator missed all the references to American pop culture misunderstood one or two bits of the dialog and there were typos and spelling errors. Hopefully this will be fixed before it's released on DVD here.".

It's just a light hearted picture poking fun at some gay nonsense  or at least that's the way it played tonight with the crowd. The lead women are fantastic if a bit OTT but the whole movie is so OTT any other characters would seem stupid. For my money Carlos Fuentes as Rey was worth the price of the admission alone! If you like a fast moving story that has a few twists plenty of bearish camp nonsense and a lot of laughs then you'll probably enjoy it. If you are looking for a film with a deep message then avoid it. Any movie that has a pensioner mother slagging off her son's boyfriend by saying he has an arse 'like a Japanese flag' is never going to deliver much in the way of earnest discussion of the themes afterwards....".

This light hearted black comedy about a psychotic real estate agent killing off the neighborhood's elderly ladies in order to sell their apartments to rich gay couples had a lot of potential that was unfortunately lost. The movie presents itself as a light and cheerful comedy when the subject matter is anything but. This ultimately works against it and makes the scenes which were meant to be unsettling or tense just fall flat. A rewrite or two of the final draft and the hands of a more competent and creative director could have turned Boystown into a darker horror tinged thriller while still maintaining all of the comedy elements present in the story. Furthermore the third act was a complete messwith a couple of small plot holes and one huge plot hole the size of a football stadium ruining any potential this film had left. However this movie still has its strengths even though they are woefully out numbered by its weaknesses. The performances were excellent especially by all of the leading ladies. The dialog was very sharp and witty and provided some laugh out loud moments plus all of the main characters bar the serial killer actually had some development and depth...particularly the male lead and what could best be described as his 'mother in law' . Also the three different story strands did not clash with each other and gelled surprisingly well.Overall the film still only manages a 6 out of 10 from me. It could have been a lot better if its was darker and not so infantile.".

While these might be a bit of a spoiler for the Madrid market it is so subtle as to have no effect on other viewers. The irony that a homophobic counsellor was played by a drag queen was well placed.I would encourage people to see this film for themselves and don't let comments put you off. Be your own judge !".

	schema:reviewBody " Warning it could contain some Spoilers I went to see this movie the release date in Madrid. From the first minute everything is predictable and the general tone of the movie is defined by the names of the old lady kittens Aznar Acebes... all from the members of the former right winged government of Spain 19962004.Ads say it's a comedy mystery movie in Chueca the gay quarter of Madrid more or less like Castro in San Francisco. But neither mystery no much fun as comedy during the whole duration of the film.As a comedy it does not work just a couple of good gags mystery is inexistent. For a broad audience is boring as they won't understand most of jokes. For a gay audience is only enjoyable by all those who likes listening to the same old jokes again and again. The only valuable thing is the work of Actors. Concha Velasco is incredible in her role even though some of her dialogs are unbelievable also Rosa Maria Sard does her best at a completely stupid and unbelievable role.Losers and low class people are heroes and posh people are the evil ones. That could be funny if the final message weren't so close to the bipolarity of the Spain's politics and maybe society influenced by mass media. What is most irritating to me is about knowledge and culture. Director shows that as if it were a sign of posh people. Knowledge has nothing to do with remembering 100 fashion designers that's nonsense.Another problem is that all jokes are too private for gays that lives or visits Chueca frequently. Too old ones listened too many times for local gays.The jokes against PP right winged political Popular Party renamed as RR are too local to Spain and even to Madrid. The parody of the visit to Chueca by the wife as a counselor of the former President of the government Jose Maria Aznar is somewhat naive and inspired in the naive shows of transvestites common in some Chueca clubs. Maybe in the 80's could be modern not now maybe it would scandalize the Right Winged bigoted Spaniards for the rest is somewhat pathetic.Finally I hate the twisted message about bipolarity unluckily very common again in Spain. Good left winged losers ignorant but with good heart ones against right winged posh iceheart fashion victims or metrosexuals the bad guys. As if it was everything that simple. There's no room for the rest for the majority don't identified neither with PP nor PSOE neither with extreme masculinity nor femininity neither being fat hairy bears nor shaved fashion and body fitness victims. Neither with ignorant only reading comics or sport press Marca nor the ignorant only reading fashion magazines... I expected to see more diversity but on the gay side we have also so many stereotypes as the heterosexual world to see us as a group.Just for fans of the old Chueca humor.".

There's a real estate salesmen in Chueca who is obsessed with not only making money but toning up the Chueca neighborhood. I'm not sure if there's a Spanish equivalent for rent control but I've seen many an American film with that as a basis. True in real life many landlords will do whatever to get out old tenants of rent controlled units so they can rent them to upper middle class Yuppie types. Only in the gay world they're called Guppies. We learn right away it's this handsome charming real estate guy doing the evil deeds. When will the authorities and the community know is the crux of the plot.I'm not mentioning any of the players because I doubt most Americans will have a clue as to who they are. The real estate guy reminded me a bit of Christopher Meloni.Who does him in? Just the hardworking working class gay men and lesbians and the mother of one of them.

	schema:reviewBody "I actually don't like film adaptations of anime there's something crazy about trying to follow a series that's roughly 12 hours in length down to a suitable movie format of 1.5 to 3 hrs. What surprised me about the film adaptation of Gantz is how well they adapted the idea of getting transported to a room relentlessly by a alien sphere to fight aliens shortly after your own death instead of simply trying trying to mash the plot into a shorter format. They kept most of the aliens but changed a lot to the series which is pretty refreshing after it had been out for five years. Also the film is just as brutal and violent as it is in the anime maybe even more so with the film's added realism.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Gantz";
	schema:reviewBody "If you think that only Hollywood is tapping deep into comic book source material for its films well they're not alone with the Japanese also digging deep into its rich manga culture for adaptations to bring to the silver screen. It's taken Gantz quite some time to reach our shores given that the concluding sequel had already been aired weeks ago and we're only getting the first installment but as I say it's always better late than never. Based upon the original works by Hiroya Oku Gantz is a science fiction fantasy film that posed a lot more questions than it answered and really asks that you put aside nagging thoughts and accept things for what they are at face value until the second film rolls along.We're introduced to the teenagers Masaru Kato the popular Kenichi Matsuyama and Kei Kurono Kazunari Ninomiya who meet by chance at a subway station once best friends with the latter always standing up for the former. They get involved in rescuing a man who had fallen onto the train tracks but in the process get themselves killed yet transported into some sparse apartment room together with strangers all of whom had their life expired and a huge black orb to whom they owe their temporal lives to. Here's where a lot of questions get tossed up as to the origins of the orb and some thick existential queries  are they really dead or operating on a separate limbo plane or are really just dreaming  but put all of these aside to just soak up the ground rules that the characters have to engage in and the set action sequences that come with the territory.To help make the narrative a little bit more palatable treat it as an extreme version of Men in Black where a randomly selected group of apparently dead folks get topped up into an existing team all of whom are given exoskeleton suits to power up and weapons fit to kill aliens who walk this earth. Gantz the orb within which houses a comatosed bald man communicating via a console on the orb summons the players sets the mission objectives and teleports them into the thick of the action. Survive and you get to live another day. Die and you'll stay dead permanently. With a catch of course where a Gantz summoned player earn meagre points in a mission in addition to getting insulted and a 100 points allows one to either wipe one's memory and go back to the real world not remembering a single thing when serving Gantz or opting to resurrect a fallen comrade.The first hour or so is spent learning the ground rules and what better way than to be thrown into the deep end of the pool in an effort to immerse both the characters and audience in double quick time. Our main protagonists with their different perspectives and values often come up clashing against once another in their ideals but when push comes to shove it's a life and death issue should they choose not to cooperate with each other and with others in the same boat unless of course one decides to use the clueless newbies as fodder.The story's made more interesting with this particular contrast between the two leads one being very reluctant to shed more blood and taking it upon himself to ensure that the newbies are properly briefed and told of the risks involved often being ridiculed while the other sees his new life under Gantz as an opportunity to rise up and be the hero he's meant to be since in real life he's a zero this presents him a chance to answer what would be his calling in life bordering on arrogance and partaking in riskier maneuvers. But alas given the need to cram everything into a slightly more than two hour film you can bet that plenty of characterization and development got thrown out of the window and subplot casualties include the romances between Kato and buxomy Kei Kishimoto Natsuna Watanabe and that of Kurono and fellow student and manga enthusiast Tae Kojima Yuriko Yoshitaka whom I suspect will have a much larger role in the concluding film.Surprisingly there is plenty of bloody violence and gore peppered throughout the film sticking close to the treatment as in the manga and anime with only the gratuitous nudity in the source materials being toned down by quite a bit in the live action movie. Computer generated graphics are the order of the day as plenty of futuristic weapons got produced in addition to the skin tight exoskeleton suit. Villainous aliens take on different looks from robots with awkward mobility to inhabiting statues of Buddhas that give rise to one of the largest action sequences in the film that came complete with high casualty and property damage. Undoubtedly a special effects extravaganza Gantz is ultimately half a film and I am looking forward to the concluding episode to wrap up the open questions posed here. After all the sequel's subtitle is Perfect Answer so I'm really hoping for that to happen. Stay tuned during and after the closing credits for that trailer to the sequel and tell me if that doesn't pique your interest even more so much so that like me I'm putting that anime DVD collection on my wish list. Recommended!".

The most insulting part is when they are inside the museum and the shiva type statue decides to wait around while the injured characters have their big dramatic moments and then decide to fight.

	schema:reviewBody "To start with I enjoyed the Gantz movie.When it comes to movies versus books it's a hard choice to make when deciding which is better.The Manga is definitely the best.But here's what I've concluded with comparing books and movies...Movies are made not to necessarily follow the book word for word. Gantz really did a decent job with following both the Manga and the Anime. Yes stuff was changed around. Most movies do such a thing.I am upset that the driving basis for the character Kurono is gone... He was very sexually frustrated and found out how to play the game better due to this fact... And the violence was toned down tremendously.. But overall I found the movie to be enjoyable.The thing about watching a movie based on a book Or an addition to an anime series is that they want to change things. What fun is it to read a book and see the exact same thing happen on screen? It's kind of interesting to find something different happen in the story compared to what you had read.I am very familiar with the series I'm on my third time through the Manga as we speak. The Character designs are great and the development is wonderful. Though I can disagree on Kurono's character in the movie... They popularized it.Going from a perverted teenager who just wants to get laid to a I want to be successful character is quite a jump but them doing Kato... Hit the nail on the head... I can't make a full on review at the moment until I see part two and how much they encompass with it. Considering the Manga is still ongoing and the movie claims that it's going to be an end makes me think that Phase 3 will not be part of this set and it will be like watching the Anime all over again...Final Thought The movie did the manga justice for what I had seen of it. Minus the sexual tension immense violence and extensive swearing Which are all major portions of Gantz but could be toned down to be more friendly... Especially for a two hour movie They hit the story and overall aspects of the series on the head. No it's no word for word by the Manga but who cares? Instead of seeing the same thing repeated why not enjoy a new twist on the story that still follows the major guidelines?".

	schema:headline " How NOT to make a Gantz LiveAction Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Characters Step 1Get the main characters from the AnimeCartoon or MangaComic depending on which of the two stories you like best since they both have different story lines. Step 2 Change their background personality or just anything about them around a bit to suit your personal preferences Say the main characters are around 15 years old but that doesn't suit you just make them 19 Y.O. if that affects the main story just changeomit bits of the story since this is an action movie and you are just doing a portion of the AnimeManga the consequences of changing some of the story basics won't be shown or noticed. Step 3 If you see characters from the AnimeManga you like but aren't meant to appear in the portion of the original story you have selected for the movie change the story around so you can incorporate them. Again feel free to carry out Step 2 with them. Step 4 Change how they affect the main story. You can substitute what happens to one character by something similar to what happens to one of the other characters. Example Kishimoto puts on the black suit first then is the first with the suit to attack the alien which is what Kurono was meant to do. Step 5 With the Aliens Select the ones you like and which go with your selected story copy their best image and main skill and just alter the rest size other skills number personality etc.. Repeat Step 4 with the Aliens.Location Try to select locations similar to those from the original source and change locations where the story was changed. If you can't find one of the bigger locations find a group of small ones that contain the same elements as the big one of course you don't need to use them the same way they're used in the original source just make sure to show them sometime so fans of the original source can say Hey that's where that thing happensedis supposed to happen!. Also remember we edited the story previously and have a max. movie length and budget. So for example we won't be needing a wooden house which comes crashing down since we removed that scene along with all new characters it involved and made the movie 20 mins. shorter that way even if that eliminates half of what happens in the scene from the original source.Objects and the like Select the iconic objects from your original source. Since the rest of the movie isn't looking too good spend a lot to make them look as cool as possible. That way even if viewers don't like the rest of the movie they will still remember it for the cool objects it had.So to summarize what i thought of the Gantz LiveAction Movie This is not a Gantz LiveAction Movie this is a Gantz looselyparalleluniverse LiveAction Movie. They took the original names and general looks of the characters from the AnimeManga shortening the number of characters by at least 75. They took the cool SciFi stuff like the suits and weapons. A few of the locations from the original story. A few of the key moments from the story rearranging them in the order they wanted. Then they just filled in the gaps sometimes with other stuff from the original but not connected to that eventcharacteretc. others just inventing it themselves even if they are complete opposites from what appears in the original. Worst thing is they could have made MOST of it the same if they had decided to concentrate on a smaller portion of the original story. Instead they chose almost a third of the story from this 11 year old Manga for the first movie and i'm guessing another third for the second. I must say i am a great fan of Gantz and Japanese stuff in general and the longer i watched the harder it was to not close my eyes and block my hearing with my hands.Now for those who don't really care about the Gantz bit the movie itself isn't good either. Acting in most cases seems fake or exaggerated a feeling i'm sure was accentuated by the English voices. The pacing of the movie could have been greatly improved. The personality of some of the characters seems to change to the opposite quite easily. Some of the action scenes seem surprisingly dull. Etc.Unless you happen to be a Gantz fan a specialeffects andor coolstuffingeneral fan or are just very bored this movie is not worth watching. I would have given it a 2 or a 3 but i'm guessing the original Japanese voices would be much better than the English dubbing i HAD to hear and be worth an increase to a 4.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a lot better than I expected although I wish I'd known Gantz 2 was actually a sequel that was better than the original or at least a vital part of what should have been a multiepisode miniseries. If I had watched both together I would have enjoyed much much more. I assumed it would be a light fun scifi popcorn movie but it has much more depth than that in the end which makes it truly satisfying. It suffers from a dialogue issue I find with a lot of Asian import films whereas the humor or exposition doesn't quite translate to English but that's not really a fault so much as to be expected. It was a wise decision to use Asian actors to do the English overdubs  and the cast do an excellent job of mimicking to the tracks although clearly not speaking the vocal. The director has a clear and concise vision here and is completely successful in finessing the photography although he really shines in Gantz 2. The action and fight scenes are a joy with the wireacrobatics and choreography you'd expect. Against the alien mutants in Gantz1 they are great to watch but against the more human aliens in Gantz2 they're much more appreciated. Gantz1 has more of a humorous undertone to it than Gantz2 although that turns out to be a mistake when dealing with the robot mutant he's a badass where Gantz2 is much more sinister and dark. There are no glaring plot holes save one in G2 that I assume just got left on the editing room floor in either piece. Plot is fluid and not plodding. The production budget is greatly increased in G2 and it shows. The ending of GantzGantz2 as a set piece is perfect with very little room for any attempt of a Gantz3  Resurrection!! and that makes it even more satisfying. Cast is capable and believable even past the leads. Don't watch one without the other you'll benefit.".

	schema:headline " Good manga makes for a very good movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "I only know the summary part of the manga so I will stick to the movie itself. The movie starts with two old friends ?  that coincidentally meet on a train platform. In this brief moment they attempt to rescue a man off of the train tracks and in trying this they are killed by the oncoming train. Or were they? The two awaken in a room with a few other strangers all of which claim to have been killed. Accompanying them is a mysterious black orb which gives some very vague instructions on what the group needs to do. Basically the task is to kill aliens that are on the earth hiding out. Sounds corny but it is far from that. The movie is so well filmed including cinematography editing locale that pretty much whatever the group was sent to do was going to be a treat. Lucky for us viewers it was an exciting mission at that. As the movie progresses we learn that each person is awarded points for surviving since if not well they are dead and what can be done with those points is part of the mystery. The effects are very good and basic not overdone at all. This makes it much easier to get into the film and the characters in it. The acting was very good even if I personally had to be distracted from their performances by reading the subtitles. Either way I could tell by visual features and expressions that it was well done. Each encounter gets more and more difficult as one would assume and leads to a very open ended climax that makes you want to see more. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from start to finish and recommend it to anyone that likes scifi and originality. Please Hollywood can you keep your hands off and not remake this let the Japanese do their thing they have brought us a gem in this as it is. Enjoy. 6.910".

	schema:reviewBody "I am not a fan of the Gantz manga and I have not even read it. I don't really read manga and comics. So when it comes to a liveaction adaptation I am clueless about the characters but I can make out with the adaptation's explanation or the adaptation may even prompt me to pick up the manga. Gantz as far as I know is famous for its overthetop violence and nudity. I saw many criticisms on the adaptation saying that it lacks of blood and nudity. For a general moviegoer who does not know what to expect in the adaptation will find this a little bloody and will wish for some more nudity.The story There is a sick game which revives dead people and commands them to play along. Their tasks are to kill aliens. Aliens!!! Once an alien dies the players are given points according to their contribution to the death of the alien. A number of points will reward that person. Gantz is touted as a bigbudget action scifi movie. And yes it is. The big action scenes especially the final one show that much money is spent. The aliens look okay but are unique in some ways. Characters wise is okay some are a bit interesting but some are just there for sake of being there. The pace is decent for a Japanese movie not to say that all Japanese movies are slowpaced. Watching this feels like watching the Japanese doing a Hollywood movie which is decently paced and features big action scenes. With the final movie completing this series it will be expected to end with a cliffhanger.Overall It is good for a Japanese action movie it could be one of the best I have seen. But for a character movie it could have done better. It is worth a watch whether you are a Gantz fan or not. Since fans are saying that the manga has more violence and nudity I am compelled to pick up the manga and to see if it is true. For a nonGantz fan I can't wait for part 2 which will conclude the movie series. Sadly Singaporeans will have to wait.".

	schema:headline " Sato Shinsuke's entertaining scifi film Gantz is one big tease...";
	schema:reviewBody "Sato Shinsuke's highly anticipated bigbudget liveaction adaptation of Oku Hiroya's hugely popular Japanese comicmanga series Gantz is an engaging glossy and outstanding highoctane popcorn action movie with imaginative and stellar visual effects. While fanboys will appreciate Sato's faithful interpretation of the manga Toho does a great disservice by only releasing a disappointingly dubbed version outside of Japan. The dry disengaging and monotone voice acting dampens an otherwise terrific movie experience.As mentioned Gantz is a currently ongoing comic series in the weekly publication Young Jump by talented artistwriter Oku Hiroya. Oku's story takes elements from a variety of sources including the seminal Japanese jidaigeki drama Hissatsu Shigotonin AKA Sure Death movies such as Men In Black and Alien and Takami Koshun's landmark novel Battle Royale among others to give us perhaps one of the most interesting scifi stories to come out in a while.Gantz begins with the tragic deaths of childhood friends Kurono Kei played by JPop boyband Arashi member Ninomiya Kazunariand Kato Masaru played by Death Notes star Matsuyama Kenichi who die trying to save a passenger who had fallen onto some subway rail tracks.Although they get hit by an express subway train they find themselves miraculously alive in a mysterious Tokyo apartment room amidst other strangers who had befallen similar tragic and accidental deaths. In the center of the room is a gigantic metallic sphere with a digital screen display and various compartments which house an assortment of advanced and hitech weaponry.Among the other contestants in the room include the mysterious and sadistic High School senior Nishi Joichiro played by Prince of TennisNana 2's Hongo Kanata the buxom and pixiehaired Kishimoto Kei portrayed by the gorgeous Natsuna who had committed suicide after breaking up with her cheating boyfriend and recently laidoff salary manoffice worker Suzuki Yoshikazu portrayed by Tetsuro and Kamen Rider The Next star Taguchi 'Tomorrow'.The metallic sphere who calls itself Gantz informs the assembled contestants that they need to hunt down various alien invaders disguised either as humans or other objects in order to earn points. Once 100 points are accumulated and won by any individual contestant they may choose to either 1 erase their memory and return to normal life or 2 resurrect any of the other contestants who had previously died in a mission.Thus begins the epic adventure of these individuals as they play the game to win their freedom and to resurrect their fallen comrades in arms.Oku's fascinating world of Gantz is recreated in loving detail by Sato's amazing direction and vision. It helps that Screenwriter Watanabe Ysuke does an admirable job of condensing and streamlining Oku's original multivolume story to give us a good introduction and look at the primary characters that are involved. While there are some subplots that don't quite work for instance the budding relationship between Kurono and his college classmate manga Otaku Kojima Tae played by cute Yoshitaka Yuriko I thought it was a bit much and didn't really add to the character development although in the manga it is better done. Gantz's strength however is definitely in the superb visual effects which are eyecatching and nicely done. In particular the various weapons used by the contestants the Gantz powersuits XGuns etc. look amazing and the alien effects are spectacular.It's hard to really critique the original character acting as the English dubbing actors really sour the performances. I'm not sure if there was a general disinterest in the material or perhaps not a clear understanding of the story but one can tell just from the monotone and often lethargic voiceovers that the actors were probably just reading lines.As good as Gantz was ultimately it was merely a big tease for the sequel which is scheduled for later in the year. As with the recent trilogy 21st Century Boys or even the final chapter of Harry Potter Gantz felt like an elaborate setup for the next film which promises to be even better than this film.I wish some of the other elements of the manga could be brought into the movie as in the manga we get quite a spectrum of interesting alien hordes that get hunted some of the aliens disguise themselves as various mythological entities and deities. It does get touched upon somewhat in this film particularly at the end.While wishful thinking I hope that Hollywood does not remake this film as Sato has delivered a perfectly good movie that could probably do well abroad in a subtitled version. Yet knowing the arrogance of Hollywood producers it's probably only a matter of time before an eventual American version comes out. Let's just hope they at least they give due credit to Oku for delivering one of the most exciting scifi comics in a long while and to Sato for capturing that excitement in this film. Let's also hope that Toho does not dub the 2nd film as I believe Gantz and the performances of its principal cast Ninomiya Matsuyama Natsuna Hongo deserve better treatment.".

It was very difficult to discover it and when I did I had hard time to see which one was the 1st. Anyhow the trouble was worth it! I initially thought it was going to be some cheap B movie or at best some American style movie with some guys wearing some special suits and facing some monsters. Although one could say that it was not far from it the whole idea was very differently approached. This movie has mystery action and drama. Actors are very convincing characters gain depth and the whole story draws you into becoming addicted to it. I never see any sequel immediately but this thing really got me and rushed into number 2 the day after. I didn't know the anime or the manga but now I want to see everything.All in all 45hours of splendid story Uturns and action. What anybody could need more?".

	schema:reviewBody "Review may contain spoilersThe anime Gantz  is a brilliant story about a young man named Kei Kurono who has a bad attitude towards society and he's a gigantic pervert. He ends up waiting for his train ride at a busy train station some where in Japan forgot the station nameonly to come across a complicated situation that involves his old school friend  Kato. A bum falls onto the train tracks  Kato jumps down to help the old fool and Kurono is forced into a situation where he should play hero something the live action didn't do. After saving the drunken bum  Kei and Kato have no time to jump up the walls away from the tracks so they end up running for their lives away from the train. Before they know it both friends are struck by the train with the crowd shrieking in horror by the horrendous blood bath!Kurono and Kato are then teleported into a bare naked room  with other Japanese people and they are all confronted by the merciless Gantz sphere.Here Kurono and Kato are forced to battle alongside fantastic supporting characters such as Kishimoto Masanobu Hojou the beautiful Sei Sakuraoka and many more memorable characters. These characters fight to survive fight to win points fight horrendous and arduous battles against their own emotions and their capabilities to actually use the Gantz suits to fight their battles.They all fight at a chance to win enough points to go home together.What I love about Gantz  is the dramatization of every situation and just how unbelievably cocky Kurono is. Kei Kurono is bad ass in the anime from start to finish  in the live action...this isn't really the case. I can't say that I've fully enjoyed the Gantz liveaction movie. My freetoair television network allowed me to take a look at the movie and because I'm a huge fan of the anime series I was more then happy to give the movie a go.Here are just a few things wrong with the filmA The story of Gantz liveaction was rather confusing. Like even though I've watched the series there wasn't enough or anything to reel you into the story. It just starts of as Kei at a train station waiting for a ride  there is one lame ass attempt to make Kei a perv by having him look at a giant poster of a beautiful Japanese girl and then that's it really. And then the plot stutters all the way. If a person never watch the Gantz anime series before  I wouldn't be surprised if those people were scratching their heads going  I don't really get it. BI am not sure why it's so hard to replicate a scene from an Anime but the way Kato and Kurono died was completely bizarre to me. CThe movie was dull 60 of the time with very little dialog...too much standing around and staring and each other like Zzzzzzzz...I was always waiting for a joke or a swear word or a pun or more life from the other characters but none of this happened. D None of the characters really kicked ass...In the anime  each character had a moment. Kato was just boring...he just mopped around all the time. He lacked compassion like he did in the anime  like I get that the Japanese love to dramatize their characters in this way but he just lacked something...E Not enough character development...in the end I just didn't care about the characters because they all died before we even got to know them lol.F The awkward bloody close ups of their faces and the over the top crying again there wasn't enough character development not even between Kei and Kato the two friends for Kei to be so upset he could die knowing that he'd lost a friend. Like the emotions on the faces of these actors were awkward to watch S!Some good points about the storyThe suits are awesome Kishimoto was pretty hot Kei came out on top in the end briefly and the computer generated scene of the laser beams teleporting the characters were pretty awesome. The monsters were pretty cool  took me back to the anime.410 Some good points about the movie but it will never ever compare to the anime nor the manga but is was entertaining to watch either way. Give it ago you might enjoy it more then I did.".

Therefore Asian quality movies are now coming more from other countries.'Gantz' has its origins in a popular 'Seinen' Manga for adults which were in Japan also successful as Anime series. It starts up with a mystery. A few people are rematerialized in a room after their obvious death. The machinery responsible for their resurrection uses unimaginable technology but orders them to fight against socalled 'Aliens' and to gain points like in an ordinary videogame. Confronted with their first mission the people react different some of them are killed but most of them are completely disturbed.Until the first mission the movie is from a western point of view intriguing effects and design ideas are announcing a decent mysterysf experience if the audience isn't aware of the MangaAnime.That lasts about 10 maybe 15 minutes until one realizes that any further impressing film experience will not happen. If you know the Manga or the Anime series you know that the movie won't bring any deeper insights than disturbed people hesitating to pull the trigger even when it goes for their second life and Aliens mostly waiting for being destroyed between cheesy dialogs. Most of the Anime's sexual content and language is absent in the movie but not the inexplicable behavior of the participants both human or alien or directorwriterproducer.Furthermore there is no real mystery as one who is not familiar with the 'Gantz' Manga may hope. It's simple simple simple. The machine is for playing the game it's not something between the realms of death and life it's no matter of Karma or God or the Devil. It's a machine built for a game built by someone and this someone isn't even a computer nerd version of an AVP predator. So there is no revelation no development. There isn't even a noticeable story anymore.Between the fights the survivors are released to the real world so they may continue their lost life until they are transferred to the next mission where new dead people arrive mostly to be killed because of their freezing despair women or dumbness men. The reallife part of the characters between the missions is mostly lengthened and could have been cut with very little effect.If someone would argue that there are insights shown to the abysms of human behavior or the illness of the society or something that goes one millimeter deeper than Video Game Shooting I could not disagree more than to that. I would accept it for 'Gamer' but not 'Gantz'.Overall the movie could have been cut to some 75 min. length and as a result it would be slightly entertaining for an audience with an IQ greater 70.People who expect a decent Japanese movie will be deeply disappointed. There is a CGI quality to mention but asides from the flawed plot there is too much overacting and screaming to keep the level at least in the B class.".

But as Joe and Claire prepare to open a bottle of champagne their idyll comes to an abrupt end. A hot air balloon drifts into the field obviously in trouble. The pilot catches his leg in the anchor rope while the only passenger a boy is too scared to jump down. Joe and three other men rush to secure the basket. Just as they secure the balloon the wind rushes into the field and at once the rescuers are airborne. Joe manages to drop to the ground as do most of his companions but one man is lifted skywards. As Joe Claire and the other rescuers watch this strangely beautiful sight they see the man fall to his death. Recalling the day's events at dinner with his friends Robin and Rachel Joe reveals the impact the accident has had on his battered psyche. Ironically the balloon eventually lands safely...";

	schema:reviewBody "Out in the country for a nice picnic Joe and Claire get involved in a ballooning accident that leads to the death of one of the men who came to help. Joe seems to get over it but he does obsess over whether or not he could have done more. This obsession is fed when he begins being stalked by one of the men who was also involved in the accident  Jed who appears to believe that Joe and him are close and belong together as a result of what they shared. As Jed continues to get close Joe appears to be coming apart putting a great deal of strain on his relationship with Claire.When I went to see this film I had no idea whatsoever what it was about and the first four minutes of the film had as much of an impact on me as I'm told the start of the book did. With the accident that is frighteningly convincing the seeds are sown for a film that is about love mental health and about a sort of Fatal Attraction vibe. I use the last description with reservations because I don't think this is comparable to Fatal Attraction because this has so much more to it than just the bunny boiler stuff. Instead the story mixes it with Joe's own sanity crumbling at the same time as Claire's 'enduring love' for him is put to the test. I have not read the book but for my money the film did this pretty well producing plenty of good dialogue that meant the film was more about the character of Joe than it was about Jed. This is not say it is totally perfect because it isn't the fatal attraction thing easily takes the focus meaning that some parts of the audience may feel that this is the whole ball game and that all the 'talking' is what gets in the way. For me I felt the other way the fatal attraction thing weakened the film when it is the focus and for this reason I didn't like the extra ending during the credits because I felt that the open ending had done fine on its own.The writing is good but the film relies very heavily on the performances and luckily they are all good where they need to be. Craig is fast becoming someone who is headed for big things not only does he have the body of a star but he can really act too. Here he is a convincing 'normal' person and his initial polite bemusement by Jed is realistic as his gradual descent into instability himself. Morton may have less time but she is equally convincing and realistic in showing that love always has limits everywhere except in the movies. Ifans is good even though he has the roles of the religious fanatic mentally ill homosexual stalker to deal with. Whether or not it was wise to link all those aspects or not is one matter but Ifans still does well  never really resorting to showboating or easy 'mad man' stuff. I wasn't totally won over by him because Craig was my focus but he still did well. Support from Nighy Lynch etc is OK but really they are minor roles and not anywhere near the centre of the film.Overall this is a strange film and anyone who dismisses it as being a rip off of Fatal Attraction has totally missed the point. Instead the film looks at love at sanity and relationship all in a wellwritten script that is well delivered by a couple of very good actors in the lead roles. Not to everyone's tastes then and not the easiest one to really put into a nutshell but interesting moving and satisfyingly lacking in gloss throughout.".

Michell is ably assisted by a first rate cast including Daniel Craig as Joe who was brilliant in this year's British gangster blockbuster LAYER CAKE and Rhys Ifans from NOTTING HILL is splendid as the gay stalker. Samantha Morton also deserves praise as Joe's lover and it is sad to know that ENDURING LOVE isn't likely to find an audience beyond the arthouses.

	schema:reviewBody "If I could sum up Enduring Love in a word it would be unusual. Not in the sense of bizarre but just very unique it doesn't do many things the way a normal film does. The first highly unusual aspect is that it begins as a quirky arthouse drama from which emerges a surreal tragic event in the opening and which gradually transforms into a thriller ala Brian De Palma all while keeping one foot firmly planted in the arthouse drama arena. If you know nothing of the plot beforehand and that's the way I prefer to watch films if possible it's extremely difficult to predict where this one will go.The focus of Enduring Love is Joe Daniel Craig a young professor who is courting a young sculptor Claire Samantha Morton. The opening images of the film are beautiful landscape shots of English farm country. Joe and Claire are about to enjoy a picnic when a hot air balloon comes almost crashing down in the field near them. A man is trying to stop the balloon by holding on to a rope attached to the basket. A young boy ends up in the basket alone. Joe runs to help as do a number of other men who happen to be nearby. Just when they think they have the balloon under control it takes off again as if by a large gust of wind. They can't hold it down and everyone lets go except for a doctor who was driving by when he witnessed the beginnings of the incident. The boy is still in the basket and the doctor hangs on until he's too high to let go. Eventually we see him fall to his death. Joe and Jed Rhys Ifans go to find the body and Jed asks Joe to pray with him. Joe is uncomfortable with this but finally acquiesces. After everyone's lives are getting back to normal Jed suddenly contacts Joe and says he needs to talk. He hints at Joe knowing what he wants to talk about but won't say exactly what it is. Jed won't let up. Joe keeps running into him in odd places day after day but Jed won't just speak straight with him. What does Jed want and what will Joe do about it? Enduring Love is based on a novel by Ian McEwan and many people have criticized the film for being different than the book. I think that's a mistake please see my novel to film minirant marked in bold red in my user profile. This is a fine film that should be judged on its own merits. It's not flawless in my opinion but it commendable for its uniqueness among many other assets.Much of the film hinges on the mystery of what Jed wants or what is wrong with Jed. One of the benefits of watching without any knowledge of the plot is that it opens up a wider field of possible answers for Jed. One of my favorite genres is rubber reality films ala Mulholland Drive 2001 eXistenZ 1999 and so on. If you're acclimated to those films there are strong intimations that maybe Jed is going to turn out to be Jesus or a guardian angel or the devil or something similar and metaphorically perhaps he does turn out to be some of those things. On the one hand it sometimes feels like substantial swaths of cryptic dialogue go on far too long in the film but on the other hand such dialogue is necessary to sustain a high level of suspense.Director Roger Michell also keeps us somewhat in the dark about Joe. We can see that he's a professor of some sort but it's not clear what he teaches. He could be a philosopher a sociologist a psychologist or some other kind of scientist. We only know that he's written a book naturally enough in the era of publish or perish and that he buys the basic tenets of sociobiology ala E.O. Wilson Wilson is an entomologist often crediting with initiating sociobiology in his books Sociobiology The New Synthesis 1975 and On Human Nature 1978. Scriptwriter Joe Penhall includes a lot of dialogue in the film including Joe teaching where he expresses a somewhat nave sociobiological view of things like love and meaning. This is just one way that Michell sustains a subtext related to the title of the film. Other ways include the fact that most major characters are having some relationship problems and of course the principal conflicts are related to the title. Joe can be somewhat cryptic in his emotional arcsthe point was probably to undermine the veracity of the sociobiological view. In any event Craig does a great job with the character. Ifans is excellent also but that's to be expected.Just as unusual as the plot is the cinematography. Director of photography Haris Zambarloukos provides consistently intriguing and varied visuals from the expansive bucolic landscape shots to an unusual claustrophobic fisheye with blurred edges sequence during one of the most crucial moments of the climax. The cinematography isn't usually showy but it is unusual nonethelessyou just have to pay more attention to it if you want to notice it.I also loved Jeremy Sams' score which had a Carter Burwell flavor. Sams is able to provide emotional momentum when the film otherwise cannot see below but it still perfectly fits the austere atmosphere. Like Burwell Sams has a knack for unusual harmonies and disarming simplicity.For me the only real flaw to the film is that it is sometimes not very engaging. Perhaps it's ironically appropriate to the subtexttheme but Michell often keeps the film a bit cold and aloof feeling. If Sams score wasn't in place during certain sections they might feel almost leaden. But even with that flaw Enduring Love is a good film well worth watching if you're looking for something different.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am normally a fan of Ian McEwan's fiction but have never got round to reading Enduring Love so came to this film with an open mind. It has its positive aspects beautiful English countryside quasiVaughan Williams soundtrack some good cinematography particularly in the excellent opening scene which is by far the best part of the film. For the most part however it is a case of watching good actors wrestle with a dire script and an implausible plot. There are many weaknesses in the script but the most obvious is its failure to give any of the characters any real sense of where they come from what motivates them and why they behave as they do. For example Joe the main character is a university lecturer I gather from what I've read about the film that he is a science lecturer but this is far from apparent from the short lecture sequences we see in which he is seen talking about love which he suggests is a matter of biology. He could be lecturing in English sociology psychology  there's no obvious scientific context to what he's saying. Although he was apparently about the propose to his partner Clare before the accident in the opening scene there is some unspecified strain in their relationship which prevents her being at all supportive when his problems begin but what this is remains completely obscure. There are numerous other glaring omissions of information. One of the most irritating things is the lack of any sense of timescale it's not clear if the events take place over days weeks or months.Perhaps the plot worked better on the page. Joe witnesses a shocking balloon accident following which he suffers nightmares and flashbacks but neither he nor his partner nor his friends ever consider that he might be suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder and suggest counselling. They are all highly intelligent Guardianreading types  surely one of them would have suggested he should get some help. He never sees Jed the stalker after the accident until Jed telephones him. But an unusual accident of this kind would undoubtedly be followed by an inquest at which evidence would be called surely they would have met there? Joe becomes the victim of Jed's stalking but never considers contacting the police or seeing a solicitor. At one point Jed is standing late at night opposite Joe's house. He suggests that Clare look out of the window to see him she just stays in bed. Even if she's is sceptical about Joe's tale of being stalked surely she would have had a look? Daniel Craig does his best with the part of Joe Rhys Ifans is reasonably good as Jed my experience as a lawyer of stalkers is that they not generally as obviously barmy as Jed but that is the fault of the script not the actor there's a good performance in a minor role by Bill Nighy. Samantha Morton as Clare is quite shockingly poor she delivers her lines in a stifled mutter and appears to have only two expressions  sullen and very sullen. Perhpas with the lines she is given you can hardly blame her.Many years ago Ian McEwen wrote a play called The Imitation Game for the BBC. It was a subtle thoughtful sad and elegantly written piece about selfdeceit and male attitudes to women. Twenty years later he is responsible albeit with a coauthor the much praised playwright Joe Penhall for this lazilywritten film. In recent years he seems to have found a role as novelist to the middle classes  the message is Look although we may appear to be comfortable and welloff nasty things happen to us! People stalk us! We are menaced in the street by thugs this is in his latest novel! You shouldn't envy us  we really have a horrid time! Those of us who can remember his early novels and short stories The Cement Garden First Love Last Rites may feel that this is not progress.".

We are given some wonderful shots of the beautiful British landscape at the centre of which there is couple on a picnic. However a hotair balloon appears to be on the loose and what follows is a terrible accident that effects their lives. 'Enduring Love' is visually impressive mostly due to the excellent cinematography and the background score contributing to the scenes. Penhall's writing is very good sharp dialogues unfolding events welldefined characters but in the middle it gets a bit slowpaced. The stalker subplot could have been done with less focus that extra scene during the rolling credits wasn't necessary and the film may have been stronger without it as it was working better as a movie about Joe and his fragile relationship with Claire. The movie is pretty much character driven and it heavily relies on the performances. Fortunately this is where 'Enduring Love' scores high. Daniel Craig breathes into a role that seems made for him. He portrays Joe's guilt confusion patience and determination with amazing skill. Samantha Morton has less screen time but she is just as good while she gives a beautifully understated performance. Rhys Ifans springs a surprise in remarkably playing a homosexual stalker with Clerambault's syndrome. Bill Nighy and Susan Lynch are adequate in their tiny roles. For me 'Enduring Love' has been a strange movie watching experience but as I thought more about it I grew to understand and appreciate it more. It does have its flaws as mentioned earlier but it's a good character study and visually interesting.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me take care of the plot in the most economical way and move on to explore what the movie have not read the book is really about. In a freak and traumatic accident one of a few strangers trying to rescue a boy falls to a grotesque death while the boy ended up being unharmed. One of the survivors Jed an obviously mentally disturbed character starts stalking another Joseph a professor leading to a critical turning point of the latter's life.Many including professional critics make the superficial association of this movie with Fatal Attraction. They cannot be more wrong. The movie is very little about the neurotic threat posed by Jed and still less about homosexuality despite the male kiss scene at the end. The focus of the movie is on the relationship between Joseph and his girlfriend Claire. Otherwise why would you need an actress in the calibre of Samantha Morton. Jed the stalker is merely a catalyst a tool  has to be in view of the degree of transparency and predictability of this clich of a character.Much more for the attentive audience to chew on is the relationship between Joseph and Claire. Right from the opening picnic scene we notice the awkward somewhat impersonal relationship between the lovers who would have been living together for some time. During the candle light dinner with some other people right after the accident Claire's care and concern is reciprocated with impatience and annoyance. Best however is the birthday dinner in which director Roger Michell Notting Hill lets the silence and nuances do the talking. This has to be one of the best scenes on such situations something that Hollywood will not maybe cannot? give you. I am reminded immediately of another British movie Young Adam.The use of silence if quite noticeable especially in the first scene. Even when I had read about the plot and was anticipating the accident I was quite shaken. On reflection I realise that not the best crafted piece of music or topnotch sound effect can produce the sense of trauma the way this movie did through silence.With the title of Enduring love the movie challenges you to contemplate various meanings of the story and the subtexts. There is first of all the battle with one's own sense of guilt on the who let go first question. There is also the consuming jealousy of the dead man's wife that turned out to be a faade. There is of course the twisted obsession of Jed. The movie does not give an answer. The simplest love between Joe and Claire does not stand the trial and when Claire can stand far away enough to be able to sculpture Joes's face we know it's over even if she had not made it so obvious by announcing it.Rhys Ifans deserves the praise he gets for portraying the neuroticturnedpsychopath but such roles are usually easy for a capable actor. Much more difficult is Samantha Morton's a normal person without eccentricities. She has to be right on with her emotions and timing to get the part just right. This reminds me of another nothingtosinkyourteethinto character played by Minnie Driver in Owning Mahowny. Both are first class acting jobs. Daniel Craig who played the husband in Sylvia a similar academic character is generally praised and deservedly so. Although outwardly absolutely normal Joseph is on one level just as disturbed as Jed fighting his own demons. The accident is just a catalyse exposing his fragility. Finally while only in a minor support role I really love seeing Bill Naughy a versatile actor who never failed to give me pleasure to watch from the flamboyant singer in Love Actually to the monstrous vampire in Underworld to most recently the engineer in The Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy.".

When asked if they felt the film perpetuated the negative stereotype of the mentally ill being violent director Michell dismissed the allegation out of hand before Rhys Ifans stepped in with a quickhit oneliner about being completely sane but I'm feeling a bit violent about that question. That should do it for intelligent discourse at THIS QA thank you...The camerawork is a bit distracting not necessarily because it's handheld but because the reason for it  which Michell did say was to represent a first person POV  is so obvious. In particular there are a few scenes in which the camera sneaks around behind walls and windows to catch a better view of the characters that screams you're being watched which generally sums up my main concern about the film it telegraphs almost everything.For a psychological thriller it isn't nearly as taut or unpredictable as it needs to be. It also lags notably between plot points content to bleed off any steam it may have picked up from a previous scene. Part of this problem could be caused by the trailer's reliance on exposing nearly every twist in the film and part of it could be on the film's overuse of thriller music that in the cut I saw nearly overpowered all five senses every time it appeared in the mix.However the acting is generally impressive yet understated. Daniel Craig does a wonderful job at portraying the complexities of a rational man who comes unhinged in the aftermath of a bizarre accident and the resultant stalker he's burdened with. And there was at least one twist that made me jump so all is not lost on the tension front.Last thought I was stunned by the film's equation of homosexuality theology and mental illness.

It is not the most extraordinary thing in cinema nevertheless it is a very good movie dealing with the topic of madness in one of its most singular forms the erotic delirium.

	schema:headline " A thoughtprovoking and perfectly performed piece of work.";
	schema:reviewBody "Having never read Ian McEwan's original novel from which this film is based I can't rightly judge whether or not this was a successful adaptation. However I can say that as a standalone work Enduring Love is one of the more interesting films to be released within the last couple of years and as a successful British film is one to rank alongside other recent UK successes like Dead Man's Shoes and Vera Drake. Having watched the film a couple of times I was left with the urge to go away and discover McEwan's original novel as was the case when I saw the film adaptation of his other keywork The Cement Garden as the film although highly interesting and emotionally engaging certainly left me asking a lot of questions.The opening scene really sets the mood and pace and of course the plot for the rest of the film... not to mention standing as one of the most exciting engaging and downright jawdropping moments of visceral cinematic tensionbuilding that I've seen in a long time. Here director Roger Michell juxtaposes the lush greenery of the Oxfordshire countryside  with it's rolling hills and vast oceanlike sky  with a billowing blood red hotairballoon waving as dangerously as the frantic handheld cameras that capture the action. The editing is punchy and creates a rhythm that works towards heightening the confusion felt by the characters as the quiet countryside picnic of writerprofessor Joe and his sculptress girlfriend Claire is disrupted by the sight of the balloon and the appalling tragedy to come. As the story progresses the couple try to put the event to the back of their minds and carry on as normal with their comfortable bourgeois lives of luncheons dinnerparties  workrelated accolades however when another one of the witnesses to the event contacts Joe out of the blue we see the beginnings of a bizarre and dangerous relationship that will push all three protagonists beyond the regular boundaries of reason.Some have likened the film to something like Fatal Attraction with the idea of obsession and guilt both featuring as central to both... however for me Enduring Love was much more of a treatise on the nature of love and the whys and wherefores of such. For example it is important to note that Joe is a professor who studies the nature of love and the human qualities one would require to endure love when in reality it is the unhinged and unwanted fellow witness Jed that really understands the true sense of blind obsession so central to such feelings.The style of the film manages to be both lowkey and visually distinctive with Michell employing a style similar to his previous film The Mother with handheld cameras that offer a reality  but also manage to convey the wavering uncertainty and voyeuristic intrusion so central to the plot  coupled with staccato editing optical filters rich composition and an extraordinary use of locations all captured in glorious 235.1 widescreen. The performances are of an extremely high calibre as well with Daniel Craig bringing a smugpomposity but also a vulnerability to his role of the logical professor pushed to an illogical limit whilst Samantha Morton offers support as the bewildered Claire who has to question Joe's mental stability as he begins obsessing about the accident and his newly acquired friend. However much more impressive if only for the fact that he delivers a performance completely against every other role I've ever seen him attempt is Rhys Ifans who embodies the lonely and perhaps somewhat disturbed Jed with a quiet contemplative spirit that goes against the kind of melodramatic raving lunatics found in similar Hollywood endeavours.The interplay between the three characters is wonderfully handled by Michell who paces the film deliberately so that the relationships only becomes truly apparent over a gradual period of time. Now this may infuriate some viewers who expect a much quicker film that gets straight to the point but I for one admired the gradual build and felt that it made the relationship between Joe and Jed much more metaphysical bringing up all kinds of questions about fragmented personalities twohalves of the same soul repressed guilt angst sexual frustration and schizophrenia whilst also forcing us to question who is really insane? This is just one question that the film left me with as the credits began to roll with Michell and screenwriter Joe Penhall leaving a lot of minordetails unresolved thus allowing the audience to fill in the blanks. Again this may annoy some viewers... and I must admit I myself was left scratching my head on a number of occasions not least the scene that takes place after the final credits but having gone back and watched the film a second time you realise that so much of the emotional background and the character motivation is there in those great performances.It's certainly a film that will leave you with something to think about if not only the relationship between the characters then certainly the rationality of them leading up to that tense edgeoftheseat final. For me Enduring Love was a great film that kept me interested throughout and left me with a lot of questions that have been running through my mind over the last couple of weeks. I appreciate the fact that a lot of viewers seek some kind of emotional resolution from a film but I feel that people who don't necessarily expect every single loose end to be neatly tucked away by the end credits  or those that enjoy thinking about both the characters and the story once the film has come to a close  will certainly enjoy and appreciate this.".

Amongst the aftermath where all but one survives including a scruffy looking loner named Jed Ifans who asks Joe to join him in a mournful prayer for deceased. Reluctantly obliging the stranger who has shared a truly traumatic event sets the course of the film into a helter skelter portrayal of love gone wrong amidst an uncommon bond.Joe an academic is suddenly plagued by the odd Jed on a regular basis showing up unannounced with a request to speak to him resulting in Jed's immediate crush on him sending him into a state of anger confusion and wrestling with the other dilemma he has harbored wishing he was able to do more to save the man who perished in the accident. Joe cannot get this out of his system that he should have conceivably prevented an unnecessary death while Jed cannot get Joe out of his system in delusionally believing they were meant to meet under dire circumstances underscoring the prevalent unspoken desire to be with one another.Joe also is making life difficult with his relationship with Claire an artist who is very deep into her work and cannot deal with Joe's obsession and subsequently Jed's for that matter. What follows is a tale of mixed emotions homoerotic overtones the fear of intimacy the knowledge of failing to stop an unstoppable nightmare and ultimately the amount of psychological damage one can endure in the name of love.Director Michell  who helmed the diverse 'NOTTING HILL' and 'CHANGING LANES'  practically melds the two an English romance with an action thriller in his adaptation of the novel by Ian McEwan by Joe Penhall  mixes the taut tension expertly particularly in the calm before the storm and then into the eye of the hurricane in the opening sequence which sets the aftermath in motion. Craig  best known as Paul Newman's fkup gangster spawn in 'ROAD TO PERDITION'  echoes Richard Harris with his craggy middleclass good looks and slight brawn as Joe allowing the shades of grey to immerse himself as the film progresses largely from his point of view in utter disbelief at that madness unspooling and Morton counter balances with just enough attitude and frankly seems to be playing the male role in the couple i.e. the strong fairly silenttothepoint tolerance of her mate.It is Ifans best known as Hugh Grant's grotty flat mate from the aforementioned 'HILL' who surprises in making his sad mildmannered loner into a uniquely frightening force to be reckoned with not seen since Glenn Close's downward spiral of carnal obsession in 'FATAL ATTRACTION' which feels like a carbon copy of but holds itself on not being only a suspense thriller but a uniformly smart adult drama.

	schema:reviewBody "I foolishly watched the film because I studied the book and it was probably the worst mistake I made. A lot of people will be drawn in by the trailer but unfortunately the trailer holds all the best parts of a film which misses the integral parts of the novel and because of that suspense is ruined somewhat.While slight name changes are acceptable what isn't acceptable are the cutting of some of the mainstays of the book. One of the few scenes out of the film which I felt was missing was the library scene in the book where Joe goes to study and is watched by Jed. Also missing out of the film is the part where Clarissas colleague is shot by Jed whilst they're having a meal and the desperation for Joe a rational man who wants himself free from Jed and his quest goes in search to find a gun whilst being high.While Rhys Ifans was great casting for the character of Jed I felt that Daniel Craig was miscast. I couldn't hear what he said for the mumbling half the time and think there are better actors who could've played the role better.There are also scenes that try to be too intelligent and could lose the viewer. The scene where they're eating at the table and Clare Clarissa becomes angry. There must have been some kind of coding in it but I couldn't understand which made me as a viewer feel patronised. Because half the scenes are cut from the book and the character of Joe isn't well played you end up feeling sorry for Jed rather than thinking of him as abnormal.

	onyx:emotionText "I foolishly watched the film because I studied the book and it was probably the worst mistake I made. A lot of people will be drawn in by the trailer but unfortunately the trailer holds all the best parts of a film which misses the integral parts of the novel and because of that suspense is ruined somewhat.While slight name changes are acceptable what isn't acceptable are the cutting of some of the mainstays of the book. One of the few scenes out of the film which I felt was missing was the library scene in the book where Joe goes to study and is watched by Jed. Also missing out of the film is the part where Clarissas colleague is shot by Jed whilst they're having a meal and the desperation for Joe a rational man who wants himself free from Jed and his quest goes in search to find a gun whilst being high.While Rhys Ifans was great casting for the character of Jed I felt that Daniel Craig was miscast. I couldn't hear what he said for the mumbling half the time and think there are better actors who could've played the role better.There are also scenes that try to be too intelligent and could lose the viewer. The scene where they're eating at the table and Clare Clarissa becomes angry. There must have been some kind of coding in it but I couldn't understand which made me as a viewer feel patronised. Because half the scenes are cut from the book and the character of Joe isn't well played you end up feeling sorry for Jed rather than thinking of him as abnormal. You can see his anger for Jed but in some scenes it looks like he loses it for no reason at all...while these are the signs of a desperate man there isn't enough ammunition to react in that way and so the viewer feels confused.I loved the book and still do but I feel that the film is a massive letdown.";

There is a young boy inside who is asked to jump out but instead he pushes the device for lifting and it flies away.

When they arrive it is obvious he is dead the men feel helpless. Jed who has tried to have Joe look at the dead man is a man who at first seems harmless but he will reappear again in the story.Jed who lives with Claire a sculptor is a university professor. He can't forget the scene he witnessed. What appears to be an easy going relationship gets complicated because suddenly Jed begins to obsess with the accident. Even their good friends Robin and Rachel begin to get concerned about Joe's mental state.Jed the man in the field reappears innocently enough one day. He becomes a nuisance that Joe can't shake. It becomes obvious that Jed has fallen in love with Joe something totally unexpectedly. Joe can't shake this man out of his life until he shows up at Claire's studio where he and Joe have a final confrontation.Roger Michell seems to be the right man for bringing this strange story to the screen. Ian McEwan's novel of the same title serves as the model for a film that has nothing to do with traditional love. The title itself is deceiving one wonders who really is the who endures the love in the story. Is it Jed whose love for Joe is unrequited or is it perhaps Claire who sees her life shattered after an innocent day when her life with Joe was at one of its best moments? Joe Penhall's adaptation of the novel works well in the film.Daniel Craig gives a good performance as Joe the man who awakens a love on another man and can't cope with what is doing to his life. Rhys Ifan's Jed is the more interesting part because one has no clue if he is serious enough or whether he is mentally insane because of the way he pursues Joe. Samantha Morton does a fine job as Claire something that is always the case. The supporting players are good as well. Bill Nighy Susan Lynch and Corin Redgrave especially enhance the picture.It must be noted that Jeremy Sams' music score works brilliantly in the film. The cinematography of Haris Zambarloukos and Nicolas Gaster's editing make the film much better. Finally it is Roger Michell who pulled it all together to bring all the characters of Mr. McEwan alive for us in the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The opening sequence of Enduring love is as powerful and gripping as you might have heard. Unfortunately that's one of the only two virtues of the movie the other being Daniel Craig's work. I almost never recommend movies only for the acting and Enduring love is not going to be an exception to my rule.The main character is a professor called Joe Daniel Craig. One day he and his girlfriend Claire Samantha Morton go for a picnic in the English cottage. Suddenly they see a hot air balloon with obvious stability problems which are leading to a potential tragedy with a young boy and his grandfather involved. Joe goes to help as do some other men who happened to be around at the moment. The rescue does end tragically when one of the men trying to help dies in a horrible way. Later on we find Joe hasn't been able to move on and he's deeply disturbed by it. Things start to get even worse when another of the men involved Jed Rhys Ifans begins to stalk him.After a very promising start the movie goes downhill and fast. The middle part is basically a series of repetitive sketches about Joe's obsession with the accident and Jed's obsession with Joe and how all of this is affecting Joe's mental stability and personal life. After a while the end comes about very abruptly and there's nothing good enough in it to reconcile us with the story.The movie is a chaotic mishmash of a number of different elements posttraumatic anxiety obsession guilt complex and reflections about the essence of love and falling in love which could have been used to compose an interesting movie. Unfortunately this was not the case and every one of the several questions posed at the beginning is left unanswered. We are left with little more knowledge about the characters than we did at the beginning and this leads to a highly dissatisfying cinematic experience. My final impression was that there might have been a point to the story but it got lost in the way maybe due to too much ambition and trying to put too many messages together.".

	onyx:emotionText "The opening sequence of Enduring love is as powerful and gripping as you might have heard. Unfortunately that's one of the only two virtues of the movie the other being Daniel Craig's work. I almost never recommend movies only for the acting and Enduring love is not going to be an exception to my rule.The main character is a professor called Joe Daniel Craig. One day he and his girlfriend Claire Samantha Morton go for a picnic in the English cottage. Suddenly they see a hot air balloon with obvious stability problems which are leading to a potential tragedy with a young boy and his grandfather involved. Joe goes to help as do some other men who happened to be around at the moment. The rescue does end tragically when one of the men trying to help dies in a horrible way. Later on we find Joe hasn't been able to move on and he's deeply disturbed by it. Things start to get even worse when another of the men involved Jed Rhys Ifans begins to stalk him.After a very promising start the movie goes downhill and fast. The middle part is basically a series of repetitive sketches about Joe's obsession with the accident and Jed's obsession with Joe and how all of this is affecting Joe's mental stability and personal life.

Torrente has a great big package and he'd like you to look at it  he is a bungler detective that deserves to be repulsed . Fourth entry in Torrente series  the masterpiece of earthy films  starred by the most grotesque detective and well played by Santiago Segura  he is a real private dick  a poster child for police corruption . Featuring politically incorrect private detective Torrente  he is a macho man  lazy  rude  sex maniac  drunkard  Athletic fan  caring only about protecting and serving himself . He is a Bad Santa of the police force  a peculiar and fatty man  being a El Fari fan  too . Despite that  he still manages to get the job done . Torrente follows the exploits of Jose Luis Torrente  an uneducated man acting for his own selfish purports . In previous outings Torrente was rejected from police duty and he returned to private investigation . A four film package that is with the quartet of Santiago Segura's massive cult hit comedies arriving on Us streaming platforms yesterday . The botcher exdirty private eye forms a new band of underdogs Paquirrin  Barragan  Caita Brava to carry out a killing  being hired by Ramrez Enrique Villen but Torrente is imprisoned . Here crooked cop Torrente breaks out prison to seek revenge those former sidekicks betrayed him . As we find our antihero in a delicate situation but he can count on to help him some people  his equally freak friends .This is 4 installment sequel in Torrente series are each starred written  directed  performed by Santiago Segura as the repulsive sleazy and frequently drunk Torrente  an exofficer of the law who refuses to accept his expulsion from the police . These films are made to entertain  and this movie  especially for a good time and a nice entertainment . Torrente is a passable and unapologetic dark comedy with great special effects  it has several funny and hilarious scenes and quite successful action scenes with persecution  car crashes and many other things . The picture contains thrills  noisy action  tongueincheek  grotesque situations and above all  humor . Although there are also nudism  badmouthed language  bad taste jokes and profanities . Torrente 4 is written directed produced and stars Segura whose production house Amiguetes Entertainment produced the film  UIP and Sony hold Spanish distribution rights  it ran up the biggest domestic opening for any film at the 2014 Spanish box office scoring Euro3.6 million 4.5 million its first days . The screenplay is absurd as well as crazy  just what makes laugh a lot  that the character Torrente a very slutty  clumsy  sexist  Machista  extremerightwing  on a real person is despicable  being not adequate  but this is a film that satirizes all this and that just means he's a pathetic character  though he also has his unsettling charms . First Torrente  El Brazo Tonto De Ley set box office records in its day  took 707000 and Torrente 2 grossed more than 22 million in 2001  while the opening figures of Torrente 5 are lower than those of its predecessor this Torrente 4 Lethal Crisis released three years ago with 10.6 million and 1.1 million tickets sold . The film contains numerous cameos of famous people  a lot of familiar faces  many of them known from Cuore magazines . And the cameos are very funny and likable and there are lots of laughters and jokes . The movie contains a colorful and adequate cinematography by Teo Delgado . Thrilling as well as appropriate musical score by Roque Baos . The film takes advantage of impressive special effects  especially on its final part when takes place a breathtaking explosions  car chases  including  bound and leaps vehicles and expensive crashes . Santiago Segura dares to make films with total entertainment and bemusement . And Torrente  is pure eschatological fun  it is 100 and some minutes of fun and laughters . It is a commendable effort by Santiago Segura to make a film like this . Few directors are able to achieve results as Torrente  the biggest boxoffice in Spain until 8 Apellidos Vascos. This film will not disappoint Santiago Segura fans.So if you want to be all sophisticated like the audiences in Spain and across Europe that flock to these films in droves here's your chance  The quintet of movies in the Torrente Package such as  the first instalment was Torrente El Brazo Tonto De La Ley or The Dumb Arm of the Law 1998 with Javier Camera  Neus Asensi  being followed by Torrente 2 Mission in Marbella with Juanito Navarro  Paloma Cela  Santi Millan  Jose Mota  Pablo Carbonel  among others  Torrente 3 El Protector in which the horrendous Spanish detective becomes a bodyguard  being performed by Jos Mota  Yvonne Sci  Eduardo Garca  Fabio Testi  . And Torrente V  Misin Eurovegas has a good cast as Alec Baldwin  Anna Simon  Carlos Areces  Chus Lampreave and many others .

The whole movie is full of dirty jokes naked breasts farts and sneezing.

These satires are rude crude lewd insensitive offensive amoral sexist racist homophobic grossly politically incorrect and hilarious with likely no socially redeeming value.

	schema:headline " Anatomy of Insanity";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a wonderfully tense and intensely claustrophobic film with a slowly escalating and relentless psychologically terror. Roman Polanski stays true to his style from Rosemary's Baby and Repulsion. But this movie is more than a simple examination of the onset of insanity from within the person who is experiencing it. The theme of loneliness and the sense of purposeless petty existence are the real backdrop of this excellent work the fact which makes it similar to Kubrick's Shining. Still The Tenant has deeper literary roots. In my opinion the inspiration for this movie came right from the great works of European literature  the influence of Edgar A. Poe E.T.A. Hoffmann and Nikolai Gogol is simply obvious. Poe's tales of madness out of loneliness Hoffmann's stories of tragic delirium most prominently The Sandman Majorat and The Mines of Falun and of course Gogol's eerie The Overcoat provided Polanski with the inspiration for this modern examination of the same topics.Trelkovsky a French citizen of Polish origin is a nondescript and unassuming loner who moves into an apartment the previous occupant of which a young woman has thrown herself out of the window. The building is owned by the stern and icecold old man who is hell bent on making sure his tenants do not make any noise and do not cause any trouble. He and his underlings in the building consider any sign of life to be trouble. The old man spends much of his time enforcing a nearpolicestatelike order within the building. Undeniably all kind of extremely weird things are going on in the building and I will not dwell on them. But it is the strange intrusiveness of the policestate which injects real terror into Trelkovsky's life. Faced with absurdity after absurdity he makes some meek attempts to complain and ask for explanations instead noone is even ready to listen to him  he is being treated like a piece of dirt practically by everyone.It is also important that Trelkovsky's plunge into madness occurs suddenly and very abruptly. It seems almost like a psychological breakdown and a rebellion at the same time. He has lived the life of conformity compliance and quite resentment never able to stand his ground or even establish his individual sovereignty. Trelkovksy's meekness is simply striking. His sudden and violent obsession with not letting them make him into the previous occupant of the flat is a pathological and concentrated reaction to the years of pent up passive aggression and anger. The infernal scream at the end of the film is the wild shout of anguish. In a certain sense the completely unexpected finale of the film presents a huge puzzle which is not really intended to be resolved. But Polanski seems to be investing it with important symbolic meaning. This world is full of multiple Trelkovskys little unnoticeable people terrorized by their own sense of total insignificance. This is a vicious cycle of dependence between people's unconscious yet compulsive cruelty to each other and the tortured compliance with this cruelty by others.This is an excellent dark and captivating film in the best traditions of European psychological Gothic literature. I strongly recommend to watch this movie and take a look at Poe's Hoffmann's and Gogol's stories.".

	schema:headline " Brilliant psychological horror!";
	schema:reviewBody "Roman Polanski is considered as one of the most important directors of our time as the mind behind classics such as Rosemary's Baby and Chinatown. Probably what makes Polanski's cinema a very interesting one is the fact that while he is capable of creating commercially attractive films such as the afore mentioned masterpieces he is also fond of making lowkey movies that are of a more personal nature. Le Locataire or The Tenant is one of those movies a horrorsuspense story about paranoia and obsession that is among his best works and probably among the best horror movies ever done.Polanski himself plays Telkovsky a young man looking for an apartment in France. When he finally finds one he discovers that it is empty because the previous tenant Simone Choule attempted to kill herself by jumping out of the window. After Simone dies of the injuries Trelkovsky begins to become obsessed with her to the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants in the building.While sharing the same claustrophobic feeling of his other apartmentthemed films Repulsion  Rosemary's Baby this film focuses on the bizarre conspiracy that may or may not be entirely in Trelkovsky's head the catastrophic effects the paranoia has on his mind and the bizarre obsession he has with the previous tenant.Trelkovsky's descend into darkness is portrayed perfectly by Polanski. While at first his performance seems odd and wooden slowly one finds out that Polanski acts that way because Trelkovsky is meant to be acted that way as a simpleton with almost no life who traps himself in this maddening subworld that happens to be inhabited by a collection of bizarre people. The supporting actors really gave life to the people in the building creating memorable characters that are very important for the success of the film.Also the beautiful cinematography Polanski employs in the film helps to increase the feeling of isolation and gives life to the beautiful building that serves as cage for Trelkovsky. The haunting images Polanski uses to convey the feeling of confusion and madness are of a supernatural beauty that makes them both frightening and attractive.If a flaw is to be found in the film is that it is definitely a bit slow at first. this may sound like a turnoff but in fact the slow pace of the beginning works perfectly as it mimics Trelkovsky's own boring life and how gradually he enters a different realm. Also the convoluted storyline is definitely not an easy one to understand due to the many complex layers it has. However more than a flaw it is a joy to face a thoughtprovoking plot like this one.While The Tenant may not be for everyone those interested in psychological horror and surreal story lines will be pleased by the experience. Le Locataire is really one of Roman Polanksi's masterpieces. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "After his classic film noir homage Chinatown Roman Polanski returned to the themes that had given him his greatest hits in the 60s with this creepy psychological horror which like Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby deals with the paranoia and claustrophobia generated by apartment living.Claustrophobic environments are the ones which Polanski is best at creating and this has to be the most suffocating and confined picture he ever created. The emphasis on side walls and distant vanishing points is greater than ever and even in the small number of exterior scenes the sky is rarely glimpsed. But The Tenant is not just confined spatially but also in the intensity with which it focuses on its protagonist. Trelkovsky played by Polanski himself is not only in every scene he is in virtually every shot. When he is not on screen more often than not the camera becomes Trelkovsky's point of view. And of course almost everywhere he looks he sees his own reflection staring back at him in a mirror.I can't think of any film that is more about the internalisation and solitude of one character. Some psychological thrillers like M or Peeping Tom manipulate us into feeling sorry for the mentally ill protagonist. Others like Psycho attempt indepth scientific analysis of his mental condition. The Tenant fits into neither of these categories  it simply immerses us completely inside Trelkovsky's experience without demanding we actually understand or appreciate what is going on inside his head. We feel his paranoia and obsession even though it is constantly revealed to us that they are irrational.Polanski was also a master of the slowly unfolding horror film. Often in his horrors there is an ambiguity as to whether there is actually anything sinister going on but they are among the most effective at frightening audiences. Why? Precisely because they unfold so slowly and invest so much time in painstakingly setting up situations that they immerse the viewer in paranoia. A much later Polanski horror The Ninth Gate is a bit of a mess plotwise but at least it still manages to achieve that creeping sense of dread.This is a rare chance to see Polanski himself in a major role. His talent in front of the camera was as good as behind it and he is absolutely perfect as the meek Trelkovsky. Another standout performance is that of the alltoooften overlooked Shelley Winters as the concierge. In actual fact it is rather a stellar cast although many of the familiar faces look out of place in this strange Gothic European movie. Also sadly many of the French actors in supporting roles are atrociously dubbed in the English language version.The Tenant is more polished and less pretentious than Repulsion but it lacks the suspense and the character that make Rosemary's Baby so engrossing and entertaining. The Tenant is good with no major flaws and Polanski was really on top form as a director but it's not among his most gripping works.".

	schema:reviewBody "I once lived with a roommate who attempted suicide and our apartment was in a building where you could get a fifty dollar noise violation for sneezing after midnight  so needless to say I can easily relate to Polanski's The Tenant. But I also enjoy the film for other reasons. I'm not sure that it works on the whole  the Polanski character's descent into paranoia and madness which takes up the final half hour or so seems rather jarring and bizarre. Ebert for one was totally unconvinced and he slapped the movie with a vicious onestar review. But I think that individual scenes and moments work beautifully so even though I don't quite understand the whole film  what does Egyptology have to do with it for example?  I still have an overall positive impression of it.I love the obnoxious friend portrayed by Bernard Fresson for example. God how many times have I settled for having stupid friends like that instead of no friends at all! I love the movie theater scene  the funniest making out moment in the history of film I'd say. And boy do I love Isabelle Adjani  she's so foxy in this movie it's almost unbelievable. And she gives a great performance as always.Polanski is a good actor too I don't agree with the occasional disparaging remarks made about his performance here. His character is supposed to be lowkey and thoughtful so his lowkey performance fits. I for one found him perfectly sympathetic  though he did lose me a bit when he started dressed in drag for no clearly discernible reason.Yes the movie's obscure. And slow. But it captures the alienating qualities of apartment living  something I've done entirely too much of  so I dig it. It's funny how all you need is a common reference point and suddenly a weirdo movie like this becomes deeply significant! Definitely worth picking up for pocket change on DVD.".

Creepier than anything David Lynch and that shows what a great director Polanski is since this is not his usual type of work and it is BRILLIANT.It all starts of with Trelkovski moves into a tenement block in Paris. He soon learns that the previous tenant a young woman committed suicide and he believes the rest of the people living there drove her to it. He also believes that they are trying to do the same to him. What results is a amazing and frightening look at paranoia.The whole production has classical horror written all over it from the imagery to the music the viewer can feel poor Trelkovski's terror building up.Are they all out to kill him?

Creepier than anything David Lynch and that shows what a great director Polanski is since this is not his usual type of work and it is BRILLIANT.It all starts of with Trelkovski moves into a tenement block in Paris. He soon learns that the previous tenant a young woman committed suicide and he believes the rest of the people living there drove her to it. He also believes that they are trying to do the same to him. What results is a amazing and frightening look at paranoia.The whole production has classical horror written all over it from the imagery to the music the viewer can feel poor Trelkovski's terror building up.Are they all out to kill him? Or maybe just drive him mad? Is there a difference? Find out for yourself. 1010";

I must admit I wasnt able to laugh about when I saw it the first time and it was the same with the second time! On the one hand Trelkovski seems so nice and even cute in his shy behaviour but on the other hand he beats this boy on the playground and there is no explanation for that. But the most weired thing is of course his transformation in Simone Choule and the fact that he doesnt know who he really is. His halluzinations are the most terrifying in this movie. Of course its all in his mind but is it this flat that brings out this female side of him or was it also before he moved in  I think thats an interesting question. His shizophrenic behaviour is hard to understand and its horrible to see his two sides or identities fighting against each other. The result of it is that he cuts his hand first and later jumps out of hisher window. But this terrible cry  does that mean that all will repeat again and again and again... that his soul is in a cage or something? And these egyptian hieroglyphs and other egyptian stuff ? The fact that heshe looks like a mummy in the Hospital  thats not an incident but a clue in my point of view.".

I wish I have somehow set some aside then is some magical suspended locker so that I could taste those things today. This magical locker might even have adjusted the fabric of the food to account for how I've drifted physically and otherwise a sort of dynamic chemistry of expectations. Over the half century they would have had to adjust quite a bit because you see I would have known that I set them aside. Eating one now would be a celebration of self and past and story and sense that would almost make the intervening years an anticipated reward.I didn't have enough sense to do that with original Coke. And I couldn't have invented one of those magical psychic lockers  not then. But I did something almost as good. In the seventies I really tuned into Roman Polanski. He was a strange and exotic pleasure  you know movies smuggled out of the Soviet block. Movies so sensitive to beauty that you cry for weeks afterward. Movies that make you want to live with Polish women one and then deciding that they would be the last to get it.Here's what I did. I took what I knew would be my favorite Polanski movie and set it aside. I did not watch it. I deferred until I thought I would be big enough to deserve it. Over the years I would test myself my ability to surround beauty and delineate it without occupying it. There probably are few Poles who have worked at this practicing to deserve Chopin. Working to deserve womanness when I see it. Trying to get the inners from the edges.Recently I achieved something like assurance that it was time to pull this out. I already knew that I was already past the time when this would work optimally because I had already seen and understood 9th Gate.If you do not know this it is about a man who innocently rents a room in which the previous tenant about whom the story is named jumped out the window to die later after this man played by Polanski visits. What happens is that time folds and he becomes this woman. We are fooled into believing that he is merely mad. But the way we follow him he is not. He merely has flashes that the world is normal and that the surrounding people are not part of a coven warping his reality.The story hardly matters. What matters is how Polanksi shapes this thing both in the way he inhabits the eye that only makes edges and in inhabiting the body that only consists of confused flesh. The two never meet. There is a dissonance that may haunt me for the next 30 years. Its the idea about and inside and an outside with no edges at all  at all except a redhead wig.I know of no one else that could do this this sketch that remains a sketch this horror that remains natural.To understand the genius of this you have to know one of the greatest films ever made Rear Window. The genius of that film is the postnoir notion that the camera shapes the world that the viewer creates the story. What Roman does is take this movie and turn it inside out. In Rear Window the idea was that the onscreen viewer Jimmy Stewart was the anchor and everything else was fiction woven as we watched. Here the on screen apartment dweller is the filmmaker. We know this. We know that everything we see is true because he is the narrator. We know it is true that bodies shift identity that times shift that causality is plastic. We know that the narrator will kill us. We know that the narrator will leave us in a perpetual horror on that edge that he imputes but never shows us and lets us imagine. Ted's Evaluation  4 of 3 Every cineliterate person should experience this.".

Personally I could have done without the cross dressing element but I accept the nod to Psycho and the fact that it had some logic bearing in mind the storyline. Nevertheless it could have worked without and would have removed the slightly theatrical element but then maybe that was intended because the courtyard certainly seems to take on the look of a theatre at the end. I can't help feel that there are more than a few of the director's own feelings of not being a 'real' Frenchman and Jewish to boot. Still there is plenty to enjoy here including a fine performance from a gorgeous looking Isabelle Adjani and good old Shelly Winters is as reliable as ever.".

	schema:reviewBody "This beautifully directed and photographed movie seems to be full of allusions. It demands attention and may be boring for people who just want plain action or a quick succession of blood curdling horror scenes. Some knowledge of art and film history is helpful here.The cast is marvelous. You meet Shelley Winters as the concierge and Melvyn Douglas as the proprietor of an old apartment house in the midst of a moldy 19th century Parisian district. The two great veteran actors are used for what they are  icons. Every movie buff who likes The French Connection II will experience a pleasant feeling of deja vu. The same actor who serves Gene Hackman's Popeye Doyle a whisky in a Marseilles bar and becomes his only buddy in France is now the waiter who brings the tenant a cup of cocoa in a Paris bar. He even wears the same wardrobe! The same can be said of French actor Bernard Fresson Popeye's police contact in Marseilles. He plays the nasty vulgar acquaintance of the tenant who wants to teach him how a tenant should behave. Polanski plays the kafkaesque main character himself. His performance impressed me very much he is not only one of the most interesting directors I know but an immensely talented actor too.The way people look in this movie reminded me very much of the Muppet show incidentally the TV series was started the same year The Tenant was released. The characters are deliberately overdrawn and feel like caricatures nobody more so than the sexy Isabelle Adjani character  not exactly a Miss Piggy but not too far from it either. The way they were made up and filmed gives them a strong puppetlike appearance. The apartment house is realistic yet it looks more like a doll house than the set of Hitchcocks Rear Window. Muppets pop out of their compartments and do things that are banal or mysterious.The Tenant deals mainly with the main character's paranoia. The apartment house offers a look into the tenant's troubled mind. The movie comments on the effects of bigotry and indifference but also on the perception of an individual who may give wrong meanings to certain events. The situation allows the introduction of signs and objects with symbolic values. The director made full use of the possibilities the movie offered here. I could not say I understood the meaning of it all e.g. the tenant slaps a kid in the face in a park for no apparent reason but I am sure it does not really matter. The tenant thinks there is a complot against him and he sees all events in this light. Even the fact that the barkeeper has run out of his beloved Gauloises bleues and presses Marlboros on him instead he sees as part of a devilish plan!Despite the finely tuned dark colors and the dark thoughts of the main character they reflect The Tenant is surprisingly light. Some may call it sophisticated camp. This lightness which is achieved with a peculiar sense of humor seems to be a trademark of Polanski's movies. He persues his tactics to look for the absurd in the midst of horrors. The ending is very grotesque. Ashamedly I have to admit it It made me laugh.Somehow The Tenant borrows from Polanski's earlier film Repulsion. But it has more flourish. The choice and the use of real locations is very good. Some ideas of this movie were integrated in Polanski's later film Frantic including Polanski's apparent love for Paris garbage men and their equipment. Whoever likes The Tenant should look for movies of Finnish director Aki Kaurismki. They are in the same vein.".

	schema:reviewBody "When this film opened back in 1976 legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain  it was widely considered a failure. I vividly remember Ebert giving it one star and it was supposedly booed at Cannes.Apparently these people didn't understand the movie which is not that hard to comprehend since it's very esoteric dark and layered in ways that still astound me. Reading through many of the reviews here I find even after about 78 viewings over the years many elements of the film I had previously glossed over. But even without understanding much the psychological underpinnings of the story it's still a cracking suspenser...even if you just take the escalating paranoia and persecution that overtakes Polanski's title character like a tsunami wave over the course of it's two hour running time.Examining the source material  an excellent novella by underrated novelist Roland Topor  uncovers more intriguing layers. Polanski's Trekovsky is a milquetoast of the highest order. Though he seems at first to be yet another mild everyday soul one gradually realizes he is one of those people who seems to aimlessly drift through life letting it direct him. He seems to have few strong feelings about his likes and dislikes. He finds himself gently pushed this way and that but never seems to get too bent out of shape regardless. This vague sort of wishywashyness is more noticeable in the novel than the movie but there are hints of it early in the film too.Making a play for the apartment of a woman one Mademouiselle Choule who is in the hospital recovering from a recent suicide attempt appears to be the most daring thing he has attempted even effectively haggling down the price of the deposit in the bargain. He soon finds however that he is paying for his good thing in more ways than he cares as he finds himself in the center of maelstrom created by a building full of neurotic control freaks who are hypersensitive to even the slightest sign of human life such as a footstep in the night or a knock on the door.Instead of taking a stand though Trelkovsky becomes increasingly alienated by the situation and overtaken by paranoia and a sense of persecution. He becomes obsessed with Choule imagining himself to be like her dressing like her etc. as his own personality rapidly begins to be wiped away by his own insanity.If anyone has ever doubted Polanski's fearlessness as an artist they'd be welladvised to see this film. His trademark black humor is prominently and sometimes embarrassingly on display here and  god bless him  he makes himself the butt of it. It's a tour de force performance in one of the richest riskiest most Gothic horror movies ever made. That more people haven't seen it is a true crime.".

	schema:reviewBody "Thematically abstruse Roman Polanski's The Tenant impels viewers to ponder its meaning. An introverted little man named Trelkovsky played by Polanski moves into a drab Paris apartment whose former resident attempted suicide by jumping out the apartment's window. Trelkovsky obsesses about the woman he even visits her in a hospital where she later dies.Weird sometimes hostile neighbors who live in the same building as Trelkovsky hound him about minor or nonexistent noise coming from his apartment. Sounds play a big part in this movie incessant knocks on his door the ticking of clocks dripping water and creaky floors. Gradually Trelkovsky convinces himself that his neighbors are conspiring to force him to commit suicide in the same manner as the former tenant.I suspect that Polanski through this film is making some kind of comment about how we as individuals must adapt to a hostile environment or die. But I'm not sure. That Polanski cast himself in the lead role conveys the impression that the film is some kind of veiled statement from Polanski about his own life or career at that point in time. The film seems very personal.There are a number of references in the film to Egypt and Egyptian hieroglyphics. But their significance is never explained. Of course there may be no deep meaning to the film at all. It may simply be a farcical comment about the routine irritations of urban apartment living.Its thematic intent aside The Tenant generally lacks entertainment value at least for me. One problem is that Trelkovsky is irritatingly timid and obliging. I would have had more respect for him if he had displayed some assertiveness. The film's secondary characters I also found not especially interesting. Also the film is too lengthy for its content. As a one hour TV drama the story might have been fine. As is the plot is tedious and repetitive and the pace is very very slow.The visuals are exceedingly drab and dreary. And the intermittent background music is as drab as the visuals. The film's production design is impressively detailed.Kafkaesque in plot Le Locataire presents a baffling psychodrama about a mildmannered man whose living arrangement morphs into a nightmarish world of invented duress and danger. It's an intriguing concept. I just wish the story and the lead character had been more interesting.".

Even more fascinating though are some of the questions it raises about the nature of reality the notion of what actually constitutes the self and some possible theories about the roots of insanity. Based on Roland Topor's 1964 novel Le Locataire Chimerique The Tenant is unsettling creepy and tragic as it depicts the events that lead to its protagonist losing both his identity and his sanity before providing the movie with its shocking climax.Trelkovsky Roman Polanski is the polite office clerk who rents a modest apartment in a residential building in Paris and immediately encounters unpleasantness from its irritable concierge Shelley Winters and Monsieur Zy Melvyn Douglas who's the building's grumpy old landlord. Zy emphasises the importance of not making any noise and ensuring that nothing's done which could disturb the building's other residents. Unfortunately a homewarming gettogether that Trelkovsky has in his apartment with a group of his office colleagues attracts complaints from his neighbours and leads to Zy threatening his new tenant with eviction if there are any similar problems in the future.Trelkovsky learns that the apartment's previous tenant Simone Choule Dominique Poulange had attempted suicide by jumping out of the apartment window and had been injured so badly that it was certain that she would never be able to return. Intrigued by this Trelkovsky visits Simone in hospital where he finds her heavily bandaged and also meets her friend Stella Isabelle Adjani. Shockingly when Simone sees her visitors she's unable to communicate with them and merely lets out a long loud and very distressing scream.During the weeks that follow Trelkovsky continues to be treated unfairly by his neighbours who consistently complain about the noise he makes. The sheer injustice of what happens makes him increasingly withdrawn and simultaneously following Simone's death he becomes obsessed with what happened to her and gradually finds himself adopting some of her behaviours like changing to her brand of cigarettes and switching from coffee to drinking chocolate. As his obsession deepens he even starts dressing in her clothes and then recognising that he's losing his own identity becomes convinced that his neighbours are conspiring against him to make him take on Simone's identity and like her commit suicide. Further distressing events then follow as Trelkovsky decides what action to take to escape the treatment he's had to endure from his intolerant neighbours.Impressively the way in which Trelkovsky's experiences are depicted onscreen enables the audience to feel the same level of injustice that he feels and to share in his confusion as he loses his sanity because it's not always clear what's real and what's imagined. Similarly the distress that he feels during his unstoppable change of identity is conveyed very powerfully as he struggles to comprehend the caf owner's role in this and also reflects on how much of himself he can give up before his identity is completely lost. The conventional view of what happened to him would be to assume that his breakdown was the result of a preexisting condition however what takes place in the movie's final scene suggests at least two other possible explanations.Roman Polanski conveys his character's diffidence very convincingly and his physical appearance makes him a perfect choice for the part. Isabelle Adjani Shelley Winters and Melvyn Douglas are also superb in their important roles and contribute strongly to the success of this extremely memorable movie.".

After moving in he is harassed by the neighbors and becomes convinced that they are attempting to force him to assume the deceased woman's identity and thus commit suicide himself. How are they doing this? The film does not offer any convincing manner.The film recalls the atmosphere of early Polanski go and watch Repulsion if you haven't already without the satisfying devilish ending. Indeed the ending is predictable with huge HUGE! signposts scattered like stray clothing all the way through the film. There are only two or three moments worth mentioning. The shot of Roman walking toward the window is memorable as is the final climactic courtyard sequence it seems that the conception of this movie was centered around these setpieces without any thought as to credibility of character and narrative but the drawnout laboured poorly conceived finale destroy any hope this movie had of success. If only this was a short film i could recommend it. SPOILERS  We see both points of view what the man is experiencing and what is really happening but because we know it is all going on in his head it is never really scary. The scenes of Roman in drag are more humorous than edgy they are silly in a way that ruins any tension he might have built. I was pretty tired when i watched this movie and even i knew after about half an hour that he would be missing a tooth and see himself through the bandages at the end. This movies come so close to Rosemary's Baby in terms of production and is sadly so far away from it in quality that they seem to have been made by different people.".

The apartment has some strange power in it and quickly transforms the new tenant's life for the worse...in fact things literally fall apart for him. Polanski plays the Pole and does a serviceable job. I always thought he was a pretty decent actor. The people living in the apartment building are equally good and bizarre with Shelley Winters standing out as the concierge. Polanski also does a rather deft job behind the camera creating tension and a foreboding feeling in many scenes. What then is the problem? It has to be the weird script which hints at story lines and never really explains any of the action particularly the ending. I just didn't buy the outcome. Why did it happen? Why was there a tooth in the wallan effective scene if not an unexplained one? I can't go into to much detail about the fate that befalls Polanski's character but it seems to come out of nowhere. I know this film is revered by many as one of the great horror films of all time. I never was scared by anything except the convoluted plot being taken seriously. Maybe the film is trying to be too enigmatic and symbolic. I don't know but what I do know is The Tenant left me with an unsatisfied feeling. It certainly isn't a bad film but I didn't think it was great either. There were large tracts within that were just plain boring and though Polanski is definitely one of the greatest directors of all time  he can and has been guilty of downplaying scenes too much. I can say the same for some of the scenes in Repulsion. I also believe that this film needs to be seen more than once but I will definitely have to work up to that chore another time. As with much of Polanski's work there is a dose of black humour laced throughout. I really enjoyed the scenes of Polanski's character seeing the woman who jumped out of the window in hospital almost completely covered with bandages. He visits not for concern for the girl but with hopes that she will die and he will land her apartment. These scenes are underlined with a very dark amusing edge and an appropriate irony to the film's denouement.".

Scene by scene Polanski allows the tension to build up in such a way that by the end the viewer is left both exhausted and wanting more. In Polanski's world there are no easy answers and there is no defining what is real and what is imaginary. Fantasy and reality cross paths in unbelievably disturbing and insightful ways. Questions emerge they are sometimes answered and then those answers are found to be false. And then they are found to be true again. With such a mind bending work Polanski forces the viewer to question everything they are witnessing making this one o0f the greatest cinematic enigmas of all time.With its sharp sense of black humor and satire The Tenant was able to tickle my funny bone as well as it was able to tingle my spine. Perplexing haunting and yet still often hilarious this film combines genres in a way only mastered by the finest auteurs of cinema I got some Lynchian vibes from much of the dark humor and surrealism and some of the satirical elements reminded me of Donnie Darko to an extent. It is as if Rosemary's Baby were co written by an intelligent jester with the help of the spirit of Jonathan Swift.

	schema:reviewBody "Saying that Wrong the new film by French director and lover of all things nonsequitur Quentin Dupieux is strange does the film somewhat of an injustice. Not because the movie surpasses the limits of strange although to be fair it does but because strange implies something nonsensical content that defies explanation or logic. Wrong is a film that despite being so bizarre manages to come around full circle and make sense at the end. All its surreal imagery has purpose at the end and the film is at its strongest at the last moments where one can step back and appreciate it as a whole.Wrong begins with Dolph Springer a man who inhabits a slightly off kilter universe in which trees make sense based on their own unique place and offices shower their seemingly unaware employees with torrential rain. He is a simple man he goes to work every day and enjoys the company of his gardener Victor a man who seems to be forcing an unneeded French accent. Dolph wakes up one morning to find his dog has gone missing and embarks on a journey to rescue his pooch from whatever peril it seems to have run across. To summarize the movie any more would be a disservice as the best part of the film is the pleasant little surprises that come along the way.What I can tell you is that the film is absolutely absurd. From William Fichtner's restrained but subtly outrageous performance as this world's version of a zen master to a strange sequence that refuses to define itself as reality or dream there is enough outlandish content to fill any surrealists imagination. Although these elements are certainly bizarre it still feels like they deliver a message. They contribute to a feeling that there is something deeper being said and by the end one walks out with a feeling that Dupieux subtly and ever so brilliantly schooled the audience.That being said the movie has problems. For large chunks of the film especially during a tour of a small animals digestive tract don't ask it feels like the director is treading water. In fact I would go as far as to say that a good quarter of the movie loses its surreal edge and becomes more than a little monotonous. These scenes clog the movie and get more than a little frustrating as it holds back an otherwise breezy and enjoyably silly movie.It's a shame I can't go deeper into the movie to explain the emotions that built inside me by the end or the flaws that made the movie shy of greatness. It's a movie that works better the less you know about it plain and simple.".

	schema:reviewBody "Quentin Dupieux's WRONG is about how people I guess can go wrong about things small and big. The premise is simple enough and a great starting point Jack Plotnick is Dolph Springer a working man though he's actually been fired for three months but still goes to work where it rains all the time indoors and he's lost his dog. Where could he be? As it turns out there is an answer to that in the form of a sort of dog communicationstelepathy expert in William Ficther's character who may or may not be Indian or Asian of some sort his accent's kinda convincing for what's required here. But Dupieux has some subplotweird strands going on here as well which include Dolph's gardener and a girl on the other end of a phone for a pizza place  Dolph is rather confused about a rabbit on a motorcycle as a logo  who finds his questions attractive and sleeps with the uh gardener instead thinking it's Dolph and then... aw hell you should see it for yourself.A lot of the great things in Wrong are from the awkward very surreal interactions and environment that are set up. This could easily go into the realm of more absurdistcomedyofmanners style of Curb Your Enthusiasm but Dupieux is just so offkilter that you know you're in for a something... special here. If I have a general criticism it's that Dolph perhaps should've been a little more of an everyman he is for the most part except for the whole thing of him being at work even though he's not really working there anymore and a couple other small things. This would make all of his interactions stronger but luckily people like William Fictner pull off deadpan humor wonderfully and his few scenes are delights as he first puts Dolph through the rigmarole to see him and then gives him a book on how to talk to his dog through his mind.Some other very strange developments happen such as with Emma the character Alexis Dziena plays you might know her as the girl who memorably goes naked for a quick flash in Broken Flowers who if one is taking her on as a 'realworld' person may be braindamaged. In Dupieux's world she may be simply... wrong. Or right who knows. But she's kind of like his own satirical take on the ManicPixieDreamGirl which makes for a lot of spoton comedy oh and she's pregnant whoops it happens! If there's another problem though there may be times where if it doesn't work on a comic plane it kind of just sits there like a lump until it's over the sequences for me involved the neighbor who we meet at the start as denying he's a jogger I HATE running! he states emphatically and then decides to go driving for a while... in the desert... or somewhere else... That part I don't 'get it' I guess. The stuff with the Dog Detective as well is hit or miss it's either very funny or you can feel the improv and it struggles.But if you're looking for something offkiler and playfully surreal  the kind of experience where a character has a dream taking place on a beach and involves warped talking but mostly presented as straightforward  this is a welcome offering. It's kind of like what Luis Bunuel might offer up for the Comedy Central network.".

If I have a general criticism it's that Dolph perhaps should've been a little more of an everyman he is for the most part except for the whole thing of him being at work even though he's not really working there anymore and a couple other small things. This would make all of his interactions stronger but luckily people like William Fictner pull off deadpan humor wonderfully and his few scenes are delights as he first puts Dolph through the rigmarole to see him and then gives him a book on how to talk to his dog through his mind.Some other very strange developments happen such as with Emma the character Alexis Dziena plays you might know her as the girl who memorably goes naked for a quick flash in Broken Flowers who if one is taking her on as a 'realworld' person may be braindamaged. In Dupieux's world she may be simply... wrong. Or right who knows. But she's kind of like his own satirical take on the ManicPixieDreamGirl which makes for a lot of spoton comedy oh and she's pregnant whoops it happens! If there's another problem though there may be times where if it doesn't work on a comic plane it kind of just sits there like a lump until it's over the sequences for me involved the neighbor who we meet at the start as denying he's a jogger I HATE running! he states emphatically and then decides to go driving for a while... in the desert... or somewhere else... That part I don't 'get it' I guess. The stuff with the Dog Detective as well is hit or miss it's either very funny or you can feel the improv and it struggles.But if you're looking for something offkiler and playfully surreal  the kind of experience where a character has a dream taking place on a beach and involves warped talking but mostly presented as straightforward  this is a welcome offering. It's kind of like what Luis Bunuel might offer up for the Comedy Central network.";

The film is rarely uninteresting if for any reason simply for it's absurdity. However if there is one thing that hurts a film like this it's in how predictable it can be at times since it's absurd events are almost expected too much so. For a film that seems to go all in on the ridiculousness of it's narrative it feels like a one trick pony.

Many things are never explained and the movie just like Rubber has you ready from the get go to not get too emotionally invested given the lack of sense that piles on during each segment. Only Wrong doesn't spell it out at the beginning like Rubber did however I would recommend this film as an introduction into his work rather than Rubber which is far less accessible. It's hard to knock Wrong it for it's broken structure since it's sort of the point of the film. It pokes fun at logic sensibility work place dynamics and perceptions of selfworth as well as making light of social issues but does so in such a way that it's hard to gain any clear insight into any of it's intended message if even there exist any.Watch Wrong if you want to see an arthouse experimental film on perhaps one if it's more easily digestible and charmingly demented levels but if your not much for movies that merely exist to send you on a head trip then don't watch this one.

	schema:reviewBody "Dolph Springer Jack Plotnick lives in suburban L.A. waking up at 760am everyday returning to his former place of employment where indoor rainfall occurs and he pretends to do work even after he was fired three months ago. He wakes up one morning to find his dog Paul is missing. After talking to his neighbor who then departs to places unknown Dolph dials a pizzeria's phone number to ask them details about their delivery service and why their logo features a rabbit on a motorcycle when rabbits can run fast enough without the motorcycle. On the phone is a young woman named Emma Alexis Dziena who turns out to be quite the nymphomaniac proposing sex to Dolph in a note secured in a free pizza which is intercepted by Dolph's yardworker Victor ric Judor who pretends to be Dolph when he finally meets Emma to get free sex. As Dolph aimlessly wanders the streets of L.A. he runs into Master Chang thatguy actor William Fichtner an author of several books about humans using telekinesis or some cockamamie process to communicate with the dogs he has kidnapped in order for their owners to show true appreciation for the beasts they take for granted.All these characters will continuously pop up with little rhyme or reason in Quentin Dupieux's Wrong some of them even coming back to life showing blatant disregard for inconsistencies and misconceptions and deadpan so well or so... deadly that you may zone out for a few minutes and awake with a startle. If 2013 is not starting off as the damnedest year for films then I do not know what to call it. I have yet to give a film released this year a positive rating and the films I have been subjected to are either pitifully awful or beyond any reasonable comprehension. I felt the same way watching Roman Coppola's A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III where I was desperately robbed of any connection or coherency with every situation and character. When I watch films I don't like to feel manipulated excluded or completely lost and both these films violated me in those three ways.You may remember my bizarre fascination with Dupieux's last work Rubber a film concocted entirely off the premise of a tire rolling I suppose through the desert using its telekinetic powers to destroy bottles crows police officers or anything else that stood in its way. It was a unique little film quirky pleasantly offbeat albeit selfrighteous and dry at times. Wrong is a film in the same category but so tedious unmoving dry deserting and frankly careless about its lead that it makes it a huge challenge to side with anyone or even sit with them through eightynine minutes of repetition.In several ways this feels like a screen writing exercise. Dupieux's lax approach must not have been too stressful and backbreaking to formulate from the ground up. It would appear he sat down one afternoon took a few characters made them all connect through interchangeable setups not truly forming a relationship with them at all and just threw situation after situation at them hoping someone will get meaning out of it. If I do not get or understand a film I will be the first one to admit it rather than throw some contrived meaning out there about the satire or the social commentary of it all. What Dupieux is essentially saying is... and that's where I become confused.Perhaps this is a social critique or a satire on I don't know life itself. In an interview Dupieux described the film almost as if it was a rebellion on convention where nobody is telling you you're wrong for doing this or this isn't correct. If his goal was to show a film can be concocted off of simply anything and everything then he succeeds at that. There isn't much else here.Wrong is photographed crisply edited efficiently and its washedout cinematography showcasing frequently vapid scenery beautifully and with a heavy touch of artistry clearly shows that it's a competently made picture aesthetically. Yet watching it is when the problems ensue. The characters are universally vacant their motivations are unclear the meaning or the reason we're supposed to stick around is nonexistent and the result is tiring and frustrating. When the most challenging part of a film is to watch it you should automatically know something ain't right.Starring Jack Plotnick ric Judor Alexis Dziena Steve Little and William Fichtner. Directed by Quentin Dupieux.".

If 2013 is not starting off as the damnedest year for films then I do not know what to call it. I have yet to give a film released this year a positive rating and the films I have been subjected to are either pitifully awful or beyond any reasonable comprehension. I felt the same way watching Roman Coppola's A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III where I was desperately robbed of any connection or coherency with every situation and character. When I watch films I don't like to feel manipulated excluded or completely lost and both these films violated me in those three ways.You may remember my bizarre fascination with Dupieux's last work Rubber a film concocted entirely off the premise of a tire rolling I suppose through the desert using its telekinetic powers to destroy bottles crows police officers or anything else that stood in its way. It was a unique little film quirky pleasantly offbeat albeit selfrighteous and dry at times. Wrong is a film in the same category but so tedious unmoving dry deserting and frankly careless about its lead that it makes it a huge challenge to side with anyone or even sit with them through eightynine minutes of repetition.In several ways this feels like a screen writing exercise. Dupieux's lax approach must not have been too stressful and backbreaking to formulate from the ground up. It would appear he sat down one afternoon took a few characters made them all connect through interchangeable setups not truly forming a relationship with them at all and just threw situation after situation at them hoping someone will get meaning out of it. If I do not get or understand a film I will be the first one to admit it rather than throw some contrived meaning out there about the satire or the social commentary of it all. What Dupieux is essentially saying is... and that's where I become confused.Perhaps this is a social critique or a satire on I don't know life itself. In an interview Dupieux described the film almost as if it was a rebellion on convention where nobody is telling you you're wrong for doing this or this isn't correct. If his goal was to show a film can be concocted off of simply anything and everything then he succeeds at that. There isn't much else here.Wrong is photographed crisply edited efficiently and its washedout cinematography showcasing frequently vapid scenery beautifully and with a heavy touch of artistry clearly shows that it's a competently made picture aesthetically. Yet watching it is when the problems ensue. The characters are universally vacant their motivations are unclear the meaning or the reason we're supposed to stick around is nonexistent and the result is tiring and frustrating. When the most challenging part of a film is to watch it you should automatically know something ain't right.Starring Jack Plotnick ric Judor Alexis Dziena Steve Little and William Fichtner. Directed by Quentin Dupieux.";

	schema:headline " A memorable Hitchcock movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Marnie 1964 is considered by many to be Alfred Hitchcock's last great movie. This movie is certainly different from most of Hitchcock's movies. Most of Hitchcock's movies have a certain signature Hitchcock feel to them much like John Carpenter Stephen Spielberg and George Lucas movies have a certain signature feel to them that are vintage Carpenter Spielberg and Lucas. Marnie retains a lot of the Hitchcock feel but this movie is a slight departure from his previous work. This movie really can't be classified into one category such as a straight psychological thriller a suspense thriller a detective story a mystery a romance etc. Whereas most Hitchcock movies put less focus on the characters and more focus on the suspense Marnie puts most of the focus on one character and less focus on the suspense. This movie is highly personal and psychological. This movie stars 'Tippi' Hedren Sean Connery Diane Baker Louise Latham Mariette Hartley Martin Gabel and Alan Napier. Hedren plays the role of Marnie Edgar a strange woman with psychological problems who is a professional thief and has an intense fear of men thunderstorms and even the color red. To sum up the plot in a nutshell she empties her employer's safe and escapes. Sean Connery plays the role of Mark Rutland owner of a publishing company that Marnie applies for a new job at. Marnie robs him as well. However Rutland is infatuated with her. He tracks her down but rather than turning her in to the authorities he convinces her to marry him. While on their honeymoon he realizes that she actually has a fear of men and fears intimacy. He gets more aggressive with her resulting in her attempting suicide. Her intense fear of men is rooted in a traumatic childhood experience she had. Watch to find out how everything unfolds. The musical score by Bernard Herrmann is memorable and is one of the strong points of the movie. The score is one of the best of all the Hitchcock movies in my opinion my other candidates are Vertigo and Psycho. There are some suspenseful moments. The special effects and some of the sets are pretty simple and low tech but this doesn't detract from the film at all in my opinion. The acting is excellent. Sean Connery was excellent. It was great to see Alan Napier in the movie. I thought 'Tippi' Hedren's performance was outstanding. Her acting in The Birds 1963 was great but she takes things to another level in Marnie. Originally Hitchcock wanted to cast Grace Kelly in the role of Marnie but she had to turn it down. I think 'Tippi' Hedren was the perfect actress for the part and she delivered. I also like Diane Baker in this movie. I have a weakness for movies with good looking women in them. This movie did poorly at the box office when it was released probably because audiences were used to getting movies that were less personal less psychological and more suspenseful from Hitchcock each time and Marnie was a departure from that. However this movie's stature has grown immensely since 1964. As for myself this is one of those rare movies that drew me in right from the start and kept my attention but multiple viewings might be required in order for one to fully understand and appreciate it for what it is. The DVD's extras include a documentary called The Trouble With Marnie which basically is about the making of the movie and the movie's historical status a picture gallery called The Marnie Archives and the theatrical trailer. Overall this is a good Hitchcock flick if you're into this type of movie whatever it's classified as Hitchcock called it a sex mystery.".

All of them consist of director Alfred Hitchcock's growing obsession for Tippi Hedrin who starred in The Birds one year earlier. By the end of the movie Hitchcock would not talk to Hedrin or even refer to her by name this following a supposed failed pass at Hedrin and his friends say Marnie was the last movie Hitchcock truly cared about.Regardless of the rumors Marnie was a boxoffice failure and went unnoticed until recently when DVD brought back Hitchcock's unremarkable films along with his classics. And behold from the ashes ariseth... Marnie.Starring Hedrin as Marnie and Sean Connery as the man who falls in love with her this movie tells of a compulsive thief and pathalogical liar who is caught by Connery and blackmailed into marrying him. Connery finds that Hedrin has incredible fears of red and thunderstorms refuses to let men touch her and has disturbing dreams brought on by knocks at her door. Connery must play the dual role of keeping Marnie away from the police while trying to find out why she does what she does.This is indeed an excellent Hitchcock film. He reminds the audience that he did start out directing silent movies and uses this silence very well in the robberycleaning lady scene. The moments leading up to Marnie's revealing flashback are incredible and the movie reeks of typical Hitchcock slow methodic pacing to a brilliant and stunning climax.Marnie is not a patented Hitchcock classic The fadestored have not aged well if they ever did look good the horseriding scenes just don't work and the backgrounds are obviously fake although it has been speculated that Hitchcock did this on purpose  whatever the case he later regretted it. But the basic premise the acting the directing are all top notch and have turned Marnie into another of the Underrated Hitchcocks.810".

	schema:reviewBody "Hitchcock's Marnie was a critical and financial failure when released in 1964. Some decades afterwards the film was 'rediscovered' by film theorists fascinated by its engagement with issues such as Freudian psychoanalysis sexual abuse gender roles trauma sexual deviance. The central plot revolves around Marnie a habitual thief who goes to work for large corporations steals from her always male boss then flees  dying her hair changing her name and then starting over again.One employer Mark Rutland recognises her from one of her previous companies. When she robs him he pursues and marries her. Playing Freud to her Jane he alternates between trying to get her into bed and determining the link between her thefts and her fear of sex thunder storms the colour red and men.Tippi Hedren is ideally suited for the role of Marnie her tremblingbutfirm voice and impassive dolllike face give her the look and feel of a toughyetvulnerable childwoman lost in a nightmare world. Sean Connery is terrific asRutland and the interaction between his character and Marnie suggests at times a slight subversion of gender roles. She may be troubled but she won't easily fall under his net he likens her to a wild animal  and will tell him!Throughout the film there is a brilliant use of colour and some memorably dreamlike shots the opening of Marnie her face unseen with black hair walking as if in a daze along a railway platform and through a hotel the hand banging against a window alarming the sleeping Marnie the flashback to the woman's troubled past.Unfortunately  and other reviewers on IMDb have argued this  the film's editing is often lazy. Some scenes go on for far too long and are way too chatty. More show and less tell I say! There are those fake backdrops. They can be seen to suggest Marnie's detachment from the world as Hitch once argued but why couldn't he include them with every shot of her? Laziness again?Then there's Lil the sister of Mark's dead wife. Diane Baker gives a terrific performance and there is the suggestion that Lil's attraction to her former brotherinlaw might be deceptive... it could be Marnie she's after. Just check out the look she gives Marnie when they first meet and her remark 'Who's that Dish'? But the lesbian subtext is never explored. Lil's character is never developed beyond a woman who alternates between smiling and scowling at Marnie and then disappearing before the dramatic 'final confession'.Otherwise a brave film elegant to look at and rich with issues for the film theorist AND the 'casual' viewer to explore.".

	schema:headline " Great Genius";
	schema:reviewBody "Marnie is a misunderstood masterpiece from the Hitchcock. Often cited as an example of a messy flawed genius  it can be off putting to some since its quite talky.  However stick with it and you will be intrigued and itching to discover all about Marnie contrary to what most say played with understated brilliance from Tippi Hedren.  The direction and cinematography is exceptional with Hitchcock and his usual crew i.e. Rob Burks etc on form.  The atmosphere generated apart from being 'Hitchcocky' is unique dark gloomy and at times akin to a horror film yet it is utterly appealing and compelling.  Theres an almost creepy artificial humanless feel to proceedings as a result of the direction and how the actors have been directed to act as is briefly highlighted by a Hitchcock scholar in the documentary on the disk. Hitchcock knows the art of cinema no flashy fast cuts or fast moving camera's as we see nowadays but measured inspired direction laced with flourishes of creative genius thats Hithcock for you.  Atmosphere emotion is built up like poetry. Witness for example some moments of genius such as the final revelation in what is one of Hitchcocks most underrated powerful and shocking pieces of direction the riding sequence which culminates in Marnies fantastic yet disturbing line of dialogue  there there.... and also sinister momnets such as when Marnies mother wakes here from her nightmare her voice disturbingly artificial in its lack of emotion and empathy for a clearly distraught Marnie.  Speaking of the mother Louise Latham the actress behind the role effortlessly steals the show from an already superb Hedren and Connery. Latham eleicits an absolutely breathtaking performance.  Her character is frighteningly creepy tragic powerful and marvellously played to keep up the suspense and intrigue.  You don't know what to make of the character except of the fact she knows or has played a part in Marnies psychological condition.  In fact I would go as far as to say it is one of the greatest performances in a Hitchcock picture  an example of genius casting. Similarly her character is arguably the greatest 'mother' character in any Hitchcock film beating Pyscho and Notorious' madame Sebastion.Marnie is a truly great picture and definetly Hitchcocks last great although Frenzy is a nice enough distraction.  Not as good as Vertigo or Rear Window but certainly up there in the higher echelons of Hitchcocks work.910".

	onyx:emotionText "Marnie is a misunderstood masterpiece from the Hitchcock. Often cited as an example of a messy flawed genius  it can be off putting to some since its quite talky.  However stick with it and you will be intrigued and itching to discover all about Marnie contrary to what most say played with understated brilliance from Tippi Hedren.  The direction and cinematography is exceptional with Hitchcock and his usual crew i.e. Rob Burks etc on form.  The atmosphere generated apart from being 'Hitchcocky' is unique dark gloomy and at times akin to a horror film yet it is utterly appealing and compelling.  Theres an almost creepy artificial humanless feel to proceedings as a result of the direction and how the actors have been directed to act as is briefly highlighted by a Hitchcock scholar in the documentary on the disk. Hitchcock knows the art of cinema no flashy fast cuts or fast moving camera's as we see nowadays but measured inspired direction laced with flourishes of creative genius thats Hithcock for you.  Atmosphere emotion is built up like poetry. Witness for example some moments of genius such as the final revelation in what is one of Hitchcocks most underrated powerful and shocking pieces of direction the riding sequence which culminates in Marnies fantastic yet disturbing line of dialogue  there there.... and also sinister momnets such as when Marnies mother wakes here from her nightmare her voice disturbingly artificial in its lack of emotion and empathy for a clearly distraught Marnie.

	schema:reviewBody "Far and away my favourite Hitch and in my top five movies of all time yes I'm very biased but there you go Marnie stands out as one of the most deliciously bitter malevolent and sardonic romance stories ever made and it doesn't surprise me in the least that it is either sworn by or passionately hated by general public. It is however no less influential than any of the acclaimed and widely loved films that Hitch made previously. Even the staunchest of Hitchcock's fans seem to be bitterly divided over this one though some among them simply not being able to forgive him for being so direct and blatant in choice and treatment of his subject matter let alone technical inadequacies  and for delivering a slow sombre pain ridden and malignant psychosexual drama whereas others myself included revel in those very aspects of the film. Hedren and Connery's singular coupling on screen and their performances have also been subject to much heated debate  in my opinion they're both excellent in that they very successfully portray genuinely unlovable characters and play off one another almost instinctively and to great effect helped by a phenomenally sarcastic dialogue and more than memorable quips The idea was to kill myself not to feed the damned fish as well as the entire You Freud me Jane sequence. Delightful.Hedren is adequately surly bitter spiteful troubled and fragile all at the same time her average acting talents and icy beauty working for the film rather than against it whereas Connery is nothing short of a perverse yet suave male filthy pig dying to get in between her treasured legs and take legal possession for precisely those reasons. Unsurprisingly the chapter in acclaimed Truffaut's book of interviews with Hitch that belongs to Marnie is subtitled Un Amour Fetishiste  read it. It's interesting that Hitchcock had troubles with his leading ladies in some of his best films  his disdain of Kim Novak and endless arguments he had with her on set are all well documented in addition to his falling out with Hedren halfway through Marnie. Both films are laced with moments of electrifying energy maybe just for that reason and both women look spectacular on screen. In any case it's perfect casting for both leads in this one in addition to a brilliant support led by Latham and Baker not to mention Herrmann's emotional score which so assuredly bounces between hysterical pleading lustful torturous and tragic  and back again.Aside from directorial touches of genius who doesn't get goosebumps when Marnie first reveals her face after washing out the hair dye  there are undoubtedly many many flaws and technically weak places in the film  the zooming in and out on the money in the Rutland safe is a particular standout in that respect totally over the top and downright silly. Obviously painted backdrops and horseriding sequences have all been slagged off to death as well altough surprisingly these don't seem to bother people that much when systematically applied in The Birds but they are more than compensated for by the greyish autumnal and trancelike feel of the film and are very likely deliberately calculated in to greatly enhance the overall atmosphere. Hitch doesn't even try to win the viewer's affection by injecting a bit of his trademark humour in this doleful story and rightly so  it would have suffered immeasurably and would have been totally out of place. For this is a serious film about both female and male emotional and sexual hang ups Hedren I'm sick?? Well take a look at yourself old dear!!...you've got a pathological fix on a woman who's not only an admitted criminal but who screams if you come near her!!  Connery Well I never said I was perfect  un grand film malade as Truffaut affectionately put it  therefore no humour apart from the bitterest variety no happy ending no sympathetic characters we can identify with nothing. But the manner in which the film ends  the car departing exiting from screen where previously we saw no street road or way out  gives a flicker of hope that Marnie will eventually with or without Mark be able to find her peace. You can either love or despise the symbolism  it's entirely left to you.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Marnie was first released it was quite unfairly  dismissed by critics.  It has since been come to be known as one of Hitchcock's great films though.  Tippi Hedren stars as Marnie.  She is a liar and a thief. She has stolen large amounts of money from her employers on various occasions.  Things start to change as she begins to work for the dashing Mark Rutland though.  He becomes romantically interested in her but not wanting to get close to anybody she decides to steal the money and escape as quickly as she can.  However Mark catches her red handed and he gives her the choice of marrying him or being held accountable for her crimes.  She chooses to marry him but he comes to find out that she can't stand to be touched by any man.  He realizes that she has a deep seated problem from her past and that he must now help her to confront this.  Marnie is a wonderful film and it is very underrated.  A lot of people have watched it and it has gone over their heads therefore leading to the underrated status.  It is much the same with Tippi Hedren's performance.  Even though it is brilliant alot of people cannot see how wonderful it really is.  Sean Connery is also very good.It is really too bad that some people can't see Marnie for the masterpiece that it is.  It's really quite pointless to call Marnie a flawed film as well.  If Marnie is truly watched intelligently you will see that this is not the case. Marnie deserves far more credit than it gets.  If you watch it I hope that you enjoy it as much as I have.5 stars  5 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "Add me to the group of viewers who like this film. Yes it is long and heavy on dialog but visually stunning and Bernard Herrmann's music is rich and vibrant. The best score he has ever composed. For me I have favorite scenes in the movie for example the opening shot of a woman carrying a yellow purse. From there we go to her hotel room and watch as she transforms herself into another person. Old clothes get discarded in a train locker and the key gently kicked down a grate. All of this is done with no words but wonderful camera angles and accompanied by a great musical score.The office scene where Marnie waits in the women's room before robbing the safe. You only hear the voices of her coworkers saying good night for the weekend. Again this entire scene is done visually only this time with a split screen showing Marnie and the cleaning lady simultaneously as if we are watching a play. Only when the shoe falls from her coat pocket do we know that the cleaning woman is hard of hearing and the scene is now concluded. There are several vignettes such as these that make the movie interesting. Yes the riding scenes are fake looking and I think it was just a case where Alfred just didn't quite keep up with technology. But when you think of Marnie this is the last true Alfred Hitchcock movie we will ever see. From then on we never again see a grand production with high production values as we have here.Yes it has flaws and the acting may not be up to par at times but there are worthwhile aspects that make this movie a classic in the Hitchcock canon.".

	schema:reviewBody "Much more so than VERTIGO whicheven though it deals with one man's neurosis is a classic whodunit.  Jimmy Stewart's coming to grips with his fear of heights at the end of VERTIGO is merely an icing of suspense on an otherwise well baked murder mystery.  In MARNIE on the other hand Hitchcock deals with the deeper darker side of Marnie's psychosexual illness.  Mark Rutland's Sean Conneryconstant probing into Marnie's Tippi Hedren persona takes on the role of psychotherapy complete with word association games and sound cues that shake Marnie's subconscious.  In one scene Rutland is even seen reading Psychosexual Behavior in the Criminal Mind.  Strange nighttime reading material for a handsome newly married businessman of a certain wealth.  In the end there is a complete pyschocatharsis as Marnie remembers the traumatic night when as a child she killed the sailor Bruce Dern thus unleashing a lifetime of criminal psychosis.Hitchcock's direction is masterful in its depth of portrayal of Freud's Interpretation of Dreams.  The scene in which Marnie experiences a nightmare at the Rutland manse is a perfect example.  As the dream begins the set is that of her mother's house during a stormy night when her mother's clients came rapping on the door. Marnie awakens however in the plush bedroom of the Rutland residence.  Hitchcock's camera takes us into the criminal unconscious and then exits into an opulent satin covered reality gone psychotic.  This insight helps us to see the troubled Marnie in a sympathetic light.  Hedren's awesome acting talent underscores this as at times she emotes a little lost child persona.  This is very true to character since emotionally Marnie's development stopped that night when as a child attempted to save her mother.From the beginning of the film Hedren's portrayal of Marnie is pregnant with a little girl's search for maternal love and approval.  At the end of the film Rutland's explanation of Marnie's life of theft as the compensatory behavior of an unloved child is simplistic and amateurish from a psychiatric viewpoint.  However it works for the audience Hitchcock is trying to touch and it is reminiscent of the doctor's pedantic and sophomoric review of Norman's psychosis in PSYCHO a horror film rife with simplistic freudian interpretation. On a deeper level Hitchcock takes us on a journey through one woman's Electra Complex as Marnie's euthanasia of a horse with a broken leg symbolically foreshadows the final scene in which Marnie's newfound memory of the horrible night serves to kill her psychotic ties to her mother's past.  Now in the paternal yet comforting arms of her husband Mark Marnie's life as a grown woman is sure to take a turn for the better.  Her fears of going to prison are the only vestige to a child's traumatic past.".

An exceptional Hitchcock film dealing with an exciting intrigue blended with sexual and Freudian theories . Besides  it has a literately witty dialog with distinctive Hitch's touches and writing credits by Jay Presson Allen . Nice acting by the great Sean Connery as current boss who catches Marnie in the theft act and forces her to marry him  though he soon learns the puzzling aspects of Marnie's background . Alfred Hitchcock and screenwriter Jay Presson Allen were allowed to see scenes from Agent 007 and doctor No 1962 when considering Sean Connery for the role of Mark . They liked his charismatic performance so much that they decided to offer him the role even though the obviously Scottish actor did not really fit with their conception of Mark as an American aristocrat.

Despite the troubles which reportedly took place on set  Tippi Hedren has stated that this is her favorite movie which she has appeared in . Alfred Hitchcock wanted Grace Kelly to make her screen comeback in the title role but the people of Monaco were not happy with the idea of their princess playing a compulsive thief . Good secondary cast such as Diane Baker as his scheming sisterinlaw  Martin Gabel  the tall Alan Napier and Louise Latham who played Tippi Hedren's mother is in reality only 8 years older.

	schema:headline " Unusual Hitchcockwhere marriage is preferred over jail by a strongwilled woman";
	schema:reviewBody "This is not the stuff that director Hitchcock is usually attracted to. Hitchcock was scared of jails. In this film the lead female character prefers to be bridled by marriage rather than jail. It is an intriguing choice for a character who had earlier stated to her husband You don't love me. I am something you have caught. Some kind of wild animal you have trapped. Aware of this the young lady who has so far fooled a lot of rich men and escaped the law prefers marriage to jail. She is smart a woman who embezzles her employers to buy rich gifts for her mother aware of modesty in dress keeps pulling her skirt over her knees and a convincing liar. Like Notorious the marriage is one of convenience or so it appearsthe end of the film is openended.For those who are not aware of it Hitchcock fired the initial scriptwriter a male who honestly felt the rape of the wife by the husband was out character with male lead played by Sean Connery. The replaced scriptwriter a lady wrote the sequence which was used in a suggestive way rather than a graphic way. Hitchcock loved to slip in sex even if it was out of character. Lesbianism is suggested by the husband's sisterinlaw's remark What a dish! a remark one would associate from the opposite sex. Hitchcock similarly played with homosexuality in Rope. A critical scene that could be mistaken for child molestation was probably an innocent gesture mistaken by the mother.Hitchcock usually was attentive to visuals and sound. This is an unusual film where the director swings from one extreme of high sophistication to absolute stupidity. The opening shots of the woman walking away with the yellow handbag are stunning. The silent cleaning of the office safe while a deaf woman cleans the office is simply outstanding. Yet the crass painting of a dock near Marnie's mother's house would make a school kid laugh out loud. Why would a woman who is scared of red wear red lipstick or not react when her husband's sisterinlaw wears red at a party? Similarly the shot of Marnie's hand not being able to pick up the money in the safe is an unconvincing shot if ever there was one.The film can be appreciated and be equally dismissed. The acting by all the main characters was good but Louise Latham performance and make up! needs to be singled out for praise. Kubrick seems to have copied Hitchcock's Marie's voice differentiation in the young child's voice in The Shining. I am not surprised if people swing from liking the film to dismissing it and back again. It has great elements and bad elements as wellyet the bottom line is it entertains!".

	schema:reviewBody "'Marnie' is widely dismissed by critics but is gradually being accepted now. Tippi Hedren makes her final Hitchcock film appearance in this tale of theft love and mysterious secrets. Marnie is a compulsive thief and liar who travels from job to job and robbing her employers in order to send money to her mother Bernice Louise Latham in Baltimore. When she is employed by Mark Rutland Sean Connery fresh from 'Dr. No' his first Bond film she soon robs him and tries to flee but is caught by Mark who blackmails her into marriage. Eventually Mark begins to uncover the truth about his new wife and what is wrong with her. This movie is truly gripping as you watch Hedren appear as a heartless thief who disregards other people but only is doing so for her mother who is a cripple from an old accident. Marnie is only a fragile and troubled woman who really longs for affection which Mark tries to give her and acceptance from her mother. Connery is an impressive actor who takes on a role that is so different from the charming suave man that most audiences know but here he is charming sly and deceptive towards finding out Marnie's secrets. It's a fabulous combination and makes for a thrilling ride.".

	schema:reviewBody "Marnie opens powerfully at a train station director Alfred Hitchcock focusing on an immaculately suited woman and the yellow purse clutched tightly possessively under her arm. She's Marnie Edgar Tippi Hedren a parttime thief who specialises in infiltrating companies and robbing them of their savings. When corporate head Mark Rutland Sean Connery is fleeced by Marnie he becomes infatuated with the woman. He follows her pursues her and finally uses Marnie's criminality to blackmail her into marriage. After much domestic turmoil Connery cast because of his real life misogyny? The misogyny of his James Bond character? then learns that Marnie is both sexually frigid and has a deep traumatic aversion to men. Why? After being abandoned by her husband Marnie's mother was forced into prostitution to make ends meet. It is then implied that Marnie was abused by and murdered one of her mother's clients.Upon release Marnie was criticised for being melodramatic unrealistic and fake looking. Expressionism was on the way out and audiences were beginning to gravitate toward the literalism of new Hollywood which was cash rich and busy absorbing European neorealist movements. With the toppling of various codes and strictures Western films also began to develop a certain explicitness everything could be shown and so should be. The hidden was out the mystery was gone. In came an obsession with the verbatim and the prosaic everything rendered directly and vulgarly with the explicitness of cash. What you see is what you get. But Marnie was rooted firmly in turnofthecentury German Expressionism. The film was proudly retro its plot consisting of a series of dreams within dreams characters are constantly waking up all told with big lurid images and Bernard Herrmann's pounding score. And as with the best of Hitchcock Marnie had a voluptuous quality Hitchcock's colours luminous his matte paintings proudly artificial every shot injected with a certain grandeur. Audiences hated it. Hitchcock was having a blast. The film's packed to the brim with phallic trains symbolic orgasms roiling waves vaginal handbags looming men huge painted boats symbollically dwarfing the childhood home in which sailors abused Marnie's mom and virile horses. Sex is everywhere.Whilst typically thought of as another one of Hitchcock's mommy pictures Marnie is as much about fathers and sons as it is about mothers and daughters. Mark's family is structured around the ghostly memoryreverence of a lost sonbrother and whilst Marnie is fatherless and siblingless Mark adores daddy and has his own complementary and oppositional deficiencies he's neurotic she psychotic she runs he interferes she denies he controls. Much of the film then watches as Mark turns into a quasi psychologist determined to pick apart Marnie's fragile psyche in an effort to determine why she's unstable frigid and kleptomaniacal.But is Mark a good guy or is he to be blunt a rapist? Mark originally wanted to be a zoologist and displays no emotion other than intellectual curiosity. He sees Marnie as but a specimen to be examined. An insect to be kept. Elsewhere his home library is filled with oldfashioned and misogynistic titles Sexual Aberrations of the Female Criminal etc. Detached and almost apathetic Mark seems to desire only to keep Marnie close to possess her his tight control over Marnie's life and psyche bordering on the abusive. Couple this with the fact that Mark refuses to talk about his exwife what happened to her? and has effectively seduced his sister in law reducing her to a sexstarved teenager and loyal lapdog and you have a very strange character. Though at times compassionate Mark's mostly a paternalistic overlord who uses literal rape and psychoanalysis as a kind of invasive metarape on Marnie. Even when he helps her Mark implicates Marnie and places the blame firmly on women. This of course echoes Hitchcock's reported treatment of Tippi Hedren He was a misogynist not doubt about it she says in interviews his attempts to control her possess her and destroy her career.Late in the film Marnie and Mark have a confrontation on an ocean liner the gigantic vessel reminding Marnie of her mother's clients sailors and the ships parked like monsters outside her home. Marnie wants to be left alone but the couple have sex instead and Hitchcock stages the event as a rape. The audience is initially with Mark and positioned to believe that a little manhandling a little sexual healing is all Marnie needed Mark even uses condescendingly sexist phrases like boning up on etc. The idea that frigid women simply need a little rough sex is of course resolutely sexist the old sexist notion that if she refuses to have sex then something is clinically wrong with her. But we don't realise this until poor Marnie attempts to commit suicide immediately afterwards. Even then Mark sees nothing wrong with his actions.What's problematic is this whilst admitting that this is an act of rape Hitchcock goes on to rationalise the act from Mark's perspective. Then in his final sequence shot with a strange lens so as to distort Marnie's childhood bedroom thereby capturing her disjointed fragmented psyche Marnie becomes normal and cured and by extension now available to Mark. Hitchcock's films frequently collide male sexual desire with the denial of female agency and identity Vertigo Man Who Knew Too Much Notorious etc but here Mark is seemingly absolved shifts the blame for Marnie's frigidity onto her mother and positions himself as a white knight. The film's faith in its lead couple then goes uncontested. Or does it? Hitchcock closing moments hint that Marnie's newfound relationship will be like jail and a symbolic shot of a basketball recalls a tale by Marnie mother in which she explains that women give their bodies only in an attempt to get things from men. In Marnie's case she's stuck with Mark because the alternative is prison their relationship still founded on blackmail and an abuse of power.8.510  Masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is part of the Hitchcock series released by Universal on DVD. While the picture and sound are fine they are by no means reference quality for rerelease of 1960s vintage color movies. The picture has quite a bit of grain and at times doesn't appear very sharp as if made via a second or third generation copy of the original film. Still a very nice Hitchcock sex mystery by his own description in the trailer. In fact the almost 5 minute trailer included in the DVD extras is very interesting for those who may not be old enough to have witnessed Hitchcock's humor.The movie opens with a lady walking away from the camera clutching a yellow purse and heading for the train platform. At the same time her employer Mr. Strutt was lamenting the missing money almost 10000 from the company safe. Tippi Hedren stars as Marnie EdgarMargaret EdgarPeggy NicholsonMary Taylor a 30something single lady who seems to have made a career of ripping off her employer then disappearing under a new name and in most cases a new look. Quite accidentally she next applies for a job with the Rutland company in Philadelphia. Sean Connery is the boss Mark Rutland and thinks he recognizes her from his visits with his client Mr. Strutt. Educated as a Zoologist before he took over the family business his area of interest was 'animal behavior' which included the human animal and took an interest in this lady mainly out of curiosity. Diane Baker is Mark's sister Lil who is suspicious of Marnie from the beginning and does a bit of sleuthing on her own. It is clear that Marnie has some big issues from childhood. She tells everyone that she has no family but sends money back to her mother in Baltimore. When she visits mom will not show any affection Marnie doesn't understand. Nor does she understand why she is afraid of storms and especially the color red. Mark falls in love with her very quickly intent on protecting her and helping her.MAJOR SPOILERS. As soon as Marnie gets her first opportunity she steals the code for the Rutland safe and steals the money. Mark was already suspicious finds and confronts her but offers to make restitution himself. When he finds out about the Strutt theft he covers that one also. He offers to either marry Marnie or turn her into the police because he can't just turn a criminal out on the street.

However while Marnie is not one of Hitchcock's very finest films it is one of his most underrated. And I don't think it is close to his worst his weakest overall for me is Jamaica Inn and Topaz the worst of his lateperiod films. Hitchcock directs splendidly with a lot of memorable touches in the final thirty minutes that are his style all over while the photography is suave atmospheric and above all striking. Bernard Hermann's score while not quite as good as his ones for Vertigo and Psycho fits perfectly and has a very haunting edge. The dialogue has wit and intensity which makes the many talky scenes in Marnie interesting. The story is slow in pace but didn't bore me here there are themes that are not easy to talk about that are explored compellingly and tastefully. The final thirty minutes is edgeofyourseat stuff to me the best final act of any Hitchcock film proPsycho. The characters are not easy to engage with and very complex especially Hedren's but all the actors give their all to making them interesting to the viewer. Grace Kelly may be more people's idea of icy aloofness needed for the woman who steals to forget but Tippi Hedren particularly in the final act does a very good jobthough I preferred her in The Birds. Sean Connery has a very atypical role his character is somewhat boorish and calculating but he brings those qualities across as well as his trademark suavity and charm. Diane Baker is terrific and Louise Latham is genuinely frightening as the mother figure. Bruce Dern and Martin Gabel don't have as much to do but they are good too. To conclude a fascinating film. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " Hitchcock's Most Psychological Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Margaret Marnie Edgar is an attractive young woman who makes a living by stealing from her employers. She applies for a job under a false name waits for an opportunity to embezzle money and then disappears before changing her identity and obtaining a job in another city. One of the false names she uses is Marion possibly a reference Hitchcock's Psycho which also deals with a young female embezzler of that name. Her behaviour however is presented as the result less of dishonesty than of a psychological compulsion to steal. Kleptomania is not her only psychological problem she also suffers from phobias about thunderstorms the colour red and physical contact or intimacy with men.Marnie's obtains a job with a large publishing company and attracts the attention of Mark Rutland the head of the firm. Mark falls in love with his beautiful employee and when he catches her stealing from the company blackmails her into marrying him instead of reporting her to the police. Unsurprisingly the marriage proves a disaster and Marnie attempts suicide on their honeymoon. Mark realises that the only way to save his marriage and possibly Marnie's life is to unlock the dark secret buried in her past which is the cause of her psychological problems.When the film was released in 1964 it was not a success at the boxoffice. Perhaps audiences of the day were put off by its frequently dark and challenging subjectmatter touching on such matters as frigidity child molestation and marital rape. The rape scene is omitted in some versions of the film. Some have seen a possible lesbian subtext in the uneasy relationship between Marnie and Mark's sisterinlaw Lil although my interpretation would be that Lil is in love with Mark herself and that her feelings towards Marnie are ones of sexual jealousy rather than sexual desire.Audiences might also have felt that Marnie is not what they had come to expect from Alfred Hitchcock. Certainly he had a deep interest in psychology and psychiatry evident in films such as Spellbound and Psycho and also to some extent Notorious Strangers on a Train and others. Marnie however is his most purely psychological thriller. The other films I mention are also physical thrillers with classic Hitchcock thriller plots either manwronglyaccused in Spellbound and Strangers on a Train or womaninperil in Psycho and Notorious. Marnie on the other hand is more heavily weighted in favour of psychological analysis with little by way of physical suspense there is for example no equivalent of the shower scene in Psycho. The closest is possibly the scene where Marnie carrying out a robbery is threatened with discovery by the cleaner.What the film lacks in physical excitement however it makes up for in psychological depth. Tippi Hedren was perhaps an unlikely film star. She rose to fame as a fashion model in the 1950s but had no acting experience apart from an uncredited nonspeaking role in one film when in her thirties she was discovered by Hitchcock and offered a part in The Birds largely on the strength of her physical resemblance to some of his other muses such as Grace Kelly and Eva Marie Saint. Kelly wanted to use Marnie as the vehicle for her return to the big screen following her marriage until she discovered that her husband's subjects did not wish to see their Princess impersonating a mentally disturbed kleptomaniac.This was the second of the two films Hedren made with Hitchcock and she is excellent better than in The Birds. To portray a beautiful elegant smartlydressed woman which is how Marnie appears in the early scenes would not have been too difficult for a professional model but the ability to portray the deeply disturbed girl of the later ones clearly called for acting skills of a higher order. Hedren's performance here should be avidly studied by all those modern supermodels far too many to single out by name who assume that acting and the ability to sashay down a catwalk are one and the same thing. Sean Connery sounds too Scottish to be entirely convincing as the American Mark but there is another firstclass contribution from Louise Latham as Marnie's mother Bernice. Domineering or overprotective mothers often appear in Hitchcock's psychological thrillers.Another point of interest is Hitchcock's use of colour. He anticipates Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now in giving symbolic importance to the colour red but whereas Roeg's film featured a bright red object in virtually every scene Hitchcock uses the colour very sparingly. Instead most scenes are dominated by the complementary colour green. There is some attractive photography of the verdant Maryland countryside Winston Graham's novel was set in England but Hitchcock relocates the action to the area around Baltimore and most scenes include a prominent green object. When something red appears it does so at crucial points in the plot connected with Marnie's phobias. There is also an striking musical score from Bernard Herrmann his last for a Hitchcock film. He did compose one for Torn Curtain but the director disliked it and it was never used.Marnie is not normally regarded as one of the great Hitchcock classics and until recently I would have agreed that it is not one of his best works perhaps on a par with something like Under Capricorn or Topaz. Having now seen it again however I am prepared to revise my opinion. Certainly some of the criticisms made of it are justified some of the scenes are too lengthy and dominated by endless conversations and there is some very unconvincing use made of devices such as obvious matte paintings and back projection. At one point when Mark and Marnie are travelling in a car it appears to be summer on one side of the road and autumn on the other. It is however one of Hitchcock's profoundest analyses of human nature exposing the dark depths which can lie beneath a calm tranquil surface. 810".

Hitchcock provides a couple of effective scenes but overall seems to have lost his touch. The process effects are cheesy the music overorchestrated and the film at 2hrs and 10 minutes seems to take forever to get to the final revelation which is complete with thunder and lightning and overthetop performing by Tippi Hedrin and Louise Latham who plays her mother. The rest of the cast makes little or no impression and even less sense of their characters. Following North by Northwest 59 Psycho 60 and The Birds 63 Marnie is watchable if disappointing. 1964 produced 2 daring and interesting films dealing with abnormal female psychology Sam Fuller's The Naked Kiss and Robert Rossen's Lilith.".

	schema:headline " Hitchcock at his most misogynistic";
	schema:reviewBody "Marnie is a habitual liar thief and cheat in her own words. She goes from job to job eventually robbing from each of them until she meets Mark Rutland who instantly falls with her. However as he discovers her habit he is compelled to help her and save her both from the authorities and from herself.Marnie says it's a trap and it is but what makes this film particularly disturbing is that apparently Sean Connery's Mark is a hero or something. Using only the worst in Freudian psychobabble and a large desire to get into Marnie's skirt Mark leads her through traumatizing confrontation and traumatizing confrontation until she finally comes to terms with her own repressed memories... which is apparently enough to make her love him and go home to him like the happy little housewife she should be.Because see apparently Marnie being a criminal is completely a result of her weakness and inability to cope with her mother's history which is in turn necessary for a MAN to figure out. And even though she does not love this man she never does at any point in this movie reveal such a love his saving her is what is required to have her want to go back home with him. It's disturbing but not in the good disturbing way like with movies like Requiem for a Dream that are supposed to disturb you away from certain choices or disturbing like Apocalypse Now which is supposed to paint a gratuitous antiwar picture. It's disturbing because throughout the movie you keep asking yourself Is Hitchcock really gonna do that? and yes yes he does. Hitchcock has decided to fully reveal his misogynism.Even beyond that this movie fails on several levels. Hitchcock uses two effects that are entirely contradictory her fear of red which is represented in much the same way as the psychosis in Vertigo and the heavy use of red on the set to represent masculinity like he does in many of his films. But uh Hitch if she's afraid of red so that she literally wigs out over a small amount of spilt red on her blouse why is she not going into seizures surrounded by all the red in Mark's house? Oh and uh why is she wearing red lipstick? Only one moment with the violent reaction to red actually works anyway and that's the one where she spills the ink because it actually looks like blood which makes sense. The rest of it is contrived and unbelievable.And speaking of unbelievable the entire relationship seems completely impossible. How a meeting of two characters like the ones portrayed could ever result in an eventual mutuality is beyond me. It's not just bad chemistry of the actors it's bad writing. The only character in this movie that seems remotely sympathetic is Lil and even she is just a deranged Freudian antihero.No this movie is just terrible. I've had issues with Hitchcock's works before but usually I've been able to find them at least technically acute and entertaining. This movie is proof that the Master wasn't always on his top form.PolarisDiB".

	onyx:emotionText "Marnie is a habitual liar thief and cheat in her own words. She goes from job to job eventually robbing from each of them until she meets Mark Rutland who instantly falls with her. However as he discovers her habit he is compelled to help her and save her both from the authorities and from herself.Marnie says it's a trap and it is but what makes this film particularly disturbing is that apparently Sean Connery's Mark is a hero or something. Using only the worst in Freudian psychobabble and a large desire to get into Marnie's skirt Mark leads her through traumatizing confrontation and traumatizing confrontation until she finally comes to terms with her own repressed memories... which is apparently enough to make her love him and go home to him like the happy little housewife she should be.Because see apparently Marnie being a criminal is completely a result of her weakness and inability to cope with her mother's history which is in turn necessary for a MAN to figure out. And even though she does not love this man she never does at any point in this movie reveal such a love his saving her is what is required to have her want to go back home with him. It's disturbing but not in the good disturbing way like with movies like Requiem for a Dream that are supposed to disturb you away from certain choices or disturbing like Apocalypse Now which is supposed to paint a gratuitous antiwar picture. It's disturbing because throughout the movie you keep asking yourself Is Hitchcock really gonna do that? and yes yes he does. Hitchcock has decided to fully reveal his misogynism.Even beyond that this movie fails on several levels. Hitchcock uses two effects that are entirely contradictory her fear of red which is represented in much the same way as the psychosis in Vertigo and the heavy use of red on the set to represent masculinity like he does in many of his films. But uh Hitch if she's afraid of red so that she literally wigs out over a small amount of spilt red on her blouse why is she not going into seizures surrounded by all the red in Mark's house? Oh and uh why is she wearing red lipstick? Only one moment with the violent reaction to red actually works anyway and that's the one where she spills the ink because it actually looks like blood which makes sense. The rest of it is contrived and unbelievable.And speaking of unbelievable the entire relationship seems completely impossible. How a meeting of two characters like the ones portrayed could ever result in an eventual mutuality is beyond me. It's not just bad chemistry of the actors it's bad writing. The only character in this movie that seems remotely sympathetic is Lil and even she is just a deranged Freudian antihero.No this movie is just terrible.

Tippi Hedren was still very young and new to acting but perfect for this role a more experienced actress might have tried to bring too much to what should be a rather stiff character.

	schema:headline " A meanspirited degrading film...typical Hitchcock stuff";
	schema:reviewBody "For some bizarre reason MARNIE is considered by some as being a masterpiece or an underrated gem. It's not. It's the beginning of the end of Hitchcock and it's not a pretty sight. I've seen MARNIE a million times because every time it's on TV I just have to watch it like a car wreck. The whole thing is very fascinating but not in a positive way but in a what the f was wrong with Hitchcock? I've seen all of Hitchcock's movies and I consider some of them to be great but as I've grown older I've started to see the truly ugly side of his films. This change happened when I saw FRENZY with an open and objective mind and noticed the really ugly and meanspiritedness of that film. I can't watch that film anymore because Hitch simply had contempt for his characters acting like some sort of god having fun with the misery of his creation. With the bad aftertaste left by FRENZY I rewatched every Hitch film again and quickly realized that degradation is a regular theme in his film in NOTORIOUS Bergman has to marry a man against her will etc. And MARNIE is probably Hitchcock's crowning achievement of meanspiritedness and degradation. But unlike his earlier films like NOTORIOUS or even REBECCA the gleam of old Hollywood glamor was a thing of the past when MARNIE was made and released and what degrading things the director got away with during the golden age of Hollywood by blinding the audience of the seedy aspects of his stories with big stars and big budgets and big studios he simply couldn't get away with that anymore with a minor actress like Tippi Hedren and up and coming star Sean Connery playing the male romantic lead. Hedren and Connery are poor substitutes for Bergman and Grant. And because the ugliness of the story couldn't be hidden by layers of glamor and glitz MARNIE's true colors were obvious to everyone. MARNIE also showed that Hitchcock was losing touch with the times. The film has an odd quaint feel to it even though its subject is anything but quaint. Even if he created two modern masterpieces of horror just before this film with PSYCHO and THE BIRDS Hitchcock's style and themes didn't transition well with the changes of the 1960s and MARNIE was the first of a series of misfires Hitch made in that era. Released in 1964 MARNIE feels like it was made in the mid1950s.Every time I watch MARNIE I always try to figure out how the audience reacted to this bizarre rape fantasy flick. I say bizarre because the whole film has several incongruous elements that clash constantly and yet it's shown almost as being normal case in point the music score. It's swirling with romanticism even though what we see on screen is unpleasant to say the least. Hitchcock came up with the term McGuffin to explain something unimportant in the story that's merely a plot device for suspense or motivation for characters. In MARNIE the title character herself Marnie is the McGuffin and she's the target of every little sexual fantasy Hitchcock had vis a vis women in general. Marnie the character is merely a cypher. And what she's made to go through is really troubling. Not troubling as a film technically the film is simply too whack bad acting bad sets bad stilted dialogue... but troubling as a showcase of all the stuff Hitch kept inside of him and decided to foist upon its unsuspecting audience with this film. I can only imagine the reaction of the people who first watched this back then. I'm sure there was a lot of head scratching going on.The story is simple enough a beautiful female thief is caught redhanded by a handsome man who instead of telling the police about her crimes basically blackmails her into staying with him. If she strays he'll spill the beans to the authorities and she'll endup in prison. So Marnie decides to stay with Mark and she becomes a toy for him to play with. Aside from the obvious misogynistic aspects the story itself is filled with potential but unfortunately Hitchcock plays coy with it and gives it a romantic treatment even though everything that occurs on screen is anything but romantic. I could go on and on about the intricate details Hitchcock peppered this story with an amazing variety of exploitive elements all in the name of targeting Marnie with as many unpleasant acts or actions as possible rape blackmail kidnapping caught in the act etc but no I won't. The story speaks for itself. Mark doesn't want to help Marnie. He gets his kicks by putting her through unpleasant situations most people wouldn't accept under any circumstances. Having the option why would anyone stay with Mark who's made to be shown as someone who's unfunny mean and basically a bully? Marnie should have just gone to the police and confess her crimes. But no. In this wonky Hitchcock tale Marnie remains with Mark and thanks to his help she ends up looking like some sort of piata with the final revelation being the candy and prize popping out of her.What's troubling about MARNIE is the director's lack of honesty. He should have went all the way with Marnie accidentally cured of her problems while Mark really uses her for his pleasure. Now that would have been fascinating. But as I said before Hitchcock was losing touch with how to represent a story with modern themes and as it is now with MARNIE looking like some sort of glamorous romantic flick imagine PILLOW TALK but with a sordid twist well it just doesn't work at all it doesn't work as a romantic movie or sexual suspense or as a psychological thriller. It's a degrading exploitation film dressed up badly like a Harlequin novel.".

His brother once played by the tentimesbetter Charles Grodin who has long since ended his film career and gone on to write books and become a news journalist for CBS has dropped off the Saint Bernard Beethoven on his brother and his wife Julia Sweeney before they go on an RV trip. Aww what a cruel thing to do. But in reality it's just as easy way of getting a sequel put together. Grodin won't come back? Get him a brother and avoid his appearance in the film! For example at the end of the film Reinhold is supposed to meet up with his brother where they are politely informed by some old man that the original Newtons are still in Europe. Most likely for another year. Another YEAR?!?! Boy how did they jump from a week to a year in Europe? Perhaps the film execs coaxed them into it...The thing with Beethoven's 3rd is that it doesn't even try to come off witty or even funny at that. Countless gags just do not work. Take a typical example the bad guys in the film are a hyperactive caffeine addict and a Star Warsquoting freak both of whom are supposed to be funny but are not. In one scene they are trying to get into the Newtons' RV to steal a DVD long story. They run around like children with little black capes on. Before they do so they equip themselves with nightvisiongoggles and a type of spray that blinds people. We hear Baddie 1 say Now whatever you do do NOT look at light with your goggles on and do NOT release your spray! We know exactly what's going to happen next and sure enoughno surprises herethey look at light and release their gas cannisters. I mean how bleeping obvious can you bleeping get? The filming style seems like a tenyearold directed it. A mentallychallenged tenyearold. In one bit Reinhold is supposed to be struggling in an RV with Beethoven and to make it look like the RV is shaking the director wiggles around a handheld camera left and right left and right. That trick is one of the oldest in the book. In the Cheap Effects book. What was their budgettwo dollars?And then with all of that the humor is literally nonexistent. Instead of being at least AMUSING and SLIGHTLY FUNNY like the original Beethoven film which I like mainly because it is a sweet goodnatured family film this flick singlehandedly rips off every genre and every joke. Ever. At times it's a bad mix between National Lampoon's Vacation and Turner and Hootch at other times a ripoff of Star Wars and Meet Joe Black. See what I mean by bad combinations?And furthermore this sequel is completely cashing in on the first two flicks. I can put up with certain things in films but I feel the most cheated when I know that a sequel was slipshoddly put together to bring in some money and nothing more. That is when I really hate a film. But Beethoven's 3rd is still one of the worst films I've seen in a long long time regardless of being a cheap sequel.The gags aren't there the wit isn't there the attaching and likable characters aren't there the dialogue isn't there. Heck the entire movie isn't there. Followed by an equallyhorrible 4th and 5th? sequels I'd say this franchise is dead weight. What was once amusing and interesting because of attaching characters and a lighthearted script is now another chip off the ol' sequelcashin block. Avoid at all costs.15 stars John Ulmer".

What was once amusing and interesting because of attaching characters and a lighthearted script is now another chip off the ol' sequelcashin block. Avoid at all costs.15 stars John Ulmer";

But this turned into your typical family film that wasn't really original or believable. The villains seemed to be homosexual morons who seemed out of place of wanting a disc of valuable information and the whole family was predictable stereotypes.Beethoven for no reason explained has been shipped to George Newton's brother Richard who is taking his family to a reunion where he'll meet Geroge and Alice and give them Beethoven. I guess Richard rents a movie that these criminals thought would never be rented in the case there is a DVD of secret information that the criminals must have back. They chase the family around with Beethoven who will make sure that these guys will not hurt the family although with these certain villains I'm pretty sure that's not a strong possibility.It was really bad acting and not even a good enough movie for a family afternoon. I'm not sure why my cousins liked the movies because I raised them better than that with movie knowledge but oh well I guess these movies must have something special in them.

	schema:reviewBody "One of the great undiscovered gems of recent movie history.  In my opinion Miller's crossing is easily the best of the Coen brothers' films and one of the true classics of American cinema.On the surface the story of warring gangsters in 1920's America is one that has been told many times before.  But never before has it been handled with such artistry and precision.  The rather violent action scenes keep the movie going along at a brisk pace and the camera work is every bit the equal of Fargo.I became a lifelong Gabriel Byrne fan as a result of this movie despite his best efforts to disappoint me since.  Byrne's Tom Reagan is a compellingly amoral character who takes more unchallenged beatings than perhaps anyone in film history.  Men beat him up.  Women beat him up.  Collection men bookies gangsters and even his boss gives him a terrible thrashing and he hardly lifts a finger in opposition with one notably humorous exception.Albert Finney is tremendous as Leo the local crime boss.  His Danny Boy scene should go down in film history as one of the greatest pieces ever filmed.  Jon Polito is at once absurdly funny and threateningly psychotic as Johnny Caspar Leo's rival in the turf war.  J.E. Freeman John Turturro and Marcia Gay Harden all lend strong support in a cast that was assembled and performs to near perfection.I will never understand why this film has not received more recognition and acclaim.  As an example of the modern style of Film Noir it has no equals The Usual Suspects would rate a close second.  Among gangster films only The Godfather can compete and Miller's Crossing features superior pacing and dialog although it lacks The Godfather's epic proportions. Perhaps someday this film will receive like The Manchurian Candidate and Touch of Evil the belated accolades it so richly deserves.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm talkin' about friendship. I'm talkin' about character. I'm talkin' abouthell Leo I ain't embarrassed to use the wordethics. So Jon Polito as crimeboss Johnny Caspar describes to his overlord Albert Finney as Leo his point of view while seeking permission to kill a doublecrossing underling played by John Turturro in the opening lines of Miller's Crossing. Had the script sought only to explore the power relationship between the two chief mobsters one the rising Italian the other the diminishing Irishman this would have been a very good gangster film. It portrays an earlier era in the nation's history of organized crime perhaps Chicago in the late '20s and one can imagine Leo as the Irish predecessor of The Godfather's Don Vito Corleone Marlon Brando.Just as The Godfather was really about family relationships and the ethical complexities arising when familial loyalty collides with the business of violence however Miller's Crossing is actually about as Caspar tells us friendship and character put under the enormous strain of that same business of violence. The film therefore centers on Leo's trusted adviser Tom played flawlessly by the Irish actor Gabriel Byrne. Tom is not a gunsel but the brain behind Leo's muscle. His decisions carry life and death consequences however and we watch him try to live with himself to preserve his character as he works out a code that will help him and his friends survive brutally violent upheavals. Critics of the film have cited its graphic cruelty and the seeming coldness of its characters yet these are essential features in developing the film's theme.Sentimentality might get any of the major characters killed and one notes the pathos and dark humor that underline an ironic distance that each character especially Tom cultivates as a tool for survival.Clues abound as we wonder what Tom will do next. Follow for example the men's hats over the course of the film. Who keeps his lid on so to speak and who loses his? Note the number of times characters exclaim Jesus! or Damn! when saying the name Tom. What has he sacrificed? Has he damned himself?Spectacular action sequences beautiful production values topnotch camera work by Barry Sonnenfeld a haunting musical score and the best dialogue ever written by the Coen brothers make this a great gangster film. The fascinating and complex theme of friendship character and ethics make it one of the great films from any genre.".

It's witty in its dialogue suspenseful in its action and violence beautiful in its cinematography and being so like the Coen brothers it can make you laugh and cringe in the same scene.The script is superb. The characters are absorbing and the dialogue as some reviewers have already observed flows like words in a book. You have to watch some scenes more than once to totally get what's going on and even then you still might miss something.The acting is topnotch even down to the lowest thug. Gabriel Byrne plays the antihero Tom to lonely perfection and Marcia Gay Harden's hooker without a golden heart is excellent. The rest of the cast is great as well including good mobster Albert Finney and a funny cameo by Steven Buscemi. However the show is stolen threefold by Jon Polito as the erratic Italian underboss Johnny Caspar John Tuturro as the slimy schmatta Bernie Bernbaum and J.E. Freeman as Caspar's dark vicious adviserthug Eddie Dane. Jon Polito's monologue in the very beginning on ethics and Tuturro's desperate pleas at Miller's Crossing are both powerful scenes and Freeman commands the screen whenever he is on.My rating is a 1010. The best part about this movie is that it gets better and better every time you watch it. Oh yeah...the Danny Boy scene is reason enough to watch this movie anyway.".

	schema:reviewBody "In my opinion Miller's crossing is by far the top work of the Coen brothers and one of the best movies in the history of cinema. The huge Coens' talent being now fully recognized I hope that this masterpiece will get the credit it deserves.The plot deals with the war between Irish and Italian gangsters caused by the Jewish crook Bernie the Coens like to joke with the rivalry of different ethnic groups. The crook's affectionate sister Verna is the mistress of Leo O' Bannion the boss of the Irish gang who consequently opposes to have him killed by the Italians. But Tom Reagan the old mate and factotum of O' Bannion has different plans... The story is extremely interesting exciting entertaining. There are no flaws in the development of the plot despite its complications a homage to the intricate classic filmnoirs of the Golden Age. The script is sharp cynical sarcastic full of memorable lines and of black sense of humor with many delightful subtleties the celebrated Coens' wit at its best. The photography is magnificent and very original. The music is great. The action scenes are superbly filmed violence explodes suddenly and unexpectedly. The finale is perfect and splendidly crowns the movie.Tom Reagan played by Gabriel Byrne is one of the most memorable characters I have seen on the screen. A gangster who tries to use intelligence instead of violence with alternate success following a peculiar moral code. Cynical but devoted to friendship. A systematic liar but capable of generosity. Despite his skills he is not ambitious he prefer to be subject to a bigshot. And then with all his smartness he strangely chooses to destroy himself with alcohol and gambling. A magnificent psychological design. With this sober brilliant subtle performance worth of a Bogart in great shape Byrne just shows that he is the best actor in the world my opinion of course.The aged Irish boss O' Bannion  Albert Finney is the opposite of Reagan naive sometimes dumb with a strong love and childish attachment for his girlfriend he is confident only in his own charisma and in brutal force. Speaking of brutal force he will show in a gunfight that he's still the number one in spite of years passing incidentally this is one of the best action scenes I've ever seen. Also the other characters are shaped with outstanding intelligence and care from the main ones Bernie his sister the Italian boss his righthand Dane to the last of the thugs. The whole cast is fantastic Finney Turturro Marcia Gay Hayden Polito Freeman and all the other excellent supporting actors. A special mention for the scaring gangster Eddie Dane  J.E. Freeman he really makes you shriver. Turturro is a bit histrionic for my taste but this is his style of acting suited for the role of the crook mean and coward but cunning and dangerous as a snake.To summarize in Miller's Crossing fun drama action suspense mystery are masterly blended with deeper themes such as love friendship and human loneliness. This movie is splendid magnificent unique don't miss it.".

I was happy to see so many recent entries on this page because that means something I predicted long ago is coming true film buffs are finally discovering Miller's Crossing an underground masterpiece that has dwelt in obscurity for ten years.The central motif of the hat and Johnny Caspar's preoccupation with the altitude thereof brings to mind another underrated masterpiece Drugstore Cowboy. The complex Jungian symbolism of forests doors and especially hats is my favorite aspect of the film.The only criticism I've heard of this film and I think it's B.S. has to do with the overactinga criticism that has been directed at more than one Coen film. Admittedly Coen screenplays read more like novels than movie scripts and are not always actorfriendly. Gabriel Byrne who appears in all but two scenes does a great job playing an extremely complicated character. Tom Reagan is a smart guy surrounded by morons and exists in a scenario where only muscle counts and brains don't. And he hates it. And he hates himself because he knows he's all brains and no heart. He tries to redeem himself through a selfless devotion to Leo whom he hates. All this makes for an immensely challenging part and the film could easily have fallen apart with a lesser actor than Gabriel Byrne playing the lead.But the acting is great from top to bottom Marcia Gay Harden in her big screen debut as the hardboiled moll Jon Polito as the maniacal Johnny Caspar Steve Buscemi as the hopaddicted Mink J.E. Freeman who is such a marvellous screen villain you have to wonder why he's still toiling in obscurity and Albert Finney an actor who embodies the term screen presence. But the Grand Prix goes to John Turturro who carries the most powerful scene in the movie when Tom takes Bernie out to Miller's Crossing to whack him.Another criticism frequently levelled against the Coens is that they are preoccupied with scenes and don't focus enough on plot coherence. This too is an invalid criticism as far as I'm concerned. Some people are irritated by a film that you have to watch a couple times to fully understand but that's precisely the kind of film that I love and that's why I love Miller's Crossing so much. Every time I see it I pick up on something that I didn't catch before.Speaking of scenes the Danny Boy scene is the best. The second best is the following scene where Tom and Terry walk through a hallway lined with goons. The third is the police raid on the Sons of Erin Club in which Leo takes on the entire police force.I'll resist the temptation to call Miller's Crossing The Greatest Film of All Timebecause who has the right to say that?

Finally Tom is one of the most complex characters I've seen in film. Why? Because he's real. It reminds me a bit of the American Splendor comics and film where Pekar don't have to give a happy ending a sad ending clear symbolism a strong message. Just a story even if it does not fit into what we expect from books films magazines etc. Tom is one of my favorite characters and I still don't understand him and neither do you. This along with everything people have commented on dialog editing characters etc. make the film in my opinion one of THE greatest films period. What makes Godfather better? Brando's tired speeches? This is a flick you can watch over and over and I stand by those who respect the genius of this film. So take ya flunkie and dangle and again this paragraph is for those who give the high hat to Tom the most conflicted and realistic personage in any film I've seen. Will you watch Tom with amazement or try to analyze his motivation based on film stereotypes? Let's get stinko.".

	schema:reviewBody "This has got to be hands down one of the best gangster films ever made certainly in the last 20 years or so. Better even than Reservoir Dogs I'd say...which is a great film too but just not nearly the same caliber as this.In a nutshell the whole movie is about loyalty and the affect it has on Tom Reagan as well as everyone else around him. Tom is the central character in this story and we basically get to experience this movie in his shoes or wearing his hat which would be a more appropriate analogy and you'll understand why I say this after watching the film. In fact I can probably count on one hand the number of scenes that Tom Reagan played masterfully by Gabriel Byrne does NOT appear in.I won't go into great detail because the story is full of subtleties...things that you won't notice even after seeing the movie several times. I think that's why I put it so high in my mind as a work of cinematic art. There has ALWAYS been something new that I discovered upon each viewing that I didn't see before so the complexities of the story make it vastly more entertaining that say Titanic or some other Hollywood schlock that's being peddled in theaters. Which is probably why this film did poorly when it was first released I didn't even see it until it came out on cable a year later.The script is truly marvelous and the snappy dialog hearkens back to the good old days of gangster films from the 30s with great actors such as James Cagney Edward G. Robinson and Bogart. In fact go get the Warner Bros. Gangster Classics Box set before you see this film...it'll give you a better appreciation of this film in many different ways the wisecracks the overthetop gun battles etc.. The only way the Coen Brothers could pay greater homage to the old gangster classics would have been to have filmed Miller's Crossing in black and white...which they didn't need to do anyway this film just can't be beat in it's set design and imagery.Oddly enough there is almost no gratuitous sex in this mildly Rrated film...it's all implied which is a nice touch given the way most Rrated films just give in to rampant sex and violence just for the sake of being able to do it. Even the violence which some posts have alluded to as excessive just doesn't even compare with what most folks see on screen today...but that just it the Coen Brothers use sex and violence in a subtle way that enhances not detracts from the film. We know more about what people feel about each other rather than just get to see to sweaty bodies going at it in bed. Don't get me wrong I think sex and violence in adult films is not a bad thing...I just hate it when filmmakers just throw it in as a way of pleasing the crowd especially when they don't show the consequences of what sex and violence can bring about in our society.Anyway I could go on and on...go BUY not rent this film it'll be the best clearancerack DVD you'll ever own!".

	schema:reviewBody "Miller's Crossing is a film containing characters of the gangster genre occupying a noirstyle world. Visually the film holds up with other Coen Brother films in terms of its style which includes elaborate set designs costumes landscapes etc. Visually the film is magnificent and eyecatching.Where the film falters lies in its dialogue. A staple of Coen Brothers' scripts particularly their earlier films involves characters who possess an uncharacteristically sharp tongue and wide vocabulary. Miller's Crossing is no different. Don't get me wrong the dialogue is wellwritten but at times too wellwritten. Characters speak so fluently in wisecracking threats that their eloquence undermines their threats. The audience rather than invest care in the characters instead marvels at their wit and articulacy. But again this isn't to say that the dialogue is bad. In fact most will probably find the characters and dialogue appealing. The plot does not become apparent until after the credits roll. For the beginning of the film characters speak swiftly back and forth referencing offscreen characters nobody in the audience has yet seen. This may lead to some confusion regarding what in tarnation is happening which subsequently may lead to a lack of emotion or care invested into the story by the viewers. Ultimately Miller's Crossing is one of those films you're going to have consider in retrospect in order to piece it together. Albert Finney and Jon Polito offer tremendous performances as respective racketeer bosses. Gabriel Byre successfully plays Tom Reagan a man caught in the middle of the warring mobsters. The wonderfully gifted John Turturro plays the twotiming Bernie Bernbaum. For this role the Coens couldn't have scripted anyone better than Turturro who in one instance can seem sputtering and weak 'til the next scene in which he confidently points a gun in someone's face. Overall Miller's Crossing is a good film that possesses many reasons to watch it though ultimately you may find yourself having to watch it again.".

The film basically tells the events that unfold around a Gangland war between the Irish and Italian mobs of the late 20s. Gabriel Byrne plays Tom Leo's Albert Finney right hand man and adviser who disagrees with his boss's decision to protect the conman brother John Turturro of his girlfriend Verna Marcia Gay Harden and must work his own wily methods to protect Leo from this decision.This is a masterpiece of modern film and definitely shows that the Cohen brothers can do anything with film. The dialog and accents are all perfectly executed in vintage 20s style and flare the sets are absolutely beautiful and the costume work is so good you almost feel like you stepped back in time. Anyone who doesn't love this film should go back and try watching it again. The musical score alone is enough to make it worth while.".

Essentially the plot has Gabriel Byrne as a good  bad guy caught between two rival gangster factions.

A picture in fact that gets better and better with further viewings.When the Coen's are on form they have the skills to make a grade A thriller and blend it with a sort of dry irony. It's like they bite the hand that feeds whilst praising said genre influences to the rafters but it works as damn fine entertainment. On a narrative level Miller's Crossing molds the Byzantine with the labyrinthine keeping the complexities just on the right side of the street from that of art for arts sake.Visually the film is superb the hard working sweat of the city dovetails impudently with the mother nature beauty of Miller's Crossing the place a place home to misery a witness to the dark side of man.

	schema:headline " Dark Brooding  Full of Intrigue";
	schema:reviewBody "Dark brooding and full of intrigue Miller's Crossing was the third movie to be written produced and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen and in the opinion of many was also their best. It's certainly good to watch because of its rather involved story its eccentric characters and the droll humour that's such a trademark of the Coens' work. Typically for a gangster movie noone can be trusted and there are plenty of betrayals double crosses and deceptions. More surprisingly however there are also some occasions where certain individuals uncharacteristically show genuine loyalty and aspire to act ethically.In the late 1920s Irish mobster Leo O'Bannon Albert Finney who has both the Police Chief and the Mayor on his payroll is also the de facto political leader of an unnamed Eastern city in the United States. In his day to day work he values the sound advice that he's regularly given by his friend and fellow gangster Tom Reagan Gabriel Byrne but when he's visited by his rival an Italian mobster called Johnny Casper Jon Polito a situation arises in which he feels unable to follow Tom's advice.Leo learns that a bookie called Bernie Bernbaum John Turturro has routinely been disclosing information about Casper's fixed fights to other gamblers and in order to stop the losses that he's been suffering Casper is intent on eliminating Bernie without delay. When Leo says that Bernie pays for protection and isn't to be touched Casper becomes both furious and frustrated. The real reason that Leo doesn't agree to the hit is because Bernie's sister Verna Marcia Gay Harden is his mistress. Tom tries to get Leo to change his mind by telling him that Verna is a grifter who's just using him but Leo isn't prepared to listen.Everything changes after a failed hit on Leo triggers a gang war. Tom discloses that he's having an affair with Verna and then also switches sides to work with Casper. In order to prove his loyalty to his new boss Tom is ordered to kill Bernie and although he makes it look as if he's done so he actually lets the treacherous bookie go. This proves to be a bad move because the fact that the hit was not witnessed puts Tom in a tight spot when he gets targeted by Casper's sadistic henchman Eddie Dane J.E. Freeman and blackmailed by Bernie. Furthermore in order to end the gang war and settle a few scores in the process Tom not only manipulates the events that follow so expertly that he achieves his various aims but also does so in a way that unequivocally proves his loyalty to Leo.Jon Polito is terrific as the hotheaded Casper who despairs at the lack of ethics that he encounters in his business dealings and says if you can't trust a fix what can you trust?. Marcia Gay Harden does well as the heartless twotiming Verna and John Turturro is brilliant as the repulsive Bernie. Albert Finney as the tough gangster who shows more humanity than most and Gabriel Byrne as the story's great schemer are also both perfect in their lead roles.Miller's Crossing is very stylish wellwritten and features some magnificent cinematography which as well as being aesthetically pleasing contributes so much to the atmosphere of the piece. What makes it most absorbing however is the quality of its story and the idiosyncrasies of its characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "They wear heavy trenchcoats and fedoras but remove them before a fight. They drag on cigarettes endlessly. It is prohibition era but that does not stop them and each clink of ice on gin glass is a sign of their luxurious freedom and power. They use words like dame which swiftly becomes whore when necessary. They have genderspecific designations for guns. This is a pure distillation of Hammet and Chandler. Verna twice closes the door in the face of her secret lover and when the thuggish Dane breaks it open she doesn't shriek like the fat lady in the restaurant but brandishes her weapon with scorn and venom spilling out of her mouth as if to loudly signify her as the designated femme fatale and Tom is just as spiteful in return. Does it matter? She is the only female character of any significance anyway. Like many Coen films the dialogue is heavily stylised and easily quotable. And overly so because we fixate on the snappy dialogue that comes in troves instead of the actual characters and how cleverly and quickly they respond. Think Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. but replicated a dozen more times. Tom buffeted by a neverending series of difficulties and double crosses and betrayals has a ready made oneliner for any confrontation. It does not feel like he is under an intense moral and ethical dilemma. Verna and he dance around each other dangerously attack viciously and never show an ounce of vulnerability towards one another. And then he grips her roughly and they fall into each other's arms but the Coens seem to do this more than twice without a hint of irony. There is less and less conflict each time. Coincidently the one time he is silent is the one time he is under the most threat and he vomits instead of firing out another quip. These gangsters run the town their own way. The best scene of the movie Casper's widesmiling pompous presentation immediately paints a picture of each side's entitlement towards what they feel they deserve. They are rivals but both possess the same twisted sense of ethics that makes them so good at controlling those beneath them. Polito sells it earnestly see how righteous and adamant he is in claiming that if he rigs a fight he should expect a profit from it and how he complains about the state of affairs that sees dishonest crooks corrupt this innocent little system and hierarchy. And observe the Coens weave in other little signs of this. See how pleasantly the gangsters greet the men in blue and the delightful way in which the chief when questioned of his loyalty stammers a docile and polite reaffirmation as if he was the one being questioned by a police officer II was just speculating a hypothesis sir. Watch how politicians cower and are bullied into obedience because of how they have been kept in office I voted for him six times. And when Tom strides into the women's bathroom it is as if he owns the place and is walking right into enemy territory.Technically the film is gorgeous and perhaps this is where it betrays its intentions. Sonnenfeld's imagery and compositions are elegant and haunting the opening credits peering through the treetops the man with a gun and the cowering weeping figure begging for his life from a distance later a crowd gathering around the supposed corpse like a coronation the twice reveals of Bernie obscured by shadow and murky intentions. Burwell's piercing flute twists itself around the film and gives it a similar atmosphere. And the production design is intoxicating the musty dim oaklined rooms with great big desks for formal affairs a dinghy and greentinged warehouse for dirtier deeds and chairs and beds of increasingly ornate design. These point to a darker brooding more morally complex film that does not match Miller's Crossing. When Tom refuses to sell out Leo he must fight his way out but the Coens go for the humorous route and the thug scurries away like a child running to his father after being teased. It is very funny and very much tonally inconsistent. And when Leo is the target of an assassination attempt mystery and tension is mustered and builtup via little hints given in closeups but again it descends into a farce. Leo dispatches the killers and then in the most ludicrous and overdone segment empties about a dozen clips of his tommy gun into one of the bodies and it flails around beyond bodily functions as if having an epileptic fit and in turn empties his own gun all around the room. And the plot too is beyond comprehension especially if you are watching for the first time. Tom is a muddled character even for noir standards and he chases something that is never fully described or realised within the narrative. So potentially Tom is a man of his own ethics. He remains loyal even as Leo and him are through. He attempts to make sense of the world and survive but sometimes jealousy and desire leads him to waver see how Verna takes off his hat just before they sleep together. But this characterisation comes thick and fast and without any real sense of development. Turturro's sniffling and weaselling performance is fantastic but his character seesaws wildly from one demeanour to another and does not really justify the shot to his head that was just so earlier causing so much emotional distress. He is physically intimate but not mentally so and his motivations are so highly guarded they never really appear but in a better film the subtext would ring hard and true. Caspar is the most honest of them all. He knows what he wants and as convincing as his speeches are thinly veil the ends he will go to get them. And he babies his chubby little son and slaps him and then immediately comforts him.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoiler alert This synopsis may contain information that could be considered spoilers to some readers.Miller's Crossing is one of my favorite Coen brothers movies. It helped a lot of course that all of the actors were well cast. Jon Polito as Caspar was his usual superb self somehow managing to simultaneously keep his character both likable and despicable. Gabriel Byrne as Tom was a great punching bag who somehow emerged from every beating just as handsome as he was before it started. J.E. Freeman was excellent as Caspar's psychopathic gay hitman. John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum the apparently gay brother of Verna added an ongoing menace to the film. Marcia Gay Harden was wonderful as Verna and looked perfect in the role.Since I don't think I can improve on previous positive reviews I would prefer to address the gay innuendo that is present throughout the movie but is frequently overlooked. It is certainly not the central focus of the story which is probably why so few viewers pick up on it and even as a gay viewer I have to include myself among them. Once all the clues are pointed out you wonder how you could possibly not have seen them.First of all we can be sure that at least three of the characters are gay Psycho hitman Eddie Dane and his lover Mink. Also there is Bernie Bernbaum who is having a secret and potentially dangerous affair with Mink largely for the purpose of gaining information. Below are some of the clues not necessarily in orderClue one The movie opens with Caspar and Eddie Dane in Leo's office. Caspar is trying to get Leo to allow him to put a hit on some guy named Bernie whom he suspects of hurting his fixed bets by selling information. Bernie however is the brother of Leo's girlfriend Verna so Leo is very reluctant. Leo suggests that maybe Eddie's friend Mink is responsible for the betrayal. Eddie quickly comes to Mink's defense and Caspar backs him up by saying that Mink is Eddie's boy. In another moment during that scene Eddie and Tom exchange knowing glances that suggest more than mutual disdain or admiration. My take on that moment is that Eddie is sadistically attracted to Tom and that is exactly how Tom sees it. I don't think the attraction is mutual.Clue Two In the scene where Tom is at the club talking to Mink. The conversation more than suggests that Eddie and Mink are lovers and that Mink is having an affair with Bernie behind Eddie's back. Tom tells Mink that it wouldn't be good if Eddie were to find out that Mink has another amigo because he doesn't take Eddie for the understanding type. Mink quickly becomes very concerned that Tom might squeal on him.Clue Three Tom is talking to Caspar trying to convince him that Eddie is a betrayer. During that scene Caspar again says that Mink is Eddie's boy. He even adds that he himself doesn't go that way. Tom referring to Eddie and Mink says something to the effect There's always that wild card a slight pause he raises his eyebrows where love is involved.Clue Four After Tom pushes his way into the ladies' powder room to talk to Verna she tells him how her brother is misunderstood just because he's different. Clue Five There is also the scene in Tom's apartment where Bernie says that his own sister tried to seduce him and the suggestion is that she was trying to make him heterosexual. I know that some people see homoeroticism between Leo and Tom but I don't see anything erotic about their relationship. I think they love each other and are deeply devoted to each other but that's as far as it goes.As a bit of trivia in real life Joe Polito who plays Caspar and J.E. Freeman who plays Eddie Dane really are openly gay.".

There was no chemistry between the girl and Reagan... the whole relationship made no sense. Oh and the girl was singularly unattractive. What a waste of great actors too. I'd have expected Turturro and Steve Buscani who only had a brief appearance to be way more picky in the character's they played then the pathetic Bernie and Mink. Albert Finney was pretty descent as Leo Irish Mob boss and was the one saving grace. In essence to me the story and characters weren't really believable.".

That they sample legendary directors and iconic films does not by association make them part of that league of talent. And yet...And yet the Coens are honest about their dishonesty. Their films are cartoons exercises in buffoonery only a trickster would title a film A Serious Man which tend to wallow in comical nihilism. It's all a game because cinema has become a game. It's all pastiche because Western cinema has become pastiche. It's nihilistic because most of American cinema has lost all meaning. So why not wallow in the filth and do it with style? The Coens thus leave us only two choices revel in their cinematic wit or reproach them for not trying.7.910  Miller's Crossing has two great sequences but it's also one of the Coens' most smug pictures its overly glossy look shades of Road to Perdition and heavily stylized dialogue diluting any longlasting imapct.

The problem with trying to make a good movie based on a silly and pointless story is that you are starting below zero and everything else has to be excellent to even bring the movie up to good.That didn't happen here.As a first matter the acting was terrible. The worst acting in the movie came when the guy from Fargo is at the bottom of the stairs talking to the lead character. I almost fell off my chair laughing it was so bad. He literally looked like what you'd expect at the High School talent show  forced as if he was reading off of a teleprompter.As a further example of bad acting the Italian actor who played the Jewish character was terrible throughout. The scene where he is on his knees and pleading for his life was laugh out loud funny  it was that unbelievable. Then later when the same character tries to act tough it's about as believable as Screech trying to act tough on saved by the bell.The acting of the Italian mobster is another low point  he overdoes it to the point of making Dinero look reserved.Beyond the acting the story stunk.For example in one scene the Italian mobster kills his presumably long time bodyguard and number 1 because the lead character has come over to the mobster's side and spun a tale about how the bodyguard is double crossing the mobster. Please. I find Clifford the Big Red Dog more believable than that. But the mobster is apparently so incredibly silly that he is willing to murder his right hand man because a guy who 48 hours earlier represented the enemy Irish mobster is now telling him his bodyguard is a traitor!!Sure.That'd be like Vladimir Putin's right hand man coming to the U.S. and convincing the president in a matter of hours that his VP was a spy.Those are just some examples  the whole movie is one long string of the ridiculous and improbable all strung together into a big mess.Another example is when the lead character is being forced to kill the Jewish character in the woods. It was obvious from the start that he wasn't going to do it. So he marches him out there and the two guys who work for his new Italian boss don't even bother to keep an eye on him. They let him waltz off into the woods they hear two gunshots spaced a minute or more apart and they think nothing of it.That is so stupid so as to be beneath dime store pulp fiction never mind a movie on the big screen.Then there's the painfully derivative machine gun scene where each machine gun has about 7000 rounds of ammo in it and when a guy gets hit he doesn't just fall limp like what happens in real life he stands there with his arms in a zombie reach and wiggles like a Shaker on Sunday for about 3 minutes and 3000 of the 7000 rounds are send through his vibrating torso. Ridiculous silly and boring.Another example. Hit men walk in front door of mansion walk up to room for about 4 minutes then walk in and Irish mobster is under bed.What would any nonretarded person do? Well clearly then would fire 2 or 3 thousand rounds into the bed. Not!You'd hit the floor and spray under the bed or you'd get up on the bed and fire down or you'd get back in the hallway and you'd take an angle . . .But not in the brother's movies. In the brother's movies everybody acts like a complete moron all of the time.If a movie is made based on an improbable premise then the movie can be enjoyable. Fargo is one example of this. The events of that movie are improbable but not impossible. On the other hand if a movie is made based on an impossible premise then the movie has to either aspire to be Buckaroo Banzai  where it is understood that everything is unrealistic  or it is a flop as in the present case.I find it funny that some people say that they watch this movie over and over and it gets better.I can tell you that were I to be strapped to a chair with my eyelids held open as in Clockwork Orange great movie I would not only NOT think this movie was better I would think it even worse because all of the bad acting impossible behavior and silly story lines would be even more obvious.Ayy.Absolutely terrible movie.".

The film's elaborate plot the doublecrossing and doubledoublecrossing also impressed me at the time. I then saw Miller's Crossing and remember also being impressed. Next came Raising Arizona which did rather less for me and I don't very much like Nicolas Cage. After that in no particular order were The Hudsucker Proxy Barton Fink and Fargo. I admired Fargo  the Coen's are nothing if not stylish  but I didn't like the way the William Macy character a schmuck in trouble who gets in way out of his depth was the butt of the jokes. It was like getting easy laughs from teasing the fat kid in class and as for a while I thought of myself as 'the fat kid'  I wasn't half as fat as I thought but I wasn't very slim either  I didn't like it. I saw a couple more Coen brothers movies after that for example The Big Lebowski and more recently No Country For Old Men but I found I had unwittingly joined the small club of those who aren't quite as impressed with Ethan and Joel Coen as so obviously Ethan and Joel are. Why not? I think it might be because as one critic I read said of Fargo they are heartless. There is cleverness galore in their films but each film lacks something essential to a great film. For my money the Coens are good at making goodlooking films but those films are never as good as they might be. They seem more an exercise in Ethan and Joel demonstrating what smart kids they are than anything else. A year or two ago I saw Blood Money again and it wasn't quite as good as I had remembered it. Miller's Crossing is rather the same yes you keep watching because  well these lads make technically good films. But once the credits roll you find you don't give a hoot. Miller's Crossing has another Coenmanufactured intricate plot but it is all rather pointless. It is rather like watching a busy junction from an aesthetic vantage point interesting enough for a while if you've got nothing better to do but it eventually dawns on you you might well have quite a number of better things to do. Sorry but I just don't think Miller's Crossing is all that good.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one my favourite gangster pictures of all time and to say the least I am a big fan of the genre. The use of the camera by the Coen bros.the cinematography and the detail of the miseenscene are first rate. Yeah yeah. Thats my sad attempt to show that I learned something in film school. Seriously though the sets are excellent. As in The Hudsucker Proxy the Coens really make you feel like your in a completely different time and place.Gabe Byrne is well cast as the softly spoken loner who by the end of the picture has danced rings around everybody yet doesn't seem much better off. Tom ReaganByrne is a very original character because one can really relate to him. He hasn't got the stomach to murder doesn't carry a gun despite all of the violence which surrounds and indeed threatens him every day and is prepared to take a beating as opposed to venting hell hath no fury style vengeance which would result in a much higher penalty. Essentially he's an everyman who is playing the cards life has dealt him and is more than aware its a shitty hand but knows the best way to win is not to go for broke.Albert Finney is excellent as Leo the boss of the Irish mob who run a very fictional Chicagoesq setting and who is a lifetime friend of Reagan who is essentially Leo's unofficial consular. John Turturro goes from a 'toughguy' in 'Do The Right Thing' to an at times pathetic yet equally psychotic 'rat' in this picture rather superbly. J.E. Freeman represents a rather commanding and intimidating physical presence as the fearsome Eadie Dane who has to be one of the most memorably sadistic henchmen ever committed to the screen. However for me Jon Polito a favourite of the Coens just about runs away with the picture as the wisecracking mob underboss Johnny Caspar a tough talking and ambitious Italian who has become fed up of taking the scraps from Leo's table and launches his own bid for the crown as the town's head honcho.The film offers one of the most violent and memorable scenes in movie history when to the sweet theme of 'Danny Boy' two of Caspar's henchmen attempt to assassinate his now rival boss Leo at his home. The sheer ferocity of Tommy Guns has never been so well portrayed or indeed has this very cinematic weapon ever been so aesthetically pleasing.The theme of the film is like many before borrowed from 'Yojimbo' with a middle man Tom Reagan playing off two rival gangs. The difference is that Tom actually does have loyalty to one.Another difference is that there is a lot of well executed humour here. Thats not to say there wasn't some in the Kirisawa classic but it's a little more obvious here. There is a more direct comparison to this film which some may have noticed but believe me 'Last Man Standing' released several years later does not hold a candle to this picture. That film took itself a hell of a lot more seriously and faded from the memory rather quicker quite possibly because you had seen it all done before but better.A typically Coenesque surreal edge is also given by the at times unorthodox camera use and blandness of the sets. As in 'Hudsucker' and 'Barton Fink' the minimalist and somewhat austere fashion of the pre60s years is overemphasized to great effect. The film is after all meant to be a fantasy. Yes a very adult and violent one with obvious nods to the realities of Capone's Chicago and the 30s and 40s Cagney gangster films but still a fantasy non the less.Overall this is a very original take on the gangster theme and a visual gem.

	onyx:emotionText "This is one my favourite gangster pictures of all time and to say the least I am a big fan of the genre. The use of the camera by the Coen bros.the cinematography and the detail of the miseenscene are first rate. Yeah yeah. Thats my sad attempt to show that I learned something in film school. Seriously though the sets are excellent. As in The Hudsucker Proxy the Coens really make you feel like your in a completely different time and place.Gabe Byrne is well cast as the softly spoken loner who by the end of the picture has danced rings around everybody yet doesn't seem much better off. Tom ReaganByrne is a very original character because one can really relate to him. He hasn't got the stomach to murder doesn't carry a gun despite all of the violence which surrounds and indeed threatens him every day and is prepared to take a beating as opposed to venting hell hath no fury style vengeance which would result in a much higher penalty. Essentially he's an everyman who is playing the cards life has dealt him and is more than aware its a shitty hand but knows the best way to win is not to go for broke.Albert Finney is excellent as Leo the boss of the Irish mob who run a very fictional Chicagoesq setting and who is a lifetime friend of Reagan who is essentially Leo's unofficial consular. John Turturro goes from a 'toughguy' in 'Do The Right Thing' to an at times pathetic yet equally psychotic 'rat' in this picture rather superbly. J.E. Freeman represents a rather commanding and intimidating physical presence as the fearsome Eadie Dane who has to be one of the most memorably sadistic henchmen ever committed to the screen. However for me Jon Polito a favourite of the Coens just about runs away with the picture as the wisecracking mob underboss Johnny Caspar a tough talking and ambitious Italian who has become fed up of taking the scraps from Leo's table and launches his own bid for the crown as the town's head honcho.The film offers one of the most violent and memorable scenes in movie history when to the sweet theme of 'Danny Boy' two of Caspar's henchmen attempt to assassinate his now rival boss Leo at his home. The sheer ferocity of Tommy Guns has never been so well portrayed or indeed has this very cinematic weapon ever been so aesthetically pleasing.The theme of the film is like many before borrowed from 'Yojimbo' with a middle man Tom Reagan playing off two rival gangs. The difference is that Tom actually does have loyalty to one.Another difference is that there is a lot of well executed humour here. Thats not to say there wasn't some in the Kirisawa classic but it's a little more obvious here. There is a more direct comparison to this film which some may have noticed but believe me 'Last Man Standing' released several years later does not hold a candle to this picture. That film took itself a hell of a lot more seriously and faded from the memory rather quicker quite possibly because you had seen it all done before but better.A typically Coenesque surreal edge is also given by the at times unorthodox camera use and blandness of the sets. As in 'Hudsucker' and 'Barton Fink' the minimalist and somewhat austere fashion of the pre60s years is overemphasized to great effect. The film is after all meant to be a fantasy. Yes a very adult and violent one with obvious nods to the realities of Capone's Chicago and the 30s and 40s Cagney gangster films but still a fantasy non the less.Overall this is a very original take on the gangster theme and a visual gem. It also contains some important lessons for any aspiring gangsters. In the words of Johnny Casper Look at this kid. Something I tell all my boys.Always put one in the brain!";

In late 1984 there was a covert IsraeliAmerican operation to save Ethiopian Jews known as Falashas by airlifting them to Israel. The Falashas are a small branch of the Diaspora. But as they lined up for their exodus Salomon's mother tells him firmly to go live and become the title of the movie. She saw in the exodus an opportunity for her son to escape the death disease famine and civil war that were ravaging Ethiopia. Salomon's mother would stay behind.The trauma of being told by his mother to leave was already strong stuff. But there is more Salomon is not even a Falasha. So the arrival in modern Israel is a double shock for him. However Salomon becomes Schlomo and we see that he is a quick learner. He learns Hebrew and when he is adopted by a bilingual FrenchHebrew family he learns French too. However Schlomo has a persistent and profound desire to see his mother again. He is wounded. On top of that injury he has to deal with racism and bigotry in Israel while hiding the fact that he is not a Falasha. Schlomo carries a lot of emotional baggage but he has some good people rooting for him. Like the Yarom and Yael the couple who adopt Schlomo and Sara the girl who has him firmly in her sights. The story of Schlomo's trials and tribulations is moving on several levels.What makes this film audacious is that it confronts the question who is a Jew. The answer is not selfevident. Indeed the question has been the subject of impassioned debate in Israel for years. The Falashas are just one case study. It is simply remarkable that someone would make a film that touches on this issue. Bravo!".

	schema:reviewBody "The images we see of Ethiopians are often those of children with distended bellies clinging to life as a Western television announcer comments about their depressing fate. No one however speaks for the children. Winner of the Audience Award at the Berlin Film Festival Radu Mihaileanu's Live and Become gives words to people whose voices have been silent. The film tells the story of Ethiopian Black Jews known as Falashas who were brought to Israel in Operation Moses in 1984 by the Israeli Mossad. It was an operation that successfully airlifted 8000 Ethiopean Jews to Israel but sadly also one in which 4000 died during a brutal journey on foot to Sudan or later in refugee camps.Mihaileanu Train of Life was born in Bucharest Romania to Jewish parents who had spent time in the Nazi labor camps. In 1980 like the film's protagonist he was torn from his parents when he fled the dictatorship of Ciaucescu to move to Israel and later to France. In Live and Become a boy clinging to his mother in the Sudan is told by her to go live and become. She tells him that he must pretend to be a Jew and instructs him to remember that his name is Solomon his father's name was Isaac and his sister's name was Aster. The film spans fifteen years in the life of young Solomon called Schlomo by the Israelis describing his experiences of being alone into a foreign country that speaks a language he doesn't understand and filled with people of a different religion and a different color. Mihaileanu crams a great deal into the film's 142minute length and it often seems cluttered yet we can listen and understand its heart and the clear voice in which it speaks to us.As he reaches TelAviv Schlomo begins the long processes of absorption and integration into Israeli society but the barriers engendered by social and cultural differences prove difficult to bear. He angrily acts out his frustration in a boarding school in Tel Aviv and is sent for adoption to a leftwing French Sephardic family Yoram and Yal Harrari Roschdy Zem and Yal Abecassis who already have two children. They are a closeknit warm and loving family but face many problems with the boy they did not anticipate. Yael must fight the prejudice of parents in the school who want to withdraw their children from school because they think coming from Africa he must be a carrier of disease.At first refusing to eat he makes an effort to fit in but hears over and over that because he is black he is not really a Jew. A battle erupts within Israel between fundamentalists and Orthodox Jews over the premise of a black Jew and Schlomo is caught in the middle. Afraid of being discovered as a Christian the boy immerses himself in Jewish theology learns Hebrew and French and studies the Torah yet he carries the burden of his lie around with him. The story then jumps ahead a few years. As a goodlooking teenager Moshe Abebe Schlomo meets Sarah Roni Hadar a white girl he likes but must contend with the virulent racism of her father. Rebelling against the authority of his surrogate parents the boy is sent to a kibbutz to work and study but maintains a correspondence with Sarah.As Schlomo Sirak M. Sabahat as an adult grows into adulthood and takes responsibility for his guilt he feels compelled to confess his inner truth and the film capitalizes on every touch of his personal drama. Live and Become tackles one of the most controversial subjects in Israel that of Jewish identity and racial purity. While it does not hesitate to show the ugly side of Israeli life it also embraces its humor sensitivity and compassion. Although unfortunately the film occasionally slips into clich Live and Become works because it is about more than the experience of one person. It tells a universal story of alienation wanting to belong and the pain of feeling alone feelings shared by people of all religions throughout the world.".

The director and the lead actor were there afterwards and we applauded them heartily. This is what a film festival is about. The basic plot follows the life of a young Ethiopian boy Shlomo whose mother realizes that he can be saved if he poses as one of the Falashas the Ethiopian Jews. They were clandestinely airlifted to Israel from Sudan in the mid 1980s. This is a story of migrationassimilation and identity through the eyes of an individual. It shows how Israel deals with these 'different' Jews how he deals with not really being one of them how he is adopted by an idealistic leftwing family falls in love with a young Israeli girl whose father is a racist and his ongoing innerdialogue with his mother still somewhere in a Sudanese refugee camp. Very multilayered critical without being moralistic and preachy. Unlike Mr. Mihaileanu's other big movie The Train of Life this is not a comedy but it contains plenty of warmth and humor and also stars a Shlomo.".

It shows how Israel deals with these 'different' Jews how he deals with not really being one of them how he is adopted by an idealistic leftwing family falls in love with a young Israeli girl whose father is a racist and his ongoing innerdialogue with his mother still somewhere in a Sudanese refugee camp. Very multilayered critical without being moralistic and preachy. Unlike Mr. Mihaileanu's other big movie The Train of Life this is not a comedy but it contains plenty of warmth and humor and also stars a Shlomo.";

The most intriguing issue raised deals with separating state and religion. The viewer essentially comes to see situations in shades of grey.

	schema:headline " One of the most emotionally upsetting films ever made";
	schema:reviewBody "The writer and director of this utterly amazing and gutwrenching film is the Romanian Jewish emigr to Paris Radu Mihaileanu born 1958. Every shot every detail every performance and all the dialogue is completely and totally brilliant. That perfection plus Mihaileanu's impassioned fury is what gives this film its unique power. The film contains many unknown actors and actresses who have never appeared in anything before or since and they are often the most effective people in the film under the director's sure and sympathetic hand. The film deals with the strange story of the people known as the 'Falashas'. People in the West who are old enough to remember the news stories of 1980 may dimly recall the incidents as they were so bizarre as to seem almost incredible at the time. The Falashas certainly made front page news for weeks. The Falashas are the socalled 'black Jews' of Ethiopia. They had lived for perhaps 2000 years or more as a tiny minority in Ethiopia and they are of Ethiopian blood. But instead of being Christians like the majority of Ethiopians they are Jews. No one knows how or why they became Jews or what their original story really is. Then one day the Israeli Government decided to rescue them from the oppressive Mengistu Regime which existed in Ethiopia in 1980 Mengistu was a fanatical communist of the Stalinist persuasion and a psychopathic mass murderer. The Israelis wanted to airlift all of the Falashas and take them to Israel! But this had to be done in total secrecy. Also the Israelis could not land their aircraft in Ethiopia so the Falashas had to make their own way on foot to the Sudan from where they would be collected from a giant refugee camp which existed there. So 12000 Falashas set out for the Sudan in a vast and tattered migration 4000 of them dying on the way. Only 8000 reached their destination more than 1000 miles away dehydrated starving ill and exhausted and many of them dying. The story of the film commences in the camp when a Falasha woman holds her very young son dead in her arms and realizes that she has lost everything she herself is also dying. Meanwhile an Ethiopian Christian woman and her son of the same age are also in the same part of the camp but they are still healthy. The Christian woman pretends that her son is the dead boy so that he can be evacuated as a Jew and the Falasha woman decides to help him and agrees to the deception. The Israelis come and are fanatical about screening out the Christians and will only take Jews so they interview them mercilessly. The boy has been told to say he is called Solomon 'Schlomo' in Israel his father is Isaac he is told the village name etc. to convinced the Israelis. But he does not want to go and leave his mother whom he loves above all else. She turns harsh with him and pushes him away and says 'Go live and become! And only after you have become then come back to me!' They are both heartbroken. Both the Ethiopian women are amazing overwhelmingly effective despite being nonprofessionals. So the boy is swept up in the evacuation and gets through the Israeli screening process. He and a planeload of Falashas land in Tell Aviv dazed and totally confused. They are kept in isolation for months and repeatedly screened. And that is only the beginning of the long and emotional story. The little boy is brilliantly portrayed by a genuine Falashsa boy named Mosche Agazai and equally brilliantly played as an adolescent by another real Falasha Moshe Abebe. Because 'Schlomo' has been so upset he had become unruly and so a leftwing Israeli couple with two children of their own adopt him and he moves into an affluent suburban house. His adoptive mother is wonderfully portrayed by an experienced and sensitive Israeli actress named Yal Abecassis. The boy befriends a wise old Falasha whose family all died played by Yitzhak Edgar. And finally Schlomo as an adult is portrayed by Sirak M. Sabahat. The remarkable thing is that none of the people I have mentioned apart from the Israeli actress has acted in any other film and yet they all did better than any professional cast could conceivably have done. The intensity of their performances is searing and never to be forgotten. This film is a great classic which should be entered in the annals of world cinema as one of the most moving films ever made. The film is also a massive indictment of hypocrisy and intolerance as experienced in Israel by the Falashas after their arrival. They were abused insulted and subjected to a bombardment of hate and prejudice of incredible proportions and this is graphically shown in the story. As an adolescent and adult Schlomo is loved by a white Israeli girl named Sara beautifully and sensitively portrayed by the young Roni Hadar who has gone on subsequently to appear on TV and in another film. Her father is a violent bigot who thinks the Faslashas are subhuman and the irony of Jews classifying other people as 'untermenschen' is not lost on us! Every aspect of this tale is anguished and so much of it is heartrendingly tragic. Some of it turns out well however. Schlomo grows up to be a medical doctor and despite the alienation from his adoptive father retains the devoted love of his adoptive mother.The talent of Mihaileanu is best of all shown in one of the most breathtakingly brilliant final shots ever to be seen in any film though of course I am not permitted to describe it here. Radu Mihaileanu is certainly a cinematic genius of the first rank and he has proved it again in his equally amazing film THE CONCERT 2009 see my review.".

The Christian woman pretends that her son is the dead boy so that he can be evacuated as a Jew and the Falasha woman decides to help him and agrees to the deception. The Israelis come and are fanatical about screening out the Christians and will only take Jews so they interview them mercilessly. The boy has been told to say he is called Solomon 'Schlomo' in Israel his father is Isaac he is told the village name etc. to convinced the Israelis. But he does not want to go and leave his mother whom he loves above all else. She turns harsh with him and pushes him away and says 'Go live and become! And only after you have become then come back to me!' They are both heartbroken. Both the Ethiopian women are amazing overwhelmingly effective despite being nonprofessionals. So the boy is swept up in the evacuation and gets through the Israeli screening process. He and a planeload of Falashas land in Tell Aviv dazed and totally confused. They are kept in isolation for months and repeatedly screened. And that is only the beginning of the long and emotional story. The little boy is brilliantly portrayed by a genuine Falashsa boy named Mosche Agazai and equally brilliantly played as an adolescent by another real Falasha Moshe Abebe. Because 'Schlomo' has been so upset he had become unruly and so a leftwing Israeli couple with two children of their own adopt him and he moves into an affluent suburban house. His adoptive mother is wonderfully portrayed by an experienced and sensitive Israeli actress named Yal Abecassis. The boy befriends a wise old Falasha whose family all died played by Yitzhak Edgar. And finally Schlomo as an adult is portrayed by Sirak M. Sabahat. The remarkable thing is that none of the people I have mentioned apart from the Israeli actress has acted in any other film and yet they all did better than any professional cast could conceivably have done. The intensity of their performances is searing and never to be forgotten. This film is a great classic which should be entered in the annals of world cinema as one of the most moving films ever made. The film is also a massive indictment of hypocrisy and intolerance as experienced in Israel by the Falashas after their arrival. They were abused insulted and subjected to a bombardment of hate and prejudice of incredible proportions and this is graphically shown in the story. As an adolescent and adult Schlomo is loved by a white Israeli girl named Sara beautifully and sensitively portrayed by the young Roni Hadar who has gone on subsequently to appear on TV and in another film. Her father is a violent bigot who thinks the Faslashas are subhuman and the irony of Jews classifying other people as 'untermenschen' is not lost on us! Every aspect of this tale is anguished and so much of it is heartrendingly tragic. Some of it turns out well however. Schlomo grows up to be a medical doctor and despite the alienation from his adoptive father retains the devoted love of his adoptive mother.The talent of Mihaileanu is best of all shown in one of the most breathtakingly brilliant final shots ever to be seen in any film though of course I am not permitted to describe it here. Radu Mihaileanu is certainly a cinematic genius of the first rank and he has proved it again in his equally amazing film THE CONCERT 2009 see my review.";

It's imperfections I think lie in the fact that this story has been kept under wraps for so long and it was difficult for the filmmakers to know where to begin. It touches on most of the major issues that refugees face in Israel and is a strong and inspiring beginning to opening up this experience to further filmic treatment.

Movies about war refugees abound but originality is irrelevant. I came in expecting weepy overdone politically motivated. I rolled my eyes when the boy's mother said Go! Live and become! and then cried the very moment Hana took his hand and claimed to be his mum.This movie is slightly uneven in the sense that scenes with overwrought dialogue are scattered throughout it but I never thought of it until afterward. I wept a bit surprised by it every time my cynical self not being accustomed to crying at the movies. There are also quite funny parts for example when the rescued children first watch television all of them sit behind it waiting to see when the people inside will come out.

The protagonist Schlomo is great  i mean as an actor. particularly the first Schlomo who with no more than 12 years spoke three very different languages. There is also a lot of humor in the movie sometimes mixed with tragedy but important to keep us sticked to this more than 2 hours long movie.okey and now to the religious speculations. This movie is about a boy who searches his identity but don't want to forget his roots because he knows that his future depends on it. He has more mothers during the film but there is a mother that he respects very much and it is mother earth mother Africa  the land on which he take his shoes off and walk barefoot. he is born Christian. to survive he has to become an hebrew but soon he enters in a family that is not religious but simply pacifistic. This boy Schlomo seeks God. he talks with the moon he pray beneath the wall of cry he changes religions but he remains faithful to God and his religious tradition. How is it possible? In the background of the story there are many religious wars and Sclomo observes them. what i understood at the end is that it is important to do our religious rites to respect our religious traditions i for example as a catholic Christian but be aware that god is bigger than i imagine him. we understand god in our limited capacity of understanding and often in a wrong way but sometimes we manage to love thanks to our religion. God reveals him in human experience of love.and so i arrive to the second first is religion main theme of the movie  love. Schlomo learns how to love. he loves his original mother but he'll have to learn to love his new father his girlfriend and ultimately every person that needs help and need to be loved. he will learn that lust is not love and that love is expressed through helping and at the end he will be richly rewarded for learning his lesson well.

	schema:headline " A meaningful poignant inspiring film";
	schema:reviewBody "I am amazed by the fact that this film did not get more advertising exposure. Perhaps it is because it surrounds a theme particularly interesting if one is Jewish and even then the plight of the Falasha or black Ethiopian Jews is little known among the general Jewish population. Despite that there is I think much in this film to which everyone can relate. It captured my soul and I was emotionally enmeshed in it. A black Christian Ethiopian young boy in a Sudanese refugee camp because of the urging of his mother pretends to be Jewish to get to Israel to escape the horrendous conditions he is in. It surrounds a dire conflict in Sudan which took place in the 1980's and the Israeli Operation Moses rescue which airlifted those Ethiopian Jews caught in the middle of that struggle and brought them to Israel. It could however certainly be the Sudan that exists today Iraq or anywhere the brutality of warfare occurs and the innocents who are swept up enveloped brutalized and killed by it. It centers around concepts of racism and man's inhumanity to man. It is also about love  especially a mother's love for her child a stranger's love and a love between two people which transcends race.For those who are Jewish I think it is an especially poignant film as it is about what it means to be a Jew who is Jewish and how that is determined. It reflects the diversity in Israel itself about those core everpresent and debatable issues which determine Israeli citizenship. It is about the plight of the Falasha or Ethiopian black Jews in Israel who are refugees and allowed entry into Israel solely based on their being Jewish. Sometimes the larger Jewish populous who consider themselves white have ambivalent and lessthanwelcoming feelings about the Falasha. Clearly worldwide being a Jew is more than being religious and this work points that out insightfully and with pathos. I have no criticism of the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yom Shi Shi 9 September 2016 I found this movie by accident but I am so happy that I did. I wish that I had known of it in year 2005. This film is based on a true story about Ethiopian Jews suffering and dying in Ethiopia Africa for lack of food and medical help and that eventually Israel saves them. The English title is Live and Become or Live and Become Jewish which is about a Christian boy and his Christian mother in Ethiopia. To save her son when the Israelis arrive to save many Ethiopian Black Jews the mom tells her son to say that he is Jewish and go live in Israel so that he will not die in Ethiopia.The young actors Moshe Abebe and Sirak Sabahat both playing Solomon at different ages and pretty Israeli actress Yael Abecassi in the role of the adoptive mother both deserves an academy award. The entire cast was excellent. Excellent acting excellent direction and great locations. Also it was great to hear the dialogue in Ivrit and also in Amharic but I don't know why French is included.I also love when the young cute Jewish girl actress Roni Hadar started to like Solomon in spite of his dark skin. God does NOT see skin color Elohim Adonai El Elyon Only see the heart and mind of people. Real Love overcomes hate bigotry and prejudice and I think that if I had the chance to meet a pretty White Israeli Jewish woman love and marriage would Not happen between us because I too am African Black American and I would be looked down upon because of my skin color.My favorite scenes was when Yael told him that Sarah loves him and she waited 10 years for him he better tell her that he loves her. I thought finally and the beautiful wedding scenes. But even more what I loved is the fact that Sarah loved him in spite of his skin color not born Jewish. True Love conquers all.But I wish that more White Jews and darker skin Jews converts included would open their hearts and minds and allow men and women to love and marry freely without all the racism. For the Jewish women and men in America that have open hearts and minds and loved and married darker skin I say Toda La El for them.I also loved the scenes with the Jewish celebrations music and dancing. The Israel Jewish culture of religious and non religious is very beautiful with the dancing in a large circle and celebrations.I hope that when it was originally released that it was well received and won some awards.I wish that it was release in United States. Todah Rabah.Shalom Laila Tov ve La heet ra ot.".

	schema:reviewBody "Live and Become is is about never giving up no matter what! It's an optimistic story. When you do good in your life good comes back to you when you least expect it.Parts of this story are incredibly gutwrenching I even had to fast forward the movie at times. Vicariously experiencing the incredible suffering taking place in a refugee camp was unbearable. On the other hand we get to see a relatively normal Middle Class existence through most of the story which is quite a relief! While this is a fictional story the setting is 100 historically accurate. I felt like I was reliving the news from the 1980's! I remember the Falashas also known as Ethiopian Jews and their evacuation from Ethiopia and the Sudan. I also remember what a hard time they were given by a large segment of the Israeli population especially by the Ultra Orthodox religious establishment who did not consider them to be real Jews.The racism and constant humiliation experienced by Schlomo was mindnumbing and symbolic of how the Falashas were actually treated back then. What a very sad commentary on the Israeli society of the time! I immensely enjoyed getting to see Schlomo played by 3 different actors one as 9year old then as a teenager and finally as a man in his 20's. We literally get to see Schlomo turn into this incredibly brave and selfconfident man. What a moving story! After watching it I guarantee you it will strengthen your belief in a Supreme Being!".

And while this IMDb page links to 9 further versions of Moliere's 1668 play at the time of this writing there are only two comments written about them and both of those are for the aforementioned 1980 version. The 1990 version copyright 1989 was directed by Tonino Cervi although some sources say it was Alberto Sordi who occupied the directors chair as well as the editors suite.Sordi plays the miser Harpagon himself known as Arpagone here and does so with relish Arpagone is able to count money by ear. The setting is moved from Paris to Rome and filmed in actual Roman palaces near Vatican city Arpagane does business with the Pope and high ranking cardinals and with a star studded cast including Laura Antonelli as Madame Frosina who is given the difficult task to find a suitable wife for the miser Marie Laforet as La Contessa former miss Italia Anna Kanakis as Arpagone's daughter and the actor with perhaps the longest resume on this site and still growing Christopher Lee as the conniving Cardinal Spinosi.Lee devotes a couple of interesting pages to L'Avaro in his autobiography Tall Dark and Gruesome. It is the only picture in his long career where he forgot his lines it being a difficult speech in Italian. Methinks Lee is being too hard on himself here for if no actor ever forgot a line there would be no blooper reels. and despite his knowledge of languages his voice was eventually dubbed over. Secondly the master of the macabre grew very annoyed at the disinterest of the Italian crew who would smoke talk and wander about during takes. This even included Alberto Sordi himself who would repeat each one of Christopher Lee's lines after he said them. At one point it got so bad Lee slammed his hand on a table to demand silence. Good for him. And he got it for at least 20 minutes or so.As the entire play is centered around the miser of the title a perfect center role for Sordi one would think it is a bit difficult at first to keep track of the supporting characters most especially who is betrothed to whom while secretly loving another. It isn't until half way through the film that everyone gathers together in one room for some clarity. Of course those familiar with the play will know that family connections will only get more complicated from then on but that's neither here nor there. The original concept of characters interrupting each other when breaking the fourth wall is not used unfortunately.7 out of 10".

All of this was portrayed subtly sensitively and with humour at many times throughout this movie in a natural and unforced way. I credit this to Christian Bale and Emily Watson's acting abilities and the Director's talent. To me underlying the midlife crisis of one man in this movie is the theme of relationship and how he gets his life from them. Whether it's with his wife girlfriend or best friend from childhood. I really thought everything about this moview was excellent script acting directing scenes. More than that it captured the subtle nuances and emotions shared between people which wasn't stated in words but one felt as a viewer that one knew what that look meant or the silent treatment was for.

The friend criticizes Chris on the lack of excitement in his life and urges him to leave his wife Marion Emily Watson and travel the world. As enticing the dramatic possibilities seem with this plot Metroland takes all the expectations one might have and tries something new. It's a character piece headlined with a smashing performance by Bale. It's also funny bright and deeply introspective. The plot takes us on a tour of Chris's past. A past that included a stay in Paris with a beautiful native. The woman teaches Chris the ways of love and bohemian lifestyle a lifestyle Chris has always wanted. The section takes up about half of the film and is the film's strongest suit. We see the very English Chris try to pass himself off as a Parisian and curse at other Brits he also loses his virginity is a grandly comical scene. The other half of the film deals with Chris trying to justify his lack of shame in his calm predictable life. Veteran director Philip Saville does a good job making sure the audience never loses faith in Chris. It could have been real easy to drag the film through a series of lame dramatics but Saville gives realistic answers to realistic questions.There are a lot of pluses in Metroland. It's well written sharply shot with a good eye for detail and everybody out there knows how I feel about the brilliant Emily Watson. What I liked best and this might seem weird but with all the grotesque nudity in such films as Go and He Got Game Metroland is refreshingly blunt. There is a lot of bodies on display here but in a very natural and  dare I say  beautiful way. It's not thrown in your face. It just is.

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the novel by Julian Barnes and directed by Philip Saville Masterpiece Theatre's The Buccaneers The Life and Loves of a SheDevil miniseries Metroland is a charming little British movie. It's a character study of Chris played by Christian Bale American Psycho Batman Begins Rescue Dawn in an early role that is a nice change of pace for him. Bale captures this sweet geeky funny everyman character brilliantly. In 1977 now a married man with a baby girl Chris lives in the suburb of Metroland his hometown where he vowed as a teenager that he would leave and never return. Every working day he takes the mass transit rail out of the suburb to London to his job at an advertising agency. He wanted to be a globetrotting photographer but settled for this. Chris seems content with his life but when his ne'erdowell chum Toni played by Lee Ross Secrets and Lies shows up Chris has a midlife crisis albeit a young midlife crisis. Toni's appearance brings back the memories of his carefree life before marriage and responsibility during the 1960s when he lives in Paris takes photographs and has his first serious girlfriend Annick Elsa Zylberstein. Bale plays a naive love sick man to Annick's worldly sexy French woman. They start an intense sexual affair and Chris is quite smitten with Annick until he meets Marionall decked out in gogo boots liquid eyeliner and a ThatGirl hair flip. Chris is attracted to Marion mainly because she can see through some of his foolishness. In one conversation between the tworeminiscent of It's a Wonderful Life in which James Stewart informs Donna Reed that he doesn't want to marry or have kids but then gleefully gives in kissing Reed Chris tells Marion that he wants to stay on in Paris and doesn't want to get married and have children. Marion cruelly replies You're not original enough to. Chris reconsiders his relationship with Annick who he has nothing in common withonly lust. And he chooses Marion. In one of many funny scenes Chris is in bed with his wife Marion played by Emily Watson Breaking the Waves Hilary and Jackie The Water Horse Legend of the Deep. He starts kissing her sweetly but she is too tired for that. He says to her I can't remember the last time. Yesterday morning she replies. Then he says Yeah we used to do it three times a day. She says It only happened once and you complained about being sore a week afterwards. He smiles and replies Sore but very smug. This changes Marion's mind but they are soon interrupted by their daughter's crysuch is the life of a family man. During Toni's visit Marion makes her dislike for him clear to Chris who defends his lifelong friend. Toni is bound and determined to lead Chris astray so that Toni can prove to himself that he made the right decision not to settle down. Toni plays his part well as the devil on Chris' shoulder. At his party Tony convinces one of his free minded girlfriends to give Chris a shag. Just as Chris is considering consummation he imagines Marion being carried away in an ambulance. When Toni happens to pass by the room Chris realizes that Toni put her up to itand is insulted and leaves. It shows how even the closest longest friendships can die in adulthood when people choose to go down different paths. Later Chris suspects something happened between Marion and Toni and he gets into fisticuffs with Toni. Marion tells Chris that he made a pass at her she was somewhat tempted but refused. As Toni gets ready to leave town Chris and he make up somewhat halfheartedly. While taking a bath together Chris tells Marion about the girl at Toni's party who he nearly slept with and of course Marion has an ongoing joke of telling Chris to go ahead and have an affair. Marion then reveals to Chris she had a one night stand long ago and tells him that it won't happen again. We don't know if this is true or if Marion is only trying to spice things upbecause as a result of her confession they have passionate sex. And afterwards she kids him about having sex with the girl at the party.Christian Bale's mutton chops and flared collars and pants legs give the movie a real retro feel. Bale has some great comedic moments here. In one of two very good scenes Toni takes Chris to a punk rock concert but Chris hates punk and only tolerates it by getting drunk and stoned. Chris comes home quite randy and keeps trying to pull Marion down on the bed in his inebriated state. The other scene is Chris' first date with Annick in which he conspicuously kisses herand pulls her into bed awkwardly. The female characters teeter on being stereotypical. Annick and Marion are the archetype of the allknowing allbeautiful allwitty woman to the archetype of Chris as the bumbling sex obsessed male. Emily Watson's performance elevates Marion's character so she doesn't turn into a shrewwe can sympathize with her as Chris shuts her out as he daydreams about his glory days of youth. We also feel sympathy towards Annick as she goes from being the experienced one in the relationship to being the needy and jealous one as Chris matures. I describe Metroland as a British cozy romantic dramedyif such a thing exists. Some memorable scenes and some funny moments make the film worthwhile. As does the good acting between Bale and Watson who make it more than a forgettable flick. Bale and Watson have good chemistry and repeat that again in the 2002 SciFi cult classic Equilibrium. Metroland is a movie you rarely see now a movie that deals intelligently and realistically with themes of adulthood.".

I describe Metroland as a British cozy romantic dramedyif such a thing exists. Some memorable scenes and some funny moments make the film worthwhile. As does the good acting between Bale and Watson who make it more than a forgettable flick. Bale and Watson have good chemistry and repeat that again in the 2002 SciFi cult classic Equilibrium. Metroland is a movie you rarely see now a movie that deals intelligently and realistically with themes of adulthood.";

Set mainly during 1977 the drama focuses on Chris Christian Bale and Tony Lee Ross who grew up together in suburban England a decade earlier.Chris is now happily married to Marion Emily Watson and has a baby daughter. Tony has never settled down. A surprise visit from his childhood friend causes Chris to reassess his present life and to remember his days working in Paris there he lived with Annick Elsa Zylberstein a young liberated French woman before he fell in love with Marion.Bale and Watson were superb in this film. He fantasizes about how his life would have been had he not gotten married. Tony is trying to convince him to give it all up and Marion is trying to save her marriage.There is a lot of nudity and sex but none is gratuitous. It all adds to the story and  at times is funny especially when he was new at sex in Paris.The most interesting part of the film consists of two related scenes. he tells Tony that he is content. Maybe that is the best you can hope for from an Englishman. His wife asks later if he is happy. he says If not now never. That is certainly to me at least not a ringing endorsement. Maybe again it is particularly English.The film was very enjoyable and the only criticism I would have is the graininess in the middle. I am beginning to like Bale more and more.".

Christian Bale plays an Englishman who begins to reminisce about his past in the mid and late '60s when an old friend played by Lee Ross comes back to stir up his life. While I felt that the story was strong and seemingly dramatic enough to keep me interested and entertained the character played by Lee Ross just seemed unnecessary. This character is supposed to build the plot the first half of the movie and I felt this could've been reached in many other directions.And if you love France well you'll love the beautiful depiction of French women with an excellent performance given by Elsa Zylberstein Bale's character's 'old flame' that he thinks about constantly throughout the film.Beautiful 'still' cinematography throughout is perfect for Bale's character's love for photography and makes the film very watchable just for art's sake.By the time I reached the last 45 minutes or so I was much more intrigued and worried for the wellbeing of Bale's marriage with his present day 1977 wife played wonderfully by Emily Watson. The tension between the two of them throughout the film is far more than believable and I loved it.While I wanted to give this movie a much higher rating I think it is fair to say that the first half moves much too slow. I was also slightly disappointed by the ending of the film but it was still a great surprise and hit me unexpectedly. I highly recommend for BaleWatson fans.".

In any future retrospective of this incredibly talented and lovely actor's body of work there is no doubt whatsoever this film will be among her most superb work. Ms. Emily Watson simply captures the screen with her presence and elevates the work of Bale and fellow cast members with the excellence of her own triumphant skill. That she was not nominated for an Oscar or a Bafta once again proves how meaningless these hollow awards are. She was honored for Appropriate Adult with a Bafta but both the Emmys and even the Golden Globes reflected their ignorance and lack of appreciation for true artistry and genius. By this point in her career Ms. Watson should have enumerable nominations and several Academy Awards to her credit. However that is not what really matters. The true significance of her brilliance as an actor is that she touches the souls of everyone graced by performance after performance. Ms. Emily Watson may well be one of the greatest female actors to ever appear on stage in film or television. No one should allow themselves to miss this film for they will be much the lesser for it.

Saville and his fine cast do a good job of conveying both the male and the female perspectives on sex romance marriage and maturation. It all seemed very real.

Merely watching Chris Christian Bale and Marion Emily Watson live their present lives through the memories of their past made for an interesting if not engrossing film. It's flaw I think lies in the film's way of batting you over the head with it's ideas. The film literally leaves nothing for you to think through on your own. The result of slathering on the characters and plot elements is that the movie starts to really sag under its own weight during the last 45someodd minutes. I actually thought to fastforward merely because everything was winding down so slowly and predictably. I finished the movie unconvinced that Chris was completely happy with his life. He was content but that does not equate to happiness...I thought Bale and Watson played well off of each other especially upon their first meeting and in the final flashback on the bridge. Ross had an occasional few good moments that held his character up shakily. I found that my main technical point would have to have been the cinematography the scenes in Paris could have been so much more wild and vivid while in contrast the scenes at home could have been more loving and smooth....Allinall the movie is watchable but only just.

I must admit that I picked it up solely because Christian Bale was on the cover whom I absolutely adore but have had yet to see him in a movie I enjoyed I found both A Midsummer's Night Dream and Velvet Goldmine to be a bore and haven't had a chance yet to see American Psycho.  The person at the video store commented that patrons who generally enjoy the nonHollywood type movies liked this one and he was right.There is nothing really marketable for a North American audience in this movie.  I don't think it would've survived against the American Beauties and Green Miles of american drama.  But this brit drama is a really superb character study of a man caught at a crossroads is he content with where he is now 31 years of age with wife and child or does he yearn for the freedom of his youthful days?  This is not an easily answerable question but Metroland attempts to in a very honest and real way.  What truly shines in this movie is the depth and threedimension in the characters.  Being 22 I never thought that I myself could identify with this story and its characters but the director does an excellent job at simply telling a good story.If you're looking for an intelligent drama one which won't cheat you at the end with a cliche finale ala Notting Hill this one is definately worth the rent.  But be warned this DVD is a fullframed transfer.  I also found myself fiddlying with the colour dial on my DVD player especially in the grainy flashback sequences.  I wonder if that was just an artifact of the transfer or an intentional part of those sequences...  but that aside the performances of Christian Bale and Emily Watson far outweigh these technical difficulties.".

Chris gradually starts to reflect on his younger years with the help from his mate Toni and remembers what a rebellious spirit he once was. This flashback device is efficient for the film as it further emphasizes the tediousness of Metroland by contrasting it to Chris' dreams and idealism as a young man.Metroland greatly showcases Christian Bale's versatility as an actor stripping him of whatever traces of superhero glamour from Batman Begins that was left in his image. Here we can recognize his ability to portray a character that is a downright loser and we enjoy it. There is plenty of Balegoodies in this film not just in his acting performance. Credit should also go to the lovely Emily Watson as Chris' little Suburbian wife.Metroland is a fairly cute lowbudget English film that occasionally borders on being severely depressing. Yet this is compensated for by including the punk edge of the 1970s that takes the form of a disdain for the bourgeoisie and a rebellious attitude. All the Paris segments that Chris recalls are wellmade and entertaining and by far the more memorable parts of this film. Everything else is nice but forgettable. 710".

Along the way Murat takes on a traitor named Ahmed Khan Renato Baldini  Prince Sergei Vorontzov Grard Herter and falls in love for Sultanet Aslan Bey's Daughter Giorgia Moll and Princess Maria Vorontsova Scilla Gabel . The film is a passable adventure movie lavishly produced  a lot of extras and usual dancing scenes in charge of gorgeous dancers . This classic story of romantic adventure come to life enriched by Technicolor cinematography in charge of Maria Bava  the notorious cameraman and filmmaker  and adapted regularly to the screen . However  being necessary a right remastering for the washedout copy . The movie suffered several cuts by Italian censorship and was based on a book by Leo Tolstoy who in turn based the book on his experiences in the Russian army in Chechnya when his unit was sent to help subdue Chechen guerrillas . Overwhelming battles and duels and full of villainy  romance  and heroism . Evocative as well as atmospheric musical score by Roberto Nicolisi . Steve Reeves is cool as the hero who encounters dangerous situations while trying retrieve his lover . Reeves acted as a corpulent hero in several movies starring historic and legendary characters such as Romulus in Romulus and Remo  Phillipides in Giant of Marathon Eneas in The war of the Trojan and The horse of Trojan  Glaucus in The last days of Pompei and Hercules in the Queen of Lydia. He starred several adventure films such as Thief of Baghdad  Morgan the Pirate The avenger Pirates of seven seas  among others .

	schema:reviewBody "Not the greatest film but not as tiresome as Leonard Maltin claims in his review. Leonard has seen so many films he apparently gets tired easily  See IMDB's sidebar link. The wonderful thing about this film is its decision to cover a subject area that is largely unknown to Western audiences. Indeed we Westerners didn't have any idea about this area of the world until the fall of the Soviet Union where a lot of these mysterious countries emerged with an an at the end Turkmenistan Azerbaijan and the like... largely Turkic regions and nations. Of course Turks are almost always treated as villains in Western films Another group that's usually villainous in cinema are the Arabs however in a rare film where the Arabs were the heroes Lawrence of Arabia the Turks were still the villains.Now the Turks are not the heroes in this film per se not the Turks of today's Turkey or the thenOttoman Empire but various Turkic tribes in the Caucasus in the film they're referred to as tribesmen Caucasian once as Muslims or  derogatorily by the Russians as Savages. Probably using the word Turk would have been risky as the Western audience might then lose its sympathy for the film's heroes. In the declining years of the Ottoman Empire mighty Czarist Russia instigated many wars against the Ottomans taking good advantage of their weakened state.The thing I found interesting is that Czarist Russia is often depicted in American and other Western films as noble and heroic... I guess it's the Christian connection. In this film based on a novel by Tolstoy the Russians are hinted at as the bloodthirsty oppressors they were. I'm influenced by a rare book The Ethnic Cleansing of Ottoman Muslims by Prof. Justin McCarthy which showed the unbelievable magnitude of the evil and inhumanity displayed by the Russians and others including Bulgars and Armenians. Turkish or Muslim lives are not as important and this part of history is very unknown to us Westerners. I doubt this subject matter would be chosen in an American film and if it wasn't for Tolstoy's book probably the Italians would have been unaware of the subject matter themselves when they tried to choose an adventurous vehicle for Steve Reeves.At the beginning of the film when Hadji Murad attacks Russian troops down a lonely road Robin Hoodstyle he meets with the Maid Marian  Russian princess Maria. When she makes a statement regarding the superiority of Russian soldiers Murad replies that his tribe kills only soldiers whereas the Russians slaughter women and children. I'm reminded of the fighters in Chechnya following the same procedure generally... they wouldn't target innocent Russian civilians other than terrorist attacks during the first phase of their recent struggle a few years ago. During the second phase when the Russians invaded again the Russians murder rob and rape as indiscriminately as they have done in centuries past. Now that the Chechnyans is it Chechens? are no longer winning there has been a general news blackout in the American media... but their struggle is still a continuation of freeing themselves from Russian domination in the Caucasus that The White Warrior is about.I thought Steve Reeves had a surprising charisma... obviously he was hired for these kinds of films for his spectacular build and not for his great acting ability but he came across as a likable and believable hero in this one.".

This film like many Italian epics much more a horse  lance than a sword and sandal film is very colorful with a good cinematography dancing numbers and battle scenes. The actresses Giorgia Moll and Scilla Gabel are gorgeous  Sultanet loves Agi Murad and Princess Maria will love him too. Both actresses provide charm and sensuality to the film.Already in the beginning of the film when the allpowerful Czar Nicholas I is talking to Princess Maria about her mission it's all too clear that he's under her spell and Princess Maria charmingly takes advantage of his infatuation for her own means after this scene I was hooked. And the lovely Sultanet commands the heart of two men  something that will have its consequences in the story.There's good chemistry between Giorgia Moll and Steve Reeves. Both of them would work together again in the enchanting The Thief of Bagdad.This film is entertainment guaranteed. The production values are not as high as those of the American epic films but this film is more creative and more fun. Don't expect much of the story it's has been told many times before. See the film for its colors and spontaneity. The White Warrior is not so deadly serious like its American counterparts  the hero may fight for freedom and justice and the villains can do very bad things but there's always time for delight.".

The version I just saw is Englishdubbed and 10 minutes shorter than the original even with the restoration of some footage that had originally been censored in Spain where my copy was issued it is a strange mixture of averagelooking sections with others that seemed to come from a blownup VHS copy. Agi Murad though is an attractive widescreen adventure film with a touch of history in spite of being not very well acted by Steve Reeves who this time seems a little beyond his scope for the title role in the dramatic scenes but he compensates his shortcoming in the action scenes and has Grard Herter to counteract as he chews the scenery playing the Russian villain and sexy Scilla Gabel as his scheming wife who has fallen for the White Devil as Murad is called. By the state the homevideo business is in these days it is a pity that we will probably never be able to watch these films in their original form.".

Agi Murad though is an attractive widescreen adventure film with a touch of history in spite of being not very well acted by Steve Reeves who this time seems a little beyond his scope for the title role in the dramatic scenes but he compensates his shortcoming in the action scenes and has Grard Herter to counteract as he chews the scenery playing the Russian villain and sexy Scilla Gabel as his scheming wife who has fallen for the White Devil as Murad is called. By the state the homevideo business is in these days it is a pity that we will probably never be able to watch these films in their original form.";

Following Reeves' success in the HERCULES flicks made in the previous two years this film takes the typical swordandsandal plot  involving cruel rulers brave rebels and an imprisoned hero  and transplants it to 19th century Russia. Yes it's a peplum film in all but setting but sadly this is one of the 'stodgy' entries in the genre where the wholesome goodness and earnest heroics are quickly tiresome to the adventureloving viewer. It's a talkfilled film talky from the word go and never letting up with the chitchat and when most of the characters are boring and interchangeable that's no good thing.Reeves plays the brawny rebel leader Hadji Murad who ends up being plotted against by a rival and thrown in prison where he's occasionally whipped. Reeves was never much of an actor and he's singularly unimpressive here both in the acting stakes and in the action department more of that later. Giorgia Moll supplies a little beauty as his love interest but Scilla Gabel is plain weirdlooking as a princess  not only has she got an OTT makeup job but it turns out the actress had plastic surgery shortly before this film adding to her general odd appearance. Euroregular actors Renato Baldini and Gerard Herter have fun in a couple of bad guy roles.The action in this film is again highly disappointing firstly because there's not a great deal of it and secondly because it's badly staged and unengaging. A scene in which Reeves is shot off his horse in the woods is probably the most engaging moment. An attack on a hilltop fortress promises some excitement but the rebels set off some nitroglycerine ?? and manage to kill every bad guy in the fortress at the same time !. Things eventually culminate in a mildly exciting swordfight that recalls THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD but this is followed by a clifftop scramble in which both Reeves and Baldini are poorly doubled so it's immediately obvious that two stuntmen are fighting instead of the real actors it doesn't help that Reeves' double is skinny as anything.The film was supposedly based on a Leo Tolstoy novel but it's not one you've heard of. The plot offers nothing new or interesting. One good thing is that surehand director Riccardo Freda is in control of things and combined with cinematographer Mario Bava he produces a goodlooking film with some good location shooting in Yugoslavia. It's just a shame that the plot and action aren't up to it.".

For the most part the great Reeves physique is hidden in a goofy knee length tunic with an even more sillier looking russian hat.The action is rather minimal with only a good wrestling scene from the mid waist up that shows off the great Reeves physique. This is an apparent attempt by the producers to move Reeves out of the sword and sandal genre into another historic era with poor results. The dialogue from the script is hard to understand at various points and only commentary from the narrator allows the viewer to understand what is really happening from scene to scene.

	schema:reviewBody "This is another of those films that I was introduced to as a kid via a still in my Dad's scrapbook of movie posters which he collected during his own childhood curiously enough as far as I know it was never broadcast on any of the basic Italian TV channels. In fact I only came across a copy of it a few years ago by way of an Italian satellite TV screening that dates back from 2005 unfortunately the channel's cumbersome announcement for the film we are presently watching goes on for its first 5 minutes and the print itself bore intermittent instances of jerkiness in the picture! At any rate for being the only movie on which Peplum icon Steve Reeves was directed by the great Riccardo Freda the end result was something of a letdown  frankly it was one of the perennial EuroCult items of this year's Easter marathon I was looking forward to the most! In hindsight the involvement of directorial collaborator Leopoldo Savona a journeyman helmer of similar efforts might have had something to do with that for the record Freda also helped out on the superior THE MONGOLS 1961 on which Savona handled the Italian side of a production that was officially credited to Hollywood director Andre' De Toth!But let us get to the good stuff first there are a couple of sequences or shots which do attest to Freda's directorial hand  the vividly depicted opening village raid by the Tsarist militia the following sequence in which a steaming Tsar Nicholas I strips his generals of their medals for not having yet tamed a revolting band of Caucasian subjects led by The White Devil Agi Murad a cathartic ritual that is interrupted by his visiting future daughterinlaw Scilla Gabel to whom he professes and displays affections which go well beyond the paternal! the Tsar's son Gerard Herter is memorably introduced via a lowangle shot while he is instructing his pet pooch in etiquette. The entire film also bears the unmistakable mark of its legendary cinematographer Mario Bava still a year away from officially graduating to the director's chair who bathes the proceedings in colourfully atmospheric hues. Roberto Nicolosi's musical accompaniment then is a decently rousing one as well.This ItaloYugoslavian coproduction is marred by a clichd script and an exceedingly low budget Reeves is a widower in love with his son's governess Giorgia Moll who is also coveted by fellow rebel ringleader Renato Baldini this romantic rivalry augurs nothing but disaster for the Caucasian forces with Reeves' subsequent desertion after the obligatory but totally gratuitous wrestling bout of course and apprehension by the enemy Moll having to promise herself to Baldini in return for the life of Reeves' son the death of their feeble and ineffectual figurehead Reeves is tortured by Herter's men but a besotted Gabel intervenes thus freeing him Reeves rides a galloping horse all over the Tsarist palatial retreat to reclaim his true love and pursue his real foe the latter's death is particularly lame. For the record Leonard Maltin's guide gives this a measly 12 rating and while definitely not all that bad I guess it should have alerted me not to raise my expectations too highly. Incidentally I have also acquired a much earlier 1930 German film adaptation of the same Leo Tolstoy story costarring Peter Lorre and I might get to give it a whirl presently in the hope that it will be a more worthwhile rendition.".

In hindsight the involvement of directorial collaborator Leopoldo Savona a journeyman helmer of similar efforts might have had something to do with that for the record Freda also helped out on the superior THE MONGOLS 1961 on which Savona handled the Italian side of a production that was officially credited to Hollywood director Andre' De Toth!But let us get to the good stuff first there are a couple of sequences or shots which do attest to Freda's directorial hand  the vividly depicted opening village raid by the Tsarist militia the following sequence in which a steaming Tsar Nicholas I strips his generals of their medals for not having yet tamed a revolting band of Caucasian subjects led by The White Devil Agi Murad a cathartic ritual that is interrupted by his visiting future daughterinlaw Scilla Gabel to whom he professes and displays affections which go well beyond the paternal! the Tsar's son Gerard Herter is memorably introduced via a lowangle shot while he is instructing his pet pooch in etiquette. The entire film also bears the unmistakable mark of its legendary cinematographer Mario Bava still a year away from officially graduating to the director's chair who bathes the proceedings in colourfully atmospheric hues. Roberto Nicolosi's musical accompaniment then is a decently rousing one as well.This ItaloYugoslavian coproduction is marred by a clichd script and an exceedingly low budget Reeves is a widower in love with his son's governess Giorgia Moll who is also coveted by fellow rebel ringleader Renato Baldini this romantic rivalry augurs nothing but disaster for the Caucasian forces with Reeves' subsequent desertion after the obligatory but totally gratuitous wrestling bout of course and apprehension by the enemy Moll having to promise herself to Baldini in return for the life of Reeves' son the death of their feeble and ineffectual figurehead Reeves is tortured by Herter's men but a besotted Gabel intervenes thus freeing him Reeves rides a galloping horse all over the Tsarist palatial retreat to reclaim his true love and pursue his real foe the latter's death is particularly lame. For the record Leonard Maltin's guide gives this a measly 12 rating and while definitely not all that bad I guess it should have alerted me not to raise my expectations too highly. Incidentally I have also acquired a much earlier 1930 German film adaptation of the same Leo Tolstoy story costarring Peter Lorre and I might get to give it a whirl presently in the hope that it will be a more worthwhile rendition.";

According to the credits it is even adapted from the book by Tolstoy Hadji Murad. But it falls short there isn't a whole lot of action for a war film and the drama is only melodramatic at best.But it keeps the classic Steve Reeves formula the great physique the slightly overdone acting and the dubbing. My rating two out of four stars it is a fair film worth watching occasionally. By the way if you are at all interested in what Steve's voice really sounded like check out either the Ed Wood film Jailbait or the MGM musical Athena.".

We see her strong shameless strong sex drive which she cannot harmonize with her wish to be loved and respected as a woman by a man. She struggles making sense of the importance of accepting social boundaries and not giving way to peer pressure to fit into a group which is a quintessential teen problem. Melissa's awakening is a path of pain as well as of pleasure but takes her to very dark places in scenes that can be disturbing.Despite the good premises the script is uneven not always engaging and has most adult characters barely sketched except for Melissa's and for Melissa's charming eccentric grandmother played by Geraldine Chaplin. The character of Melissa's mother Daria played by Fabrizia Sacchi is barely drawn and very stereotypical. The absent father and his marital relationship with Daria is barely explained just a reference outside. Most male teen characters are depicted as despicable villains stereotypical machos and I don't think I want to believe that is always the case.Maria Valverde is very good as Melissa actually she's the best thing in the movie. She has an impressive acting registry for such a young age. Her face is splendorous always her expression innocent childish weak and boyish sometimes hyperfeminine dramatic strong and sexual some others. Valverde has to deal with very raunchy scenes some of them very dramatic and she succeeds at making believable her character. Geraldine Chaplin is always a delight but I did not find her especially inspired in this movie mostly because the way her character is written. The rest of the actors are just OK.A not always engaging movie but with some interesting themes and a good performance by Valverde.".

It is wonderful how Melissa always want to choose what to do with her life what to feel how to act what to search for but somehow the change is only in her deeds but not in her inside her diary pickups are often in disharmony with what happens to her afterwards. But although she is in fact doing this to herself she is just so full of it! And so she is coping with her teenage pain as rational as she can in her age. Of course the sex. When you don't know what it is but you want it badly. She is less selfaware then the character played by Liv Tyler in Stealing Beauty but much more proactive. She doesn't let situations pass by she is grabbing what she can of them she does not wait in a corner. That's what i liked at Melissa. The cruelty of acts and the sweetness of the inside. Unsplittable. And that this movie is more real than a sweet romance movie. It is of the age  if she were a little more older the tender detailed camera would lost its narrative function. And maybe the casting would pickup another actress. Anyway I love it more and more. It's telling exactly the teen story which have been missed.".

Melissa's sexual exploits were for the most part disgusting and whatever was left over was disturbing. I'm not prude but that book nauseated me and the movie wasn't much better. At least the movie had some kind of a story. The book was more or less a detailed list of all the raunchy things she had done in her past there was no connection between her and any part of her family. No mention of the grandmother that figures quite largely into the movie's plot not a peep. All in all if you have the choice between the movie or the book pick the movie at least it is shorter.".

Besides there are no interesting dialogs nor an appealing related story to support it. The main actress Valverde doesn't look young enough and most of the rest of the cast seems isolated. On the plus side the movie is nicely shot the background songs are appropriate and Geraldine Chaplin brings some brightness as the bohemian grandmother.

	schema:reviewBody "'Melissa P.' is far too weak and clichd to be a good film. Upon enjoying 'Lo Sono L'amore' and 'A Bigger Splash' and anticipating 'Call Me By Your Name' I figured I should watch all the other films by Italian director Luca Guadagnino. Due to other poor reviews and the fact that this is one of Guadagnino's early films I didn't have many high expectations. However even my mediocre expectations were disappointed by this film. The story was poorly handled and saturated with predictable clichs that caused the film to be un engaging. Surely though since this is labelled as an erotic drama the love scenes will be appealing? Not at all. They were filmed in a very amateur manner and they were cut short so nothing really happened. For a movie entered around an individual's sex life all the sexual tension leads up to a few moments of kissing and then before things get excessive it's cut short. However there were a few moments of this film that were rather good such as the character of Melissa's grandmother played by the wonderful Geraldine Chaplin. The leading role of Melissa was also played quite well by Mara Valverde and she pulled off the sexuallycharged character quite well. There were also a few moments where Guadagnino's potential was shown through some beautifully filmed scenes that is essentially a good indication of the good to come in his future films. While this film had it's moments overall it was a disappointing bore. I won't hold this film against Guadagnino as I know it is one of his earlier films and having seen his more recent brilliant films I still commend him as a great director. This movie is a good indication of how far Guadagnino has come in his filmography.".

Mara Valverde is well cast in the title role and wearing negligible makeup Geraldine Chaplin looks at least a decade older than her actual age in a memorable turn as Valverde's feisty freespirited grandmother. Interesting as Valverde is to follow around there are some gaps in her character progression. At times it seems like she is acting out as a result of being rebuffed by her high school crush with at least a couple of points in which she agrees to do things to prove that she is not a baby. And yet it is what happens to her grandmother that actually initiates her quest and try as the film does it has trouble finding a balance between being about grief and societal pressures. There is also something to be said for the lack of graphic imagery. Most of her exploits are told to us via diary entries and while this has the advantage of leaving it up to one's imagination to fill in the blanks everything that occurs resonates less since we only ever see fleeting glimpses of her quest. Curiously enough even with the explicit content kept to a minimum the film has still sparked some controversy. It is certainly not a film for all tastes and its low IMDb rating is only representative of just how divisive a movie it is. 'Melissa P.' is hardly a flawless motion picture but there is more of interest to it than one might expect.".

As another reviewer has noted  this is a gem.";

It sounds too good to be true  may be not for you  but imagine what those words meant for a boy who is used to live in a missy  probably due to the hard life he had to live after the death of his mother. As soon as the boat reaches the shore the reality of this new world came out of the dream mist. Finding employment is not as easy especially considering the age of the Pele's father and the fact that he has a small boy with him.

Although Pelle is often refused friendships from the local Danish boys he shows his good heart befriending a boy who has some physical disability  and their friendship through a little odd at times shows that people can find someone to care for  even in the toughest places.Pelle the Conqueror is classic movie and although some may thing that the story gets a bit depressing at times I recommend it to anyone who treasure excellent coming of age movies.".

	schema:headline " Von Sydow at his very best but still upstaged by a boy!";
	schema:reviewBody " SPOILER NEAR END OF REVIEW  Whenever I see a film starring Max Von Sydow I can expect the very best in quality acting from him regardless of whether the actual film is lousy or not.Sydow isn't perhaps all that internationally well known although he's appeared in a number of high profile Hollywood films such as The Exorcist and Three Days of the Condor.But he really shines in his native Scandinavian homeland especially under aspiring  inspiring directors such as Bergman  August. The great thing about Sydow is his quality  depth to play any character a director requires to me he is on a par with Olivier.In this Bille August adapted screenplay we witness the plight of a father Sydow and young son Pelle Hvenegaard looking for work in Denmark having sailed from their native home of Sweden at the turn of the 20th Century.Pelle initially idolises his father seeing him as his guardian where his life will be all play play  play. But the bitter reality is so different  they end up as cowhands for a wealthy country baron. Life is hard even for young boys and Pelle finds it doubly hard because he is picked on at school because he is a poor immigrant.Sydow is old  widowed a man who has had to work all his life yet his faith in God is undeterred even though he knows he can no longer live up to the young boy's eager expectations. For in spite of all his grandiose words to the boy about whipping those who beat him when he actually comes face to face with his superiors he crumbles  cowers all witnessed by a disbelieving Pelle.By the end of the film Pelle wants to leave this tortured existence and look for a new life in America yet his disillusioned father no longer has the strength or the will to follow his son's dreams.A quite remarkable film both in content  style. Everything is so underplayed yet so dynamic August doesn't have to try too hard to give his actors enough scope to understand their characters and neither does he have to underscore the grim  brutal realities of seeing immigrants ill treated.There are various examples where he could have gone into explicit detail in order to move us  shock us but he doesn't. Instead he pulls away from the edge and lets us imagine what may have happened.In addition the photography by Jrgen Persson is breathtaking especially the winter scenes of the farm and the nearby coast covered in ice. Persson also does a lot of fixed portrait shots of the leads spending 20 or 30 seconds framing a face while letting the music  other background noise fade so that there is nothing to distract us as we look into the eyes of the character on view.But the real honours have to go to the two male leads Sydow  gives his usual sterling performance as the downtrodden man who still tries to be his son's hero. One of most moving scenes is near the end where a blossoming romance with a middleaged woman comes to a dramatic conclusion and he turns to the demon drink and finally turns his back on God while his son looks on  pure genius  gut wrenching stuff!However even Sydow is placed in the shadows by the young boy Pelle Hvenegaard. It's as if the part was specially made for this talented youth especially with his facial looks  big eyes. The film doesn't overpower Hvenegaard he is not intimidated by the presence of the great Sydow or any of his elders. Instead he plays his own part with a great deal of innocent charm  maturity.  SPOILER Perhaps the most emotional scene of all is right at the end of the film where the boy finally realises that his father is not his saviour after all just a broken old man with a baggage of broken dreams. The boy has to move on and follow his own dreams in spite of Sydow begging him to stay. The last scene where they stand out in the snow covered field they shake hands before the boy leaves his father for a better future is truly gutwrenching  so moving! SPOILER END The film is not wildly available on tape of DVD but I urge you to see it if you can. You will be moved in so many different ways.".

	schema:reviewBody "At the end of the 19th century Lasse and Pelle father and son cross the sea separating Sweden from Denmark in pursuit of prosperity and happiness. Lasse a middleaged widower promises his son that in the new country there's work with high wages and 'kids are free all day.' It's the illusions of a hopeful emigrant. In reality they land in Denmark to work almost as slaves at a farm bound to the owner by a poorlypaid contract that doesn't allow them to leave until they've fulfilled its term.Bille August's Pelle The Conqueror is harsh. It's a movie about crushed illusions xenophobia class differences power economic submission and the cost of freedom. It's not an easy uplifting movie.There are two character studies at the center of the film. We've all met Lasse in our life. We all know someone who is cowardly but prone to boasting who complains about his boss but never stands up to him who drinks when life doesn't suit him who makes plans but never does anything to fulfill them. Max Von Sydow gives a great performance as Lasse he has that rare ability to subtly change his facial expressions from moment to moment which fits Lasse's mood swings and he speaks volumes just with his eyes. To play Lasse a frail middleaged man the actor adopts a stooped frame with slow movements accentuating his weakness. This is one of those rare performances when an actor loses himself in the role he's playing. Max Von Sydow alone is reason enough to watch this movie.Pelle Hvenegaard who was 13 at the time also gives an excellent performance. Pelle is the main character and Hvenegaard holds his ground when he shares a scene with the veteran actor. Pelle is his father's opposite introspective and a sharp observer. In the farm a lively man called Erik Bjrn Granath fills Pelle's head with new dreams about America and convinces him to save his money so the two can go together. It may turn out to be another disappointment but it's what keeps Pelle going. Unlike his father he hasn't lost hope.This is the conflict at the heart of the film. The scene the two actors share when Pelle asks his father to leave with him is an amazing example of acting contrasting the two personalities perfectly Lasse's fear of the unknown against Pelle's determination to change his life.Besides portraying this conflict the movie also captures the hardships and cruelty of the farm and community they live in. Right from the start they're discriminated for being Swedes whom the Danish forearm considers a dumb people fit only for manual work. The foreman dictates the terms he decides who can rest and when he threatens rebels like Erik with the police. Pelle's life is even worse because he can't get along with his schoolmates. His only friend is Rut the bastard son of farm owner and a local peasant. The movie is very critical of the ruling class too showing its indifference and aloofness. A quick subplot neatly demonstrates the consequences of a farm girl and the son of a landowner falling in love.Ironically the film is beautiful to look at especially when the camera lingers over endless icecovered fields. There's an atmosphere of stillness and peacefulness. Bille Auguste captures all the beauty of the landscape around the farm even if it's a deadly landscape where men can freeze to death during winter. Even when the movie is beautiful its ultimate message seems to be life is difficult.Pelle The Conqueror fascinates me because it's not a distant reality it depicts. Who doesn't know what it is to have dreams crushed because of circumstances beyond our control? To be afraid of taking a chance? To submit to and confront authority? To accept life's unexpected pleasures as they come to us? Lasse and Pelle two opposite approaches to life  resignation or hope  are always with us. This movie is harsh but not harsher than ordinary life.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pelle the Conqueror won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language film when it was originally released. Although I did not see it then it is certainly easy to see why it received that answer. It is an unsparing tale of the life of a Swedish immigrant father and son Max von Sydow and Pelle Hvenegaard who have come to Denmark following the death of wife and mother and found work as laborers on a farm in a desolate seaside landscape. It is to avoid giving details a terrible life. I'm told that this is a very thin slice from a fourvolume novel. So despite the film's 212 hour length what we're shown is a tiny piece of a much larger canvas. Max von Sydow a famous actor in his day is superb as the elderly father of young Pelle but the child's role is also very well acted and the direction by Bille August who also wrote the screenplay is unobtrusive but surehanded. Since it is set in the 19th Century there is nothing dated about this film. It is a masterwork.".

It is an unsparing tale of the life of a Swedish immigrant father and son Max von Sydow and Pelle Hvenegaard who have come to Denmark following the death of wife and mother and found work as laborers on a farm in a desolate seaside landscape. It is to avoid giving details a terrible life. I'm told that this is a very thin slice from a fourvolume novel. So despite the film's 212 hour length what we're shown is a tiny piece of a much larger canvas. Max von Sydow a famous actor in his day is superb as the elderly father of young Pelle but the child's role is also very well acted and the direction by Bille August who also wrote the screenplay is unobtrusive but surehanded. Since it is set in the 19th Century there is nothing dated about this film. It is a masterwork.";

Based on a four volume novel by Martin Andersen Nex the screenplay by writerdirector Bille August Per Olov Enquist and Bjarne Reuter granted takes only a small portion of the original story and that explains why so much of what happens in this 2 12 hour film is only vaguely explained but the end result is a marvelous drama of the relationship of a father Lassefar brilliantly realized by the venerable Max von Sydow who has pride but has not the courage of his convictions and a son Pelle a masterpiece of young acting by Pelle Hvenegaard who dreams of finding a life better than the bitterly poor existence he shares with the father he loves. The film takes place in Denmark near the turn of the 19th century over the course of a year and during that time the Pelle encounters peer prejudice from being a Swedish immigrant who has traveled to Denmark for the good life class distinction between the wealthy landowners and the poverty stricken workers the double standard of morals of the learned 'role models' death physical abuse young love between two lovely people who out of fear drown their infant at birth the harsh realities of gathering sustenance from laboring the land and the sea the bonds of true friendship with a bastard child of the land owner and the disappointment of losing hope of conquering the world by means of accompanying a friend who must remain a vassal for two years who becomes brain damaged in an alteration with the foreman. Yet through all of these lessons Pelle learns about the survival of the fittest and despite all odds being against him strikes out toward the frozen sea to await his ship of fortune. This is a film about dreams and realities about surviving physical and mental stresses about adapting to the seasons and the struggles of indentured life. The stench of the farm and the grace of the snowfields are captured with amazing perfection by cinematographer Jrgen Persson and the mood of this film's story is accompanied by the music of Stefan Nilsson. The cast is huge and uniformly excellent much due to the sensitive direction by Bille August. This is a classic film one that is enjoyed more with repeated viewings. This is definitely one for the home library. Breathtaking. Grady Harp".

However I am warning you that although it's worth seeing it's not a particularly pleasant filmas it's grim from start to finish...VERY VERY grim.The film is set in late 19th century Denmark. It begins with an older man Max Von Sydow and his young son Pelle arriving there from Sweden. According to the dad Denmark is a land of many opportunities and there life will be so much better than it had been back home. However soon they learn that life is dreadfully oppressive here in their new home. They are hired on as indentured servants of sortsand even the young boy must toil very hard on this farm. In some ways they are like slaves as the food is terrible the hours long and there is almost no let up to the bleakness of their lives. Many awful things happen through the course of the filmmurdered babies people getting pounded in the head by a large stone rapes and Pelle ultimately learns that through all this his father is a spineless wimp.This movie does seem to illustrate just how tough life was and does a great job of showing the lives of illiterate workers but it's also a real chore to stick with it. Lovers of art films will probably be able to stick around for the almost three hour running timemost of the rest will not. In many ways it reminds me of other Oscarwinners like The Last Emperor and The English Patientvery grim and miserable films. However at least with Pelle you actually care about the characterswhich makes it worth seeing IF you are very very patient. However if you are depressed at all do NOT watch the filmit might just push you over the edge.".

It premiered in Sweden and Denmark was screened In competition at the 41st Cannes International Film Festival in 1988 was shot on location in Sjlland and Bornholm in Denmark and is a SwedenDenmark coproduction which was produced by Danish producer Per Holst.

Both see father and son struggling to make a living. There it ceases.Almost all differences are in favour of Pelle. Will Smith' son is an annoying little Mr Knowall. Pelle is a real kid learning life lessons the hard way. Will Smith embodies the American Dream  his movie is not interested in all the thousands who fail. Von Sydow's Lasse Karlsson is one of those losers. Still he only wants a quiet old age. The Pursuit is a cheesy tearjerker constantly we are reminded of all the bad luck the set backs. The Pursuit rubs it in our face Will Smith and son are soooo pitiful! Lasse and Pelle Karlsson are not pitiful at all. They don't have time for it as they are too busy coping with their hard life.Consequently The Pursuit is a smooth movie inevitably leading to its happy end. The spectator is expected to rejoice after rooting for them. Being it so predictable I could not. Pelle is not smooth at all. In fact the script is not very consistent. Quite a few sidelines are not fully developed many characters remain vague. There are several open ends. That is the reason I don't give Pelle the full 10. But it is also true that the fragmentary story far better paints real life than all the Hollywood smoothness. We will never know how far Pelle will get conquering America. Indeed nor will his father.When comparing there is no question about acting cinematography and scenery. Pelle Erobreren shows why European movies can be so superior to Hollywood stuff notwithstanding the much smaller budgets. See The Pursuit and Pelle shortly after each other  you will see what I mean.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nearly 60 years old Max Von Sydow gives a stupendous performance. He played memorable roles in Ingmar Bergman's classics of the 60s. Afterwards he fared well in horror movies like The Exorcist. He certainly left impression other times if only upon the European audience. Yet in my opinion this is his best performance to date. He plays great failure to great success.The film offers a deep insight into the life of immigrants from one country of Scandenavia to the other. Strange though it may seem today in the wake of current superstardom of these countries in the arena of human development the story remains true in nature honest in details dedicated to truth.People man woman and child have always been traveling around looking for better things better conditions to live and to die in. This immigration factor is a part of human nature. A ritual as old as life itself. People leave their place only to establish themselves another place. They do this out of necessity for prosperity in search for love peace or health. They feel a pull towards their destination. Everything will be just fine there they think. They keep on dreaming with their eyes halfopen. Until they are made to open their eyes fully in the wake of reality. Lassefar keeps reminding himself he is not going to accept the first job offer he is going to look for better terms demand more. Still he is obliged to do exactly the opposite.From that point onwards destination achieved is no longer the promised land these weary immigrants had dreamed of. As it ceases to be their old dream it turns into their new reality. Often so harsh that it makes difficult for them to decide whether they are better or worse off. Their great expectations unfulfilled they begin to suffer and survive their new life. Miserable though they are they are not ready to give up their dreams and reluctant to abandon their origins. But this precisely is what process of establishment demands. Otherwise well they can not count on the kindness of strangers.So they have to make their choices. They have to set their priorities right. If they want to exist and not merely be. Therefore after a while or so a compromise takes place. The newcomers silently and gradually accept the norms of their new world. They learn new rules and practice to abide by them. At the same time they begin to give their origins away little by painful little. Some merely do not notice or pretend not to others resist the current. But all of them know.Even then they do not part with their beloved dreams. They sacrifice their past useless for them anyway for the future they think they have right to. They become even satisfied with their present. More at ease if one dares say that. Lassefar's plans of second marriage exemplify this behavior. Only thing needed to make the circle of immigrant life complete is the dream of a new and better world. Yet another promised land only more fertile in riches more extravagant in opportunities more splendid in every imaginable detail.They have sea awaiting at their doorsteps. Some day a ship will take them across it. To the other far side of the world. To America.".

	schema:reviewBody "While not quite as engaging as TINTIN ET LE MYSTERE DE LA TOISON D'OR1961 this adaptation is fun and silly enough to impress most children under 10 and adult fans. JeanPierre Talbot makes for an athletic Tintin and resembles the character physically which is what counts. Jean Bouise as Capitaine Haddock is rather silly and a lot more like the comic book character than his incarnation in the previous movieGeorge Wilson. The story is typical Tintin fare with adventure in exotic placesin this case Valencia Spain and over the top bad guys. For those of you not familiar with Tintin let's just say that every French speaking childand most European children under the age of 14 has been thrilled by his comic book adventures for over half a century. In this film we find our heroes and their friend Professeur Tournesol going to Spain to investigate the blue oranges of the title. After much toing and froing they expose the villains who have captured the professor and his Spanish colleague. A really funny moment occurs when Captain Haddock finds a bottle of whiskey and attempts to have a drink while Tintin tries to get him to check out the clues he has found. Anyone who has read a Tintin book knows that the good captain likes his drink and will try anything to have one. Overall silly but a lot of fun especially if you are young or young at heart. I give it 6 comic books out of 10.".

These blue oranges look great but they're just impossible to swallow. Fittingly enough the same can be said about the second opus of Tintin's liveaction adventures The Blue Oranges a film cruelly underwritten that can't be saved from mediocrity despite the efforts of JeanPierre Talbot the only good thing about the film along with Calculus.The film started well the bit with the real fake TV program set the tone and gave the blue orange a sort of realistic dimension contextualizing them with the issue of hunger in the world but it doesn't take too long before you know you'll have to tone down your quality I order to enjoy it and even then there's not much to enjoy. It's a real pity that Tintin and the Blue Oranges never really hold up to the coolness of its intriguing title. The film was made three years after the first one but I can see why it didn't do better at the boxoffice the first didn't benefit from an elaborate plot but it had a strong setup and a strong bond between Tintin and Haddock. In Orange Talbot's performance is somewhat ruined by the overacting of Jean Bouise as Captain Haddock a shame because the chemistry with George Wilson made the first film.Jean Bouise is a good actor but while George Wilson's overacting was never at the expenses of the story Bouise plays his Haddock as if he thought the captain was a previous commedia del arte actor amplifying every syllabus gesticulating for any reason and using any moment as an excuse for some loud baritone tantrums. His performance could have worked if the film was meant as a comedy but not when the other actors play their roles seriously. Felix Fernandex is a fine copy of Cuthbert Calculus but Bouise makes Calculus more endurable. Again this is less a comment on Bouise's talent as the man was notorious for playing dark and brooding characters but let's just say he didn't take the right angle.But it's not as if the story deserved the best acting anyway so maybe he's the one reason to watch the film after all. The film is a series of setups and comical premise that always fall flat the Thompson gags are pretty lame even by the days' standards. And when a young Spanish kid meets Tintin and says Tintin and Milou you've got to wonder how come he knows them since the film is set in a universe where Tintin isn't a comic book character. There are a few interesting moments the encounter with the Castafiore and the interactions between Professors Calculus and the Spanish professors provide a few interesting moments but the film doesn't even swim in the same waters than Golden Fleece.Don't get me started on the climax the whole plot leads to some evil emir and the intervention of a bunch of kids save the day and we're supposed to be laughing. I won't even mention the fact that being Moroccan I could spot the accent of the guys who were supposed to be from the Arab Peninsula. Anyway there's a sort of naivety in the film that could have been excusable if the plot wasn't so thin and if the first film was if the same caliber but overall comparing the two on the sole basis that they're liveaction adaptation of Tintin would be unfair these are apples and oranges and not blue one.".

	schema:headline " Unique thoughtful and stunning  a winner";
	schema:reviewBody "The Air I Breathe is stunning in many ways. It should be established right from the start that this is not a movie which allows you to check your brain at the door. It demands attention and thought. Director Jieho Lee and cowriter Bob DeRosa have crafted an intriguing work which leaves more questions than answers. And after all that is what art should aspire to do.The film is based on a Chinese proverb which says that life consists of four emotions Happiness Pleasure Sorrow and Love. To be whole one must experience each emotion and by doing so we are interconnected with all other human beings. The film itself is structured in the same fashion with each of four segments focusing on those ideas. The lead actors portray those emotions one by one. Forest Whitaker is Happiness Brendan Fraser is Pleasure Sarah Michelle Gellar is Sorrow and Kevin Bacon is Love. They anchor the four segments of the film while the rest of the magnificent ensemble cast weaves in and out of the narrative.The idea is somewhat fuzzy at first. This is an unconventional story with a similarly unique style. Unlike most films the major characters don't really have major arcs in story line or performance. While some may find a couple of the actors a bit deadpan they pretty much are solid throughout while consistent in their characterizations. Whitaker and Fraser especially fit that description. Both are quite stoic in their roles but that's what the story demands. Sarah Michelle Gellar may be the exception. She is the one who has to display a wide range of emotions more than the others. Her character is quite tortured and goes through a lot emotionally and physically. Gellar is a very brave actress who took risks and put her heart and soul into it. She is sure to surprise many people. Bacon is a delight and is perfectly cast as a wouldbe hero. Andy Garcia is a chilling and devilish nemesis throughout while Emile Hirsch provides some comic relief in his brief appearance.The script is filled with poetic statements hearkening back to the Chinese proverb on which the story is based. Each segment's main character provides voiceover. And while the language is somewhat oblique the dialogue is quite blunt and to the point.Visually it is breathtaking with broad sweeping images interspersed with numerous gritty closeups of tragedy. The Air I Breathe has the look of a big budget film although it is not. Watch for some fascinating visual effects. Handheld with closeups is used for some of the more chilling parts and creates tension. Hitchcock would be proud.Surprises occur at every step of the way. One of the most startling aspects of this film is that there are moments when one may think No that won't happen. And then it does. It's hard to watch at times and quite violent. There's sadness and tension. But there is also an amazingly clever use of humor in the film and that is perhaps what is most surprising. But that's what life is. The soundtrack plays a major role in this movie as if another character. It has an Asian feel not just because of the filmmaker's background but because the film is based on that Chinese proverb. It was quite haunting.The Air I Breathe is at its heart a character piece which follows a general theme. Seems simple. On the face of it it plays out like a crime drama. But there's more to it and it takes patience and thought to get to the point of it. Not everyone will be able to do that. But it is definitely worth the effort.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Air I Breathe is stunning in many ways. It should be established right from the start that this is not a movie which allows you to check your brain at the door. It demands attention and thought. Director Jieho Lee and cowriter Bob DeRosa have crafted an intriguing work which leaves more questions than answers. And after all that is what art should aspire to do.The film is based on a Chinese proverb which says that life consists of four emotions Happiness Pleasure Sorrow and Love. To be whole one must experience each emotion and by doing so we are interconnected with all other human beings. The film itself is structured in the same fashion with each of four segments focusing on those ideas. The lead actors portray those emotions one by one. Forest Whitaker is Happiness Brendan Fraser is Pleasure Sarah Michelle Gellar is Sorrow and Kevin Bacon is Love. They anchor the four segments of the film while the rest of the magnificent ensemble cast weaves in and out of the narrative.The idea is somewhat fuzzy at first.

Bacon Whitaker Gellar Fraser Garsia Hirch  what a nice choice for this movie! However if you are not really open minded you may not like their characters you may not like the plot but still you will love the acting. Persuasive smart and well done. That's how I would rate the crew members of this movie.This leads to n awfully understandable conclusion  The Air I Breathe is actually one of the best movies I have seen this year only 25 Hour moved me more.. Even after seeing Ed's 25 Hour i was quick to state that crimedrama is from now on my most favorite genre of the movie.

It was touching and moving in so many ways and they way it all made sense in the end was simply brilliant. There is not one scene where I thought the creators have added in something mediocre or unnecessary and there was not one scene where I pressed the pause button to do something for I could not stop watching it.It shows how everyones' lives all intertwine in some way and how one person's honest actions can affect the life of another who honestly needs help when they can't find it anywhere else and it is honestly as beautiful and worth the watch as I am making it sound honest. This is a mustsee I recommend it for everyone and usually the haters have to complain about how boring and confusing it is while I found it at the right pace to keep your attention and understood everything the film meant for us to understand along the way.".

After seeing it over three times i can really say it is a very great film. The Acting is phenomenal and Sarah Michelle Gellar gives her best performance to date. She really shows what she is capable of. She portrays the right signs of Sorrow. Andy Garcia was also great. The direction from a first time director was really amazing. The were a lot of beautiful scenes great cinematography. It is a pleasure to watch. Some of the songs played are kinda cheesy but those songs go away fast. BUT the score is truly amazing. It totally captures the right feel that the film portrayed. The film should have been longer. It was only 90 minutes it was very fast paced. They should have shown more screen time with Gellar and Bacon. The rushed feeling has a positive side to it. The film never gets boring. It grabs you completelyand for some people that is what they want. Yes the biggest problem is the screenplay which at times seems silly some of the dialogue but the film also has powerful moments and some GREAT dialoguesort of like the 2004 film Crash. Overall I have fallen in love with it. It is very underrated and some of the negative feedback it has received is not worth it. See it expect flaws but see it expecting something big something about human complexity and you will not be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "It starts off well with the first of four vignettes pulled through by an outstanding acting job by Forest Whitaker. The second vignette is OK because Andy Garcia does a great job as the villain. But Geller is once again sadly disappointing and by the middle of the movie it starts to disintegrate. By the last act it is so full of plot holes it's like a piece of moldy Swiss cheese.Kevin Bacon is supposed to be an emergency room doctor but acts like someone being electrocuted while having a tantrum. A woman he loves has been bitten by a snake and he clearly has no real idea about how to handle the situation  can he be that incompetent? Some research tech is screaming at him that she must have a transfusion within 24 hours or she will die. But she isn't even given an IV. He runs around screaming at everyone supposedly trying to find this rare blood type but this is not the first line of defense for Russel's viper envenomation. It would not have been that difficult to make this episode realistic but nothing short of a Valium transfusion would have saved Bacon's character. A transfusion is obtained and she is magically transformed into the picture of health. There's a monitor but she doesn't even have a line in I guess they ditched realism for the ooh gosh wow picture of the monitor. Funny how that monitor doesn't even seem to be attached to the patient. This is the kind of thing you would expect in an ultra low budget flick. Most people have been to a hospital and know things just don't work that way.It's not just the technical medical aspects that are botched. Geller is well protected by all kinds of bodyguards but in spite of her being in a clearly precarious state of mental health all attendants melt away to allow her to climb out on the roof in an attempted suicide. Nobody notices she is missing. And Bacon runs up what must be at least 40 flights of stairs again suddenly unmolested by the previously ubiquitous bodyguards who have conveniently disappeared. He arrives with no sign of fatigue and rescues Geller in what has to be one of the hokiest scenes ever to make it into a movie. It's just so poorly acted and set up as to make the entire sequence laughable especially the diaphanous garment taking flight at the end. This is pure corn by this point. I was hoping they would just come crashing down and the movie would end.Then Geller who has just attempted an act of suicide is discharged without any apparent evaluation. It's OK because Bacon and Geller hugged each other so she's just fine and ready for a casual discharge. They aren't even trying to make this believable anymore.A cheesy bow tie follows to wrap the movie up and try to integrate the vignettes. At least the epilogue was over quickly.".

Nobody notices she is missing. And Bacon runs up what must be at least 40 flights of stairs again suddenly unmolested by the previously ubiquitous bodyguards who have conveniently disappeared. He arrives with no sign of fatigue and rescues Geller in what has to be one of the hokiest scenes ever to make it into a movie. It's just so poorly acted and set up as to make the entire sequence laughable especially the diaphanous garment taking flight at the end. This is pure corn by this point. I was hoping they would just come crashing down and the movie would end.Then Geller who has just attempted an act of suicide is discharged without any apparent evaluation. It's OK because Bacon and Geller hugged each other so she's just fine and ready for a casual discharge. They aren't even trying to make this believable anymore.A cheesy bow tie follows to wrap the movie up and try to integrate the vignettes. At least the epilogue was over quickly.";

	schema:reviewBody "Firsttime director Jieho Lee has brought us the next installment of the multiple stories genre threaded together as though fate and coincidence are the name of the game. This type of narrative has been around for a long time most definitely before Robert Altman's Short Cuts but at least there is an example from 15 years ago and I can't rack the brains for an earlier one at this time. The most well known to those out there today is of course Oscarwinner Crash. Lee's The Air I Breathe based on an ancient Chinese proverb that life can be broken down into the four emotional cornerstones of Happiness Pleasure Sorrow and Love is not as good as Haggis' film and I think even that one is overrated. It's not that I disliked this one I actually found a lot that I really loved unfortunately there's more that feels overdone overwritten and absolutely unrealistic. One thing you can't fault it for however is the superb cast and acting.Some of the dialogue is almost too obvious at times having answers repeat all the words in the questionjust a bad redundancy as though the audience might not comprehend a short answer. These characters are so important in the scheme of each other's lives that everything out of their mouths needs to be so well crafted that it becomes stiff. The delivery though is almost consistently superb. Brendan Fraser is great in a rare serious role the kind of stuff that began his career. Very stoic and deliberate in all he does you begin to feel for him as the stone faade starts to falter. Due to the storystructure going out of order we see some of this emotional evolution before the catalyst for it but once that event occurs it makes everything before it make more sense and I actually think it was handled well as a result. Even his ability to see the future was utilized in a realistic way that it never felt like a gimmick just a skill he had and used. The best actor again as almost always is Forest Whitaker as a bythebooks successful man who has finally realized that his pristine life is devoid of true happiness. No material needs can fill the void of actually living whether living wealthy or poorly it is the act of adventure and excitement that is necessary to enjoy. His final reaction of pure adulation is the best part of the film and it happens about twenty minutes in.One would think that a story as involving as this would have pretty equal billing for all roles but that is not true. Whitaker and Kevin Bacon are underused while Fraser is involved at almost every turn. Andy Garcia however is the one that stays the most constant throughout. As a hardnosed bookiegangster nicknamed Fingers Garcia shines something that usually doesn't occur with him of late. He is good at this type of role and it was nice to see him sink his teeth into it. Even Sarah Michelle Gellar had her moments although few to show that maybe she can do more than ScoobyDoo and every year's Japanese horror remake. Mention also needs to go to Clark Gregg in a small but funny role and Emile Hirsch as Garcia's nephew appearing to be a pawn to the plot but in actuality becomes a role with payoff.As far as the style went I can't complain too much. The correlations between each thread is well conceived if not totally contrived to benefit the story. I enjoyed the transitions especially at the start with multiple layers and progressions. I can't quite recall if that is the only part in which it was used though. The music was also a help very Explosions in the Skylike the score enhanced each moment it was used. In the end the film just couldn't keep its bloated heavyhanded script up. Even utilizing the four emotions as vignette titles something used similarly in the superior The Dead Girl was so obvious that it became laughable. Each instance made you know first thing that they will be the exact opposite of that title despite the lead thinking they werehappiness was really depression pleasure was really regret sorrow was really vanity and love was desperation. Every emotion is more of a backhanded overview that is manipulated in order to serve the tale rather than allowing the tale to serve the emotions that are supposed to be backboning it.".

How did they? How much blood did Gina need to save her life. If it was a total blood transfusion could blood from one person then save her life and how much blood can one person really spare? All these questions and many more will be answered in the next episode of Soap.I could go on for ever with flaws from this movie but that would be a never ending story. You can fill a movie with poetry but when you don't believe the actors and the script is bad and filled up with clichs this poetry only becomes an empty shell of nothing.No if you want to see the real deal you could try Amores Perros out  here with a believable Garcia  no not Andy but Gael Garcia Bernal and no this is not made in Hollywood  thank God for that.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Air I Breathe 2008 12Kinetic Pretentiousness from the word go. Lee has some directorial skills but its painfully obvious that he thinks The Air I Breathe is some kind of ultra important and transcendental masterpiece. Its not. Now pretentious movies are occasionally fine and can sometimes be even good. But when such a movie thinks its so great well that is just a deadly recipe. There is nothing in The Air I Breathe that you can't find in a run of the mill after school special. Its not nearly as intelligent as it would have you believe and far more shallow than it even realizes. The film is fairly well made as far as physically putting a picture together but in terms of writing this thing is a mess. Its only half decent line shows up on the opening title card credited to 19th century American clergyman Henry Ward Beecher. Even it comes off heavy handed especially as the film goes on. The first line of actual dialogue comes soon after spoken by Happiness Forrest Whitaker pondering whether or not a caterpillar realizes how beautiful it becomes when it morphs into a butterfly. Its a cringeworthy line that may have sounded good on paper in a second rate poem but heard aloud its nearly almost laughable. There are a number of such lines scattered throughout the film. There are also scenes of the same nature  i.e. a laughing and camera spinning Forrest Whitaker after he's cornered for robbing a bank. Or maybe a scene thats meant for laughs in which Andy Garcia's Finger's You should ask him why he's called that and a partner groove to Trista's new track Aka Sorrow aka Sarah Michelle Gellar. These kinds of scenes are rarely funny and there is no exception here. The film's saving grace if it can be called that is that it is broken down into 4 segments based on a Chinese proverb regarding the emotions happiness pleasure sorrow and love. The first happiness is Whitaker as a pencil pusher who gets in deep with mobster Fingers. Second is pleasure following Finger's enforcer and seer of the future Brendan Fraser. He's put in task of taking care of Fingers' trouble prone nephew Tony Emile Hirsch. This segment is the best and probably the only one I would give a pass. Third Sorrow follows new pop sensation and her relationship with Fraser's mob enforcer and the trouble their relationship brings. Finally love follows a doctor trying to save a friend he loves deeply. Given that Happiness and Love begin and end the film their serious weaknesses damage the film. I was looking to come around after Pleasure but was only slowly let down by Sorrow and slammed into the ground by Love. Lee may have an interesting future ahead of him maybe. His direction is physically solid even if it is nothing unique and thematically soso. He's clearly a product of modern filmmaking which I must say is becoming rather boring in all of its hyperness. This is not a lazy film nor is it without ambition. But that is no excuse for its pretentiousness or its bad writing. I hope that Lee can make something better in the future. His direction suggests he can make good  not great  but good films given the right script. That is if he can get over his own back patting stage to realize what he thinks is profound is actually rather banal.".

That is if he can get over his own back patting stage to realize what he thinks is profound is actually rather banal.";

	schema:reviewBody "The first question that would come to mind would be whether Carol Kane could play a psycho successfully. And after seeing this film I would have to say I still don't know because the very tame screenplay didn't allow her to be a well developed psychotic nor did it allow any other sort of development for any other aspect of this film.The storyline here is very typical. It involves Carol Kane with very odd penciled in eyebrows as an awkwardly mousy hardworking magazine editor in a drab and depressing looking office building where she gets picked on daily. Then without any time wasted the inevitable psycho switch gets flipped and she starts killing off her coworkers.I know that may sound to most like your typical fun slasher but in fact it can't even be considered a slasher. Actually I really don't know what genre to categorize this film in because it dips it's toes in a couple different subgenres without ever fully concentrating on any one area therein lying the problem. The resulting film just doesn't quite work. At the start it seemed to be heading into satire territory with office politics and such but quickly falls flat because of a major lack of humor. As it went on it then seemed I was in for a slasher but all of the murders take place off screen giving us no chase sequences creative deaths or gore. Then I expected it to take a turn into suspense but was left with no tension or any sort of character development whatsoever so I never cared for anyone or anything enough to ever get involved in the storyline. The writers just didn't seem to know what they really wanted which kind of left the final product in limbo. And it's pretty disappointing because the photographer turned director Cindy Sherman seemed to have talent and would have benefited greatly if it were a straight up thriller.So what were we meant to feel during this film? It wasn't smart funny thrilling or even bloody. Were we supposed to hate and fear Kane? Or were we supposed to root for her? The whole film felt just as awkward as she looked and felt just as drab and boring as the office building looked which leaves us with no reason to ever want to visit. I would compare this to later films such as Love Object and the Willard remake both of which used the same plot techniques yet executed them in a much more entertaining fashion. Office Killer isn't a terrible film. I give the director and cast credit for trying. But it's just so lifeless that I can't recommend you wasting your time with it.".

The lessthanimpressive results Robert Longo's Johnny Mnemonic David Salle's Search and Destroy Julian Schnabel's Basquiat and finally Cindy Sherman's Office Killer. That only Schnabel moved on to direct a second feature says a lot about these poor directorial choices. Surprise  just because you can paint a picture or take a photograph doesn't mean you know how to make a movie.That said Office Killer has a unique look to it Sherman's photographic eye makes for some nice creepy compositions even if her philosophy about using a camera cinematically is of the boltittothegroundandmaybepanalittle school. And she works well with cinematographer Russell Fine though the whole film is shot through a murky lens that had this viewer crying out for the occasional bright exterior just to add a little contrast.So what went wrong with Office Killer? Well pretty much what you'd predict would go wrong with a photographer director who had never made a film before uneven pacing more attention paid to the setup of a shot than to what's going on in it a lack of tension and a cast who with the exception of the everwilling Carol Kane don't seem to know what to do. Aware that they're working for a famous photographer they quietly obey even while Sherman clearly has little experience in working with actors. Michael Imperioli and Jeanne Tripplehorn have been far better elsewhere Barbara Sukowa is flatout bad and Molly Ringwald is her usual depthless self. The script is also somewhat leaden given its dark comic potential.Office Killer is still a curiosity interesting mainly for aficionados of Cindy Sherman's work and you've got to admire those cool opening credits though horror fans who enjoyed the betterreceived May which I personally didn't care for might like this movie's look and mood. As for me I couldn't shake off the feeling that this is the product of a bunch of chuckling New York hipsters who thought they were doing something postmodern and ironic but only churned out something uninspired and limp... albeit artsy.".

Her adult acting ventures have not panned out so well for her. And I am not saying she is a bad actress but after her John Hughes years she will have to do more than appear in one or two disposable films to recreate herself.And does Carol Kane age? I had always believed she was older in Princess Bride but now know she was only 35 and therefore 45 here. I am not sure if I am impressed by her lack of aging or dismayed that she has always looked 60 years old...But as far as the film goes I just did not think it was that great. There was some humor but nothing that really hit me I have seen other comments from people who think it is funny but I disagree. The dead body effects are decent but there is just something about the film quality that gives off an amateur effect and makes the whole thing seem poor. And I do not mind independent films if they are done right so it is not just the cheap look but something about how it comes across here. Not my cup of tea.".

These are pretty much all the kills anyway and they're the bloodiest and most brutal ones. The only other part to this is a few mildly interesting stalking scenes. The confrontation in the hallway with the choking and being unable to see the stalker makes it come off nicely and the finale in the basement is fine gets a little better when the lights go out and overall is pretty tense and bloody. These few moments give the film it's only good points.The Bad News There wasn't a whole lot wrong with this one since there wasn't much to it. The mere fact that outside of the gore and the aforementioned stalking scenes at all really happens. This one here is pretty dull and boring as most of the time is spent on running the magazine and everyone reacting to the ranting and raving of the boss which is not all that interesting or leads to anything which produces any excitement. This mostly comes because this one doesn't really seem all sure whether or not as a comedy which several scenes tend to throw out such as the gathering of corpses in the basement or the treatment at the office missing only a laughtrack to signal the humor. The black humor in here hardly gives us any big laughs. There are a couple of scenes which are mildly amusing but nothing in here manages to really evoke the laughs it was going for and it utterly fails as a comedy. These failed attempts at humor only succeed in making this one even more dull and boring than it already is.The Final Verdict Without much about it that really stands out for this one and a couple flaws there's not a whole lot to this one worth mentioning.

	schema:reviewBody "Conceptual portraitist Cindy Sherman made her directorial debut and only narrative film to date with 'Office Killer' 1997. Sherman in her work has continually sought to challenge and raise important questions about the role and representation of women in society and media. It is interesting that she has stated a major influence in her film is Dario Argento who has a negative reputation so far as his portrayal of women is concerned. Sherman tells the tale of 'Doreen Douglas' a plain and unassuming office worker. During a period of economic rationalization she is forced to work from home in more ways than one. Doreen cares for her mother at home she was accidentally responsible for her father's death and is at work is the kind of longtime employee who often ends up being relegated to menial tasks by virtue of her being the only one able to do them. A tsunami of office infighting is happening resulting in nobody liking each other very much and they're all coming down with the flu. When Doreen accidentally kills a male coworker while putting in overtime at the office she stumbles headlong into murder as empowerment tool. Before long the magazine is understaffed and Doreen has a basement full of corpses with their rotting fingers taped to their keyboards. While a failure as the satire it was meant to be 'Office Killer' demonstrates the impact of Argento's work on horror cinema generally and interestingly here on feminist cinema. In addition to traumatic childhood flashbacks we have a roll call of Argento stylistic influences with the primary colours tracking shots asymmetrical framing dark shadows foregrounding of objects empty buildings after dark and of course the pussycats.".

	schema:headline " Good!!";
	schema:reviewBody "The opening credits are awesome!! I just love the way they bring the names out while that great music is playing. I really want to get my hands on the soundtrack. Short sweet and amazing actress Carol Kane plays Dorine Douglas a lonely middle aged woman who is buried under big sweaters clunky shoes and over sized glasses. She keeps to herself barely talking to anyone and cringes at the slightest touch. Dorine lives alone with her elderly mother who is basically handicapped. Dorine works at Constant Consumer magazine which she has been working for the past 16 years. Dorine along with many if not all employees have been down sized to part timers due to a lack in funds. Dorine now has to work at home from her laptop. The last night at the office Dorine runs into computer trouble and seeks help from one of her coworkers. A jerk who hates everything about her Gary tries his best to make her feel uncomfortable and succeeds. After she returns from the bathroom Dorine notices that Gary has been accidentally electrocuted. Here is where it all begins!! Instead of telling the police Dorine takes his corpse to her house and sets him on a sofa in her basement. Now of course it's normal for one to think that this lady has got serious issues right from the get go but as the movie progresses you should tell yourself that words like 'crazy' and 'psycho' are total understatements. Dorine begins to feel a form of comfort for her loneliness after killing her boss and another coworker along with a pair of 7 year old girl scout cookie sellersWhich I think was very screwed up. She sets each body in the basement and begins to talk to them and giggle to herself as if the dead people are talking back. Issues people....ISSUES!! We soon learn that Dorine's strangeness and discomfort comes from being sexually abused by her father when she was young. In one of the flashback scenes we see that Dorineas a childhas killed her father. Anyway Doreen comes home one day and finds her elderly mother has diedNo she didn't do it!but the way Doreen screams to her mom after her mom dies is priceless. I love the way she goes from Mommy don't go away...!! to I don't care...you and Daddy can dance in hell alright...hahahahaha!! in a split second. Man does this woman have major issues or what?! Molly Ringwald plays Kim a coworker who despises Dorine and is friends with coworker NorahTripplehorn. Is it very obvious that Kim doesn't like Dorine and it turns to a brutal fight in the stairwell once Kim has been fired from her job. Kim manges to escape Dorine's attempt to strangle her. Mean while Norah begins to befriend Dorine and on their way to have lunch Dorine knocks Norah out and drags her home to the basement. Norah's boyfriend comes looking for her and heads to Dorine's house. He hears a noise in the basement. Dorine runs down there before he can and locks the door behind her. Norah runs to Dorine and freaks out when Dorine realizes Norah's secret Norah is the reason why work is going bad. Norah has been secretly stealing money from the company thus causing the job cuts. Norah tries to escape and her boyfriend manages to break in the basement. Dorine kills him and after a long struggle ends up killing Norah as well. The ending was a bit weak and could've been better but that's just my opinion. Carol Kane delivers one of the best performances I've ever seen!! I don't think an actor can portray a crazypsychotic person as convincing as Kane did. You can't help but feel sorry for Dorine even after she goes on her killing spree. This movie was well acted and the plot although silly at times was good over all. After watching this movie I can only say that I hope no one tries to ever mess with quiet mousy people. You just never know.".

To my surprise this movie has quite a few familiar faces such as Carol Kane When A Stranger Calls Molly Ringwald The Breakfast Club and Jeannie Tripplehorn Basic Instinct.The plot seemed interesting enough a mousey employee goes on a killing spree when she's handed her pink slip at the office. The tone is surprisingly light Carol Kane plays her part well as down trodden would be serial killer Doreen without going over the top and I really enjoyed Molly Ringwald as the bitchy secretary whose sole purpose is to be a total bitch.But some aspects of this movie simply doesn't work like the comedy element is almost entirely humourless the characters are plain and boring and didn't feel for them when they got killed. I would have liked this movie to go a lot darker and the killings to be a lot more innovative instead they were just boring and lacked any thrills.All in all not a terrible waste of time but is kind of forgettable which makes this movie very average but seeing familiar faces in a movie like this is always fun.".

So we get to see her murder a bunch of people just one after the other and it's well there is no right adjective. It's not funny because people are dying gory deaths it's not shocking because well look at this thing but it is pretty good. I believe it's kind of a tongueincheek kind of thing and I believe it's working. Carol Kane also plays her role very well helped by the screenplay that's gradually making her character meaner. At one point she encounters some girl scouts selling cookies. What follows is just not cool. Well maybe a little. I'm also really digging this ending.

They just play as the game is supposed to be played.It is fantasy in that it lets you suspend realism for a moment and dwell on the things we take for granted many times laughter romance and childlike innocence.

In fact it is one of the most original movies I've seen lately.Directed in a superb way by the inventive Yann Samuell this film can make you laugh out loud in a minute and shed some tears on the next due to the extreme complexity of the feelings the director and the actors share with you. Nothing in this film seems exaggerated it's a fairy tale of our time with a great dose of realism.The chemistry between Guillaume Canet and Marion Cotillard is simply perfect.Whether you like it or not it's difficult to be indifferent to this movie and this is one of the best compliments a director can receive.".

It has much of the same Pierre et Giles aesthetic that made the other film so memorable and the child actors also display a similarly remarkable complexity that is so rare when they are usually depicted in film.Very rarely does a film have the capacity to surprise me this much  either with the usually predictable storyline or when trying to understand the character's motivations etc. But this film continually had me reeling when trying to get a grip on it and in the end just when I thought it was a predictable love story...!! For this reason alone I found it a most remarkable film and I would strongly recommend seeing it.This film will not appeal to lovers of mainstream American cinema  it is too intelligent in the way it challenges our usual expectations. We usually expect to finish watching a film and have no questions  to have everything wrapped up nice and neatly so we can get on with our lives.If you do not want to suddenly find yourself asking Pour quoi? a week later or waking up with the haunting refrains of the unique renditions of the Piaf song in your head then I would suggest you rent a more predictable movie.However if you like being alternately surprised delighted and haunted by a unique film and wonderful soundtrack  check this one out.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first feature from French director Yann Samuell is an expressionistic allegory about love disguised as a romantic fantasy. It is about how in our relationships we never outgrow childhood games or fully recover from the insecurities caused by deep childhood wounds. It is about how people in love constantly test each other. Each dare is a renewed demand for the other person to prove their love no matter what the sacrifice.Love Me If You Dare is a gimmick translation of Jeux d'enfants a better translation would be Games of Children. But given the general confusion about this film by English speaking viewers and critics the inaccurate title is probably appropriate. Film Theory 101 would include a discussion of the two basic film extremes realism and expressionism. Generally the closer a film comes to reproducing reality the less room there is for the filmmaker to express his artistry. Which is not to say that realism is necessarily less manipulative than expressionism both aim to effect their viewing audience expressionism is just less constrained.When you are used to a steady diet of Hollywood realism it is difficult to switch gears and watch a film like Jeux d'enfants without attempting to force it into the realism mold. The temptation is to gloss over the surreal elements and to take everything you see literally. But Samuell has a background as an illustrator and designer. Note the inventive visuals that employ a multitude of cardboard cutouts and idyllic fantasy settings. This is expressionism. Note the accelerated action segments and strange transitions. This is expressionism. Note the interesting time passage montages and flashbacks.While you sometimes see similar stuff incorporated into a realistic film it is explained away as a dream hallucination or memory. Here it is a tipoff that this is a surreal allegory like Bunuel's The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie. If you avoid taking Jeux d'enfants too literally stop being judgmental about the actions and motivations of its characters and focus instead on picking up its allegorical elements you will probably understand it better and enjoy it more.Then again what do I know?

If we analyze his powerful script he wants lovers to find their true love since they can do this only once in a lifetime. He encourages us to believe that the more time passes the more powerful the relationship is and that's why he cuts out the classic foundation of love at the first sight and makes fun of it. Everything is OK up to here but his plot only lacks in reality where it was necessary to bind destiny with love. Afterwards this question stays unanswered If we decide to stay loyalin heart to our first love without believing in destiny and keep returning to himher after failed relationship trials to heal our wounds how can we know heshe is our true love?. I'll add this question to discussion board under A Study of Love  Destiny.Romance movies never makes sense for me as romance novels do. Although we have a senseful and sensible story beginning in this one. There is a 7 yearold girl named Sophie who is known as a very killjoyproudindifferent child. Across the heart there is a nasty but very sensitive 7 yearold boy named Juline both going to the same elementary school. Julien meets with Sophie while her friends making offcolor humour with her. He gives a care for her but she doesn't even take a blind bit of notice at first. Though afterwards when she realizes that she can have fun with him all the time she starts spending time with him day by day. At age 7 they start a game of gameness which will last for a lifetime.For their unity had begun by means of games one day at age 17 Sophie left Julien challenging him to question how can she be sure that he's seriously in love with her. By that time Julien hadn't realized that Sophie was having maturational crisis. Yet in Jeux d'enfants the methods of communication through love is so impressive that sooner or later they both understand that they're meant for each other. There are signature scenes and moments in between their reunion times with an excellent transfer of Surrealism into storyboard sequences.Even though they both betrayed on each other they keep their game just like keeping a secret deep in their hearts. This became crucial to accept when the social and sociological obstacles happened to put an end to their game. Whereas they realize the meaning of love is to go after your lover no matter how hard the situation is. They put an end to their life together at the end to be able to stay loyal to their game.".

The story starts like a childhood gameJulien and Sophie were first nonsexual buddies since they both were eight and they were already then linked by strange symbols of their friendshiplike an old box which is actually more than a simple object to both of themit will play an important part in the filmsomewhat like Kane's Rosebudand a game they both inventedstarting with the question cappas capapproximate translations are you in or notwant to play or notgame on or notbefore every unimportant and crucial decisionturning their entire lives into a gamea beta challenge in between doing or not doing several mostly outrageousthings. Years go by andlike in Wuthering Heightsto which this film is considered to be a contemporary versiontheir relationship becomes gradually lovehatesort of oneless because there was a real sexual or sentimental chemistry between them and more becausejust like in Wuthering Heights they were close to each othercloser even more than their own parentsand kindred spirits since their childhood. But they gradually have to discover that what was permitted to them as childrenthough even then their were occasionally bullied by parents and teachers due to their game and other curiositiesbecomes increasingly impossible for them as teens or young adultsthat real life is not a game but a tough struggle for survival.They try to get together but something has changedthey don't manage to stay together foe longa series of both objective and subjective factors are causing their separationand while he seriously considers to flee to Afganistan and become fundamentalist Moslemhe is evenfor a very short moment depicted as a sort of Bin Ladenthis is one of the reasons why the film is brilliantartyso Europeanbecause it involves framestoriesdisruptedalternative plotsshe starts an affair with a strugglingunknown and poor footballplayerwhom she doesn't love. A few years pass andin spite of their wildstrange personalities they are both involved in a bourgeoisdecentrespectable sorts of lifestylesyessometimes not even the most bohemian can't escape itJulienwho dreamed in his childhood of becoming a tyrantis now marrieda father and has a lot of debts to pay years ahead for the house and cars bought for his growing familySophie on the other hand has married the footballplayer who is now an international star like Beckhamrich and famousyet Sophie doesn't find the slightest satisfaction neither in her marriage nor her new wealth. Both have ended up exactly the opposite of what they once wanted to be and both of them dreamor rather desperately cravefor reteaming. Julien's monologue as he is driving towards aprobably selfinflictedaccident is summing up his relationship with Sophiein a crescendo that lasts several minuteshis final sentence before the crash beingbetter than liferelevant because it's also one of the titles of this film and it perfectly sums up their relationshipwhich was to both more important than the instinct of selfpreservation. Since the accident had only mild consequences they decide that every great gift needs a boxa wrapping andjust as they played with famous old box in their childhood they resolve to be wrapped up together for eternity...in a box of concrete. With a last cappas cap they both acceptcap!for a last time to conclude their game while descending into a pit soon to be filled up with concreteit seems that French cinema usually ends a love story with both characters willingly dying togethersee Jules et Jim or Mayerling. This final scene was for me the most disturbingand probably it is so even to a viewer with macabredark tastes andor least instinct of selfpreservationlater on I realized that it was surrealisticfairly impossible off screen there are several constructionworkers shown while deliberately pouring concrete on themin real life a worker who would do that would lose his job and be charged with murder. Though at first I was unconsciously appalledheckdamned instinct named above!I then realized that the scene was rather symbolical than a true outcomebeing also named love me if you darethis film is a metaphor about the price and rewards of love in love one must dare to accept every challengeeven deathto eventually find fulfillment. Daring also involves not losing the childlike fantasy beyond any reason at whatever the costfor instance the characters in The Cement GardenTwistand Shout or Zappaother beautifully deep European films about coming of agesimilarly unleash disasterbut without bad intentionsrather an overreactedyet natural unconsciousness. At a closer lookthe endingwith the same old box symbolically crowning the concrete boxmight even be considered a victory of unrestrainedinnocently unaltered love over pettybourgeois moralityof fantasy and imagination of the tyranny of real lifeafter all our definitions of what's rightof the values we're servingof reason and morality might be wrong. This is why the film has been called poor man's Amelie due to its understatedunusual sort of optimismespecially Julien's life would have been worse than deathhad he survivedboth without the woman he loved and with his childhood dream shattered for goodthis is the way many people are slowly dying as human tools of the consumerist worldwithout daring to break free. In fact this film might be paralleled also to The Royal Gamea screenplay of Stefan Zweig's brilliant short story where a chessmatch becomes an issue far more important some might expector to Alexis Zorba or The Old Man and the Sea for its messagelikewhat a splendid catastrophe or you can kill a man but not defeat him.".

The story starts like a childhood gameJulien and Sophie were first nonsexual buddies since they both were eight and they were already then linked by strange symbols of their friendshiplike an old box which is actually more than a simple object to both of themit will play an important part in the filmsomewhat like Kane's Rosebudand a game they both inventedstarting with the question cappas capapproximate translations are you in or notwant to play or notgame on or notbefore every unimportant and crucial decisionturning their entire lives into a gamea beta challenge in between doing or not doing several mostly outrageousthings. Years go by andlike in Wuthering Heightsto which this film is considered to be a contemporary versiontheir relationship becomes gradually lovehatesort of oneless because there was a real sexual or sentimental chemistry between them and more becausejust like in Wuthering Heights they were close to each othercloser even more than their own parentsand kindred spirits since their childhood. But they gradually have to discover that what was permitted to them as childrenthough even then their were occasionally bullied by parents and teachers due to their game and other curiositiesbecomes increasingly impossible for them as teens or young adultsthat real life is not a game but a tough struggle for survival.They try to get together but something has changedthey don't manage to stay together foe longa series of both objective and subjective factors are causing their separationand while he seriously considers to flee to Afganistan and become fundamentalist Moslemhe is evenfor a very short moment depicted as a sort of Bin Ladenthis is one of the reasons why the film is brilliantartyso Europeanbecause it involves framestoriesdisruptedalternative plotsshe starts an affair with a strugglingunknown and poor footballplayerwhom she doesn't love. A few years pass andin spite of their wildstrange personalities they are both involved in a bourgeoisdecentrespectable sorts of lifestylesyessometimes not even the most bohemian can't escape itJulienwho dreamed in his childhood of becoming a tyrantis now marrieda father and has a lot of debts to pay years ahead for the house and cars bought for his growing familySophie on the other hand has married the footballplayer who is now an international star like Beckhamrich and famousyet Sophie doesn't find the slightest satisfaction neither in her marriage nor her new wealth. Both have ended up exactly the opposite of what they once wanted to be and both of them dreamor rather desperately cravefor reteaming. Julien's monologue as he is driving towards aprobably selfinflictedaccident is summing up his relationship with Sophiein a crescendo that lasts several minuteshis final sentence before the crash beingbetter than liferelevant because it's also one of the titles of this film and it perfectly sums up their relationshipwhich was to both more important than the instinct of selfpreservation. Since the accident had only mild consequences they decide that every great gift needs a boxa wrapping andjust as they played with famous old box in their childhood they resolve to be wrapped up together for eternity...in a box of concrete. With a last cappas cap they both acceptcap!for a last time to conclude their game while descending into a pit soon to be filled up with concreteit seems that French cinema usually ends a love story with both characters willingly dying togethersee Jules et Jim or Mayerling. This final scene was for me the most disturbingand probably it is so even to a viewer with macabredark tastes andor least instinct of selfpreservationlater on I realized that it was surrealisticfairly impossible off screen there are several constructionworkers shown while deliberately pouring concrete on themin real life a worker who would do that would lose his job and be charged with murder. Though at first I was unconsciously appalledheckdamned instinct named above!I then realized that the scene was rather symbolical than a true outcomebeing also named love me if you darethis film is a metaphor about the price and rewards of love in love one must dare to accept every challengeeven deathto eventually find fulfillment. Daring also involves not losing the childlike fantasy beyond any reason at whatever the costfor instance the characters in The Cement GardenTwistand Shout or Zappaother beautifully deep European films about coming of agesimilarly unleash disasterbut without bad intentionsrather an overreactedyet natural unconsciousness. At a closer lookthe endingwith the same old box symbolically crowning the concrete boxmight even be considered a victory of unrestrainedinnocently unaltered love over pettybourgeois moralityof fantasy and imagination of the tyranny of real lifeafter all our definitions of what's rightof the values we're servingof reason and morality might be wrong. This is why the film has been called poor man's Amelie due to its understatedunusual sort of optimismespecially Julien's life would have been worse than deathhad he survivedboth without the woman he loved and with his childhood dream shattered for goodthis is the way many people are slowly dying as human tools of the consumerist worldwithout daring to break free. In fact this film might be paralleled also to The Royal Gamea screenplay of Stefan Zweig's brilliant short story where a chessmatch becomes an issue far more important some might expector to Alexis Zorba or The Old Man and the Sea for its messagelikewhat a splendid catastrophe or you can kill a man but not defeat him.";

Well maybe you'll find it funny if you're the kind of kid who likes to tear the wings off of flies. Maybe you'll think it's funny if your sense of humour is based on insulting or injuring others. But to the more mature audience this is downright appalling.The premise is that two kids grow up playing a meanspirited game in which they constantly dare each other to do cruel things to innocent bystanders. I'll give you a few examples and you can judge whether or not you'll get a laugh out of it.1. Ruin a wedding by tipping over the food table and splattering the cake. 2. Seduce a random girl just to get her earrings. Then throw her earrings in the gutter after making a rude comment to her. 3. See how many times you can slap a random young man. 4. Urinate on the principal's floor. 5. Stand in the middle of the road holding up traffic. Then jump on top of one of the cars. 6. Drive a busload of kids into a brick house.Are any of you laughing? I didn't think so. And don't expect to laugh if you see this movie either. I walked out after 34 minutes because that's all I could take. I can only imagine what's in the second half... do they start kicking over senior citizens in wheelchairs? Spreading herpes? Torturing cats? Ho ho what fun.

Sophie is abused because of her heritagerace in French films this is allowed to be a background detail in an American film they only mention it if that's what the movie's about in the first place and even then they feel compelled to include a moral lesson about it basically in order to deny that it is a facet of everyday life. Julien's loss of his mother is his own motivation. But seriously folks the character's motivations are exactly what this movie is NOT about. They live their lives the way they do not out of selfdefense but out of love of life. The ending makes perfect sense when viewed from this perspective. Do you dare to live life? Do you have unlimited control of your actions? If you did AND you had someone calling you on it at every point then your life would be as wild and nonsensical as these two fantasy figures. Wuthering Heights? Maybe. Romeo and Juliet? More likely.".

	schema:reviewBody "When it come to commenting  criticising movies I can be quite a pain in the arse... and I might be one just once more. I got to watch this movie for a preview screening lucky me! but quite soon felt like leaving the theater.Don't get me wrong I enjoyed watching LE FABULEUX DESTIN D'AMELIE POULAIN as we call it in here. I enjoyed it despite all the tiny points I had against it. I knew pretty much from the start that the director was pulling huge strings to get maximum audience support using ridiculous parisian tourist clichs  basic ALLYMcBEALstyle empathy tricks. The point is that despite all these lame cunning tricks and the basicest plot JeanPierre Jeunet is a director with a vision plus obvious storytelling  cinematographic skills and he gets great artistictechnical staff  inspired actors to work along.None of this can be said of Yann Samuell so just forget about the visionnary mind comment in the IMDB tagline. When AMELIE evolved in an univese of her own JEUX D'ENFANTS just feels like a patchwork sequences pasted one after another with as much visual coherence as a 15 minutes commercial break. Some parts get the right feeling basically the first part with the school bus but most don't children's fantasy looking like cheap kids shows on TV the hospital emergency entrance scene that just feels like another powercar expensive TV advert.... So basically forget about the director.When it comes to the story it ain't much better... If the daring game makes sense I really don't believe in the love story  what could have been a romantic JULES  JIM feeling in the script turns into a pretty anticlimactic ending. Not even mentionning the cheap attempt to show the characters growing up from teenagers to thirtysometing adults using pretty much unchanged actors.Now when it comes to the acting parts I can't really get in the mood to blame the cast. I mean Marion Cotillard is definetely a decent actress. Too bad we mostly saw her in secondrate flicks France's most embarassing TAXI series... basically what you'd get if JeanClaude Van Damme directed The Italian Job's remake but I sincerely believe she's talented  also have no doubt about Guillaume Cannet forget about the lame THE BEACH he's acted in  also directed much better movies. In the end they're not doing bad but you don't really believe in their story. So once more I think I'll blame everything on the director's absence of actormanagement skills  bad editing sense...That is if I was gentle enough to spare the poor boy that plays Guillaume Canet's character aged 8. Honestly I hope dubbing will spare foreign audience the embarassment of what was the most artificial acting experience I've seen in years. In mean the kid sounds even less natural than 1950's commercials characters. Basically the child can't play tries much too hard to sound cute... in the end you're just checking your backpack in case you didn't leave your flamethrower home.To sum things up this movie is obviously a product generated to aim at AMELIE's audience BUT it doesn't have it's good storytelling or visual charm. Do not waste money on this there are much better french movies being exported much better ones to get on DVD too including real tasty romantic love stories.".

That substitution got for Erwin a nomination for Best Supporting Actor in the first year of the Supporting Players categories at the Academy Awards.Pigskin Parade is typical of the college films of the Thirties when students were hardly expected to think about anything of social or political significance. The main thing on the minds of the folks at Yale was who to play in a tune up charity game before the big annual match with Hahvard. In fact the one guy in the film who does think about issues is Elisha Cook Jr. and he's a figure of ridicule. Although it is kind of funny how the fraternity boys use his radicalism to help them in their cause of victory over Yale. But to the students and faculty at Texas State University in Prarie Texas this is one big deal to show up those Yankees. They have a sad sack football team with a brand new coach from Yankeeland himself in Jack Haley. Although truth be told it's his wife Patsy Kelly who's the real brains here. A lot of the comedy with Kelly and Haley involves her showing him up and not being too diplomatic about it.In fact she has the unique idea of utilizing the championship basketball of the school as football players in a unique passing game. Kelly also with Betty Grable and Johnny Downs who discovers Stu Erwin a natural quarterback in a melon field heaving melons across it. Thrown in as a bargain is Erwin's little sister Judy Garland who becomes the team mascot.This film was Judy's feature film debut she would not make another film outside MGM until she left that studio and did A Star Is Born in 1954. Her songs are negligible but her talent is apparent to all.The best song in the film is done by another guy just getting started in the picture business. Tony Martin sings You're Slightly Terrific at a pep rally and he was also going places.Further down the cast list is Betty Grable and even further down is Alan Ladd who you can see in some of the scenes at the fraternity house and at the football game. Pigskin Parade is a pleasant enough film with a whole lot of talented people showing their stuff. Did these kids ever go to class in these schools?".

Best known for his later performance of The Tin Man in THE WIZARD OF OZ Jack Haley was a memorable light comic of stage and screen and his pairing with Patsy Kelly is truly inspired. In addition to the thenpopular quartet The Yachtclub Boys the film also offers early glimpses of future big names like Betty Grable Alan Ladd Tony Martin and Elisha Cook Jr. not to mention B movie queens Arline Judge and Lynn Bari.But then as now the real noise in the film was teenage Judy Garland who made her feature film debut on loan from home studio MGM with the small role of Amos Dodd's hillbilly sister Sairy. Slight though the role was Garland's handful of cornponehumor scenes and her three songs served as a wakeup call to her MGM handlers and for the rest of her MGM contract she would never work offstudio again.Although PIGSKIN PARADE is hardly in the same league with the Paramount Warner Brothers or MGM musicals of the same era the lightweight story memorable cast silly dialogue Well Call My Hawgs! and pleasant if not greatly memorable songs has a great deal of period charm. I do not think it will greatly appeal to any one who isn't already a fan of 1930s musicals but those who are will enjoy itand Garland fans will consider it a minor classic.Gary F.

With a credit list of staff and actors listed on a rolling football Stuart Erwin who appears late into the story heads the cast though the real leads are Patsy Kelly and Jack Haley in that order. By today's standards its sole interest is on future musical film stars in smaller roles Betty Grable in 20thFox debut and Judy Garland on loan from MGM resulting to one of the most musical college movies up of that time. The slight plot begins in a conference room where a deliberation meeting at Yale University as the board of directors select for its charity game the football team from the University of Texas to play against them in New Haven Connecticut. A clerical error between Freddie George Offerman Jr. and Sparks Eddie Nugent has them getting the team from Texas State University in Prairie Texas instead. Winston Slug Winters Jack Haley a coach from Flushing Long Island arrives by train with his wife Bessie Patsy Kelly to his new assignment in shaping up the team. Biff Bentley Fred Kohler Jr. the football captain chosen to lead the team to victory meets with an accident of a fractured leg forcing Winters to find an immediate replacement. Hoping to acquire Stanley Russell Bessie accompanied by fellow students Chip Carson Johnny Downs and his girl Laura Watson Betty Grable encounter Sairy Dodd Judy Garland whose older brother Amos Stuart Erwin is seen tossing melons long distances into a basket. Impressed by his accurate throw Amos is chosen as Bentley's substitute acquiring a college scholarship for both he and his sister in the process. All goes well until the unexpected occurs.Taking amiable support for Arline Judge playing Sally Saxon the college vamp Elisha Cook Jr. as Herbert Terwillinger Van Dyke the wimpy socialist Dixie Dugan Ginger Jones Grady Sutton and Sam Hayes playing himself as the radio announcer of the football game. Look quickly for future leading man Alan Ladd in a minor bit as one of the students. Along with Patsy Kelly's antics and sarcasms and Jack Haley's bit of confusion there's time for songs lots of them. Composed by Sidney Mitchell and Lew Pollack song interludes include T.S.U.

Alma Mater reprise We'd Rather Be in College and Down With Everything The Yacht Club Boys Balboa sung by Dixie Dunbar cast membersJudy Garland You Do the Darndest Things sung by Jack Haley The Texas Tornado and It's Love I'm After both sung by Garland The Football SongTexas Sunshine written and performed by The Yacht Club Boys and The Texas Tornado sung by cast. Although all the musical interludes are delivered in a very entertaining manner the true musical highlight is unquestionably 14yearold Judy Garland's rendition of three lively songs much of them forgotten. Garland's scenes are limited but makes the most of it with her singing ability and transformation from barefoot hillbilly gal in pigtales to talented singing teenager. The Yacht Club Boys as 14 year career students are an interesting foursome of comic striptype faced characters. They perform their specialty numbers well never missing a beat. Interestingly Betty Grable singer and dancer in her own right doesn't get a solo number to herself. As for Stuart Erwin has the distinction of being the only actor to head the cast and earn an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. If anyone deserves an acting honor in the supporting category is Patsy Kelly who in true form is very funny as the assertive wife who calls the plays for her husband. Television revivals for PIGSKIN PARADE have been few and far between over the years. In 1996 American Movie Classics selected PIGSKIN PARADE as part its annual film preservation series. Availability on home video came about that same time. The names of Grable or Garland mostly Garland are the reasons why this routinely done musical has been kept from oblivion.Clam shell video boxes with Garland's face on the cover might have made this an easy sell but disappointment for those expecting her to be the lead.

	schema:reviewBody "I stumbled into Pigskin Parade this morning because my cold kept me from sleeping. Was I surprised at how much I enjoyed this screwball football musicalcomedy. We begin with a conference of the directors at Yale University where they are deep in a serious debateand then we learn it's about who to invite to play football in a big charity game in November. Fearing Michigan is too tough and here I wished they had said How about Ohio State? they settle for the University of Texas.Only the idiot assistant cannot differentiate between the famous school in Austin and Texas State University in Prairie in his directory so they invite a weak team no one has ever heard of to their big game. That the dummy that made the mistake works for Yale really starts the comedy in this film.It happens that TSU has just hired a new football coach from Flushing New York we learn he was coaching high school there. Winston Slug Winters is played by Jack Haley. He and his wife Bessie played by Patsy Kelly are really the stars of this more than anyone else. Some of the best scenes feature this pair.The new coach has barely settled in when the invite from Yale comes. They excitedly accept and now need to build a winning team. Bessie finds out that while they haven't won a football game in years they have a terrific basketball team with four members of that group also on the football team. She gets Slug to realize that they can do well with basketballlike passes laterals among those four. Led by the athleticlooking passer Biff Bentley the team begins the season rolling over everyone they play.Mixing in all through the plot are songs at every pep rally and at dances after every game. We see little game action mostly read newspaper headlines. The Yacht Club Boys are featured. I thought the quartet interesting in that two of them wore neckties and two bows ties all the time. Their songs were humorous particularly the one about how they are so proud to still be in college now sophomores just 14 years after they started college.Magnum P.I. fans will likely recognize Icepick Elisha Cook Jr. who checks in at a fraternity early in the film. Many scenes later we learn that he hasn't registered for classes. He is a socialist busy working on distributing his propaganda material.About halfway through the season Bessie takes away some gin from students right before that week's big dance. Unfortunately she winds up drinking it. Unfortunately for TSU she encounters Biff and tries to show him how to be tougher at stopping a blockerball carrier. She knocks him into the wall breaking his leg.Now they need to find a replacement. Bessie takes two students with her one of them Betty Grable to track down some hotshot passer in Arkansas. That doesn't pan out but they stumble onto a kid Stuart Erwin in a melon field who can fling watermelons long distances with great accuracyputting them into a large net held by his sister Sairy played by Judy Garland. They whisk the two of them off to good ol' Texas State eager to show the coach his new passer.What they hadn't considered was that the passer Amos Dodd doesn't have the qualifications for enrollment at the school. Here's where the little socialist comes in. The students trick him into breaking a large window in the bank so he will get put in jail for 60 days. Amos assumes his role and spends his days in school as Herbert Van Dyke.Things go well for a while with plenty more songs but another problems crops up that leads to Bessie getting a chance to pretend to be jealous of her husband making love 1930smeaning to a coed where she clubs him wife a shotgun butt to again save the day for the team.Finally everyone boards the train for the big trip to Connecticut. Amid the football scenes there are some humorous things like the way the crowd seems whipped in a frenzy on every scene even a seconddown punt. Virtually all the Texas State fans are wearing large white cowboy hats. We got lots of quick reaction shots of fans in a large bank of stands. I wonder if it was the same bank of fans just wearing Eastern hats for the shots of Yale fans and cowboy hats for the Texas State fans.It's a defensive struggle with TSU holding a 60 lead most of the game before Yale scores and converts for a 76 lead. Most of the game is played in a howling snowstorm. At halftime the TSU band comes over to the Yale side to perform a special song they planned. Here the Yacht Club Boys are reluctant but proceed with The Football SongTexas Sunshine where they sing about how they brought the Texas sunshine with them that without it they wouldn't have a chance to win etc. that makes for a comical song.During the second half Bessie keeps having the usher hand notes to her husband who mostly ignores them. Late in the game she winds up on the bench beside him. The bench is more like a baseball dugout and right after Bessie says We don't have a chance Winston stands up and bangs his head on the roof knocking himself out. She immediately declares Now we do have a chance. I can't be spoiling anything by revealing that she sends in the next play and TSU scores right before the final gun to win the game.Loaded with fun songs and funny lines I found this a most enjoyable film. Funnier than most musicals to me the songs were more fitting than you often find.".

We begin with a conference of the directors at Yale University where they are deep in a serious debateand then we learn it's about who to invite to play football in a big charity game in November. Fearing Michigan is too tough and here I wished they had said How about Ohio State? they settle for the University of Texas.Only the idiot assistant cannot differentiate between the famous school in Austin and Texas State University in Prairie in his directory so they invite a weak team no one has ever heard of to their big game.

Also there's a 20year old Betty Grable as one of the eyecandy coeds. The story's nothing special. It's a big football game between little Texas State and bigtime Ivy League Yale. Texas has a new coach Haley and his behindthescenes brains wife Kelly. Texas has no chance until wife Kelly spots cornpone farm boy Irwin who has a slingshot arm. With a little finagling they get him enrolled and made team quarterback. Now the little team from the West stands a chance that is if wife Kelly gets to make the big decisions.Irwin has the goodoleboy drawl down pat which is pretty funny. On the other hand Kelly's pretty shrill as the loud mouth missus undercutting her comedic impact at least in my book. The college dance scenes however sparkle especially the big one before the game. However I could do without the Yacht Club Boys whoever they are Garland should have gotten their singing spots. And get a load out of that fierce rabbit Elisha Cook playing an aggressive campus communist of all things. Even then he appeared as a hapless fall guy. At the same time somebody spent a bucket load turning the LA Coliseum into a snow bowl for the big game. It's very realistic but after 40years I'm still waiting for real snow on my LA home.Other than Garland and Grable and a few sparkling moments there's not much to recommend unless you're into old time football.".

	schema:headline " One of the best LOUSY Hollywood musicals I've seen.";
	schema:reviewBody "Pigskin Parade only has one thing wrong with it. It's kind of lousy. But as far as musicals go it's a good kind of lousy.I've seen Hollywood musicals that bored the hell out of me. I've seen musicals where the songs were lifeless and dull and the musical numbers put you to sleep. I've seen musicals where the acting in between the musical numbers was sheer cinematic torture. I've seen musicals where the performers seemed to be sleepwalking through the movie and where the characters they were playing were so braindead and annoying that you just wanted to whack 'em upside the head with a tube sock full of wood screws! Pigskin Parade is silly and corny but it is never boring. The musical numbers are not great but they are always fun to watch. The characters are stereotypes but the cast plays them with such enthusiasm that you can't help liking them.The plot Bessie and Winston Slug Winters Patsy Kelly and Jack Tin Man Haley arrive at Texas State University to coach the football team. Although they spend most of the movie arguing with each other in RalphandAliceKramden mode they make an effective coaching team. Their big success comes when they discover Amos Dodd Stuart Erwin a country bumpkin farmer who can hurl a melon with missilelike accuracy. They immediately sign him up as the new quarterback for the football team.Texas State is mistakenly invited to play in a charity football game against Yale. They wanted the University of Texas but sent the invitation for the game to the wrong university. Will the Texas State team win the game? Will Amos Dodd score a gamewinning touchdown in the final seconds of play? What do you think? This is one of those college musicals where all the college students look as if they are about thirty years old. Most of the songs are sung by a nutty quartet of sophomores played by the Yacht Club Boys. They look old enough to be visiting their kids at the college on Parents Day. One of them even admits that he has been in college for seven years  beating John Belushi to the movie line by 42 years. The musical numbers are not great but they are a lot of fun to watch. There is one called You're Slightly Terrific which pretty much describes the entire soundtrack. The songs are slightly terrific but not overly so.The songs written and sung by the Yacht Club Boys have a great satirical edge to them. They sing We'd Rather Be In College in which they admit that with the Depression raging they are better off in college than they would be in the current job market Down With Everything a wonderful vigorous musical number that satirizes college revolutionaries sung to a wouldbe college Trotsky. And We Brought The Texas Sunshine With Us which the Yacht Club Boys sing in the middle of a snowstorm at the Yale football game.And then there is Judy Garland in her feature film debut playing Amos Dodd's countrybumpkin sister. The first time we see her in the movie she is barely recognizable wearing overalls and sporting pigtails and using a phony Texas accent. Hey yuh wanna buy a melon? Within a few scenes however she has been transformed offscreen into a college girlyoung starlet. In her first few scenes she tells everybody I can sing. Wannuh hear me? It takes a few scenes before someone lets her sing  and dammit can she ever sing! Her first bigscreen musical number is the tailend of the song The Balboa!a rather rocky har! college dance number sung at the TSU Homecoming Dance. The Balboa was no Carioca or Continental although it tried to be. From there she sings The Texas Tornado and It's Love I'm After. And if you saw this movie in 1936 you just had to know that Judy was going to be a major star! To quote the great Roger Ebert I cannot recommend the movie but ... why the hell can't I? Just because it's godawful? What kind of reason is that for staying away from a movie? Godawful and boring that would be a reason. Well I could recommend Pigskin Parade. It's not exactly godawful but it is lousy. But despite the lousiness you will have a good time watching it. You won't love it the way you love Wizard of Oz or Singing in the Rain. But you will like it  as long as you accept the lousiness of the movie and go with it.".

College bigwigs intend to invite a strong football team to the championships but instead they invite the team of another college with a very similar name. That team is terrible so they send out for a new coachwho's also terrible!Jack Haley stars as the poor excuse of a coach with Patsy Kelley by his side as his wisecracking wife. If you liked Jack in Poor Little Rich Girl you'll be cracking up just as much as I was at his similar rapport with Patsy in this musical comedy. He's so endearing when he's an idiot isn't he? Patsy is hilarious with her nononsense common sense solutions and underneath it all you can tell she's still crazy about her goofball husband.Stuart Erwin a veteran actor by the time 1936 rolled around was nominated for an Oscar for his awshucks hickturnedfootballstar role. It's almost funny when you see this movie to think that this was the one that won him ecognition from the Academy when he did much more acting in 1933's Hold Your Man. Other soontobe stars joined the cast including Betty Grable Tony Martin and Judy Garland in her very first film. If you decide to rent this just be prepared for a very lowbudget comedy with lots of random songs interspersed to stretch out the story.".

It's almost like she was just added in for the sake of having this child singing prodigy in the film. The only reason I believe that this film is even remembered is because of the future stars that it featured Garland Betty Grable and Elisha Cook Jr. Patsy Kelly who played the wife was annoying at best. I didn't mind Jack Haley but he is forever etched in my mind as The Tin Man. When there were multiple comments made to him about having a brain I was really wanting him to mention his heart somehow but alas no. I love watching football so the old timey football scenes to me were the best part of the film. I'd love to know how many horrible injuries players sustained during these times because they aren't wearing very much protection. However the game seems to be more physical now than it used to be and the players are also much bigger. I found the logic of basketball players being good at football to be strange. I guess we're presuming that these are pass heavy games and good blocking and tackling abilities aren't required in 1930s football. I really liked the scenes of the football in the snow. Bad weather football is the most fun to watch. 510 points are for Judy Betty and football. Whether it is worth watching even once is a take it or leave it proposition.".

	schema:reviewBody "By all means not a great film with a silly premise not made any less so. However it is easy to like and does liven up the spirits as long as not too much is expected.'Pigskin Parade' is mainly notable for being the film debut of 14year old Judy Garland but it is worth watching for more than just historical interest. Garland's performance is certainly one of 'Pigskin Parade's' standout features she is a real charmer here and not only does she look like she is having a lot of fun but she gets ample opportunity to show off her unmistakable vocal pipes and sounds fabulous for so young.Tony Martin is also very early in his career and does make an impression singing the film's best song You're Slightly Terrific. Betty Grable is similarly charmingly perky while Stuart Erwin though am personally not sure about the Oscarnomination especially with greats like Walter Brennan and Basil Rathbone also in the running in the category that year is fun and endearing. A pre'The Wizard of Oz' Jack Haley does just fine while Patsy Kelly comes very close to stealing the show as a less than subtle character. Love her chemistry with Haley which can be uproarious to watch. Nice to see Elisha Cook Jnr.Visually while not exactly lavish 'Pigskin Parade' is attractive enough everything is shot well and it was made with care. The bright and breezy direction from David Butler helps. The songs are hardly awardworthy and they vary in the memorability and relevance factor but they are very energetic and pleasant while they are not necessarily great songs count me in as somebody who enjoyed listening to them. You're Slightly Terrific and Garland's numbers come off best and they're staged in a way that isn't big and bold but never static or indifferent either due to that the cast seem to be enjoying themselves too much.Scripting has its snappy and funny moments the film never drags and has a breeziness throughout.Not that 'Pigskin Parade' is perfect this said. The story is thin does get contrived in places and is as old as the hills. Some of the script is corny and overlysilly with some of the comedy overplayed on odd occasions. Could have done with less of the Yacht Club Boys they serve little purpose other than their songs and their performing style is neither interesting or fun and grates somewhat trying to see them pass for college kids even for comedy strains credibility beyond belief.Overall not great but good undemanding fun. 710 Bethany Cox".

However apart from the novelty of seeing a young Judy in the film there is not a lot to recommend this subpar musical.The film begins with the Yale administrators discussing an important topicwhich college will play their football team in an upcoming game. They decide on powerhouse University of Texas but due to a stupid mistake tiny Texas State is instead offered this prestigious game. This comes at a very opportune time as the horrible team of Texas State has a new coach Jack Haley and he wants to make a name for himself. But there are two problemsthe team hasn't won a game in two years and the coach's wife Patsy Kelly is a buffoon and she ends up breaking the star player's leg! So to try to make amends this annoying woman goes on a crosscountry trek trying to find a star for their team. Her search ends up in a watermelon patchwith melonslinging Amos Dodd Stu Erwin being offered a scholarship to play for Texas State even though they have no idea if he even finished or even attended high school! He's hesitant but his kidsister Garland insists and comes along to college with him. Can this hayseed somehow help the team to be able to take on Yale and not embarrass themselves?This film is jampacked full of songsmostly bad songs. Even if you love songs you may find some of them hard to takeparticularly those of a strange and very oldlooking college quartet The Yacht Club Boys. Their songs to put it bluntly are thirdrate and it's obvious the studio really saw this more as a Bmovie than anything else. The humor is generally very broad and corny. Subtle the film ain'tand this can also be said about much of the acting. Erwin is more a caricature than anything else and Kelly is as Kelly usually isbrash loud and well LOUD! So we have one character who is a lot like Uncle Jed from The Beverly Hillbillies and another who seems to be performing specifically for the hard of hearing as she screams many of her lines! In addition to being a poor film it brings us an incredibly cynical message that when it comes to small schools they must cheat in order to keep up with the big colleges! And cheating is what Texas State does repeatedly as Dodd isn't even eligible to play though he does through some creative cheating! I know that the reviews for this film are all rather positivesome even giving it a 10. I find this inexplicable as I have seen hundreds of better musicalshundreds! Aside from Garland's amazing singing and a few cute moments the film is lame through and through. It is something no one would remember or want to remember except because of her appearance...as well as when Texas State punts the ball on 2nd down pay attention...they really do this in the big game with Yale.College movies of the 1930s 40s and 50s OFTEN featured college students who were practically old enough to be on social security! In this film most of the students appear to be in their 30sand Erwin is 33! And in an odd twist his 'sister' is only 14! Yes I know a true Bmovie is only about 60 minutes in lengthnot 93 minutes like this one. However the film is full of second and thirdtier actors bad writing bad music and the studio seemed to have little faith in the film.".

To this day we still rate movies even very bad ones by how much better than The Lonely Lady they are.A long time ago I saw an interview with Eleanor Perry who wrote the screenplays for among other things Last Summer and Diary of a Mad Housewife and she related that she had been asked to write a screenplay for the Harold Robbins' book The Lonely Lady. She said that she sent in a treatment and it was rejected because they didn't think she understood the difficulties of a female screenwriter in Hollywood. She then said I think they got someone else to write it. The interview was filmed before the movie was released. She died in 1981 and I bet the first thing she did on arrival in heaven was personally thank God for saving her from involvement in the result.".

	schema:reviewBody "One must envy Oediphus for having the nerve of taking his eyes out to me the act in itself just sounds painful enough and it's unimaginable. For those who aren't versed in the classics forget Oediphus and let us go back to not long ago I envy the British man who ripped his eyes out apparently possessed while attending a mass in Rome. I envy him more than the literary character not only because he's real but because while doing it he said to the doctors he didn't felt a thing while doing it. No pain at all! Why am I being grotesque while criticizing this movie? Well simply because The Lonely Lady is one of those things that makes you wanna commit those acts. The atrocity your eyes are put to see are so shocking that one has two options to go blind and vow to never watch a movie again or erase your memory because all of those terrible moments stays with you for a long while. But since the company who provides the memory erasing device from Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind doesn't exist YET but one day will your eye must be put to death. Let us be frank I'm responsible for committing such crime to myself guilty as charged. Often listed one of the worst stinkers ever made I just felt the need to see it with my own eyes how bad this could get reserving some hope this might a bad good film or maybe not that bad as they say. It turned out be to a sickening gutwrenching and almost pointless experience. I say almost because I learned a few things from it 1 I don't have the strength nor the health to watch those kind of films. It's life threatening and from now on I'll try to avoid at all costs when I sense a movie is going terrible. I'll allow myself more and more walkouts. 2 to trust a little more when a whole bunch pans something go forward it with them join them. They're right! Why bothering wasting time with garbage? You're being warned as I was just don't go one step beyond like I did. You'll feel better afterwards. My advice read all the reviews written in here about this thing you'll find some funny material of the highest quality.The average easy reading book written by Harold Robbins was translated to the screen as a corny almost soapoperish flick ruined from practically scene one. To the director writer and producer of this it must have been quite a luck that Robbins was suffering from aphasia at the time of the release of this otherwise I think he would sue those people ask for his name to be risked from the credits and would disown this with passion. Weird soundtrack insanely bad script and lousy acting by almost the entire cast poor Ray Liotta in one of his earliest roles and here's an infamous one as the main character's rapist. What's this all about? The adventures and misfortunes of Jerilee Randall Pia Zadora trying to establish herself as a serious screenwriter fighting against Hollywood's misogynist conventions learning that the only way to get to the top in the entertainment business and being a successful person is to be ON top of a bunch of cruel hedonist yet powerful man and some women!. It's almost like if this was a silly biographical account of someone relatively famous who had to go through the same experiences the main character had to.Won't go further in details on why this fails because this is almost common knowledge for those of us who know about films out there. From the one line written by Jerilee changing a whole film written by her husband WHY? to the hilarious montage sequence with her breakdown smashing objects not a single moment was good in this junk. We can almost forgive the acting problems but we can't forgive how negative the script is towards women and their representations of being needy naive and with limited talents and we certainly cannot forgive the infamous hosing rape scene which was in the lack of a better word and reaction laughable. This isn't a funny issue in life but somehow everything terrible music combined with the awful editing and lousy acting contributed to such laughable reaction in my defense never during the scene but a little afterwards to quickly disappear with shock when of Jerilee's mother reaction to the event  the doctor quoting She was attacked to which she replied But not raped!.The only redeeming quality of this is the final scene. Yes they made something good out of that which was better than was in the book. I almost felt something for the character in that moment. She wins the Oscar after going through hell trying to sell her script and in the acceptance speech she gives the movie's best bad line and gets booed of the stage. In Robbins novel it's the same thing except...she strips naked painted in gold as the Oscar and addresses herself against the men in Hollywood. Can you imagine this scene filmed? They would probably erase the mentions of this film as if never existed in history. Too bad it exists and can be found out there. Thankfully not that easily. 110".

	onyx:emotionText "One must envy Oediphus for having the nerve of taking his eyes out to me the act in itself just sounds painful enough and it's unimaginable. For those who aren't versed in the classics forget Oediphus and let us go back to not long ago I envy the British man who ripped his eyes out apparently possessed while attending a mass in Rome. I envy him more than the literary character not only because he's real but because while doing it he said to the doctors he didn't felt a thing while doing it. No pain at all! Why am I being grotesque while criticizing this movie? Well simply because The Lonely Lady is one of those things that makes you wanna commit those acts. The atrocity your eyes are put to see are so shocking that one has two options to go blind and vow to never watch a movie again or erase your memory because all of those terrible moments stays with you for a long while. But since the company who provides the memory erasing device from Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind doesn't exist YET but one day will your eye must be put to death. Let us be frank I'm responsible for committing such crime to myself guilty as charged. Often listed one of the worst stinkers ever made I just felt the need to see it with my own eyes how bad this could get reserving some hope this might a bad good film or maybe not that bad as they say. It turned out be to a sickening gutwrenching and almost pointless experience. I say almost because I learned a few things from it 1 I don't have the strength nor the health to watch those kind of films. It's life threatening and from now on I'll try to avoid at all costs when I sense a movie is going terrible. I'll allow myself more and more walkouts. 2 to trust a little more when a whole bunch pans something go forward it with them join them. They're right! Why bothering wasting time with garbage? You're being warned as I was just don't go one step beyond like I did. You'll feel better afterwards. My advice read all the reviews written in here about this thing you'll find some funny material of the highest quality.The average easy reading book written by Harold Robbins was translated to the screen as a corny almost soapoperish flick ruined from practically scene one. To the director writer and producer of this it must have been quite a luck that Robbins was suffering from aphasia at the time of the release of this otherwise I think he would sue those people ask for his name to be risked from the credits and would disown this with passion. Weird soundtrack insanely bad script and lousy acting by almost the entire cast poor Ray Liotta in one of his earliest roles and here's an infamous one as the main character's rapist. What's this all about? The adventures and misfortunes of Jerilee Randall Pia Zadora trying to establish herself as a serious screenwriter fighting against Hollywood's misogynist conventions learning that the only way to get to the top in the entertainment business and being a successful person is to be ON top of a bunch of cruel hedonist yet powerful man and some women!. It's almost like if this was a silly biographical account of someone relatively famous who had to go through the same experiences the main character had to.Won't go further in details on why this fails because this is almost common knowledge for those of us who know about films out there. From the one line written by Jerilee changing a whole film written by her husband WHY? to the hilarious montage sequence with her breakdown smashing objects not a single moment was good in this junk. We can almost forgive the acting problems but we can't forgive how negative the script is towards women and their representations of being needy naive and with limited talents and we certainly cannot forgive the infamous hosing rape scene which was in the lack of a better word and reaction laughable. This isn't a funny issue in life but somehow everything terrible music combined with the awful editing and lousy acting contributed to such laughable reaction in my defense never during the scene but a little afterwards to quickly disappear with shock when of Jerilee's mother reaction to the event  the doctor quoting She was attacked to which she replied But not raped!.The only redeeming quality of this is the final scene. Yes they made something good out of that which was better than was in the book. I almost felt something for the character in that moment. She wins the Oscar after going through hell trying to sell her script and in the acceptance speech she gives the movie's best bad line and gets booed of the stage. In Robbins novel it's the same thing except...she strips naked painted in gold as the Oscar and addresses herself against the men in Hollywood. Can you imagine this scene filmed? They would probably erase the mentions of this film as if never existed in history. Too bad it exists and can be found out there. Thankfully not that easily. 110";

	schema:reviewBody "I kind of liked The Lonely Lady. Give Pia a break. She looks great and she has really nice eyes. What's not to like? The scene where she gets raped by Ray Liotta with a garden hose was kind of gross and cruel. Actually a LOT of stuff that happens in this movie is gross and cruel. But its a trashy movie. A lot of movies that are trashy are not all bad. I liked this better than Valley of the Dolls which was not only trashy but boring as well. At least this wasn't boring.Pia gets naked a lot and seems miscast as a writer. Watching her talk about Pushkin and Byron with a guy three times her age is flat unbelievable. I'm sure Pia's a nice person in real life she just doesn't project the writer vibe. She looked much happier when she was working as a hostess for that guy from Saturday Night Fever and wearing a glittery disco dress.A couple of the scenes are funny. The one where she tells the twotiming actor that she's pregnant and he rolls his eyes and snaps at her to stop hanging around! all the while he's practically fawning over every bimbo who flounces by.Pia's nervous breakdown scene is good. It was probably a mistake to go so supernova on it the vortex of floating faces and freezeframe scream  whoa! and her subsequent catatonic stupor is kind of overdone.The acceptance speech is a hoot though. I want to see someone do that speech in a drama class.But again this is trash we're talking about. You could find worse on any movie of the week back in the eighties.".

She had been inspired by Robbins and how he wrote added in her crazed ability self promote and became a star. The book was his tarted up version of how he saw her life.I discovered that book hidden on my parents shelf in the 1980's and was amazed by it. How did they fit so much sex and depravity between its pages? And when I learned that HBO would be showing the movie adaption at 4 AM well look out!Jerilee Randall Pia Zadora! is an innocent waif living in the San Fernando Valley with a dream of being a screenwriter and a trophy for creative writing. Then she meets Walter Thornton Mr. No Legs Crystal Heart a famous screenwriter. She's kind of sort of is dating his son but she slowly falls in love with him. But before all that Ray Liotta rapes her with a garden hose.You know how they say that you need to take a shower after some movies? You need to continually shower during The Lonely Lady. In fact I would recommend putting your TV in the hallway and watching the film from the shower.Walter and Jerilee marry despite the protests of her mom. He gets her a job as an onset writer but when the one word she adds to his script WHY!?! improves the film their marriage starts to fail. He's unable to satisfy his wife. Also his chest hair is like a perilious thatch of salt and pepper steel wool.Walter accuses her of enjoying the rape with a garden hose and that's the end of their marriage well they stay married but she leaves. Jerilee starts sleeping her way through Hollywood including getting pregnant by George Ballantine Jared Martin from Fulci's Warriors of the Year 2072! and then getting an abortion before falling for a nightclub owner. He lies to her all along the way until she finds him having sex with two other women. Lost and hopelessly addicted to pills she has a nervous breakdown in a bravurra sequence.Every single agent that Jerilee meets with wants to sleep with her. Seriously every single one. Well I take that back. Some of them want her to sleep with their wives. Even a woman tries to take advantage of her.Finally Jerilee's script is produced  and it has to star George Ballantine  but it wins a major award that is not an Oscar. Jerilee goes off during her speech admitting to her exhusband that she never learned anything about selfrespect and that she's slept her way to the top. She refuses the award and walks out with dignity to the strains of her theme song. That's not as good as the book which ends with her tearing off her clothes to reveal the Oscar painting upside down with his head resting inside her pubic hair.Meshulam Rikls Pia Zadora's billionaire husband spent 5 million to get this made and spent several million more for Universal Pictures to release it in the U.S. But you gotta give it to Pia  despite half of the audience being voters for the Razzie Awards who laughed throughout the film  she showed up and stayed for autographs in the lobby. I would have been right there in line ready with a supportive hug if she needed it!".

Pia married a wealthy older man who financed her movies while Traci found parts by marrying the prop manager for John Waters after living together with an agent who produced her popular adult feature Traci I Love You. I think the film's worst part is the instant bandage that's applied when Pia's character overdoses and has a nervous breakdown but fifteen minutes later her first film is produced and she's ready to accept an Oscar for best screenplay. The industry seems to be full of powerful women who climb the bedroom to the top of success while their male companions sink to the bottom from where they were.

	schema:reviewBody "The Lonely Lady is the story of Jerilee Randall a young girl who in search of fame and recognition basically puts out to get ahead. It's sleazy campy fun for all if you can stand the gratuitous nudity. The reason this movie is so entertaining is its star. Pia Zadora is a bad actress who was fortunately blessed with the gift of accidental comedy. Sometimes you can't help but bust out laughing even before she opens her mouth. I can't help but wondering if maybe she would've had more success if she tried to make comedies rather than angstridden melodramas like this that only spotlight her lack of talent. She is further hindered by utterly atrocious dialogue as is the supporting cast. The lines range from unintentionally funny You've already had one abortion don't make it two I don't suppose I'm the only one who's had to fk her way to the top Is this more your kick? to downright alien Jerilee's high school award acceptance speech at the beginning and her book reviews which laud her for depicting rape and violence with a sensitivity beyond her years and showing the inadequacy of liberal values in the face of evil??? The writers' bad dialogue and poor choice of wording really deserve a mention because this movie is about drum roll please screenwriters! Nevermind the fact that Jerilee thinks her ticket to fame is becoming a successful screenwriter she modifies a script by excising an actress's entire monologue and replacing it with Why? and it is treated as brilliant! We're also supposed to believe that the actress would rather say one word than give a monologue. Of course it's all worth it as watching the actress act out her new line change is rife with narm. Bad acting and dialogue aside it's really hard to feel any sympathy as Jerilee goes from one obvious bad choice to another. She dumps her niceguy boyfriend in the beginning to run off with a famous screenwriter's son. Her reward for this is getting raped at his house by one of his smarmy friends with a garden hose no less. The description is absurd on its own but this scene has to be seen to be believed. Our imperiled heroine writhes on the ground while shrieking her head off as she waits for a soontobeembarrassed Ray Liotta to insert his hose not a metaphor inside her. He rips her blouse open so the audience gets a boob shot first of many as a bonus while overwrought scary music blares. In a more competent movie with a competent cast this scene would be upsetting to watch. Here it's so ridiculous that the filmmakers have achieved the impossible a comedic rape scene. Later she marries the boy's father the screenwriter's son not the garden hose rapist though given some of her later choices in men it would've made as much sense and continues to live in the same house where she was raped! Though it can almost be forgiven as it leads to another memorable scene where her older husband after battling impotence waves the garden hose in her face and taunts her with it. It's so jawdroppingly insensitive you just can't help but laugh. She follows with a succession of increasingly sleazy boyfriends though once again it's forgiven as it gives us Jerilee's nervous breakdown scene. Of course it's memorable for all the wrong reasons. Jerilee is also given a mother who's every bit as comically insensitive and abusive as her lovers. She repeatedly puts her daughter down after getting raped getting an abortion and even going to the loony bin. She throws herself at her daughter's husband knowing full well that her daughter got violated at his house and that the boy would go unpunished because of hubby's status.However the filmmakers obviously felt that the movie could not stand on its own so they added nudity and it gets ramped up as the movie progresses. First we get an occasional topless shot then a sexintheshower scene and then five straight minutes near the end of Jerilee and her latest boyfriend cavorting in the buff. Most of the shots are of Ms. Zadora herself though we do get to see quite a lot of Saturday Night Fever's Joseph Cali so they clearly thought her body was something special. She even has women coming on to her! Pia Zadora's not a dog mind you but she's certainly not attractive enough to have every man and woman fawn over her. The fact that her older rich husband backed this movie makes it rather icky as well.Finally the movie has an overall generic feel to it. Buildings are not named the ersatz Oscar ceremony which bookends the film is simply called The Awards and one of Jerilee's books is shown with a white cover and blocky letters. Many of the film's songs have a bizarre anonymous vibe to them with simple uncreative lyrics. Character names are rather dull and uninspired except for Jerilee but the movie undercuts even this by having her compete with another woman named Jerilee for a screen writing Oscar sorry Award. Not only are the screenwriters for this film out of touch with reality they're woefully unimaginative. This movie finally ended Pia's bid for movie stardom. What's strange is how much this movie seems to mirror Pia's own career. Both Pia and Jerilee married older rich men used them to get ahead had their careers ruined at the end of the movie and bared enough skin to make people call Pia's selfrespect into question. Thankfully those of us in the real world knew better than to give Pia an Oscar.".

Later she marries the boy's father the screenwriter's son not the garden hose rapist though given some of her later choices in men it would've made as much sense and continues to live in the same house where she was raped! Though it can almost be forgiven as it leads to another memorable scene where her older husband after battling impotence waves the garden hose in her face and taunts her with it. It's so jawdroppingly insensitive you just can't help but laugh. She follows with a succession of increasingly sleazy boyfriends though once again it's forgiven as it gives us Jerilee's nervous breakdown scene. Of course it's memorable for all the wrong reasons. Jerilee is also given a mother who's every bit as comically insensitive and abusive as her lovers. She repeatedly puts her daughter down after getting raped getting an abortion and even going to the loony bin. She throws herself at her daughter's husband knowing full well that her daughter got violated at his house and that the boy would go unpunished because of hubby's status.However the filmmakers obviously felt that the movie could not stand on its own so they added nudity and it gets ramped up as the movie progresses. First we get an occasional topless shot then a sexintheshower scene and then five straight minutes near the end of Jerilee and her latest boyfriend cavorting in the buff. Most of the shots are of Ms. Zadora herself though we do get to see quite a lot of Saturday Night Fever's Joseph Cali so they clearly thought her body was something special. She even has women coming on to her! Pia Zadora's not a dog mind you but she's certainly not attractive enough to have every man and woman fawn over her. The fact that her older rich husband backed this movie makes it rather icky as well.Finally the movie has an overall generic feel to it. Buildings are not named the ersatz Oscar ceremony which bookends the film is simply called The Awards and one of Jerilee's books is shown with a white cover and blocky letters. Many of the film's songs have a bizarre anonymous vibe to them with simple uncreative lyrics. Character names are rather dull and uninspired except for Jerilee but the movie undercuts even this by having her compete with another woman named Jerilee for a screen writing Oscar sorry Award. Not only are the screenwriters for this film out of touch with reality they're woefully unimaginative. This movie finally ended Pia's bid for movie stardom. What's strange is how much this movie seems to mirror Pia's own career. Both Pia and Jerilee married older rich men used them to get ahead had their careers ruined at the end of the movie and bared enough skin to make people call Pia's selfrespect into question. Thankfully those of us in the real world knew better than to give Pia an Oscar.";

The real problem with The Lonely Lady is that the screenplay like the original book looks for sensation rather than substance and nothing can help with this. The screenplay for this film is abysmal but whether the story could have been filmed more successfully with a better script tauter directing and really competent acting must remain a matter of personal judgement. As it was released my viewers rating for it would depend upon whether I am assessing my personal opinion or assessing to what extent the film succeeds in providing what it aims at doing.

	schema:headline " Marx Brothers at half speed  and Douglas proves a comic";
	schema:reviewBody "Groucho Marx in one of the interviews in Richard Anobile's book about the brothers admitted that the films after the death of Irving Thalberg he meant after A Day At The Races were not his favorite and he considered them the team's worst films.  This is not a totally fair evaluation.  Two of the films Room Service and A Night in Casablanca were as good as Horsefeathers or Animal Crackers.  But it must be admitted that At The Circus Go West The Big Store and Love Happy not to say their unfortunate solo performances in The Story of Mankindwere below par Marx.  All had good moments in them  but only moments.  If one can cut these films to only highlight their highlights the resulting anthology film would be almost as good as Room Service and A Night in Casablanca.Groucho is Wolf J. Flywheel in this film  one of his catchiest pseudonyms. Like his later tamer film role as Sam Grunion in Love Happy he is a detective.  Like Grunion he is living a hand to mouth existance owing rent. In the last moments of the film Charles Lane forcibly reposes his car an ancient vehicle for 1941 America with the sign Welcome Admiral Dewey Hero of Manilla on the back  the battle of Manilla Bay was in 1898 and the car looks like it just arrived on the scene before Dewey died in 1917. Groucho is therefore definitely interested in impressing and romancing his normal foil Margaret Dumont for financial security.  In the end they and Harpo are in the car as it is towed away.It was not the first time that Groucho played a character named Flywheel. In the missing year of 1934 while he and his brothers left Paramount after Duck Soup failed and when Zeppo decided to become an agent rather than a straight man  a wise decision as he was a very successful agent Groucho and Chico made a series of radio programs about a firm of shyster lawyers Flywheel Shyster and Flywheel.  The tapes of these broadcasts no longer exist apparently but the scripts have been published.  Many of their routines appear to have been used in these scripts which are funny.  One hopes the tapes will still manage to turn up one day.The best moments in the film are those dealing with Groucho trying to impress Dumont and his confrontations with Douglass Dumbrille as the conniving pompous store manager Grover.  Harpo's fantasy moment with two other Harpos playing a trio is fine.  Chico really does not do too well in the film  nothing in particular standing out.  This is not enough to sustain the film until the final ten minutes.The brothers have photographed Grover paying two goons to assassinate Tony Martin the heir to Dumont the owner of the store  Dumbrille wants to marry her to get control of the store.  Dumbrille tries to get the photo back and chases the brothers through the deserted departments of the store. Douglas Dumbrille was a recognizeable movie villain throughout the 1930s and 1940s.  He appeared opposite Crosby and Hope in Road to Utopia and opposite Abbott and Costello in Lost in a Harem.  In such roles he usually just gave the normally competent straight dramatic villainy that he gave in such films as Treasure Island he was Israel Hands who tries to kill Jackie CooperJim Hawkins.  But it was different with the Brothers as he appeared in two films with them.  He had played Morgan the racetrack owner in A Day at the Races.  Dumbrille was not the only actor who played in several Marx Brother films  Walter Woolf King was Gasparri in A Night at the Opera and was one of the two villains in Go West.  Sig Ruman was Herman Gottlieb in A Night at the Opera Dr. Leopold X. Steimetz in A Day at the Races and Hans Stubel the Nazi War Criminal in hiding in A Night in Casablanca. Margaret Dumont appeared in seven Marx films and Thelma Todd in Horsefeathers and Monkey Business.  Ruman Dumont and Todd were all expert comic actors and perfect foils for the brothers.  King was okay but no more.  But Dumbrille was the interesting repeater in the bunch. In A Day at the Races Dumbrille had little to do except to threaten Harpo for not throwing a race and looking apoplectic while the brothers demolish his racetrack to prevent a race from occuring before their missing horse can be found.  As such his performance there is little different from his performance in Road to Utopia or Lost in a Harem.  But the conclusion of The Big Store is different.  Here he steals the chase from the stars of the filmIt is true that by 1941 the brothers were too old for the stunts needed  and so they use doubles compare it to Go West a year before where they still do some of their own stunt work.  In some of the tumbles Grover is supposed to take one can see that Dumbrille has a double too.  But the difference is that the director noted that Dumbrille's unsmiling stiff face can be used to punctuate what a ridiculous figure he could become.  For he does become ridiculous despite the grave reason for his chasing the brothers.  Suddenly he has to do such ridiculous things as ride a bicycle in the store a kid's bike at that while wearing his floorwalker outfit to catch the brothers who are on skates.  He puts on skates too at one point and falls into a counter full of ladies hats.  He disappears behind the counter and raises his head to show he is wearing a lady's hat with a flower on top.  It's a priceless image for his expression has not changed.It is Dumbrille who makes the forced chase worth watching  it was perhaps his finest moment as a comic actor.  I wonder if the brothers especially the critical Groucho ever stopped to realize how they had briefly abdicated their movie to a supporting player.".

	onyx:emotionText "Groucho Marx in one of the interviews in Richard Anobile's book about the brothers admitted that the films after the death of Irving Thalberg he meant after A Day At The Races were not his favorite and he considered them the team's worst films.  This is not a totally fair evaluation.  Two of the films Room Service and A Night in Casablanca were as good as Horsefeathers or Animal Crackers.  But it must be admitted that At The Circus Go West The Big Store and Love Happy not to say their unfortunate solo performances in The Story of Mankindwere below par Marx.  All had good moments in them  but only moments.  If one can cut these films to only highlight their highlights the resulting anthology film would be almost as good as Room Service and A Night in Casablanca.Groucho is Wolf J. Flywheel in this film  one of his catchiest pseudonyms. Like his later tamer film role as Sam Grunion in Love Happy he is a detective.  Like Grunion he is living a hand to mouth existance owing rent. In the last moments of the film Charles Lane forcibly reposes his car an ancient vehicle for 1941 America with the sign Welcome Admiral Dewey Hero of Manilla on the back  the battle of Manilla Bay was in 1898 and the car looks like it just arrived on the scene before Dewey died in 1917. Groucho is therefore definitely interested in impressing and romancing his normal foil Margaret Dumont for financial security.  In the end they and Harpo are in the car as it is towed away.It was not the first time that Groucho played a character named Flywheel. In the missing year of 1934 while he and his brothers left Paramount after Duck Soup failed and when Zeppo decided to become an agent rather than a straight man  a wise decision as he was a very successful agent Groucho and Chico made a series of radio programs about a firm of shyster lawyers Flywheel Shyster and Flywheel.  The tapes of these broadcasts no longer exist apparently but the scripts have been published.  Many of their routines appear to have been used in these scripts which are funny.  One hopes the tapes will still manage to turn up one day.The best moments in the film are those dealing with Groucho trying to impress Dumont and his confrontations with Douglass Dumbrille as the conniving pompous store manager Grover.  Harpo's fantasy moment with two other Harpos playing a trio is fine.  Chico really does not do too well in the film  nothing in particular standing out.  This is not enough to sustain the film until the final ten minutes.The brothers have photographed Grover paying two goons to assassinate Tony Martin the heir to Dumont the owner of the store  Dumbrille wants to marry her to get control of the store.  Dumbrille tries to get the photo back and chases the brothers through the deserted departments of the store. Douglas Dumbrille was a recognizeable movie villain throughout the 1930s and 1940s.

	schema:reviewBody "While I disagree with the conventional wisdom about the Marx Brothers' film made before The Big Store Go West 1940 believing it to be yet another one of their many masterpieces I have to agree with the conventional wisdom about The Big Store. It has the feeling of a contractual obligation film. One two or all three of the Marx Brothers are absent for long periods of time. The story is often confusing. The film doesn't flow very well. Some of the material featuring other performers simply doesn't work. Even when it does work it's never as good as the Marx Brothers' material and even their work is too often strangely flat.The Big Store is really the story of Tommy Rogers played by famed pop singer Tony Martin. Rogers has just gained partial ownership of the Phelps Department store with the passing of a relative. However he's not interested in the store so he plans to sell and use the money to build a state of the art music conservatory in conjunction with his friend Ravelli Chico Marx. Unfortunately not everything at the Phelps store has been on the up and up and surviving store manager Mr. Grover Douglass Dumbrille is worried about buyers discovering their creative bookkeeping. So they try to off Tommy which leads to hiring private detective Wolf J. Flywheel Groucho Marx and his assistant Wacky Harpo Marx who happens to be Ravelli's brother. At the same time Mr. Grover is courting Martha Phelps Margaret Dumont Tommy's aunt with machinations of eventual ownership of the store.In terms of meatiness that's far more of a plot than I usually relay but all of that is presented in the first 10  15 minutes of the film. The remainder involves playing out those threads. The problem is that the above is way too complicated especially for a Marx Brothers film. The Marx Brothers style was that plots were really secondary to their anarchic madcap skits. In truth the two were usually well integrated in their films with meatier plots than the conventional wisdom has it and the skits relatively seamlessly enmeshed in the plots.Here the plot is often difficult to follow and when you do manage to follow it it just isn't that interesting. Despite this there are still a number of fabulous set pieces. The scene where we first meet Groucho and Harpo in Groucho's private eye office is hilarious. The bedding department scene is good. The climax featuring an extended chase through the department store is a lot of fun including its cartoonish use of wire stunts and camera tricks.But there just isn't enough of that stuff and one of the Marx Brothers' strongest pointsGroucho's verbal bantering is oddly flat just as often as it isn't. Even the usual musical sequences are problematic unlike their sublime charm in Go West. Only Harpo's musical sequence and a brief duet with Chico on the piano are worthwhile. Groucho is given a schmaltzy big musical production number that goes on too long is supposed to be funny and isn't and ends up with Groucho doing little else but mugging and doing his trademark walk while other characters we're not familiar with sing the song.Tony Martin has a song early on in the film that's okay but doesn't exactly fit the tone of the film and later he does another big musical production number called The Tenement Symphony that is bizarre to say the least but not particularly funny. Instead it's a strange mishmash of styles that is strongly derivative in a negative way of George Gershwin.While Marx Brothers completest certainly can't avoid The Big Store it's difficult to imagine this being anywhere near the top of the list for any Marx Brothers fan. It's also not a great way to introduce anyone to their work as they're likely to not be very interested in seeing more and there are far better films for casual viewers who are not particularly interested in the Marx Brothers.The few hilarious scenes could easily be excised and work just as well if not better in isolation as random skits. But the film is very slightly recommendable for them.".

	schema:reviewBody "Halfway through The Big Store my Dad turned to me and remarked This is an uneven movie  some parts are great some are terrible some are boring and some are a scandal. I couldn't put it better myself and so I didn't try!.The scandalous parts are of course the scenes involving broad stereotypes.The Marx Brothers always walk a pretty fine line on the right side of good taste as much of their humor involves insulting women and authority figures. But that's their schtick and it's usually pretty harmless not to mention hilarious. It's only when they go after ethnic groups that they lose me. And yet I always laugh during the bed scene in this movie so maybe they don't really lose me I hate to say it but stereotyping IS often funny. But it's an uncomfortable kind of funny.It's a shame because the Brothers clearly aren't playing to their strengths in this movie. The final chase scene is good fun but not really their thing somehow the slapstick seemed better thought out in A Night at the Opera. Still they shine in several scenes most notably when Groucho first meets Grover and proceeds to insult him while simultaneously wooing Margaret Dumont with Romantic poetry. I also like Harpo's fantasy segment one of the more imaginative musical numbers from the latterday movies. I don't even mind the obligatory Handsome Young Man character as he's got a good rapport with Groucho but his bizarro Tenement Symphony which is mercifully excised from most TV versions really needs to go.I sound like I hate this movie but I really don't. Though it's clearly a big step down from the best of Marx The Big Store is still intermittently hilarious and even at its worst it's diverting. Lesser comedians would kill to be as good as the Marx Brothers on a mediocre day.".

	onyx:emotionText "Halfway through The Big Store my Dad turned to me and remarked This is an uneven movie  some parts are great some are terrible some are boring and some are a scandal. I couldn't put it better myself and so I didn't try!.The scandalous parts are of course the scenes involving broad stereotypes.The Marx Brothers always walk a pretty fine line on the right side of good taste as much of their humor involves insulting women and authority figures. But that's their schtick and it's usually pretty harmless not to mention hilarious. It's only when they go after ethnic groups that they lose me. And yet I always laugh during the bed scene in this movie so maybe they don't really lose me I hate to say it but stereotyping IS often funny. But it's an uncomfortable kind of funny.It's a shame because the Brothers clearly aren't playing to their strengths in this movie.

It was at this time that Mr. Thalberg got his wish when he brought the Boys to MGM. They came over but as the 3 Marx Brothers sans youngest brother Herbert alias Zeppo.NEXT they set out to make that ultimate Marx Brothers romp A NIGHT AT THE OPERA MGM 1935. The improved method was achieved by the use of testing out the material to be filmed and timing the laughs as the one knock on the previous Paramount product was that one laugh would drown out the set up for the next.THE new method worked. The team with Chico Harpo and Groucho received a new lease on life. They would be at Metro for about as long as had been their stay over at Paramount. Every thing was just honky dory for the team.AND then the frail and chronically ill Mr. Thalberg died the following year of 1936.

Whereas Thalberg had been artistically inclined cinematically motivated and was among the Brothers biggest fans the gruff Mr. Mayer was strictly for the bottom line practical pragmatic and allegedly hated the Marx Brothers.

THE BIG STORE starts out with setting up a sort of precursing of that which would come later like Chico's being a poor but honest and lovable piano teacher in cahoots with one young SingerSong WriterGood Guy Tommy Rogers Tony Martin who just happens to be inheriting half interest in a big major downtown type Department Store.THE Present Manager of the store one crooked and illtempered Mr. Grover just happens to be planning a nefarious plot to get control of the store by any means possible. Do you get the drift? THE Picture mixes in a great deal of musical numbers big ensemble songs and songs for Mr. Martin his female lead Virginia Grey as Joan Sutton as well as some others such as Virginia O'Brien and a group called Six Hits and a Miss.NOT to be thought of as being strictly a 'crepe hanger' we must say that even this is not the best Marx Brothers outing it does contain a lot of excellent bits and should not be boycotted by any means. Some excellent comic interaction is done between Chico  Harpo with one Italian immigrant Giuseppe Henry Armetta. We also are witness to a parade of on screen ethnicities done up in the typical stereotypes of the day. Italians Blacks Swedes American Indians and Chinese family groupings are part of the innocently meant and harmlessly received by the audiences of the day.OTHER critical cast members included in THE BIG STORE'S Directory are William Tannen Russell Hicks Anna Demetrio Paul Stanton Bradley Page Edgar Dearing and Al Hill.AND lest we forget the most important Lady to any Marx Film for what would Groucho do if a movie of the Brothers did not include Miss Margaret Dumont for the Grouch's horrid dalliances? PROMOTIONAL spots for this movie were done in a most unorthodox manner.

I nonetheless found it quite palatable for what it was the Marxes were in pretty good form here as were their regular foils Margaret Dumont and Douglas Dumbrille and the picture afforded them a fair number of good lines not familiar to me from reference books like the ones in CASABLANCA and situations the scene in Groucho's office already mentioned by Joe the bedding department scene featuring a typically flustered Henry Armetta and the hilarious climax in which even Dumbrille gets embroiled in the slapstick. Also it was nice to see Groucho and Harpo share some scenes as they usually interact more with Chico albeit separately.In the end I'd say that I enjoyed this film enough to make me want to purchase the barebones but thankfully lowpriced DVD from Artisan of the Marxes' independentlyproduced LOVE HAPPY 1949  which reportedly sports a pretty satisfactory transfer coming from this company. I had seen the film as a kid on Italian TV but while I remember individual scenes I can't recall what my overall opinion of it was!".

Tony Curtis gets to sing some truly terrible stuff like 'The Tenement Symphony'.  You get two cracks of both Chico and Harpo plus some little kids fake playing piano.Another problem is most of the movie is dedicated to Tony Curts the dull straight man yet another Zepposhaped hole Douglass Dumbrille the part of the conniving store ownermobsterdiplomatSanitarium owner that's in every Marx movie and of course Margaret Dumont the elderly old matron in every Marx movie...literally.  It's not to say that any of these people are bad actors it's just that I bought it to see The Marx Brothers not Tony Curtis and friends.But the Brothers don't fare too well either.  No one was really given anything good to do.  There are no brilliant bits that are still funny even today like the mirror sequence in Duck Soup.  There's just a long stopmotion chase thing at the end that really fails to entertain and some parts to do with beds and racial stereotypes.If you want to see a good Marx Brothers flick go for Animal Crackers Duck Soup or A Night at the Opera.

And the impressive swath that Harpo removes from a vamp's dress can't have pleased the Hays Office.";

The ditzy chase scenes towards the finale of the film although exaggerated and obviously performed by stunt doubles and stopaction or jerky photography were over the top for belly laughs. Harpo's mirrorreflection musical moment was a great deep breath of rest from his usual zaniness it was magic as was Chico's duet with him. For me born in 1936 my viewing it at still a tender age of nine or ten only made this little boy happy and delighted with the film. If I were to be critical at the age I am today I would say the film doesn't come close to what the Marx Brothers films intended from earlier works...but just see it again through the eyes and heart of the child I was and you'll agree that gee what a funny film the Big Store really was.".

	schema:reviewBody "...but still pretty bad. This does feel more like a Marx Bros. film than Go West does but some stuff doesn't fit as far as what we have learned about the brothers in all their earlier films. For instance Chico is funny because he is such a fake Italian but he is supposed to be real Italian in the Big Store and that just ruins it. Also it seems that Groucho only halfheartedly goes after Margaret Dumont and doesn't really ever insult her as usual. Another difference is that we see Harpo with Groucho before we ever see him with Chico which never happened in any other movie. There were a couple of laugh out loud moments for me though I can't remember any right now even though I watched it an hour ago but many more downs than ups. I hate hate hate the fast motion chase on skates I forgot I was watching a Marx Brothers film at the end it seemed more like an episode of the Munsters. I also found the Tenement Symphony with the candlelighted children to be quite creepy and boring at the same time. I have to say out of their 13 films I place this ahead of Room Service Love Happy and Go West so that would put it in 10th place I guess that's something to cheer for.".

No memorable dialogue or creative gags. It's a generic cookie cutter Blevel comedy of the 1940's that just happens to star the Marx Bros. The only life in the film comes from Douglas Dumbrille and the lovely Virginia Grey. The Marxes Groucho in particular seem to just be parodying themselves. Collect that paycheck boys! The great Margaret Dumont in her last Marx movie goes through the motions but is clearly having no fun. Tony Martin's insipid songs make me long for Zeppo. Be prepared to fastforward through all musical numbers as they are just dreadful. There are some very generous reviewers here on IMDb who seem to like this one. To each their own but in my opinion this one really is the pits.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not one of the Marx Brothers' best films. The main fault is the script. It concentrates too much attention on a rather corny plot although it does provide plenty of lines for our favorite villain Douglass Dumbrille. Its gags and comedy situations are not particularly witty and in fact are often rather strained. Proceedings are further dampened by two unmemorable songs for Tony Martin including a tedious finale called Tenement Symphony. The Marx Brothers have one number Sing While You Sell which has a catchy chorus and is fairly well staged with Groucho swooping along in front of the counters  but it falls quite short of their 1930's standard. Generally the Brothers make a game attempt to overcome mediocre dialogue and soso situations. That they are partly successful is due as much to their experience as their natural gifts but even they can do little with a particularly trite scene with Henry Armetta. The direction is no more than competent though the timing may have originally been sharper than Nervig's inept film editing makes it appear. For some reason Charles Lawton has gone all out for soft focus photography  though why he bothered to do this for such a charmless couple as Tony Martin and Virginia Grey is a mystery. Production values are otherwise good.".
