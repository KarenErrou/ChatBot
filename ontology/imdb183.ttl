	schema:reviewBody "What can one say about their favorite movie?  A movie that would make one laugh in suspense excited and even touched. A film that takes two personalities which clash and learn to get along with each other to where they actually care for one another in the end.  A film that touches one's soul is a film that one can consider to be their favorite of all time. Robert De Niro plays Jack Walsh a exChicago police officer who is currently a bounty hunter.  He works in Los Angeles for Eddie Moscone Joe Pantoliano who is a bail bonds man.  Eddie offers Jack a job to catch and bring back the infamous Jonathan the Duke Markukas Charles Grodin. Jonathan is a accountant who stole millions of Jimmy Serrano's Dennis Farina money and gave it all to charity.  Jonathan jumped bail and is in hiding.  Jack needs to find John bring him to the L.A. county jail within four days and Jack will collect 100 thousand dollars.  Jack does find John in New York City the first day.  But Jack has many people following him.  First there's the FBI led by Alonzo Mosely Yaphet Kotto who wants John to testify against Jimmy Serrano.  Second there's Tony Darvo Richard Foronjy and Robert Miranda Joey two dimwits working for Serrano who want John dead.  Then there is Marvin Dofler John Ashton another bounty hunter who wants John also but for a smaller price.     From there on it's a cross country trip which involve all of the men looking for Jack and John.  A film which has some very exciting moments with action.  Other moments where the scenes are intense where Jack and John's lives are in danger. And scenes where the two men share each other's thoughts and feelings which surprisingly makes the movie touching. The acting by De Niro is at his best.  He does his usual tough guy attitude but he also mixes it with some humor and emotions.  Charles Grodin is also great as the sensitive accountant who is the exact opposite of Jack's personality. And Dennis Farina is funny and scary as the outraged mob boss who has a vicious attitude. The music by Danny Elfman I find to be his career best. It's not like his famous BATMAN BETTLEJUICE or SLEEPY HOLLOW style of score.  It's more like a mixture classic Chicago rhythm and blues which even Elfman himself considered to be his most unusual score.      The writing by George Gallo is also excellent.  He manages to fit a cross country story within two hours of time while still bringing out personalities of the characters and making sure there are no holes in the plot.  He also manages to have some very funny scenes involving Jack and John. And the direction by Martin Brest is outstanding.  He keeps the movie at a very fast pace without any slowing down. He does brilliant moves like having De Niro and Grodin improvising their lines while arguing.  Brest also does a great job by making the film enjoyable for it's 125 minutes. This is a movie that touched me it can be considered a man's movie on the surface.  But take apart this film and it's also a film that women can enjoy also.  The most emotional scenes involve Jack seeing his exwife and daughter after not seeing them for ten years.  It shows that everybody makes a mistake in life and that we can all try to forgive people that emotionally hurt us.       People say that one can identify a person's personality by the movies and music that they like.  To find out what I am like pop in this movie into your DVD player or VCR and you'll see.  Saying this movie is better than CITIZEN KANE STAR WARS GODFATHER and GONE WITH THE WIND is a pretty bold statement. But the character of Jack Walsh shows my personality. This is the way I am therefore it's my favorite movie of all time. And I'm not the only one Robert De Niro said on a interview on Oprah Winfrey that this is his most enjoyable film that he's done.   out of five THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME".

And scenes where the two men share each other's thoughts and feelings which surprisingly makes the movie touching. The acting by De Niro is at his best.  He does his usual tough guy attitude but he also mixes it with some humor and emotions.  Charles Grodin is also great as the sensitive accountant who is the exact opposite of Jack's personality. And Dennis Farina is funny and scary as the outraged mob boss who has a vicious attitude. The music by Danny Elfman I find to be his career best. It's not like his famous BATMAN BETTLEJUICE or SLEEPY HOLLOW style of score.  It's more like a mixture classic Chicago rhythm and blues which even Elfman himself considered to be his most unusual score.      The writing by George Gallo is also excellent.  He manages to fit a cross country story within two hours of time while still bringing out personalities of the characters and making sure there are no holes in the plot.  He also manages to have some very funny scenes involving Jack and John. And the direction by Martin Brest is outstanding.  He keeps the movie at a very fast pace without any slowing down. He does brilliant moves like having De Niro and Grodin improvising their lines while arguing.  Brest also does a great job by making the film enjoyable for it's 125 minutes. This is a movie that touched me it can be considered a man's movie on the surface.  But take apart this film and it's also a film that women can enjoy also.  The most emotional scenes involve Jack seeing his exwife and daughter after not seeing them for ten years.  It shows that everybody makes a mistake in life and that we can all try to forgive people that emotionally hurt us.       People say that one can identify a person's personality by the movies and music that they like.  To find out what I am like pop in this movie into your DVD player or VCR and you'll see.  Saying this movie is better than CITIZEN KANE STAR WARS GODFATHER and GONE WITH THE WIND is a pretty bold statement. But the character of Jack Walsh shows my personality. This is the way I am therefore it's my favorite movie of all time. And I'm not the only one Robert De Niro said on a interview on Oprah Winfrey that this is his most enjoyable film that he's done.   out of five THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME";

	schema:reviewBody "Jack Walsh is an excop turned bounty hunter working for bailbondsman Eddie Moscone. Looking for another job to bring in Jack is presented with an exmob accountant Jonathon Mardukas who has ripped off the mafia for millions of dollars and has gone on the run. Using the very basic tricks of his trade Jack easily finds and catches his man and prepares to transport him back to Moscone and collect his pay. However with the FBI the mafia and other bounty hunters all looking to bring in Jonathon for differing reasons Jack has a hard road ahead of him  and that's before he discovers Jonathon's phobias about planes.In terms of cinema I remember the 80's for one main genre  the buddy movie the genre continues today but that is my overriding memory of the films I saw during this time and since then from the period. Hardly a dynamic hotbed or imagination and innovation the genre did throw up many films that are quite enjoyable if you meet them on their own terms and it did occasionally produce some that are very enjoyable and still stand up years later  for a combination of reasons Midnight Run is one of these and for my money is a great street smart comedy. Of course it is still a genre film but the plot is well written combining a reasonably engaging story with a fun series of set pieces. While it is not laugh our loud funny apart from maybe once or twice what it does manage is to have a comic tone to it and a great sense of fun and energy throughout. It is hard to describe but it is one of those films that just feels comfortable and fun to watch.A major part of this is the fantastic playing of the actors  the cast and their chemistry go a long way to making this a better film that it may have been in other less able hands. De Niro plays his wellpracticed tough guy but allows himself to be the butt of humour if not out and out jokes. What he and the writers did very well was to keep the audience on his side even though he was basically transporting Jonathon to his death! He comes off as a likable guy and De Niro takes what many other actors have made into a clichd part and really made it his own. His easy chemistry with Grodin also helps a lot and the two really so work together thanks to a good comic performance from him. Of course in a more serious film Jonathon as he was would be very unrealistic but Grodin's delivery suits the material and tone of the film perfectly. The support cast are all given minor roles to share out and they all contribute in their own little way. Kotto gives plenty of laughs with a minor character. Ashton has less time and a less likable character but still does OK Farina could not look more 'mob' if he tried Pantoliano swears a lot and is amusing while minor roles for the like of Walters and Hall add to the cast in cameos. While the film has a deep cast it really belongs to De Niro and Grodin both of whom really deliver and have an easy chemistry between them befitting the genre.If I had a complaint it would be the sheer volume of swear words in the film the first time I saw it was on ITV that most notorious of editors  they cut whole scenes out of Die Hard due to swearing! and it was cut to shreds with plenty of badly dubbed lines and scenes just removed due to language. Personally I'm not overly bothered by it but it is such a fun film that it seems a shame to make it unsuitable for children by such liberal use of the F word one or two can be forgiven but every other word pretty much makes it unsuitable but I suppose it is all part of the tough but fun tone of the film and I enjoy it regardless.Overall this is not one of the greatest films ever nor one of De Niro's best but it is a very very good genre film and in my mind stands out from many other buddystyle movies that have been made in the crimethriller sort of mould. The plot mixes a good story with many fun set pieces and keeps a solidly enjoyable pace all the way through while a roundly strong cast all make better use of the script than lesser actors could have done. A very enjoyable genre film and one that I will keep coming back to due to its reliable mix of pace energy fun and excitement.".

	schema:headline " A Road Movie Buddy Movie ComedyAction all Rolled into One";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the key ingredients for a successful movie is chemistry that evolves between actors playing particular characters. In the case of Midnight Run Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin are unlikely bedfellows as a bail bountyhunter and his bailjumper accountant who used to keep the books on a mobster who runs drug rings in Chicago and Las Vegas where else?. Jack Walsh De Niro has been hired by a sleazy bail bond firm in Los Angeles to bring back Jonathan the Duke Mardukas Grodin in 72 hours or everyone turns into pumpkins. His bounty is worth 100000 partially because the firm put up nearly one half a million dollars for the bail. If Grodin isn't brought back in time the courts will keep the bail money and the firm will be out of business.However it turns out there are other parties involved who also want Mardukas. The mildmannered accountant had been keeping the books on the mob for several years but didn't realize he was doing it for Jimmy Serrano one of the most notorious drug kingpins in Chicago. Before the events of the movie Mardukas upon realizing his involvement embezzled millions of the mob's drug money but made the fatal mistake of sending postcards to Serrano bragging about how he was using the money to fund charitable causes. He was arrested for being party to the mob but later skipped out on bail.The story begins with De Niro being hired to track down Mardukas to bring him back to Los Angeles although the mob might try to assassinate him before any kind of legal proceedings. Grodin still has in his possession all the goods on the mob their racketeering etc. So the mob decides they want Grodin before he is returned to custody. Then add to the mix the FBI who also gets into the act decides they need Grodin to help build their case against Serrano. If that isn't enough the bail bond firm distrusting De Niro hires yet another sleazy bounty hunter Marvin who also wants to get Grodin for the payback money.Walsh finds Mardukas at a mundane New York apartment with his wife. The original plan is to take him to LA via a plane but Mardukas claims that he suffers from a fear of flying and forces them to take a crosscountry trip. Midnight Run is essentially a cross between several genres a crosscountry chase movie a comedy a buddy movie an action movie. Not unlike the road movies of the 1940's the two characters end up in all kinds of strange locales across the United States from Chicago suburbs to the Arizona desert. They go by passenger trains stolen cars even a cargo train.Aside from the essential plot which is a bit fantastical in retrospect but plausible enough to suspend your disbelief during the course of the movie the real gem is the relationship between De Niro and Grodin. I don't think these actors had ever played in a film before this pairing and yet they seem strangely natural together. De Niro as Walsh is the cigarettesmoking hardtalking urbanite who looks like his clothes were laundered last in the 1970's. By contrast Grodin is the softspoken suburbanite accountant who thinks in terms of practical decisions the complete opposite from De Niro.

	onyx:emotionText "One of the key ingredients for a successful movie is chemistry that evolves between actors playing particular characters. In the case of Midnight Run Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin are unlikely bedfellows as a bail bountyhunter and his bailjumper accountant who used to keep the books on a mobster who runs drug rings in Chicago and Las Vegas where else?. Jack Walsh De Niro has been hired by a sleazy bail bond firm in Los Angeles to bring back Jonathan the Duke Mardukas Grodin in 72 hours or everyone turns into pumpkins. His bounty is worth 100000 partially because the firm put up nearly one half a million dollars for the bail. If Grodin isn't brought back in time the courts will keep the bail money and the firm will be out of business.However it turns out there are other parties involved who also want Mardukas. The mildmannered accountant had been keeping the books on the mob for several years but didn't realize he was doing it for Jimmy Serrano one of the most notorious drug kingpins in Chicago. Before the events of the movie Mardukas upon realizing his involvement embezzled millions of the mob's drug money but made the fatal mistake of sending postcards to Serrano bragging about how he was using the money to fund charitable causes. He was arrested for being party to the mob but later skipped out on bail.The story begins with De Niro being hired to track down Mardukas to bring him back to Los Angeles although the mob might try to assassinate him before any kind of legal proceedings. Grodin still has in his possession all the goods on the mob their racketeering etc. So the mob decides they want Grodin before he is returned to custody. Then add to the mix the FBI who also gets into the act decides they need Grodin to help build their case against Serrano. If that isn't enough the bail bond firm distrusting De Niro hires yet another sleazy bounty hunter Marvin who also wants to get Grodin for the payback money.Walsh finds Mardukas at a mundane New York apartment with his wife. The original plan is to take him to LA via a plane but Mardukas claims that he suffers from a fear of flying and forces them to take a crosscountry trip. Midnight Run is essentially a cross between several genres a crosscountry chase movie a comedy a buddy movie an action movie. Not unlike the road movies of the 1940's the two characters end up in all kinds of strange locales across the United States from Chicago suburbs to the Arizona desert. They go by passenger trains stolen cars even a cargo train.Aside from the essential plot which is a bit fantastical in retrospect but plausible enough to suspend your disbelief during the course of the movie the real gem is the relationship between De Niro and Grodin. I don't think these actors had ever played in a film before this pairing and yet they seem strangely natural together. De Niro as Walsh is the cigarettesmoking hardtalking urbanite who looks like his clothes were laundered last in the 1970's. By contrast Grodin is the softspoken suburbanite accountant who thinks in terms of practical decisions the complete opposite from De Niro. During the entire film Grodin needles De Niro about his habits and eventually his relationships including his exwife and daughter. At first the two dislike one another particularly De Niro towards Grodin but by the end something has changed.A really fun movie a bit madcap in places but the real treasure is the chemistry between De Niro and Grodin. Throughout the movie there are several ongoing jokes but the one that stands out is maybe in the next life meaning that De Niro and Grodin could have been friends under different circumstances. Although I wouldn't go as far as to say this is a terribly deep movie it's almost perfect escapist fair.";

It is the only movie I can watch again and again because it just never gets old. It is the perfect duo of opposing personalities in Deniro and Grodin. It's a shame they haven't been paired up in other movies because these two characters make the movie. I even let my 9 year old watch it because there is nothing gory or scary and there is no sex  just a lot of swears. And frankly without the swears it is not nearly as funny. I've seen it on regular censored t.v. and when they replace fck with hell it definitely loses something. This would probably be rated PG13 nowadays given the language. The cast of other characters from the bail bondsman to the other bounty hunter to the mafia to the police is also incredible. Whoever chose the cast in this movie deserves an award  and so does the screenplay and the movie. It has it all  comedy constant action drama some mild child friendly cops and robbers type violence some good bad and ugly and just an outstanding and memorable story line. My son is 9 and he loves it. Any younger than 9 and the kids probably wouldn't quite understand it because there are so many different characters and so many things going on  they might have a lot of questions. Otherwise if you don't have a big problem with some serious foul language and one reference to sex referenced with the f word only it can be a great family movie that everybody will totally enjoy!!!".

The film is full of tense and exciting moments of action and humour from both De Niro and Grodin who in this film I think are both at the top of their game. Their chemistry in playing hard ass bounty hunter and sensitive criminal is fantastic. It is such a shame there was no talk of a sequel in mind especially since it is such an original and cool story and we were gagging to see De Niro return as Jack Walsh again. The film also gives us an impressing supporting cast with Dennis Farina Snatch Get Shorty as an angry mobster and Yaphet Kotto Alienas an angry cop on the trail for them both.An easy 1010.

There has been many attempts a regurgitating the story line from my fellow commenter's so I will go in a different direction.The Deniro character is awesome. Most Deniro fans will have to see this movie a couple of times to understand his comedic brilliance in this movie. The interaction between Deniro and Grodin is incomparable. It has been rumored that Grodin aggravated Deniro so much on the movie set that it brought out the best in these two actors in the film.The soundtrack is marvelously written by Danny Elfman. I have one question on the soundtrack...who is that playing the Slide and Electric Lead Guitar on the soundtrack? Is this Danny Elfman himself? There is not any listed credits for the musicians so it is impossible to tell who it is...but suffice it to say that the slide guitar player sounds like Ry Kooder on Steroids. The music complements the chase scenes like I haven't heard or seen in many years.If you do not have this movie in your collection BUY IT. It is one of those movies you can watch every couple of months and never get bored with it or its characters.Jim Morris".

No longer do you have to spend hours searching through the racks in out of the way video stores or resort to fourth generation bootleg copies. 'Ciao Manhattan' is a case in point. I'd been curious about this movie ever since reading Jean Stein's brilliant Edie Sedgwick bio 'Edie' back in the 1980s and now here it is! The 30th Anniversary edition with excellent picture commentary and deleted footage. The only people who seem more excited about seeing it again than me are the directors John Palmer and David Weisman themselves going by the chatty and informative commentary track they have made with 'Ciao Manhattan' costar Wesley Hayes. For those who don't know Edie was The Face of 1965 a beautiful socialite turned model and Warhol superstar. At one point in the 1960s quite possible the coolest girl in the world. Very shortly thereafter she was almost forgotten and died aged 28 after a drug overdose. 'Ciao Manhattan' is made up of black and white footage shot in 1967 originally intended for a never finished movie that almost accidentally starred Edie and later colour footage filmed in an attempt to salvage the project. In the final version Edie plays a character called Susan a former model and underground film star who has retreated to her mother's home for treatment. She's a mess  has permanent brain damage and a drinking problem. Hayes plays Butch a young Texan drifter who picks Susan up while she is hitchhiking half naked down the highway. He returns her home and Susan's mother Isabel Jewell hires him to babysit her troubled daughter. The movie cuts between now and then colour and black and white documentary footage and paranoid sci fi fantasy. It's quite a trip! Anybody interested in Andy Warhol or The Velvet Underground will want to see this very strange but watchable mess. Neither Warhol or The Velvets actually appear mind you but Warhol scenesters like Paul America Baby Jane Holzer Brigid Berlin Brigid Polk and Viva do as do Beat legend Allen Ginsberg as himself mostly naked and 'Barbarella' director Roger Vadim clothed as Susan's doctor. If you watch the outtakes you also get to see Robert and Nena Thurman. Yes Uma's folks. 'Ciao Manhattan' may not thrill everyone but for me it's essential viewing for anyone interested in 1960s pop culture especially Warhol's Factory which subsequently influenced almost every underground pop movement thereafter from punk on down.".

Manhattan shocked and angered me when I first saw it in 1972 because I had known Edie. For several months in 1962 when she was in a very tony lowsecurity psychiatric institution in Westchester I knew her as a sweetnatured somewhat reticent and very artistic 19yearold. When I first met her I thought she was a 12yearold child as I was for she was so thin and underdeveloped looking for her age. Seeing the way she is abused in Ciao! Manhattan just leaves me feeling very sad for her. She deserved better than this exploitation film.As for the Summer of Love reference made by an earlier reviewer on IMDb referring to the fact that this film was actually made partly in 1967 I do not think Ciao Manhattan represents any of the genuine feelings of free expression and loving attitudes that were touted at the time. There is far too much cynicism inherent in this film to connect it in any way to the hippie happiness one could experience in pleasanter circles than that inhabitedcreated by the ghastly selfish meanspirited and selfinvolved Warhol. He used and threw away such gentle souls as Edie. I weep for the lost and underappreciated life she led while under the influence of Warhol. In kinder company she might have survived and been happier.Ciao Edie! You deserved better.".

The director's commentary explains that Vedecchio was only added to the movie because during shooting the rest of the cast disappeared and there was nothing else to do but beefup this role. In fact the whole movie is a cutandpaste of premeltdown Edie black and white footage and postmeltdown Edie color with Vedecchio and Paul America tossed into the mix. The color section also introduces Butch the drifter from Texas who does provide some muchneeded comedy.Although Ciao Manhattan might not be particularly entertaining on its own the DVD extras in the Anniversary package are wonderful and to me made the disc worth purchasing. The directors' and ButchWesley's! commentary provides the story of how this movie directed itself and informs much about Edie and her state of mind during the last days of her life.

	schema:reviewBody "A silver lipstick stained blueprint to the Big Come Down era Ciao Manhattan is by technical standards very bad. Though the color sequences are well photographed and the older clips seem well reproduced the narrative is clumsy and the sound is choppy. This doesn't bother me and whereas I would like to see a coherent documentary on Edie the flaws of the film are perfect alongside the flawed characters in the film.

This is ironic considering the fact that her personal reality is the focus of the entire film and that herEdie's own mortal coil is unraveling faster then footage can record it. But the cameras are tenacious and keep rolling thru her staged shock treatmentsa true event to her last chance at a normal life marriagea true event captured on 8mm complete with a Warholsque posterized sequence and finally a news clipping of her obituary.The film serves well as a cautionary tale to the contemporary modern girl with SusanEdie as the prototype modern girl trying anything new without regard to the consequences. i.e. forced stardom derelict emotions mood management drugs radical psychotherapy techniques and even a botched breast job. This has all become a common lifestyle todayin 2006 perfected by time and human casualty. SusanEdie was an incidental trailblazer in a filmlifestyle where the sun shines too white hot for human beings to bare it yet is too intoxicating for the obsessive ones to turn away from. Like a pretty lactose intolerant lab rat that keeps eating the cheese in spite of the gas pains SusanEdie was caught in a maze of learned behavior and couldn't resist it's unhealthy escapism's even though she must have felt the grim reaper's hand on her emaciated shoulder. As long as she was feeding her head and all eyes where on her she really lived. She only snuffed it after filming had concluded and she was faced the realism of a sober off camera existence. The book Edie An American Biography is required reading if you want to get the most out of this film and may be all you can take. Not for the mentally squeamish.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ciao! Manhattan is an avantgarde film that makes the films of JeanLuc Godard seem conventional. That's not to attack Godard mind you. I'm just comparing the two to express how far out Ciao! Manhattan is. The slight narrative concerns a young Texan hippie traveling the American countryside just because he likes to see things. One night he sees something quite unexpected a beautiful young woman with bare breasts hitchhiking. He picks her up who wouldn't? and finds that she has a couple of dog tags around her neck with her name Susan and address on them. He takes her home. Susan's mother thanks him and offers him a job taking care of her daughter. Susan was a young model in New York a discovery of artist Andy Warhol. She lived a life of hard partying and is now paying for it with a severe case of brain damage. Now Susan lives in a drained pool in her mother's back yard and she spends endless hours drinking hard liquor and rattling off stories about the old days in New York.At first Ciao! Manhattan just seemed to me an excessively playful experimental film with a bunch of bizarre imagery and editing and stuff. I was laughing it was fun to see the excesses of that subculture which I know so little about. But after a while the film just started working and really well. Susan is played by Edie Sedgwick who really was a protege model of Andy Warhol. The film works a fine balance between reality and fiction. How much of Sedgwick are we seeing? Is any of it fictional. She died three months before the film was released and edited into the last moments of the film there is a shot of a newspaper headline that announces the death. Whether Ciao! Manhattan was meant to be or not it serves as a dirge not only to Edie Sedgwick but to the young generation of the time.I don't know maybe I loved this film because I grew to adulthood so far after the hippie generation but I'll tell you one thing I have seen a ton of the greatest films ever made. It's a rare experience to come upon one that is as unique as this one. Perhaps there were a thousand films like this at the time but none are available except this. Well I choose to praise this. 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are two reasons i've looked up this movie. The first is the Factory Girl 2006 with Sienna Miller in the lead role which had mostly mainstream approach to Edie's life. In comparison to that Ciao! Manhattan is a ockumentary although unintentionally dark.The second is Madonna's video for Deeper and Deeper which somewhat capitalized on Edie's image during her Warhol years. At the time of the video's release internet and DVD were the tools of the future so finding more information had to wait.Since i know more about Edie Sedgwick now i can only say that Ciao! Manhattan mercilessly exploits her even after her death. The blackandwhite footage is showing some of her pastimes while being Warhol's muse or shortly thereafter. There is nothing glamorous about it since we know that chemistry is boosting her creativity. The footage in color displays the consequences of those wild years.In terms of or absence of plot Ciao! Manhattan is in line with avantgarde contemporary movies of the era. On the other hand it shows the outcome of longterm substance abuse. It was unclear to me whether Edie was acting or brainstorming during the color sequences.We may argue that Edie had already been in need of professional help even before meeting Andy Warhol and his bunch. But even then Ciao! Mahnattan send shivers up your spine while showing her life being wasted while authors get credits for artistic merit.".

	onyx:emotionText "There are two reasons i've looked up this movie. The first is the Factory Girl 2006 with Sienna Miller in the lead role which had mostly mainstream approach to Edie's life. In comparison to that Ciao! Manhattan is a ockumentary although unintentionally dark.The second is Madonna's video for Deeper and Deeper which somewhat capitalized on Edie's image during her Warhol years. At the time of the video's release internet and DVD were the tools of the future so finding more information had to wait.Since i know more about Edie Sedgwick now i can only say that Ciao! Manhattan mercilessly exploits her even after her death. The blackandwhite footage is showing some of her pastimes while being Warhol's muse or shortly thereafter. There is nothing glamorous about it since we know that chemistry is boosting her creativity. The footage in color displays the consequences of those wild years.In terms of or absence of plot Ciao! Manhattan is in line with avantgarde contemporary movies of the era. On the other hand it shows the outcome of longterm substance abuse. It was unclear to me whether Edie was acting or brainstorming during the color sequences.We may argue that Edie had already been in need of professional help even before meeting Andy Warhol and his bunch. But even then Ciao! Mahnattan send shivers up your spine while showing her life being wasted while authors get credits for artistic merit.";

Edie was one of those troubled rich girls who died young because they only found solace in drugs and booze. Certainly an interesting individual. Of course for me it is difficult to respect any socialite since the ones we've had the last two decades have given these people a bad name.Ciao! Manhattan is a combination of two films a blackandwhite production made shortly after Sedgwick's exit from the Warhol Superstars from 196667 and color footage from 197071. Sedgwick plays herself albeit with the name of Susan Superstar as she lives in a tent in the pool of her Mom's mansion boozing and drugging herself to death while some drifter from Texas named Butch halflistens and halfdreams while she talks about her sordid life in New York.I found the film to be 90 minutes of druggy dialogue. Ms. Sedgwick was clearly drugged up during the color segments. You needed subtitles to understand what she and Butch were saying. I also saw it as an overlong YouTube video where somebody is pleading for help. She's asking in vain for somebody to help her and the clowns who are supposed to listen to her cries for help are too busy screwing around. Sadly for Edie her entire 28 years were a total mess. I doubt even today you could save her. She was the Amy Winehouse of her day.These people associated with Andy Warhol were quite an eclectic group and it is certainly worth watching any material you can find of them to see what the excesses of the 1960's did to them. I still wonder what happened to those drug addicts in the Roliing Stones' CS Blues but we already know what happened to Ms. Sedgwick.".

But more as a dramatic piece based on the 'Poor Little Rich Girl' that fascinated Andy and many at The Factory that knew Edie before the general public did. The story was loosely cobbled together from Edie's personal history the hoopla of the 60's counter culture and art and fashion revolution and the deflation and enterprising of the whole hippie drug and free love spirit that was doomed by the end of the decade. Edie herself was literally a 'last minute fill in' to play the lead of Susan. As the initial actress went on to other projects So in a strange twist Edie was brought in to play someone else playing herself with liberty. As surreal dislocated and conspiracy strewn as the movie is it becomes that much more meaningful and believable when one realizes it's Edie more or less 'living the part'. So what was initially drawn up as a 'high end titty film' to profit from the drive in draw and Edie certainly shows a great pair through the majority of the film turns into this unwitting vigil recounting her actual past current demise and tragic and untimely end.

Russell Rouse who had just done D.O.A. decided to direct an espionage drama that falls just short of 90 minutes without containing a single word of dialogue.

	schema:reviewBody "The Thief stands as the first American Film since Charlie Chaplin's City Lights without any spoken dialogue.Directed by Russell Rouse this 1952 noir is a propaganda film without any of the leaden antiCommunist dialogue that other films of this type contain. In fact the film has no dialogue! It's funny how first impressions stay with you. When I first saw The Thief it was at a Film Noir series at the Film Forum Theater in New York.The Thief stands out for its special way of objectifying the isolation of the central character with film elements such as moodinducing lighting scripting and especially music.The lack of dialogue and Ray Milland's marvelous performance visually communicating the angst and secretive nature of the lead character is something to see to appreciate.What stands out in this film is the lack of dialogue. At the outset this motivates us to watch more closely than if we were given dialogue to help drive the action along.With its blast of a raining phone in the very first frame of the film as the camera moves over to show us the anxious Allen Fields lying fully dressed on his bed waiting we understand that sound and sight over spoken language is what will be the currency of this film.Hats off to Ray Milland and the wonderful score because just as in the early films of the silent period all the plot points of the film are understood trough purely visual means pushing the film to the level of pure cinema.The musical score for the film that Herschel Burke Gilbert composed says volumes about the character Allen Fields and his emotional state.Gilbert received an Academy Award nomination for his music score for the film and one watching will tell you why. Gilbert creates swells and moods to support the facial expressions and other physical language that Milland utilizes to show us what is happening with Fields and his eroding state of mind.The dialogueless film is definitely a stylistic approach to this subject matter. It is very unusual but primarily because we are used to a dialoguedriven plotted film style.The technique does begin to seem forced into the second half of the film especially in exterior scenes where one would normally hear people talking as ambient sound.The scenes with the FBI would have some sort of dialogue especially in those where agents are being prepped on who to investigate.Once the viewer gets with the approach that the filmmaker is taking though the lack of dialogue can be understood as part of the overall theme of he voiceless nature of the Spy character in films.Some things are left unexplained though and this could have been added to create more depth in the story line. We never learn why Fields is stealing secrets for the enemy. Is he being paid? Is there a wife being held captive? These pieces of the puzzle may help. Without them the story feels poetic without substance.Ray Milland gets extra credit for creating such a memorable performance. His Allen Fields seems cut from the same cloth as his character from The Lost Weekend angstdriven without solution.No one can drink whiskey or smoke a cigarette quite like Ray Milland with his sense of exclusive attitude while simultaneously embroiled in some deep emotional turbulence.For anyone interested in Film Noir styling taken to exceptionally expressive levels this film will show you things you may not have seen before.The night exteriors are textbook noir examples of lighting and camera. In this case the ambient sounds of the Washington D. C. locations are contrasted well with those of the New York City locations especially the wide shot of Milland's Allen Fields arriving in the beautiful Pennsylvania Train Station before it was demolished.Although the interiors are stage sets there is attention paid to creating surroundings that support the 'silence' of spy Allen Fields especially the cagelike apartment where Fields waits for his final phone call.".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't' be put off by the 'gimmick' of a dialogfree movie. THE THIEF is an engrossing extremely wellmade movie. Right off the bat we can expect quality with Ray Milland in the lead the man could act. And THE THIEF is a graphic demonstration of how acting requires much much more than good linereading. Milland immerses himself in the drama from the word go and we almost never think of him as an actor until the end when the impact of the film really hits. This is a powerful performance in the league of some of the best from the silent era only more realistic in style. Russell Rouse presents us with a story that bristles with suspense in some scenes. First time around it may be a slight challenge to know what's going on but it's soon clear that exact details are not important. We only need to know that Milland plays a Washington D.C. scientist who is microfilming topsecret government documents and passing them on to agents who remain obscure. His main contact is played very nicely by Martin Gabel an actor with a face perfect for sinister wordless intrigue.Just as important as the acting and directing is the music score. Hershel Burke Gilbert must have outdone himself for this project. This is an excellent score. Never obtrusive always supportive of the action pleasing but never calling attention to itself. The music really makes the film work. An example of how intelligent the approach to the scoring is comes at the film's climax when Milland is followed to the very top of the Empire State Building the music stops completely for about ten minutes. The effect is downright Hitchcockian  an extremely effective sequence.Also worthy of mention is the persistent use of locations D.C and New York in 1952 are almost characters unto themselves. This is another superb film that document the bygone look of some great urban locations. Very highly recommended.".

There are perfectly good noirs without a femme fatale or without chiaroscuro lighting or outside of an urban setting. And not all noirs have the trademark snappy dialogue... the crisp lines distinctive lingo backbiting remarks. So why not a noir with NO dialogue? Not a word is uttered in this look at a nuclear physicist selling secrets to an unknown enemy. We see him Ray Millard in a bravura performance smuggling out photos we see the convoluted machinations of the spy ring the procedures of the authorities trying to catch him and we see him wrestle with fear doubt conscience. When dealing with a gimmick film several questions come up. Is the gimmick pulled off well? For the most part yes. There is one cheat where we see a teletype of police communication but other than that it stays true to the conceit without seeming forced. There isn't a moment where you think This scene really needs some dialogue. Is the gimmick distracting? Yes and no. I was always aware of it in the back of the mind but it wasn't annoying me or anything. Would the film be better without the gimmick? I don't think so. Again there wasn't a scene where I felt dialogue was essential. We're spared the gungho narration of a docudrama like House on 92nd Street and there's a refreshing ambiguity in that we have no idea nor do we really care who this enemy is or how Milland got involved with them. These unanswered questions are rare in noir or in any movie of the period. And putting aside the lack of dialogue it's a nice tight thriller with a mighty fine chase scene psychological tension great location work and a very good score which becomes especially important in this case.".

He pretty much pulls it off. We very rarely get to read any written messages but his expressions tells us much of what we need to know. He's tortured with guilt throughout. He sweats profusely not from the heat but from the cupidity. And there are closeups of his face so that the slightest change in his facial muscles registers on the Richter scale. The extreme closeups are sometimes odd  a telephone receiver pressed against an ear  but they tend to break up the sometimes irritating visual flow of figures coming and going without ever speaking. The director also breaks up the stream of traditional shot with some overhead angles.One of those figures doesn't have to speak. Rita Gam as his provocative neighbor slinking around in her loosely tied dressing gown is astonishing sexy and extraordinarily attractive in an Arabic kind of way an houri out of scripture looking a little like a plumplipped Cher. I don't know why Milland before tearing up his fake identity didn't move in with Rita Gam for a while. After all the guy is in for a long stretch in the slams and maybe the hot seat. Might as well have one last fling. Looks like it would have been sufficiently memorable to last him a lifetime.But the film raises a question. Why make a film with no dialog?

Hitchcock used only a lifeboat in the movie of the same name but it generated a palpable sense of isolation and despair.

I have doubts about haiku in English as well a form devised for use in a foreign language whose syllables don't correspond to English.In any case the silence here is a little distracting to be honest but the story  simple as it is  is engaging enough to keep a viewer from being bored.

It fell to Ray Milland and independent producer Harry Popkin to get this project finished and released by United Artists.Without dialog other elements in the film have to carry the story along and two of them are there. The facial expressions of Ray Milland who is on screen for about 90 of the film are marvelous. The second is the Oscar nominated score from Herschel Burke Gilbert. But the third for silent films are those all important titles inserted where needed so you followed the story where the writer and director wanted to go.Those titles might have explained Milland's motivations for what he was doing as a scientist who is doubling as a spy. Whatever they were the anguish on Milland's face told you this was not something he was doing willingly. As The Thief was made in 1952 at the height of the Cold War there were certain parameters in how the story had to end and they were followed.Some things need no dialog however. Rita Gam made her film debut as a slinky and sexy woman in the next apartment. Those looks she gives to Milland and that sexy body language need no words.The Thief is an interesting and somewhat entertaining film from Milland which while it doesn't succeed totally is still something to be checked out.".

But the third for silent films are those all important titles inserted where needed so you followed the story where the writer and director wanted to go.Those titles might have explained Milland's motivations for what he was doing as a scientist who is doubling as a spy. Whatever they were the anguish on Milland's face told you this was not something he was doing willingly. As The Thief was made in 1952 at the height of the Cold War there were certain parameters in how the story had to end and they were followed.Some things need no dialog however. Rita Gam made her film debut as a slinky and sexy woman in the next apartment. Those looks she gives to Milland and that sexy body language need no words.The Thief is an interesting and somewhat entertaining film from Milland which while it doesn't succeed totally is still something to be checked out.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie really shows how powerful and captivating can the image be. I don't understand why this movie is seldom mentioned for the big public. Nobody has doubts that Casablanca or Citizen Kane or so many others are great movies but this movie can also be enjoyed by many people and means something very innovative at the moment it was shot. I got astonished when after 20 minutes I hadn't heard any voice I didn't know in advance that the movie had no dialogues. However the story was intriguing enough and the situations had so much suspense that I watched it without missing dialogues. Of course the spies were communists and it's a produce of the cold war time but this fact does not impact on the quality of the script. Ray Milland was an actor so remarkable that his acting makes the film believable. He shows the anguish and fear of a man who is doing something very grave treason and is being shadowed. He was so good actor that at the end of the movie when he's about to go aboard one can read his mind and guess his final decision. After all he is not a crook or a murderer but rather a man of science and not violent so the reasons that lead him to the final decision have to do with his conscience an innocent man is being accused of something that he did and another man was killed by him The cinematography is superb I enjoyed specially the way it shows the streets and buildings of the cities. The script is subtle and full of brilliant details. The music is very good and well sync. Really a masterwork. Maybe the long silent scenes that JeanPierre Melville or Jules Dassin had in their movies could've been inspired by this film? Very recommended.".

All of this is done in an intelligent way with the narration wellwritten and clear and the sound effects welljudged with none of them feeling out of place to spoil the mood.The Thief is very well made. Its use of camera work and editing is quite innovative in the use of angles while the lighting and scenerysets are quite striking.

	schema:headline " Silent information";
	schema:reviewBody "'The Thief 1952' sets itself apart from other Cold Warera thrillers  and indeed from most films released after 1930  because it unfolds entirely without dialogue. Directed by Russell Rouse the film uses its deliberate silence not merely as an unusual gimmick but as a legitimate storytelling device to internalise the guilt fear and frustration of its protagonist. In most films characters get worries off their chests simply by talking to others  but to whom can Allan Fields talk? Not to his fellow Communist spies who must never be seen in his company and whose convictions he doesn't necessarily share. Certainly not to friends or family whose wayoflife he is betraying to the enemy. Lonely and segregated Fields Ray Milland simply goes about his painful duties his inner torment consistently repressed behind a strained pretense of nonchalance. Only when he murders a young FBI agent does his anguish spill forth into physical and verbal form in a pitiful outpouring of grief and emotion.Despite a slow first half in which Fields' typical espionage duties are introduced via a lot of silent waiting 'The Thief' picks up substantially once the American authorities catch wind of his crimes. Rouse cultivates some truly thumping suspense sequences including a magnificent stairway pursuit up the thentallest building in the world the Empire State. This breathless flight from the 88th floor observatory to the 102nd floor and beyond serves as a convenient allegory for Fields' Communist involvement. As an FBI agent rushes in pursuit Milland's character tries repeatedly to escape through service doors on each floor only to find them locked each time. Throughout the film despite wishing to abandon his treasonous practices Fields consistently finds his path to freedom blocked his only option to continue what he's been doing further implicating himself with each staircase he ascends. When inevitably cornered high above New York City ironically defenseless at the pinnacle of human achievement Fields desperately lashes out at his aggressor and does the unthinkable.In spite of my reservations that only a lowbudget film could get away with such an anachronistic style 'The Thief' does in fact boast excellent production values. Sam Leavitt's cinematography is graceful but with an edge of documentaryrealism. I particularly enjoyed the lurid confusion of Fields' nervous breakdown perhaps a nod to Wilder's 'The Lost Weekend 1945' with an increasinglyclaustrophobic Milland filmed from above like an insignificant pawn as specks of blood appear to permeate the walls. Despite his Oscar Ray Milland is one of his generation's most underrated leading men and he handles an exceedingly difficult role with poise and empathy just watch Fields' pang of guilt every time he glances at the Capitol Dome a symbol of American nationalism. Despite its sympathetic portrayal of a Commie spy the film is nevertheless patriotic as it must have been at this time. Indeed Fields' ultimate decision to confess everything to the FBI comes not with the realisation that he is a bad person but the realisation that he is a bad American.".

	schema:headline " No talking in the library";
	schema:reviewBody "'The Thief' is a gimmick film and the gimmick is more interesting than the film itself. Without the gimmick this movie is a fairly banal Cold War drama. The central character is an American nuclear physicist played by Ray Milland who at regular intervals gives classified information to spies for a foreign power. The enemy nation is never identified but surely it's either the Soviet Union or a Soviet satellite nation acting as intermediary for the Kremlin. Eventually the physicist's guilt and his latent patriotism overcome his other motivations and he turns himself in.The gimmick is that this featurelength film tells its story without any dialogue. I've seen at least one reference book which lists 'The Thief' as a silent film. That's incorrect 'The Thief' has a soundtrack with conventional ambient sound throughout the film and occasional human noises such as grunts and screams ... but no coherent dialogue.The gimmick is an interesting one but it becomes wearying. On at least three occasions in this movie Milland's character is home alone when his contact man rings him up. We see Milland staring in horror at the 'phone as it rings. And it rings. And it rings some more. Once we realise that there's never going to be any dialogue in this movie we also realise that Milland isn't going to pick up the 'phone. It's not quite clear what's happening here. Is Milland allowing the 'phone to ring unanswered because the number of rings constitutes some sort of signal between Milland and his contact man? Or is Milland supposed to answer the 'phone but he's too gutless to pick it up? Anyway each time the ringring routine commences it always ends the same way eventually the scene fades out with the 'phone still ringing and then we fade in to Milland on his way to the next rendezvous. At several other points in the film the narrative gets bent out of shape to enable the action to proceed without dialogue in a situation where plausibility makes dialogue essential. By the way I really dislike any movie in which a 'phone keeps ringing or a baby keeps crying and we're forced to listen to this because nobody on screen responds to the situation.'The Thief' benefits from some extremely realistic locations notably in one sequence in which Milland drops off his microfilm by sticking it in a drawer of a card catalogue in a reference library. Dozens of people are present and none of them notice what he's doing. Also the hushed atmosphere of the library makes the movie's nodialogue gimmick  in this particular scene at least  very plausible. The contact man in this scene is played by Martin Gabel an American actor who affected a crisp midAtlantic accent it's interesting to see Gabel here in a role that doesn't rely on his distinctive speaking voice. There's also a suspenseful sequence in which Milland must climb an outdoor stairway to deal with a 'tail' who's been surveilling him.On the negative side of the ledger we get that old atombomb clich which has afflicted other movies better than this one including 'Torn Curtain' and 'Pickup on South Street' namely that a mathematical formula is somehow so powerful that spies will want to steal it. That's nonsense that is. The atomicbomb secrets which were bandied about by Rudolf Abel and Julius Rosenberg were specific engineering schematics of military ordnance. In 'The Thief' Milland is just peddling algebraic equations ... and we're expected to believe that these fiddly bits of maths can somehow change the balance of power.The basic implausibility of this film's premise strained even farther by the notalking gimmick is made a lot more bearable by the documentarystyle cinemaverite techniques used throughout. Not one shot in this film looks like a studio setup. At one point one of Milland's contacts who has just picked up the latest microfilm steps into a crossing and blunders into the path of an uncoming vehicle. A woman pedestrian sees this and she reacts. Because of the nodialogue gimmick which makes this seem like a silent film with dubbedin sound effects I expected her to react silently. Impressively she screams the movie would have lost all remaining plausibility had she not done so.Ray Milland a seriously underrated actor despite his Oscar gives a strong performance in a role which allows him only a very limited emotional range and no dialogue at all. 'The Thief' would have been much more plausible if it had skipped the nodialogue gimmick and told this movie conventionally. But without the gimmick this would be a much less interesting film the gimmick is much more compelling than anything else that's on offer here. I'll rate 'The Thief' 6 points out of 10.".

That's incorrect 'The Thief' has a soundtrack with conventional ambient sound throughout the film and occasional human noises such as grunts and screams ... but no coherent dialogue.The gimmick is an interesting one but it becomes wearying. On at least three occasions in this movie Milland's character is home alone when his contact man rings him up. We see Milland staring in horror at the 'phone as it rings. And it rings. And it rings some more. Once we realise that there's never going to be any dialogue in this movie we also realise that Milland isn't going to pick up the 'phone. It's not quite clear what's happening here. Is Milland allowing the 'phone to ring unanswered because the number of rings constitutes some sort of signal between Milland and his contact man? Or is Milland supposed to answer the 'phone but he's too gutless to pick it up? Anyway each time the ringring routine commences it always ends the same way eventually the scene fades out with the 'phone still ringing and then we fade in to Milland on his way to the next rendezvous. At several other points in the film the narrative gets bent out of shape to enable the action to proceed without dialogue in a situation where plausibility makes dialogue essential. By the way I really dislike any movie in which a 'phone keeps ringing or a baby keeps crying and we're forced to listen to this because nobody on screen responds to the situation.'The Thief' benefits from some extremely realistic locations notably in one sequence in which Milland drops off his microfilm by sticking it in a drawer of a card catalogue in a reference library. Dozens of people are present and none of them notice what he's doing. Also the hushed atmosphere of the library makes the movie's nodialogue gimmick  in this particular scene at least  very plausible. The contact man in this scene is played by Martin Gabel an American actor who affected a crisp midAtlantic accent it's interesting to see Gabel here in a role that doesn't rely on his distinctive speaking voice. There's also a suspenseful sequence in which Milland must climb an outdoor stairway to deal with a 'tail' who's been surveilling him.On the negative side of the ledger we get that old atombomb clich which has afflicted other movies better than this one including 'Torn Curtain' and 'Pickup on South Street' namely that a mathematical formula is somehow so powerful that spies will want to steal it. That's nonsense that is. The atomicbomb secrets which were bandied about by Rudolf Abel and Julius Rosenberg were specific engineering schematics of military ordnance. In 'The Thief' Milland is just peddling algebraic equations ... and we're expected to believe that these fiddly bits of maths can somehow change the balance of power.The basic implausibility of this film's premise strained even farther by the notalking gimmick is made a lot more bearable by the documentarystyle cinemaverite techniques used throughout. Not one shot in this film looks like a studio setup. At one point one of Milland's contacts who has just picked up the latest microfilm steps into a crossing and blunders into the path of an uncoming vehicle. A woman pedestrian sees this and she reacts. Because of the nodialogue gimmick which makes this seem like a silent film with dubbedin sound effects I expected her to react silently. Impressively she screams the movie would have lost all remaining plausibility had she not done so.Ray Milland a seriously underrated actor despite his Oscar gives a strong performance in a role which allows him only a very limited emotional range and no dialogue at all. 'The Thief' would have been much more plausible if it had skipped the nodialogue gimmick and told this movie conventionally. But without the gimmick this would be a much less interesting film the gimmick is much more compelling than anything else that's on offer here. I'll rate 'The Thief' 6 points out of 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "An interesting entertaining yet somewhat underrated little western WILL PENNY was one of the last worthwhile western efforts to emanate from Hollywood in the sixties. Produced by Fred Engel and Walter Seltzer for Paramount Pictures in 1968 it was beautifully written and directed by Tom Gries. This would be Gries finest movie and the picture for which he is best remembered. He died in 1977 of a heart attack while playing tennis at 55 years of age. It is a great shame really since with this one movie he revealed a remarkable flair for film. Stunningly photographed in widescreen and colour by the great Lucian Ballard the picture was also buoyed by a haunting score from veteran composer David Raksin Laura.Aging and illiterate cowboy Will Penny Charlton Heston has just finished up helping to bring in the last herd of cattle before winter sets in. He signs an X to draw his pay and must now look for another job to see him through the winter months ahead. Luckily he gets a line camp job with a large and remote cattle spread watching out for any strangers or drifters who might interfere with the straying cattle. But he finds the isolated cabin he is allotted in the area to be occupied by a woman Joan Hackett and her young son Jon Gries. Unable to turn them out to the mercy of the elements he allows them to stay little knowing that later a growing attachment will develop between all three. Later after a confrontation with the murderous and loony Preacher Quint Donald Pleseance and his equally murderous sons Will finds now that he must defend the woman and the boy against them. The picture ends in an exciting shootout and the welcome dispatch of the devious preacher and his cohorts.Performances are excellent from all concerned. Heston gives one of his very best performances as the aging cowpuncher who just cannot commit himself to the woman and the boy. His Will Penny is an absorbing and compelling portrayal of a man who cannot accept the involvement of anyone else coming into his life. A life in which he had never experienced family ties or domesticity of any kind and now resigns himself to the fact that it's too late for him to try for it. The illfated Joan Hackett she died in 1983 of ovarian cancer at 49 years of age couldn't be better as the lonely woman desperately wanting that commitment and there's a nice performance too from the director's nine year old Jon Gries as the boy. Also notable are those in smaller roles like British actor Donald Pleseance as the formidable baddie and there are welcome appearances from Slim Pickins Ben Johnson Anthony Zerbe and Lee Majors in his first film. The music by David Raksin is memorable as well. There is a lovely and haunting main theme heard throughout the picture and is transformed into an arresting ballad sung by Don Cherry over the end titles and a tender love theme is heard during the film's softer moments.WILL PENNY is by no means an explosive shootem up western for it is essentially a love story. But besides having moments of real charm there is a modicum of exciting action here and there. Overall WILL PENNY is beautifully written and directed beautiful to look at and beautifully played out by a wonderful cast.".

	schema:reviewBody "The tough lonely life of the cattle drover as it really was is briefly related in the ideal opening scene of Tom Gries' Will Penny with an aching Charlton Heston compelled at the end of an exhausting cattle drive to take a humble winter job in the cold bleak hillside... His turbulent crude oppressive  virtually celibate existence  is marvelously exposed by Gries...Heston portrays with honesty and sensitivity a middleaged cowhand free and easy who ignores everything about farming... He is a lonely rider who takes his bath eight or nine times a year and mends his own clothes... He is a good steady hand concerned for Mrs. Allen and her son but bad scared before and bad sorry after. He is also a helpless man with uncertain future a sincere cowboy extremely sensitive...Will Penny is an extraordinary film... Not only does it feature Heston's most sincere and sensitive performance it has a fine supporting cast and is one of the most adult Western scripts ever written...Joan Hackett portrays Mrs. Allen with strength and dignity never collapsing beneath the strain of her tribulations... Donald Pleasance is the most dastardly villain to grace the screen in many long years... He is mean unkind and slightly insane... Bruce Dern is equally effective as one of his sons the psychotic who handles a knife just fine.Realistically spared Will Penny is a straightforward and honest film a sincere attempt to recreate the Old West and more important the mighty good men who lived therein...".

	onyx:emotionText "The tough lonely life of the cattle drover as it really was is briefly related in the ideal opening scene of Tom Gries' Will Penny with an aching Charlton Heston compelled at the end of an exhausting cattle drive to take a humble winter job in the cold bleak hillside... His turbulent crude oppressive  virtually celibate existence  is marvelously exposed by Gries...Heston portrays with honesty and sensitivity a middleaged cowhand free and easy who ignores everything about farming... He is a lonely rider who takes his bath eight or nine times a year and mends his own clothes... He is a good steady hand concerned for Mrs. Allen and her son but bad scared before and bad sorry after. He is also a helpless man with uncertain future a sincere cowboy extremely sensitive...Will Penny is an extraordinary film... Not only does it feature Heston's most sincere and sensitive performance it has a fine supporting cast and is one of the most adult Western scripts ever written...Joan Hackett portrays Mrs. Allen with strength and dignity never collapsing beneath the strain of her tribulations... Donald Pleasance is the most dastardly villain to grace the screen in many long years... He is mean unkind and slightly insane... Bruce Dern is equally effective as one of his sons the psychotic who handles a knife just fine.Realistically spared Will Penny is a straightforward and honest film a sincere attempt to recreate the Old West and more important the mighty good men who lived therein...";

The Inyo County California locations are wonderful and the cowboys at work scenes are refreshingly honest.The basic storyline serves as a template to work more on character development and the cast full of western stalwarts do not disappoint.Charlton Heston as Will Penny is on great form as the vulnerable middle aged man of the plains. He is a little backward but unfailingly truthful and decent. He and his friends Blue and Dutchy represent the best principles of old west comradeship and his approach to Mrs Allen and her son H.G shows with tenderness what he has craved to have all his life but knows it is too late to embrace.I found Donald Pleasence a bit over the top as the evil Preacher Quint but his portrayal is entertaining if nothing else. Ben Johnson Slim Pickens and Lee majors all do a good job in support and Joan Hackett is completely convincing as the lone mother in search of a better life.Very much a film for those viewers who like to experience feel and be touched by a well written story and its characters.".

The scenery is perfect the great west during a harsh winter after a long cattle drive. We feel like we are there.The initial pace of the screenplay is slow and plodding. But this is intentional. It gives us a feel for the dreariness of a common cowboy's bleak life in the late 19th Century. Later the pace picks up.Charlton Heston is convincing as a tired aging wrangler who really doesn't have much to show for his life. Joan Hackett is just plain enough looking to be real but attractive enough to become the love interest. A great actress she passed away prematurely.Donald Pleasence and Bruce Dern are frighteningly convincing as a homicidal religious zealot and his psychopathic son. They personify the cults of violent people that occupy the back recesses of society and only come out to work evil on the rest of us. These two are very scary.Heston and Hackett's love is believable and so is the gun play. Yet there is no gratuitous sex or violence. Will Penny is well produced and thoroughly entertaining.".

	schema:reviewBody "Charlton Heston is an aging cowboy in Will Gries' 1968 gritty Western Will Penny. This is not the West of larger than life heroes men of rugged independence and strength just ordinary men without glamor who have to struggle for a living in a tough bitter and lonely environment. Will is a loner not a tough guy with a romanticized image but he is a survivor. After one job comes to an end Penny takes off to look for work along with two companions Blue Lee Majors a young cow hand and Dutchy Anthony Zerbe a more experienced worker. Along the way after a dispute over an elk Will and his friends are attacked by Quint Donald Pleasance the most demented preacher this side of Harry Powell Night of the Hunter. When one of Quint's sons is killed the preacher vows revenge and we know we haven't seen the last of him.When Will inquires at a roadside inn about the nearest doctor for Dutchy who accidentally shoots himself he meets Catherine Allen Joan Hackett and her young son Horace known as Button Jon Gries on their way to Oregon to find her husband. After leaving Dutchy in the care of a doctor Will finds a job for the winter at the Flatiron Ranch as a line rider keeping squatters off the property. When he arrives at the line rider's cabin however he finds Catherine and her son living there after they were abandoned by their guide. When Will is suddenly attacked by the Quints and left to die in the cold Catherine nurses him back to health and he soon develops a close attachment to Catherine and Button.When Will realizes that he cannot force Catherine and HG to leave he agrees to let them stay during the winter and they spend Christmas together and the story becomes both a tale of conflict with the Quints and his growing love for a married woman. Although we root for Will to overcome his reluctance to take risks we know that Will has known nothing but handling cattle cannot read or write and has little selfconfidence or belief that he can ever change. There are many familiar faces in Will Penny Slim Pickens Donald Pleasance Lee Majors Anthony Zerbe and Bruce Dern. This outstanding ensemble cast produces a Western that is authentic and intelligent and is probably Heston's best performance of his career.Interestingly the film opened in the New York's R.K.O. Coliseum at Broadway and 181st Street a neighborhood theater in which I spent many boyhood afternoons and even worked as an usher. The Coliseum was one of the most attractive movie theaters in New York and as described at the time had a lovely oval opening surrounded with a wooden railing from which it was possible to look down from the balcony onto the first floor. Like many movie palaces of my youth it is gone now but the memories remain.".

	schema:reviewBody "Peckinpah's flamboyant 'The Wild Bunch' and Leone's innovative spaghetti westerns of the 1960s are among my all time favourites but the stir they created overshadowed some gems that are now unfairly overlooked  Brando's 'OneEyed Jacks' and Monte Hellman's 'Ride In The Whirlwind' and 'The Shooting' immediately spring to mind. Those three movies all have strong cult followings just ask Quentin Tarantino! but for some reason the same can't be said for 'Will Penny'. I don't know why as it's one of the best westerns I've ever seen. Charlton Heston is of course a MOVIE STAR and also a controversial figure because of his politics but sometimes people seem to forget that he could be a damn fine actor when he tried. I think 'Will Penny' is his best performance. Heston plays a low key character an aging cowboy who is tired of his life but believes it is all he can do. Maybe this is the main reason why 'Will Penny' has been forgotten. He's basically a decent guy not a larger than life John Wayne hero or a Clint Eastwood antihero. Heston regards Tom Gries' script as one of the finest he's ever read and I must agree with him. Gries was a TV veteran but this was his big break as a motion picture director. Despite the talent he showed he never became a name director though he worked steadily until his death in the mid70s and was responsible for a few well known films including the Manson movie 'Helter Skelter'. Heston is surrounded by an impeccable supporting cast. His two buddies are played by a young Lee Majors and Anthony Zerbe 'Cool Hand Luke' 'The Omega Man'. Joan Hackett is very good as the woman squatter Penny befriends her on screen son is played by Tom Gries real life son who is also excellent. Donald Pleasence is fantastic fun as a crazed preacher and he and his eldest son played by Bruce Dern one of my all time favourite actors make terrific villains Dern is always a terrific villain!. Western legends Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens play a ranch foreman and a cook respectively and then there's character actors galore  G.D. Spradlin Clifton James William Schallert Luke Askew Matt Clark Roy Jenson. Off the top of my head it's difficult to think of a 1960s western with a more impressive cast. 'Will Penny' is a movie crying out to be rediscovered! I highly recommend it to western fans.".

Never a Heston fan....I was very pleasantly surprised  taken by his Will....he gives a fine understated performance as the aging loner just looking for his next job..to get through the winter till he can hook up with a cattle drive in the spring. Heston is excellent free of the melodramatics  overacting found in some of his other work. Will is an aging cowboy a loner an illiterate faced with the prospects of a dim future. He is someone who realizes that he can't do anything else but what he has been doing all his life..he punches cattle because it's the only thing he's ever done and the only thing he knows how to do......even as railroad tracks laid on the prairie indicate that time may be running out for the cowboy way of life. Nearing fifty he has never learned to read or write and existed moving from one job to the next...Along the way..there's a chance encounter w Quint ....the psycho preacher and his degenerate sons Rafe  Rufus   Romulus..featuring Donald Pleasance in a maniacal..over the top performance..  Bruce Dern as one of his loony sons. These guys could give the Hammond Brothers Ride the High Country a run for their money.There's also Joan Hackett in a lovely subtle yet solid performance as Catherine Allen  a woman travelling across country w her young son in search of her husband who had gone on ahead ...through whom Will sees a life he never had.. never thought possible. The film is notable in that it presents not at all a romantic image of the West..Cowpunching not being a glamorous profession....not a lot of 'Yeehas' here... it's a life of solitude and hard work.. The work is brutal... hired one day and out of work the next....... Yes..there is action..fistfights..gunplay  violence...but the first fistfight..shows us the kind of territory we're in...get it on..get it over with.. Here we see the kind of people who must really have inhabited the West..cowpunchers.families looking for a better life... sure there were bounty hunters bank robbers marshalls...shootouts at High Noon..the OK Corral etc. .....but this is more of a character study of people very much like us. In one of the gunfights...a cowboy sustains a bullet wound in a way that's atypical of western movies..but probably pretty typical of the real West.Another nice touch is the town Will Blue  Dutchy ride into...many towns really did consist of nothing more than a couple of buildings ..a few shacks and a tent. The direction was superb Lucien Ballard's cinematography added to the splendor of the story. ..filmed in the glorious Inyo Mountains of California.The music in the movie is mostly uninspired  although by no means terrible or distracting..Some fine familiar character actors are here.. the can't be anything but great Ben Johnson appears as the top hand at the ranch where Will takes a job riding line... William Schallert Clifton James and Anthony Zerbe all deliver good performances. Lee Majors is passable.In short..Will Penny is a film that deserves to be seen  enjoyed..  savored.".

Joan Hackett also gives a great if somehow delicate performance. Donald Pleasence is a delight as always as the sadistic Preacher Quint and there's good support from Lee Majors in his major film role Anthony Zerbe and Ben Johnson both of whom sadly never really get to do much character actor Slim Pickens in a small role and Bruce Dern in one of his countless villain parts. And Gries is good as the boy.The cinematography is beautiful especially once the story moves to the snowcovered terrain where much of the film plays out. A little slow at first but the pacing soon picks up and moves nicely. My only complaint is that the film's score is at times overbearing and distracting but not enough to ruin the enjoyment of the film.

He questions his choices he makes mistakes... but he plugs stubbornly on. Makes more mistakes. Moves on. There are only a handful of unglamorous but wistful westerns that ring true due to character WILL PENNY is one of the best of them. It's amazing that this lowkey classic was done around the time of PLANET OF THE APES which boasts a tour de force performance by Heston the difference in the characters both of whom are rendered believably with the craft of a consummate professional only points up the amazing range of this superstar. ALWAYS interesting even in bit parts Charlton Heston never failed to rise to the occasion... or to come back down to earth when the situation warranted it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Charlton Heston's saddlesore cowpuncher is one of the most understatedand underrated performances in an outstanding career he's a man nearing the end of the proverbial ride and he's all too aware of it. He questions his choices he makes mistakes... but he plugs stubbornly on. Makes more mistakes. Moves on. There are only a handful of unglamorous but wistful westerns that ring true due to character WILL PENNY is one of the best of them. It's amazing that this lowkey classic was done around the time of PLANET OF THE APES which boasts a tour de force performance by Heston the difference in the characters both of whom are rendered believably with the craft of a consummate professional only points up the amazing range of this superstar. ALWAYS interesting even in bit parts Charlton Heston never failed to rise to the occasion... or to come back down to earth when the situation warranted it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Possible SpoilersAlthough Charlton Heston has made a number of Westerns he has never been regarded as one of the great Western actors like John Wayne or Clint Eastwood probably because he has played such a great variety of other roles. 'The Big Country' is probably the best of his films in this genre although he only played a supporting role. 'Will Penny' is probably his best Western in which he had the main starring role. The film is more downbeat and realistic than many Westerns which try to give a heroic or glamourised image of the West. The central figure Will Penny himself is not the cowboyashero but the cowboyasaverageworkingman tired disillusioned middleaged badly paid and having difficulty finding work. Is it significant that his surname is the name of a lowvalue coin? He eventually finds employment as a 'line rider' on a ranch a demanding and lonely job which involves him riding long distances to guard his employer's property. On one of his trips he discovers that a young woman named Catherine Allen and her son Horace abandoned by their guide while traveling overland to California to join her husband have taken refuge in a hut in the mountains. Although he is under strict instructions not to allow trespassers to remain on the property Penny takes pity on them and allows them to stay. Penny has earlier fallen foul of an outlaw family having killed one of them in selfdefence during a quarrel over a dead elk. The patriarch of the family and his surviving sons swear vengeance track Penny down beat him and leave him for dead. Penny's earlier kindness is rewarded when Catherine finds him takes him in and nurses him back to health throughout the long winter. The two find themselves becoming drawn to one another but danger threatens when the outlaws reappear. The two leading roles are both well played. Charlton Heston states in his autobiography that a number of wellknown actresses turned down the role of Catherine possibly because she script described her as 'plain'. Joan Hackett then littleknown was far from plain but was excellent in the part. Hackett made relatively few feature films before her career was tragically cut short by her early death but her performance as the practical but tender Catherine shows that she had real talent. Heston himself is equally good bringing out both Will Penny's resigned worldweariness and his fundamental decency. There are also moments of humour between them especially when Catherine tries to persuade the reluctant Penny to take a bath.There were other things about the film which were perhaps less good. The first half seemed very slowmoving although there was more action in the second. I was not really convinced by Donald Pleasence as the leader of the outlaws. Despite his name Pleasence seemed to specialize in playing unpleasant characters I wonder if he ever considered changing it to Unpleasence. His character here known as 'Preacher Quint' although he does not seem to be an ordained minister of any church is for my taste too exaggerated and cartoonish to seem really threatening. He is the sort of character who would be more at home in a tongueincheek Western than he would in a serious one. There have been other Westerns where the temptation to overplay the villains has detracted from an otherwise serious film 'Hannie Caulder' is another example. Despite my reservations this is still one of the better Westerns of the late sixties. An added bonus is the visual beauty of the scenery against which it is shot. Most of the action takes place in winter and we are treated to some marvelous scenes of the snowcovered mountains. This forbidding wintry landscape is perhaps symbolic of Penny's disillusionment and the toughness of his life. This is a very watchable film both for its acting and its cinematography. 710".

While trying to get the injured Dutchy to a doctor he encounters a husbandless woman Catherine Allen Joan Hackett and her son Horace Jon Gries son of director Tom Gries with the woman not thinking very highly of him for leaving Dutchy in the wagon during winter. While Blue sees to Dutchy Penny moves on ahead and gets a job as line rider for a flat iron ranch he goes out to get the lay of the land and finds Catherine and her son using the shack that's supposed to be his after being abandoned by their guide. Since no one but employees are allowed on the property he gives her one week to move on. Shortly after that Penny is ambushed by the vengeful Quints left for dead Penny manages to get back to the cabin where he is nursed back to health by Catherine and Horace. Without his horse he doesn't have much choice but to wait till the winter passes before he can get back to the flat iron ranch and move on. During that time Penny and Catherine bond as he begins to see into a world he never knew existed alas it is not to be for Penny feels he is too old for her and too old to start over and moves on yet again  but not before circumstances force him to face the Quints again and defeat them once and for all.Charlton Heston an actor often unfairly even viciously criticized for either his acting his politics or both cited Will Penny as one of his personal favorites from the pantheon of films he made and it's easy to see why. It is a thoughtful insightful film offering an unromantic yet not cynical view of the Old West. It is simply put a just the facts ma'am look at the Old West. The Old West may have been pretty to look at but it sure wasn't easy to live in. It also gives Heston usually cast as a larger than life hero in some grand epic film or something of the science fictional nature the rare chance to play an ordinary man a man simply trying to get by doing the best he can with the only job he knows how to do people who only know him as the guy who yells Damn You All To Hell! at the end of 'Planet of the Apes' should watch this film and see the tragic yet hopeful nobility he brings to Penny it truly was one of his best roles but somehow it never got the recognition it deserved which is a shame. Joan Hackett is equally good as Catherine the lonely soft spoken single mother who longs for a better life for herself and her son. However as good as the film is it does have one nagging flaw the Quints. With Bruce Dern Gene Rutherford and Donald Pleasance in particular as the hypocritical patriarch Preacher Quint all over acting rather badly in their roles the Quints come off as cartoon characters rather than realistic antagonists. While it is definitely satisfying to see this clan of sadistic frontier trash killed in the climax of the film the cartoonish quality of the three performances makes them feel out of place with the film's more realistic and somber tone.Still a fine film at the end of the day. Do not miss this forgotten classic!".

Directed and written by Tom Gries who refused to sell the rights to his story unless he could direct Will Penny is an understated Western Recowboy movie for those that need to distinguish the two that shines because it relies on strength of story over histrionics and a pandering to the norm. This is no ode to the wild west a time of gunslingers fighting it out and riding off into the sunset with the dame. This is the nitty gritty west where cowboys are actually that cowboys working with beef so that they can afford to eat and perhaps enjoy a jar of throat stripper by way of a reward for their graft.It's also refreshing to find a romance within the genre that is believable and not thrust upon us like some form of necessity. The relationship and in fact the three family dynamic at the core of the film is expertly written not rushed or underdeveloped and crucially not hurt by the bold and correct ending that Gries delivers. Hackett gives a lovely subtle turn opposite Heston in a role that was turned down by a host of prominent female actresses at the time. Fine support comes from Pleasence rightly overacting the role Ben Johnson Lee Majors Bruce Dern Anthony Zerbe and Slim Pickens. While Lucien Ballard's cinematography is lucid and adds splendour to the moving story. I can't say that David Raksin's score totally works since it at times feels like it belongs in some Universal Pictures creature feature! But it's a minor issue in what is an elegant Western that deserves no demands to be sought out by more people. 810".

Fine support comes from Pleasence rightly overacting the role Ben Johnson Lee Majors Bruce Dern Anthony Zerbe and Slim Pickens. While Lucien Ballard's cinematography is lucid and adds splendour to the moving story. I can't say that David Raksin's score totally works since it at times feels like it belongs in some Universal Pictures creature feature! But it's a minor issue in what is an elegant Western that deserves no demands to be sought out by more people. 810";

	schema:headline " Can't Roast Chuck Here";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers. Well this is one western they got pretty much right writing and direction casting performances score are all well above the expectable and easy.Tom Gries whose name I recently discovered is pronounced Gryes and not Greaze both wrote and directed this film and overall did a fine job of it. The script has the ring of authenticity. See the elephant was a current expression. I don't know about Big Auger and Stud Duck but they sound right. His direction is unusually good too. The movie begins just before dawn so we feel these working cowboys still have sleep in their eyes and need hot coffee. A conflict between Chuck and a younger hand who harrasses him about his age is handled deftly with Chuck only responding when necessary finally bonking the younger man on the head with a skillet. Chuck is no fastest gun in the west just an exhausted cowhand trying to get the job done and maintain some modicum of dignity. The solidarity found within isolated male groups is handled deftly. When the herd is delivered after a long and arduous trek the hands split up. There are a few muted compliments exchanged but no newage hugs or tears despite the intensity of the friendships. Chuck's partners Lee Majors and Anthony Zerbe always an interesting actor who does a neat German accent here hook up with him and the trio find themselves in a shootout with a group of rawhiders over a dead elk. Here the film weakens a bit. The rawhiders are a thoroughly villainous group totally lacking in humanity. Their patriarch Donald Pleasance as Paw is a religious hypocrite and his sons are no better. Bruce Dern's first line in the movie is one he utters to his father during negotiations over the carcass  Kill 'em Paw. They're all onedimensional characters and seem to be in the movie mainly to provide an opportunity for violent conflict. Anyway if the cowboys are having such a hard time finding work in the winter how in tarnation are the rawhiders making a living? What IS a rawhider?In the next act probably the best Chuck is confined wounded to the line rider's hut up in the snowy mountains. His accidental companions are Joan Hackett and her young son two stranded Californiabound travelers with no real future in the Golden State. They nurse him back to health and civilize him a bit teaching him Christmas songs and so forth. Chuck is at his most interesting in these scenes. He rarely projects selfconscious awkwardness in his performances but he manages it here. His defensive explanation of why he only takes seven or eight baths a year is hilarious. In the Spring why you give yourself a REAL GOOD ONE. His performance here makes his Marc Antony look wooden.Joan Hackett looks the part. Her hair is piled on top of her head unglamorously and she tends to keep her gaze lowered as if afraid to look directly at the sort of reality that Chuck represents. Her voice though sound straight out of Smith or someplace. Alas she died at an early age. I realize they had to have a kid in this movie. But did Horace have to be so cute with one buck tooth sticking out of his freckled face? Did he have to be called H. W. and be referred to as the button? Ugh. Did he have to wave at the departing Chuck at the end when the retreating horseman was too distant to hear him out of Shane? I surely do wish that kid had been ugly. Still the last conversation between Chuck and Hackett is touching. She out of ignorance argues delicately that they can begin a ranch or a farm and live on love. He on the other hand brought up in a more rigorous practical way explains why it's too late for him to begin over. I'm damn near fifty years old. Ben Johnson is here too and looks just like what my idea of a ranch foreman ought to look like. Unsmiling unsentimental and fair. The rest of the supporting cast is equally good.The musical theme by David Raksin Laura consists of a main theme of a melancholic but not tragic hue and fits the story. It bounces along rythmically but not symmetrically like a horse plodding over uneven ground.The incidents are sometimes overscored. Over the closing credits there is a horrifying set of lyrics imposed on the main theme  A man is only a man. . . does the best he can  defacing what has come before it. It's a naturalistic Western for the most part. Lucien Ballard's photography is impeccable. This isn't Monumental Value. It's the windswept Great Plains. Unglamorous as hell. If you have a chance to catch this one do so. It's a decent film. And it's Heston's best film effort as far as I'm aware.".

	schema:headline " Merry Christmas!";
	schema:reviewBody "A scant two months after the February 1968 release of Planet of the Apes Hollywood legend Charlton Heston was back on the big screen in the lesserknown film Will Penny. Since 1959's The Big Country one of this viewer's alltime faves though it does not seem to be highly regarded Heston had only appeared in one other Western 1965's Major Dundee but his work in the '68 oater seems to be generally viewed as some of the finest that he ever gave us. Here he plays the titular Penny an aged cowpuncher who when we first encounter him is being razzed by his fellow hands about his senescence at the end of an earlywinter cattle drive. Penny as he later admits is damn near 50 years old a pretty advanced age in the late 19th century milieu in which the picture seems to be set. At loose ends for work Penny takes a job as a line rider for the Flat Iron Ranch only to find that his lonely winter cabin has been invaded by squatters a young married mother Joan Hackett and her 8yearold son Jon Gries reallife son of the film's director Tom Gries. Against his better judgment Penny allows the two to winter with him especially after the mother Catherine Allen tends to the horrible wounds that Penny receives at the hands of the lunatic Preacher Quint a particularly overthetop performance from Donald Pleasence and his deranged sons. And by the time Christmas rolls around Penny is feeling the stirrings of romantic and paternal love for the first time. But is it too late in life for this itinerant cowpoke to have a shot at that kind of domestic happiness?As mentioned above Heston is just terrific here as Penny. Just witness how movingly choked up he becomes when the young boy who he nicknames The Button hugs him on Christmas Eve how shamefaced he seems anytime his illiteracy becomes apparent and how embarrassed he is as he reveals that he cannot sing a single Christmas carol. Heston's excellent work is matched here by an outstanding cast of supporting players including Hackett's understated portrayal and Pleasence's maniacal thesping look at how crazed Quint seems as he dances that jig!. In smaller roles Bruce Dern as the preacher's hateful son Anthony Zerbe as one of Penny's cohorts here in one of his earliest films Lee Majors in his first film AS Lee Majors and here playing another of Penny's pards Ben Johnson who actually WAS a cowboy at one point and here playing Will's foreman and the great Slim Pickens as an ornery cook as well as Clifton James and William Schallert all get their moments to shine. The film was beautifully shot by veteran cinematographer Lucien Ballard who had been lensing Westerns since the mid'30s and who would the following year lend his great talent to the Western classics True Grit and The Wild Bunch. Much of the film was shot in the desolate splendor of the Inyo National Forest in Inyo County California how any location so close to Death Valley could look so very wintery is beyond me but the film IS often visually spectacular. Adding to the film's charm is the score by famed composer David Raksin and if this background music isn't as beautiful or memorable as the piece that Raksin wrote for the great film noir Laura in 1944 actually how COULD it be? it is a nice one nevertheless his theme song The Lonely Rider is even more so. And then there is director Tom Gries also the screenwriter of the film whose script is a model of authenticity and who does a wonderful job with all his performers. Gries had only directed television programs previous to this his first theatrical work but would go on to helm such exciting Westerns as 100 Rifles 1969 and Breakheart Pass 1976.I mentioned the picture's authenticity a moment ago and that realistic feel is engendered in any number of ways. For one thing as the adult Jon Gries reveals in a modernday DVD interview all the weapons used in the film were authentic museum pieces not props. The cowhands in the film employ slang terms that many including myself might be unfamiliar with such as bull nurse bar dogging riding grubline stud duck line rider and rawhiders their clothes look realistically grubby and the twobuilding towns that they ride into are convincingly dilapidated. Most authentic though is the relationship between Penny and Mrs. Allen that develops over the course of the film and the realistic manner in which their mutual attraction plays out. The film may not fully satisfy all viewers in this regard but at least one must admit that the screenplay is adult and intelligent. Functioning at once as a snapshot of the lonesome cowboy existence a touching and poignant romance and a rousing Western adventure Will Penny manages to succeed on all three fronts. It may just surprise those viewers who believe that Heston reached his thespian peak portraying Moses and BenHur in late'50s blockbusters. As it turns out his Will Penny may stir you emotionally more than both of those earlier characters put together!".

For one thing as the adult Jon Gries reveals in a modernday DVD interview all the weapons used in the film were authentic museum pieces not props. The cowhands in the film employ slang terms that many including myself might be unfamiliar with such as bull nurse bar dogging riding grubline stud duck line rider and rawhiders their clothes look realistically grubby and the twobuilding towns that they ride into are convincingly dilapidated. Most authentic though is the relationship between Penny and Mrs. Allen that develops over the course of the film and the realistic manner in which their mutual attraction plays out. The film may not fully satisfy all viewers in this regard but at least one must admit that the screenplay is adult and intelligent. Functioning at once as a snapshot of the lonesome cowboy existence a touching and poignant romance and a rousing Western adventure Will Penny manages to succeed on all three fronts. It may just surprise those viewers who believe that Heston reached his thespian peak portraying Moses and BenHur in late'50s blockbusters. As it turns out his Will Penny may stir you emotionally more than both of those earlier characters put together!";

The film was made just before all the moral codes were out the window meaning you get a fair amount of profanity but it's mostly just damn.

However into his rather dull and routine existence comes Joan Hackett and her son the director's reallife son. Winter in approaching and they are tossed together in the wildernessleading to some great dialog touching scenes and a burgeoning romance. Unfortunately into this nice little world come Donald Pleasance as the Preacher and his insane children who are hellbent on revenge and terrorizing Heston and company.This is an exceptional Western because it is unique and defies the usual silly clichs associated with the genre such as a perfect happy ending. As for me I hate these fictional imagesespecially since I am an American History teacher and I know the Roy Rogers and Gene Autry style versions of cowboys are all a lot of hooey. Instead of a ridiculous Hollywood image of the West with shootouts in the street Indian attacks and a biggerthanlife hero this film features characters that really could have existed back then. No these characters were not superheroes but real people placed in situations that draw us in thanks to the wonderful script by the director. Also the script is generally easygoing and stresses some of the mundane realities of life in the mountains long ago. Despite this the film never gets boring because the characters are written so well and the acting with one exception is superb and understated. My only complaint and it's a small one is the character of the Preacher. He seemed rather silly and hard to believean odd anomaly into this otherwise perfect picture. And the idea of a Biblequoting nut is a silly and overused stereotype. Still he's not a huge part of the film and the overall effort makes this a mustsee film and a great departure from the norm.By the way the DVD includes a few extrasincluding a nice little featurette where you learn some great details about the film. The director and writer of the film had no idea that his own son would be cast in the film in a very important part despite inexplicably getting such low billing. How all this occurred was a really neat accident. Plus the interviews with him Heston and others really helped make the film come alive.".

Some have criticized Jodie Foster's directing but I found the film to be very balanced with the right amount of comedy and tragedy. I loved the camera work and editing especially with the Beaver as its own character. I also liked the secondary storyline about the teenagers. All the performances were very good. I think the entire movie is very well done and although I have not changed my personal opinion of Mel Gibson at all the movie does make you very sympathetic towards families dealing with crisis including his own and as an actor he pulls off a very difficult role.".

And speaking of highs and lows who better than a bipolar actor to not only accept a stigmafied role of someone with a mental disorder but also to get past that and offer the meat and potatoes of entertainment as well? Full disclosure I am on Team Mel when it comes to an ex girlfriend making headlines with her personal life with reckless disregard for the personal and professional toll an overkill gesture followedup ultimately by withdrawal of charges. . .I won't get into debates over context and word choices in someone's private conversations or during a fit of rage. But others like to and perhaps for that reason I was only one of about 21 people in the late showing of The Beaver opening night at the Varsity in Toronto cinema 8. Apparently the VIP cinema there had a screening that started 20 minutes earlier but I don't know how that or earlier screenings were attended. I'm hoping the movie does better. Even with a small crowd the audience I was in responded with laughter where appropriate and the atmosphere was often charged with anxious energy. Jodie Foster is very dear in her own performance and her directing choices don't falter. Mel gives glimpses of his goofy persona and one can speculate about which bits of whimsy might have been his contributions but he also lets us dislike the character a bit or the condition he suffers and the film goes to some dark places. Nobody in the theatre dared laugh at the point that is most drastic and also anxiety inducing. In someone else' hands this film could easily be a TV Movie of the Week.The woman who played the Sheriff in Signs is again Mel's confidant in The Beaver for the half of the story involving his business. Anton Yelchin the new Scotty in Star Trek is impressively grounded even as he suffers through some of his father's inherited symptoms and those typical of teens anyway. If you are poisoned against Mel I'm not going to say go see it but I'll go out on a limb and suggest that one of the opening sequences where he is at his lowest ebb might be especially entertaining for people who hate him and there is a certain gallows humour that might allow you to relax your guard. The daring premise and loving execution of the film from everyone involved is a nice mix and the film deserves a better fate than it is likely to get with gossips fanning the flame of scandal. Everyone loves a train wreck especially one they're not in.  The BeaverI know people are clogging the box office lines for Thor this weekend and I haven't heard anything negative about that movie but I'm glad I saw The Beaver and that I can honestly say it is more than just weird it is actually also out on a limb and inspiring without feeling like a cheat. That's my two cents anyway.".

The BeaverI know people are clogging the box office lines for Thor this weekend and I haven't heard anything negative about that movie but I'm glad I saw The Beaver and that I can honestly say it is more than just weird it is actually also out on a limb and inspiring without feeling like a cheat. That's my two cents anyway.";

	schema:headline " Mel nails the accent!";
	schema:reviewBody "It really sounds to me like Mel Gibson has modelled the voice and the accent for the puppet on Ray Winstone which shouldn't surprise me considering they have worked together in the past. However top marks to Mel for that one because you really could be forgiven for thinking Ray did a voiceover for the puppet.In general this is not the usual style of film I would watch but I really must say I was most pleasantly surprised at how engaging it was. For me at least this was down to the Beaver yes I realise how that sounds but the remarkable thing is that I forgot it was a puppet controlled and voiced by Mel. I really began to see it as a complete separate character and it just gave the film whole other dimension.Performances from Gibson and Foster were excellent as you would expect. Their acting was totally spot on never once seeming over the top or forced. Jodie Foster has done a sterling job on the directors chair skilfully taking the viewer on a journey in what I would have thought not a particularly easy film to direct. There are some humorous moments but this is not a comedy. You will occasionally laugh and at times you will tense up during some of Gibsons darker moments. But that is a job well done from all.This is certainly not a film for everyone but if you like a movie that's choc full to the brim with the human element excellent acting and directing then I really would recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK Mel Gibson used to be a very hot actor that everyone loved. Then he became famous and got caught in the trap of celebrity and fame. His aged face tells the story. The Beaver is not going to win any awards not because it isn't a good movie  it is. However with the history behind it of Gibson's rants and misdemeanors and the way he has offended the big boys of Hollywood Gibson has no where to go anymore. But then he has great friends like Jodie Foster who believed in him and that is why The Beaver is a fascinating film  it tells the story of Mel Gibson and it is clothed in another tale that is probably highly unlikely in real life  BUT it does explain why Gibson acted the way he did reading between the lines. The Beaver is the story of a man in a nervous breakdown communicating to the world through a beaver hand puppet during his breakdown and then to the point of total collapse. In between this tale is the effect on his family  his work and how the world sees him. The theme of the film is mental illness and Gibson does a fine fine job in acting  he really is a tremendous actor. What is really important here is that Gibson bears his soul through the channel of the film script and I find that very admirable. It is his way of explaining himself and it is a humbling act. I have to admire Jodie Foster too because she is fearless. As the opening credits roll we see that the film has been financed by an Abu Dhabi film production company  how very obscure and not often seen in a Hollywood production. But of course this is not a Hollywood production  this is a story beyond that  Hollywood is ruled by certain groups of people that Gibson offended  it takes brave people to tell their story against the odds.".

	schema:headline " Jodie Foster takes on depression and Mel Gibson in The Beaver";
	schema:reviewBody "The Beaver tells the story of Walter Black Mel Gibson a man who has lost his way in life and is dealing with an extreme case of depression. His wife Meredith Jodie Foster has told him to move out and his oldest son Porter Anton Yelchin hates him. Just when he is about to call it quits Walter becomes friends with a hand puppet named The Beaver who takes total control of Walter's life. With The Beaver constantly attached to Walter he is able redeem himself at work and with his wife and youngest son. It isn't long though before living life through The Beaver catches up to Walter making his life even worse than ever before. It is now up to Walter to take back his life or to lose everything he has worked his entire life for and live it forever as The Beaver.The Beaver is a really dark and depressing piece of cinema. As the film continues you really saw how deep Walter's depression is and that he is in serious need of help. The man is living his life through a stuffed beaver! It's really an original and interesting take on depression which has never been seen before. The subplot which was focused around Anton Yelchin was also interesting and kind of played hand and hand as the same situation that Walter was dealing with.Mel Gibson gives us an extremely powerful and dark performance in this film. This is something that you have never seen him do before and it's extremely scary to watch him portray this character. This is the most unique take on depression that I have currently seen and Gibson nails it. Jodie Foster is good as the dedicated wife and gives an emotional performance. You can tell that Meredith cares deeply for Walter and will stop at nothing to be with him. Anton Yelchin gives the best performance of his career in this film. He is a kid who hates his father so much that he lives his life through others. He is so focused on hating his father that he doesn't realize he can't live his own life. That is until Jennifer Lawerence's character Norah comes along and helps him find himself. The acting in this film is just ravishing with everyone involved showcasing some of the best performances of their careers.While I admired the film's creative and unique take on depression as well as everyone's acting there were a few elements of the film that didn't sit well with me. The first being why the heck didn't anyone have Walter committed to a mental institute? About 30 minutes in I couldn't suspend belief that an entire company would allow its CEO to run a company through a hand puppet. That just wasn't plausible. I also didn't get how Meredith didn't take more active role in helping Walter out. There is a scene where Meredith and Walter go to dinner and Meredith tells the Beaver that she wants Walter to come out. This scene is quite disturbing as it shows just how much the Beaver has taken control. At this point however why Meredith doesn't bring him to counseling is just unbelievable. He has obviously lost his mind at this point. I just didn't get it those two factors of the film. It's like everyone cared yet no one really took the time to guide him to the light so to speak.Despite those minor hiccups I really enjoyed the film. I liked that it was about two stories in one. There was Walter living life through depression aka The Beaver and there was Porter living his life through writing about others. Both of these stories were showing how much Walter and Porter were alike and how much Meredith and Norah are alike. It was a very unique way to view living life through others or other things but it worked out perfectly. My favorite thing about the film was the last 30 minutes. The entire third act was remarkable and really overshadowed all my initial dislikes in the film in regards to no one committing Walter. It was a truly powerful and scary because it showed the true side effects of depression and just how deep into the depression Walter really was. I don't want to give anything away but I will let you know that something does happen to Walter in the last 30 minutes that truly impacts his life. It brings the overall tone of the film to a very dark and depressing state but I feel it was an important part of the film. This film wouldn't have worked out to be so good if it wasn't for how deep it got in that last 30 minutes.In the end The Beaver will definitely not be a film for everyone. If you are going expecting a comedy I will warn you right now that you should stay far away. This is not a comedy and it's not even a dramedy. While it does have a few lighthearted moments here and there this is probably one of the darkest mainstream films that I have come across in quite some time. I don't know how well this is going to do one for the obvious reason of Mel Gibson but also because of the small niche market for this film. It obviously has great performances good direction and a well written story but the subject matter isn't what most people want to see. I think it's great to see a film be as ballsy and real as this one but I also know this isn't what sells tickets. I would be curious to see how this does when it's released. I personally think it's a must see and recommend those who are into really serious dramas to put this on the top of your list. It's a really unique take on depression as well as a unique piece of cinema.".

A simple yet effective story executed in a very professional manner it is a journey into healing and trying to beat that nasty depression. the characters are played to perfection as Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster who also directs the film deliver memorable performances. It also tackles the family relations and how it is affected by the father's sickness and turmoil about family supporting each other and an emotional father  son story.Digging deep into Mel Gibson's character Psyche and how he escapes his inner depression through the puppet the beaver is just so interesting. and they actually made the Beaver the puppet itself so real it appeared as a completely independent character who was funny and at times even freighting. In summary a highly recommended movie great acting and a wonderful story. If you are one of those who are still obsessing about Gibson's mistakes then just go watch Jumping the Broom.".

Although its premise is actually quite ludicrous and should not succeed by any rational means but this isn't a completely rational film  Gibson stars as a depressed family man named Walter Black who can only express himself through a beaver handpuppet  you have to turn on your suspensionofdisbelief button into maximum overdrive mode.Foster plays his wife Meredith who is forced to bear witness to a man who may be steadily losing his mind along with her two sons  troubled high schooler Porter Anton Yelchin and kindergrtner Henry Riley Thomas Stewart.

	schema:reviewBody "Once seen as a great actor and visionary director Mel Gibson has fallen dramatically with his private dramas overshadowing his onscreen talent. Funnily enough it takes a film which reflects Gibson's reallife battle to show us how good he used to be.Gibson stars as Walter Black a CEO of Jerry Co toy company who is clinically depressed. He's drifting away from his devoted wife Meredith Jodie Foster who also directs the film and his sons Porter Zachary Booth  a troubled teen who is desperate not to become like his father despite the signs pointing that way  and Henry a shy loner who blends in to the background even to his mother.After being kicked out of home Walter discovers a mangy beaver puppet in the trash. After a failed suicide attempt the puppet's personality kicks in with Gibson putting a cockney accent when speaking through the beaver. While this form of alternate therapy seems effective both for his work a new beaverinspired product sees his oncetroubled company revived and reuniting with his family eventually the severity of Walter's illness becomes apparent as the beaver tries to take over Walter completely. The subplot involves Porter  who writes other student's essays for money  forming a close friendship with the talented but troubled Norah 'The Hunger Games'' Jennifer Lawrence who has just as many demons as Porter. While their relationship is tumultuous these two damaged kids are perfect for each other.Though Gibson is unlikely to fully rediscover his halcyon days he manages to show both his funny and vulnerable side in 'The Beaver'.While the puppet and his Ray Winstoneesque cockney accent are kind of cute this isn't the Muppets. Depression isn't an easy subject to tackle but 'The Beaver' manages to do it maturely without being overwhelming though it does get bleak at times. The moral of the film is quite uplifting life isn't perfect and noone is completely happy but as long as you have someone to share it with you'll be OK.".

While this form of alternate therapy seems effective both for his work a new beaverinspired product sees his oncetroubled company revived and reuniting with his family eventually the severity of Walter's illness becomes apparent as the beaver tries to take over Walter completely. The subplot involves Porter  who writes other student's essays for money  forming a close friendship with the talented but troubled Norah 'The Hunger Games'' Jennifer Lawrence who has just as many demons as Porter. While their relationship is tumultuous these two damaged kids are perfect for each other.Though Gibson is unlikely to fully rediscover his halcyon days he manages to show both his funny and vulnerable side in 'The Beaver'.While the puppet and his Ray Winstoneesque cockney accent are kind of cute this isn't the Muppets. Depression isn't an easy subject to tackle but 'The Beaver' manages to do it maturely without being overwhelming though it does get bleak at times. The moral of the film is quite uplifting life isn't perfect and noone is completely happy but as long as you have someone to share it with you'll be OK.";

	schema:headline " A surprisingly excellent film";
	schema:reviewBody "I just rented the DVD last night and must admit was not all that enthusiastic about the choice. Who wants to see a film about a guy who takes up with a toy beaver? But amazingly the more I got into the film the more engrossed I became. Mel Gibson does a brilliant job as Walter Black a darkly depressed middle aged man whose despair over his lack of feeling leads to lethargy and destroys everything in his life predictably resulting in thoughts of suicide. No one really wants to diedeath is forever. So it's a perverted attempt at self rescue when Walter finds a beaver puppet in a trashcan and converts it into an alter egowith an Australian accent! that restores him to life. Anyone who's suffered from depression knows what a debilitating painful mental illness it is. Many turn to alcohol drugs gambling shopping anything to relieve them of their agony. It is a slow dark march toward death. That Walter bonds with a puppet to drag him back from that march is initially absurd but also laudable. That he succeeds in convincing others that his remedy is acceptable is ludicrously uplifting...at first. But the puppet is perhaps the mania edge of Walter's bipolar malady. And eventually he finds himself in conflict again in descent. What's remarkable about this film is Mel Gibson's performance. He committed 1000 to this role and played Walter Black as a man wrangling with mental illness and trying to deal with it as best he could. I found him totally believable and empathized with him completely. The major subplot dealing with Walter's son who is more like his father than he's willing to consciously accept is perhaps a bit neat a bit heavy handed but it is interesting and does work. Kudos to the screenwriter for whom this script was a first time effort and first sale. Mel Gibson has had some personal problems also played out spectacularly in the media. I suspect he's not far from Walter Black himself. As a black person I should be upset at him. But I'm not. I don't believe he's a racist for some reason. I believe he was he is a man under pressure and an unhappy man rooting around for a joy in living that once came so easily for all of us. I've always been a Mel Gibson fan and will continue to be.".

	schema:reviewBody "Walter Black Mel Gibson is a chronically depressed miserable man who has been lost in a dark cloud of despair for years. He has driven the toy company his father founded to the brink of bankruptcy and that's nothing compared to the damage he's done to his family. His youngest son Riley Thomas Stewart doesn't essentially doesn't have a father his oldest son Anton Yelchin despises him and his wife Jodie Foster has kicked him out of the house. As the voiceover tells us Walter died inside long ago but his body didn't have the decency to follow suit. On a serious bender Walter finds a beaver hand puppet in a dumpster and when he comes to after a failed suicide attempt he begins to speak to himself through the beaver with a British accent no less. He develops his own form of therapy speaking only through the beaver and begins to reintegrate himself into the lives of his family members and his company with great success. Before long however Walter can no longer find the line of reality between himself and the beaver and watches as all the progress he had made washes away.The similarities between Walter and Gibson himself are obvious and significant. Add in some unfortunate voicemail rants and a touch of antiSemitism and this could play as a Gibson documentary. These similarities are also where The Beaver makes its money. Walter's transition seems authentic to a point as if Gibson himself is undergoing the therapy along with his character. He exhibits the right character traits of man who has lost his way and is struggling to find a way back and the work he does with facial expressions body language etc. is rich. It's quite possible that as a Gibson fan and someone who wants to see him get back on track I could be exaggerating the overall quality of his performance but I think a great deal is asked of him in this roll and he delivers. I wouldn't go so far as to call this a superb performance but it is solid and compelling and an example of just how good Gibson can be when he gives himself a chance. The other elements within The Beaver represent a decisive step down from the work done by Gibson. Foster's character never really finds a foothold to become substantial and her work as director is satisfactory but unspectacular. Kyle Killen's script is uneven too drawn out in some parts but rushed in others resulting in a film that doesn't develop quite the way I believe it was supposed to. And while I am generally down with a darker narrative The Beaver is almost overwhelmed with it to the point of frustrating bleakness. Yelchin and Jennifer Lawrence the Valedictorian cheerleader have some nice moments together but their relationship is poorly developed and is treated at times like a distraction from the storyline involving Walter. A lot could have been done with Yelchin's character and his relationship with Walter but it stagnates early on and just barely reaches for redemption in the end. All totaled The Beaver is a good movie with one great performance that carries the film much further than it could have gone otherwise. It is a worthwhile viewing but not one that I'd look forward to seeing again.Please check out my blog at www.thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com".

The other day I was browsing IMDb and this came up and I noticed it was on DVD. I grabbed it the first chance I got and watched it. I expected little from this movie just a nice entertaining family comedy. As I began to watch I quickly realized I was totally wrong. The movie begins with Walter Black a troubled man who was just kicked out of his house by his wife and family emptying out his trunk so he can fit beer in it and while throwing his trash out in the dumpster sees a beaver puppet and grabs it. He then goes home and tries to kill himself. However he does it with the puppet on his hand and when he knocks himself out trying to commit suicide he wakes up talking through the puppet. Walter uses this puppet to say everything. He then tries to reconcile with his family doing it acting like the puppet. Everyone that comes across his path must accept him for who he is now that he is using this puppet for communication. It also tells the story of his whole family and the problems they also face especially his oldest son. The son's story is equally as emotional and entertaining as his fathers. The acting especially by Mel Gibson and Anton Yelchin were wonderful and Jodie Foster and Jennifer Lawrence were also great. The story is unique and quirky but is also very deep and emotional which I wasn't expecting at all. This movie is great for anyone who like Mel Gibson or wants a movie with a deep story and a great ending. I give it 910.".

I expected little from this movie just a nice entertaining family comedy. As I began to watch I quickly realized I was totally wrong. The movie begins with Walter Black a troubled man who was just kicked out of his house by his wife and family emptying out his trunk so he can fit beer in it and while throwing his trash out in the dumpster sees a beaver puppet and grabs it. He then goes home and tries to kill himself. However he does it with the puppet on his hand and when he knocks himself out trying to commit suicide he wakes up talking through the puppet. Walter uses this puppet to say everything. He then tries to reconcile with his family doing it acting like the puppet. Everyone that comes across his path must accept him for who he is now that he is using this puppet for communication. It also tells the story of his whole family and the problems they also face especially his oldest son. The son's story is equally as emotional and entertaining as his fathers. The acting especially by Mel Gibson and Anton Yelchin were wonderful and Jodie Foster and Jennifer Lawrence were also great. The story is unique and quirky but is also very deep and emotional which I wasn't expecting at all. This movie is great for anyone who like Mel Gibson or wants a movie with a deep story and a great ending. I give it 910.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Beaver is the story of Walter Black a hopelessly depressed individual who finds the way out in a puppet that speaks for him. He finds a beaver puppet in a dumpster and decides to take it with him to the hotel room where he get's drunk and tries to commit a suicide. After the first attempt fails he climbs on the edge of the balcony and is about to jump but than all the sudden the beaver speaks out and brings him to his senses. The idea as simple and dull as it may sound is actually quite good and interesting when you think about it. Unforunatelly the script lacks a great deal in structure and character development which is ultimately why the movie is not nearly as good as it could've and should've been.Jennifer Lawrence and Anthon Yelchin are both brilliant in the movie and a big talent is really visible in their performances. Unfortunately while Yelchin is obviously very very talented i just can't see the leading man in him. His charisma is i think really not on the same level with his talent. However that being said i do not doubt it that both of them are gonna be Academy Award winners one day. Jennifer Lawrence is already almost there. With one nomination behind her the second one is surely gonna come. And i think that one day with the right choice of roles she could even be Hollywood's best leading lady. She definitely has what it takes for it.However all the good performances in this movie really fall to water compared to the one of Mel Gibson. I don't know if he's acting or is it him self in the movie and honestly i don't care. All i know is that he's brilliant. If only the character had more to offer i'm sure the role would be remembered for a long long time. But even though the movie fails at certain levels Gibson's performance was definitely worthy of a much larger recognition. If you ask me the reason he wasn't at the Oscars this year if not as a winner than definitely as a nominee is the fresh new scandal that happened in his life. And that's i think unfair because he is an actor and he should be judged as an actor and not as a human being. In fact i don't think anyone can judge him as a human being since none of us knows him like one. The only way we the audience and the critics can know him is as an actor. As Mad Max William Wallace Walter Black and so on.... As far as this role goes at my opinion he was definitely robbed of all the recognition he well deserved for the portrayal of Walter Black. An amazing performance that was unfairly overlooked by the Academy's voters.The weakest link as far as the acting goes is and i can't believe i'm actually saying this Jodie Foster. It could be because she was busy working as a director on the movie but her performance even though good is really not on the same level as those of Yelchin and Lawrence and needless to say as the one of Mel Gibson. Another thing i felt was very weak is the score. Well it's not bad it's good. It just doesn't fit this film. It's too melodic and.... Italian. I just don't think it's right for this kind of story. The score that this movie desperately needed should've been something like the one from American Beauty. That would fit great! Slow sad tragic... It would've been great!I really wish the script was longer. And simply because you can't build so many complicated characters in ninety pages. Not convincingly anyway. And especially in a movie like this one which was supposed to be a deep story that deals with a very important subject. What i really like about the movie is the feeling of a solution circling around all the time but staying unreachable to everyone. Like for example Walter's wife showing him pictures of their family back when everyone was happy hoping that he'll see some hope or inspiration in it.... and so on... which he fails at doing. That could've been a real good description of the state he and the depressed people in general are usually in. But once again the script fails terribly in structure and it prevents it's character's from going in whatever direction they were supposed to go. Truth be told i don't think it's the writer's fault so much as it is Hollywood's. Producer's rarely allow the movie to be a piece of art these day's even when some movies like this one are meant to be just it. I wouldn't be surprised if the first draft was way better than the one they made the movie on.To conclude my review i wasn't bored but i was definitely not blown away either. The only thing that was great about the movie is acting. Gibson's especially. Maybe it's because i had really high hopes for this movie but i was a bit disappointed. It's a good movie but i expected it to be great!!!! It's definitely worth a watch but i wouldn't put my hopes into being left speechless.".

	schema:reviewBody "The phrase I'm depressed is a phrase we hear people lamenting a lot  these days. Heck we are guilty of whining about how depressed we are  too. Work woes? Relationship problems? Uncertain future? Depression is  more indeed a convenient state to live with until a solution comes  along.  But how serious can depression get? How affected can one get to  entirely lose interest in activities that dictate normalcy? While we  are no medical experts we are guessing that if one's feelings of  sadness anxiety emptiness worthlessness and restlessness lead to  difficulties concentrating remembering and making simple decisions he  should be duly concerned. We are also guessing that if one can only  communicate through a hand puppet like the protagonist of this film he  is in need of medical attention too.  After a 16 years hiatus Home for the Holidays as director Jodie  Foster casts good friend Mel Gibson Edge of Darkness as the CEO of a  toy company who becomes depressed after being kicked out by his wife. A  series of incidents leads to him taking on a new persona in which he  speaks through a beaver hand puppet. His wife and elder son are  unconvinced that he is serious about this but as a favour to his  younger son who loves the beaver they try to play along with the  depressed man.  Anyone with some common sense would think that this setup is a joke  wouldn't he? We too would be cynical if someone comes up to us one  day to say that he can only converse through a hand puppet. However we  wouldn't mind playing along if the puppet was cute. And in this case  the beaver is one adorable creation that you'd want to cuddle. But wait  till you see how serious our protagonist is with his newfound identity.  That is also probably when you realise that this 91 minute film written  by Kyle Killen has got a somber message to tell. Things get heavy  handed as Gibson's character plunges deeper into this absurd game and  as a concerned fellow human being you begin to wonder how severe one's  depression can get.  Gibson seems to be the perfect actor to play the troubled protagonist.  The Australian actor has been in the news recently for accusations of  antiSemitism misogyny and racism  could the Academy Award winning  filmmaker be facing some personal problems himself? His sunken eyes and  sullen emotions in the film seem to be cry out for help and you can't  resist reading a little deeper into this role. Besides directing the  film his Maverick 1994 co star Foster takes on the role of the  skeptical wife. The two have a comfortable on screen chemistry  probably due to their long time friendship.  The film also features outstanding performances by up and coming young  actor Anton Yelchin Terminator Salvation as the couple's elder son  and Oscar nominee Jennifer Lawrence Winter's Bone as his girlfriend  hiding a secret.  Audiences expecting a smart comedy who wouldn't when the protagonist  talks through a beaver puppet almost throughout the movie? will be  left cold by the production's serious tone. There is a unsettling  feeling that the film tries a little too hard at times to shed light on  depression as a medical condition but we are assuming that its  intentions are good  you wouldn't want yourself to resort to  conversing via a hand puppet one day would you?".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a big Jodie Foster fan so I had to see this movie after it came out in DVD. Her directing was brilliant with the movie effectively conveying the sense of loss helplessness and despair that comes with depression. The dissociation experienced by Gibson's character in which he begins to communicate only through a puppet is nicely played and nicely written. But what missed for me was that  although we learn what the son's love interest is stuck on the death of her brother we never learn what put Walter in such a state. Aside from some pictures of a baby we don't know whether it's a baby who died or photos of the living sons as babies and a nod toward the death of his father two years earlier nothing is even hinted at. It seems germane to the point of the movie to know why Walter is depressed. Simply getting him into treatment isn't enough. Like I said a lot of film real estate was spent about the secondary character the cheerleader and her loss but nothing is obvious about the root cause of Walter's malfunction. This makes the movie harder to empathize with.Like I said nice job Ms. Foster but the writers obviously missed tying the story lines together.".

Nothing resonates. Something felt really off about the screenplay and direction. The most compelling aspect of the story was exactly how a person could develop an illness in which they choose to communicate through a puppet  but 'The Beaver' skims over this with an unexpected montage. The audience is given no sense of how Walter Black unravels. Actually the audience is given no sense of Walter Black at all so therefore the beaver puppet feels like nothing more than a gimmick. I'm truly surprised to read reviews that talk about a film that explores a 'broken man's attempt to rebuild his life'. The performances weren't up to scratch either. Anton Yelchin and Jennifer Lawrence have both proved their acting chops in previous roles  but here they are inconsistent. Jodie Foster seemed slightly uncomfortable and selfconscious a real surprise as she is one of my alltime favourites so perhaps taking on both directing and acting was unwise. Gibson's performance is difficult to comment on. Asthetically he looks the part of a shattered soul but the writing provides very little insight into the man behind the puppet. The music was intrusive with one of the most distracting scores I've encountered in recent memory and one of Radioheads most emotionally devastating songs was misused in an 'are you kidding me?' moment. To be positive the cinematography is crisp and clear  and the film is clearly ambitious....but ambition does not equal a good film. I was expecting 'The Beaver' to be a moving exploration of the human condition with a focus on communication and mental illness. Instead I got a superficial family drama that spreads itself too thin.

Jodie Foster gets the comedy and tragedy of her character just right and the support acting is solid with no real major glitches. The Beaver is filmed and directed beautifully and has a good soundtrack and serves the tone of the film well and a compelling and emotional story. The characters also deserve credit there are a lot of them but The Beaver does well to give these characters credibility heart and even complexity. The Beaver perhaps is not perfect while most of the time the slow pace is necessary for the mood of the story and also to give credibility to the characters there are moments where it does feel a little pedestrian. The dialogue is fine most of the time with intelligent and moving lines but about 15 of it feels contrived and underdeveloped. All in all though a very good movie. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " At times captivating but also one of the most bizarre dramas you'll ever see";
	schema:reviewBody "It probably goes without saying that you sort of expect obscurity from The Beaver and you will get exactly that. But at the same time it also isn't as silly and contrived as you might think and it actually has a really great story often depressing and it doesn't try to wrap everything up into a neat little bow which I really liked about it. The film is definitely dark and at times a touch of humour but I wouldn't even classify it as a black comedy because there really is nothing funny about the film. That might sound impossible given the premise of a grown man with a talking Beaver puppet on his hand but the main character who suffers from this mental infliction is so pathetic and you will just feel so lost for him that it isn't funny not even for a moment. The film is definitely drama and can be dark and disturbing and a little bit twisted. In a society where a lot of film fans complain and complain about there be nothing unique anymore or no new ideas...well this is a new idea and for that you have to give them credit. It might be depressing dark with great characters but the story is definitely unique through and through.I am not on the Mel Gibson hate train. He has done a lot of wacky things a lot of wrong things the man has a serious alcohol problem without a doubt. But he is still one of my favourite actors although I don't think he has had a truly outstanding role since Signs in 2002 Yes I loved that movie. He probably took this film to try and show people the darker side of his personality but also make people feel sorry for him relate to this literally pathetic character of Walter Black. Gibson plays this role quite well and because of his range as an actor he really does bring that Beaver to life with his voice and does a terrific job. It's not Oscar Worthy but its worth noting. Jodie Foster directs and stars as his wife who has all but given up on him but clearly still shows a passionate underlying love for this man. Foster has this ability to be very subtle but powerful and she is good in this role. Her and Gibson's chemistry is a little odd and off but that's exactly the way it is supposed to be which is why it works so well. I am a huge Anton Yelchin fan. I have been since his work in Along Came a Spider as a real youngster and now I think he is fast becoming one of Hollywood's up and coming hot commodities. He doesn't get a huge role in this as the bitter and angry son of Gibson but he proves his dramatic chops easily opposite the talent of Foster and Gibson. Youngster Riley Thomas Stewart is also someone to watch as he is terrific as the youngest son who finds his Dad all over again through The Beaver. Cherry Jones is decent in a small almost forgettable role as a Business Associate of Gibson's. I think they should have given her more to work with.As stated Jodie Foster steps behind the camera as well to direct for the first time in over fifteen years. She certainly has been in the business long enough to know how to make a good film and you can't get any more unique than this movie and it has some heavy emotions throughout so she handles all that with ease while creating her own character on screen. Certainly the story focuses front and centre on Walter Black Gibson and the film unapologetically follows him throughout his break down. Also as I mentioned earlier the film is the furthest thing from wrapping things up in a neat little bow in the end and in fact has one of the most shocking climaxes I've ever seen. Your jaw will definitely hit the floor as it seems Walter's life spirals out of control after being in control through the Beaver for so long. If you like drama and you really want something different than The Beaver won't disappoint. If nothing else it is a great character driven film and might seem depressing but it definitely has its moments. 810".

The whole thing seemed too strange and too painful to watch. The plot meandered all over the map and didn't hold my interest. The flopping between comedy and dark drama was unsettling and jarring. Very unrealistic to my thinking. Perhaps a less rough hewn actor or cuter puppet might have carried it better. Some of the puppet sequences seemed twilight zone creepy.

Yeah we have a group of people who will get picked off one by one but that's to be expected in the genre. And hey  by now we know one thing the Reeker definitely does not do  and that's babysit. The trick in horror is to keep us guessing which No Man's Land does and also manages some original kills in the process.Reeker is back with his tool kit and the prequel retains the same tongueincheek humor as the first with some choice dialog and gory silliness. Watch out for further cranial exploitation and the best bird flyby on screen to date! Desmond Askew Turistas stands out as the inept Binky and it's good to see veteran Robert Pine as the local Sheriff. All in all a fun schlocky addition to the franchise.".

I normally have no problem enjoying films that aren't completely original but No Man's Land The Rise of Reeker adds very little to what the first film brought to the table.You will find yourself EXTREMELY bored as there are no characters to root for and you'll just want them all to die anyway. Even though some people might believe otherwise this film DOES rely heavily on its final twist. And if you've seen Reeker surprise! It's the same thing all over again. That is what makes the film so dull. You know what is going to happen at the end of your 88 minutes that you're going to waste.The movie does try to shed some light on the Reeker's origin's but that aspect of the film turns out to be a tiny portion of the film's running time. If tacking on the same old ending isn't insulting enough the final scene of the film after all is said and done will make you cringe with just how awfully clich it is.If you've seen Reeker avoid this one by all costs. It's a lazy attempt for the studio to capitalize on a decent first film. And if you haven't seen the original you might enjoy this one but I'd definitely recommend checking out the previous installment before seeing this coughremakecough.".

	schema:reviewBody "After going to my rental store many times and finding nothing but terrible lionsgate movies i thought hey i'll give one of those redbox DVD machines a try so i looked at the choices and there happened to be a cool looking horror movie made by Ghost house. i normally like ghost house so i thought i'd give it a try. i pay a dollar and to my horror not only is it not the real ghost house it was its underground brand it was also made in affiliation with Lionsgate. oh dear lord kill me now. So after realizing i couldn't escape from the horror that is lionsgate i popped the DVD in and we began to watch it.Once again lionsgate doesn't fail to disappoint. This movie is not only bad but it is stupid. it thought it had a twist ending but it really didn't. well i guess the best place to start is the beginning.It starts out with a hitchhiker walking through death valley which when i went it was flooded btw and a guy in a car stops looking like he's going to let him ride. then he runs him over and cuts off his tongue. lovely. considering Mr hitchhiker was like a deer in the headlights when the car's coming after him not even thinking to oh i don't know JUMP OUT OF THE WAY? good job. then Mr. psycho drives back to his shack where a police man finds him and cuffs him. how does he find him you ask? a blood covered hubcap falls right at his feet. convenient? i'd like to think so. the policeman leaves to vomit and when he goes back in the guy is gone with his hand cut off. he picks up the gun and aims it at the cop but then he says nevermind i give up if you were going to give up...WHY DID YOU CUT YOUR HAND OFF?! stupid movie. he's then executed. fast forward to the present.Bunch of people in a diner in the middle of nowhere. Californian girl who looks like she has NO business being there as if she never worked a day in her life with perfectly quaffed hair and no dirt is working at the diner. she finds a bloody t shirt. the manager of the diner shrugs it off saying once i found a foot! um.. good for you? then some bank robbers with one of their friends who got shot pull up and try to get a new car from the girl who happens to be his ex girlfriend. and i have to just say this is the WORST hostage taker ever. he lets her walk 20 feet to drop her keys down the toilet she forces HIM to go into the septic tank to get them back and she threatens HIM. my god. do we have to go back to hostage taking 101? well apparently it's because they used to be bf and gf. this isn't hard to believe considering there's only 10 people in the whole damn town. oh and one Australian for some reason. two sheriffs father and son one on his last day and one on his first day show up. oh my god. could we have ANY MORE stereotypes? yes we can! an incredibly hot doctor who just happens to be there as well as a murderer picking people off one by one! yay for unoriginality! then the car explodes because of a gunfight with the crooks and the sheriffs and then the 2 crooks try to drive away but Mr Australian throws the smelly bf out of the car. The Australian crook then proceeds to drive into an invisible wall. yes. apparently there are invisible walls. awesome. this is when Mr murderer finally shows up and starts killing them with horrible stop motion walking that makes the girl from 'the ring' look fluid. he kills Mr Australian the girl doctor the old sheriff after he has a long i was never there for you as a father speech and some dude in a hospital gown. the bf and gf then proceed to blow the evil dude up. and the bf dies. now i know what you're thinking you just missed like half the movie. sadly no i didn't. that's really about all you need to know. so the only people we have left alive are the single most annoying female in California and Mr. whiny sheriff who likes to watch fish have sex. that is seriously a quote in the movie i did not make that up. and we find out that everyone who died died similarly in real life to how the crazy stop motion dude kills them. i guess that's supposed to be a twist but i didn't see how.This movie is boring it's stupid and the supposed twist doesn't exist. lionsgate just keeps failing and failing and failing. I don't know why i keep giving them a chance. fool me once shame on you fool me 17 times i'm retarded. The characters are unlikable the killer's unlikable the setting's unlikable and the plot's unlikable. Well if i hate it so much why is it a 2 instead of a 1 you ask? Because even though it's stupid retarded and boring it still is professional film quality. it's not dark fields or Mr. jingles. they actually took the time to rent a decent camera. and for that it gains one point. i know that's not much to give them credit for but hey. they should take what they can get.Rise of Reeker gets 2 keys in the toilet out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Smells like a pretty decent sequel!";
	schema:reviewBody "I have fond memories of watching the original Reeker back in 2005. It was at the Belgian Festival of Fantastic Films and practically the entire theater went wild with enjoyment. Surely the premise was derivative and the wholesome was overall forgettable but at least it was a totally unpretentious new horror film with neat gore effects fresh acting performances and a really cool killer character a smelly grim reaper like serial killer. Nothing more nothing less. The release of sequel within a couple of years was inevitable but let it be understood that it wasn't unwelcome at all. In a fair period of three years writerdirector Dave Payne came up with a followup that is at least equally entertaining exciting and fastpaced as the first. Obviously the surprise element has vanished  although even the original wasn't that surprising  but Payne inventively compensates this through adding a background to the killer even more black humor and barbaric grossout effects. The main difference with Reeker is that the characters become conscious of the situation they're in relatively quick and actually attempt to make it out of there. Whether some of them succeed or not is what keeps the film reasonably suspenseful. No Man's Land opens bizarrely in the year 1978 with the arrest and execution of a serial killer known as the Death Valley Drifter. He doesn't even bother to resist because the voices in his sick head keep telling him that his work on earth is done and a much bigger errand awaits him. Jumping forward to present time in the same desert where a retiring Sheriff and his estranged deputy son literally bump into a couple of fugitive casino robbers. Subsequent to some gunfire and a car explosion the posse find themselves isolated and abandoned in the desert with a heavily stinking and vigorous shape chasing them. In this type of films when you already know from beforehand what the major twist will be it's still a lot of fun to pay close attention and fit all pieces of the puzzle together yourself. The script of Rise of the Reeker leaves plentiful of clues for alert viewers but offers even more exhilaration and bloodshed for undemanding horror fanatics. Good performances particularly from Michael Robert Brandon and the beautiful Valerie Cruz surefooted direction and a marvelously depressing setting as well. Overall a much recommended film to fans of the genre.".

	schema:headline " More of a remake than a sequel each taken on their own merits this is the better film.";
	schema:reviewBody "No Man's Land The Rise of Reeker is set on a lonely strip of desert road in the middle of nowhere at a dusty diner  motel on the day of his retirement Sheriff McAllister Robert Pine is about to hand the reins over to his son Deputy Harris McAllister Michael Muhney  are discussing things in the diner when a situation breaks out. There casino robbers on the run from the law arrive one looking for his very hot exfriend Maya Mircea Monroe who is a waitress at the diner. All hell breaks loose a shootout between cops  robbers ensues  they all end up stranded there cut off from the outside world by an invisible barrier  terrorised by a smelly ghostly killer but that's just the start of their nightmare...Like the original Reeker 2005 this was written produced  directed by Dave Payne who also composed the musical score on both films  is basically more or less a straight remake as opposed to a sequel  I think it's telling that the number 2 doesn't actually appear in the title anywhere. I think that those who have not seen the original Reeker will enjoy No Man's Land The Rise of Reeker more than those who have since all the twist's  turns are exactly the same in both films especially the ending. Those who have seen the original Reeker will know exactly how this will end which obviously takes a lot away from the film the original wasn't even anything that different anyway since the twist had already been done before  in a much better capacity in the excellent Dead End 2003 a couple of years previously so there's definitely a strong sense of dj vu here with No Man's Land The Rise of Reeker God I hate that title. Forgetting about the original  the not very original twist ending on which the whole film hangs No Man's Land The Rise of Reeker taken on it's own merits is fairly enjoyable with a nice pace some good action a plot that entertains some humorous moments  dialogue some spunky character's that are quite likable  one blonde bird who is drop dead gorgeous call me weird but even when she is heard talking about someone taking a stinky sht in a grease pan she still came across as hot to me some nice gore effects  one or two nice sequences that add up a better than average horror film  as I have said those not familiar with the original  therefore not expecting or know about the twist ending will find an enjoyable little twist filled horror film that delivers on several counts. Unfortunately those who have seen or know about the original can't help but know exactly where the film is going within the first fifteen minutes which is not good. So there you have it really whether you like No Man's Land Rise Reeker  how effective it's twist's  turns are will depend if you can guess or already know about it's ending  that's basically what it boils down to in a nutshell. Also one has to say that writer  director Payne has tried to expand on some of the ideas  themes of his original almost as if he was trying to explain away some of the ambiguities  mystery of the original for instance he gives the Reeker more of a specific purpose he gives it  his potential victims more boundaries  rules in which they function  operate  he even gives the Reeker an origin birth  backstory which I am not sure was needed but Reeker is beginning to smell pun intended of a cheap endless sequel driven franchise based around some sort of monster or gimmick  I think Payne sets the roots for a possible series up here.It's quite interesting to note that although film is a very visual  audio based medium how many times the makers base scenes around bad smells which is something by it's very nature the media of film just cannot accurately convey in any way whatsoever. There's some decent gore on show here like decapitated heads  severed body limbs including a sawn off hand in a sneeky nod to the infamous sawn off foot sequence in Saw 2005 a drill through someones head a pole stuck through someones body someones chest is sliced open  some cool CGI computer effects to render half a guy's head  face missing while he is still moving around. The demonic Reeker itself is alright but it's scenes are always filmed with an annoying blurriness  wobbly straight line effect which lessened the impact  distorted the image too much for me.With a supposed budget of about 2000000 this was shot in California Los Angeles for the interiors  Lancaster for the exteriors. It has a pretty slick look to it  feels more polished than the original the special effects are good  it certainly looks better than most recent low budget horror fare. The cast are alright but noone I have heard of or seen before although I will just say again that Mircea Monroe is hot in this.No Man's Land The Rise of Reeker is a better than average horror flick with good gore good CGI effects some humour  horror  at only just over 80 odd minutes it's fast paced with some good twist's  turns. The only problem is anyone familiar with the original will have already seen  therefore know about those twist's or turns which on the one hand is one of the films biggest plus points but by a bizarre sort of logic at the same time are one of it's biggest minus points as well.".

	onyx:emotionText "No Man's Land The Rise of Reeker is set on a lonely strip of desert road in the middle of nowhere at a dusty diner  motel on the day of his retirement Sheriff McAllister Robert Pine is about to hand the reins over to his son Deputy Harris McAllister Michael Muhney  are discussing things in the diner when a situation breaks out. There casino robbers on the run from the law arrive one looking for his very hot exfriend Maya Mircea Monroe who is a waitress at the diner. All hell breaks loose a shootout between cops  robbers ensues  they all end up stranded there cut off from the outside world by an invisible barrier  terrorised by a smelly ghostly killer but that's just the start of their nightmare...Like the original Reeker 2005 this was written produced  directed by Dave Payne who also composed the musical score on both films  is basically more or less a straight remake as opposed to a sequel  I think it's telling that the number 2 doesn't actually appear in the title anywhere. I think that those who have not seen the original Reeker will enjoy No Man's Land The Rise of Reeker more than those who have since all the twist's  turns are exactly the same in both films especially the ending. Those who have seen the original Reeker will know exactly how this will end which obviously takes a lot away from the film the original wasn't even anything that different anyway since the twist had already been done before  in a much better capacity in the excellent Dead End 2003 a couple of years previously so there's definitely a strong sense of dj vu here with No Man's Land The Rise of Reeker God I hate that title. Forgetting about the original  the not very original twist ending on which the whole film hangs No Man's Land The Rise of Reeker taken on it's own merits is fairly enjoyable with a nice pace some good action a plot that entertains some humorous moments  dialogue some spunky character's that are quite likable  one blonde bird who is drop dead gorgeous call me weird but even when she is heard talking about someone taking a stinky sht in a grease pan she still came across as hot to me some nice gore effects  one or two nice sequences that add up a better than average horror film  as I have said those not familiar with the original  therefore not expecting or know about the twist ending will find an enjoyable little twist filled horror film that delivers on several counts. Unfortunately those who have seen or know about the original can't help but know exactly where the film is going within the first fifteen minutes which is not good. So there you have it really whether you like No Man's Land Rise Reeker  how effective it's twist's  turns are will depend if you can guess or already know about it's ending  that's basically what it boils down to in a nutshell. Also one has to say that writer  director Payne has tried to expand on some of the ideas  themes of his original almost as if he was trying to explain away some of the ambiguities  mystery of the original for instance he gives the Reeker more of a specific purpose he gives it  his potential victims more boundaries  rules in which they function  operate  he even gives the Reeker an origin birth  backstory which I am not sure was needed but Reeker is beginning to smell pun intended of a cheap endless sequel driven franchise based around some sort of monster or gimmick  I think Payne sets the roots for a possible series up here.It's quite interesting to note that although film is a very visual  audio based medium how many times the makers base scenes around bad smells which is something by it's very nature the media of film just cannot accurately convey in any way whatsoever. There's some decent gore on show here like decapitated heads  severed body limbs including a sawn off hand in a sneeky nod to the infamous sawn off foot sequence in Saw 2005 a drill through someones head a pole stuck through someones body someones chest is sliced open  some cool CGI computer effects to render half a guy's head  face missing while he is still moving around. The demonic Reeker itself is alright but it's scenes are always filmed with an annoying blurriness  wobbly straight line effect which lessened the impact  distorted the image too much for me.With a supposed budget of about 2000000 this was shot in California Los Angeles for the interiors  Lancaster for the exteriors. It has a pretty slick look to it  feels more polished than the original the special effects are good  it certainly looks better than most recent low budget horror fare. The cast are alright but noone I have heard of or seen before although I will just say again that Mircea Monroe is hot in this.No Man's Land The Rise of Reeker is a better than average horror flick with good gore good CGI effects some humour  horror  at only just over 80 odd minutes it's fast paced with some good twist's  turns.

The other reviewers also said that if you saw Reeker then No Man's Land will be kind of a letdown.Without having seen the 'Main Event' I think I agree. But if this is your First view then by all means it will be entertaining.Without giving away any plot a assemblage of characters including the obligatory 'Fleeing criminals' are holed up at an isolated desert gas stationmotel to find they are trapped and being stalked by something Hideous. Starts as a simple timeworn horrorslasher premise which can prove to be limp and boring except for either creative laughs or extra buckets of splatter. You know a Jason in the Desert sort of thing.Except this movie takes a vague left turn. It isn't about the Splatter though there is a bit of that. It's about some strange unexplained supernatural rules Rules that must be adhered to. . .or enforced.Think about it that way as you watch and begin to scratch your head then when the end comes it will all try to snap together. Yeah with gaps and loose pieces but still. That's why I gave it a 7. That plus the notion of a 'Reeker' as a supernatural creature seemed more corny than scary at first glance so you think it will be cornball fun and yucks might be disappointed when it doesn't deliver. Instead I came away from this movie thinking of an episode out of Neil Gaiman's Sandman universe. So to me this movie was more Supernatural Thriller than Horror. Not the BEST but nicely entertaining.

	schema:reviewBody "The first film was your good usual twist and turn psycho killer horror thriller and this straight to DVD sequel is just as good if not a tiny bit better. The film opens with the origins of how the Reeker came to be there used to be a man or the Salesman Michael Robert Brandon in the 1970s known as the Death Valley Drifter and there is a part when he gets caught and chops his own hand off. He was caught by Sheriff McAllister David Stanbra in his shack filled with heads limbs and body parts kind of like Leatherface or the real life Ed Gein and he was put to death in the gas chamber but his spirit managed to get out. Then it moves to present day where Sheriff McAllister Robert Pine will be retiring and having his son Deputy Harris McAllister Michael Muhney replace him. Then three thieves show up one is dying but Binky Desmond Askew is looking forward to getting his hands on the money they stole from a casino and Alex Stephen Martines wants to see his exgirlfriend waitress Maya Mircea Monroe. Soon they realise that they are in danger from a mysterious ripply serial killer with a hook for a hand wearing a gas mask the Reeker a ghost working for Death. Each victim is warned almost by a horrible smell coming from the killer hence the name Reeker and when each die you see their pasts flashing before you. It is apparent though that all that did die were meant to seeing how also they are trapped by an invisible wall you see the logical way they are killed off in the end and there is no Reeker at all. Also starring Lyne Odums as Psychiatrist Valerie Cruz as Allison Lew Temple as Hitchhiker and Ben Gunther as Reeker. I can't remember there being much humour in the predecessor but this one has some good moments of humour in amongst the good gore and rough death scenes and a creepy killer to go with it not bad at all. Worth watching!".

In the movie dead end a family goes on a road trip has a near miss collision and then they are stalked by a killer all to find out that they didn't have a near miss but had a head on collision and it was all a dream. Sound familiar reeker fans? This premise just like the whole They are the same person twist ending i.e. Fight club hide and seek etc. where everyone has to steal it. Dead end Reeker The I Inside Stay and the Reeker 2 Even reekier all have the same exact ending and reeker does it the worst. Dead end was filled with gruesome kills and funny awkward moments making it enjoyable The I Inside probably my favorite of the bunch cause it adds a little something extra to the ending Stay because its a beautiful trippy direction that the film has.

	schema:reviewBody "Stopping at a remote desertside motel a group of thieves and their local hostages find that all of their potential escape attempts are blocked by a supernatural creature that is merciless in killing them all forcing them to find a way of stopping it so they can get away.On the whole this one wasn't that much better than the first one but that was a very rare event and it wasn't all that often. Among the few good ideas present here is the fact that there's some really enjoyable and entertaining action to be had here with this one as once again the film's central plotpoint where the main killer runs around in an altered dimension picking off the group onebyone following a devastating accident gives this the foundation needed for a sterling series of suspense encounters. These come about here as the opening attack on the killers' hideout and capture in the bloodied body filled shack is highly enjoyable the first scenes out in the desert where they come across the killer among the sanddunes where he comes out of nowhere to attack several people in quite grisly fashion the traps at the end where he goes out to the different sections of the facility where it chases them around and really brings out some slasher standouts quite nicely as these elements really provide this with not only some rather strong and brutal kills but also quite a few graphic mutilations that come about due to the victim's not entirely dying off after an encounter which leaves their body mangled. All of these here are based very heavily on that premise of the different deaths being conducted in this universe to account for the person's death in the real world which is the same twist found in the original. That in a sense is the film's biggest flaw in that it feels so much like the original mainly because it occasionally did something interesting with the group that plays off like a retread of what happened previously of a group getting stranded in the middle of nowhere and then getting picked off by this particular breed of killer resulting in the same twist ending and it was only because it's a sequel and there's the creature's name in the title did you really know what it was. The other issue here is the relaxed pacing in the first half as this just comes off with a slew of rather bland storyline to drag the pacing out from the troubled officer family and the troubled thieves to way too much time with their different relationships and nothing at all about what the creature was which all holds the killing down into the second half that comes off as a really off balance section to the film overall. It does have some problems but there's way too much about it to really mean anything anyway.Rated R Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.".

This film is an independent and low budget picture. The script could use work though. There are plenty of unanswered questions about how this Reeker works. He is supposed to have killed people for their souls or bodies or heads. I don't know. This film is more gory and violent than needed be. I was not scared at all about it. The film doesn't work on making this Reeker believable. The cast is fine and so is the production crew in meeting them in the DVD special feature. The film just has a lot more questions to be answered and explained to the audience. I try to not to think too much about what the Reeker is all about and why Death Valley. The goriness and violence is grotesque.".

But as the film and story continued i found myself getting more into it. There's plenty of blood and gore very over the top to be honest but good. I was really impressed with a certain idea of the film! so not to give to much away about it but the idea of how they kept the story surrounding the location is cool and was humorous at one stage when a character uncovers a secret and then the horror comes more a light and you start thinking holycrap can you imagine that. The acting ability of the cast was also good not substandard like some horror sequels of late. I didn't see the plot come together until the very end i was surprised and found it quite unpredictable until i watched it again and pieced it together. so it's clever as i didn't see that coming. i would recommend it if you get the chance to see it.".

An incident involving three criminals on the lam and the citizens of a small desert town in the middle of nowhere will include the Reeker who has a fresh batch of victims to send to meet their maker. More or less a horror comedy where characters attempt to free themselves from their prison where a devastating occurrence took place which revolves around a shootout and gas tank explosion. Kind of a brother to THE FINAL DESTINATION series where a group of people attempt to cheat death unable to avoid their inevitable fates. Grotesque humor includes a victim walking around with half his head gone the lower half of a victim running around without the upper torso and a heart patient dropping dead wearing only a hospital gownhis chest bursting openas he was running about in hysterics. We see a car crash into some sort of invisible wall which holds those caught in the limbo in the general area where the big event took place. The Reeker when he rears his very ugly head is an abomination of ragged clothes face mask and pale skin accompanied by his tools of the trade such as a drill. The deputy at the beginning of the film who was considered a local hero although the killer clearly had him caught between a rock and hard place is played as an older sheriff by CHiPs own Robert Pine who meets the man he helped send to the gas chamber in a different way than the last time.

This is not the story of a woman with normal problems marital or otherwise. This is the story of a woman who as a child was sexually abused by her uncle for a long time. And her mother exacerbated that emotional damage by blaming Nancy for the abuse. Typical of many sexual abuse victims Nancy translated the abuse into being loved which compelled her to long for it in subsequent relationships.

I would expect even most of the more secular types would hate this film because it IS hard to watch and atypical of most movies that have either a clear message or a protagonist who somehow manages to succeed.The truth is this film is very hard to watch but is a very well made film that allows us into the world of a woman fraught with pain the likes of which I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. Who among us could deny any living thing relief from profound pain? It seems as a species we're much more adept at causing and prolonging each others pain than anything else.In this film Maria Bello plays very much a victim of childhood abuse who now suffers at the hands of an uncaring unsympathetic husband played masterfully by Rufus Sewell. Every nuance and every tick is captured and sometimes shown in closeup as Sewell goes about his business with utter disregard for his wife's profound suffering.Maria Bello portrays a woman I'd expect would elicit even a modest measure of sympathy from a passing stranger and yet her husband clearly unable shows himself to be either a monster or yet another tortured soul battered by years of his wife's seemingly unreasonable anguish.This is not a film I'd care to watch a second time but I'm glad I watched it because it IS very well made. The performances are as perfect as any I have seen while the cinematography and the score similarly show qualities that perfectly fit the story.".

This is not a thrill a minute suspense film for the Transformers crowd or a film to brighten your day. It features semi graphic depictions of sadomasochism and explores the psyches of people suffering from severe emotional dysfunction.It is also one of the best films of the past two years and has been unjustly neglected by film distributors critics and audiences.The film functions on a number of levels. On one hand it explores the personality and life of Nancy a woman unable to cope with the trauma of having been sexually abused as a child. We see her experiences with a therapist and with selfmutilation. However it is also an indictment of a emotionally and physically sterile suburban existence embodied by her dullard husband Albert. The film's sets and color scheme reflect this barrenness with gray being the color of the day.Maria Bello's performance anchors the film and should have been given an Oscar nomination. Although most of the praise has gone to Bello it is also worth noting Jason Patric's performance as the sadomasochist she turns to for release.Although I believe this is a very good film it is not perfect. Rufus Sewell's portrayal of Albert is overly broad lacking real depth. Furthermore the film's soundtrack is lacking a very generic synthesizer score that may reflect the film's low budget.For comparison look at David Cronenberg's Dead Ringers and the Vera Farmiga film Quid Pro Quo. As with these films many people will hate it but the thoughtful will love it.".

She had been so violently abused by her uncle since she was seven years old that she can not have babies anymore. She is ignored by her selfish husband Albert Rufus Sewell who does not have sex with her or give any attention to her problems dedicating his leisure time to play a virtual golf game in a special room in their fancy house. The psychoanalyst Carol Amy Brenneman unsuccessfully tries to help Nancy to resolve her emotional issues with therapy. When Nancy contacts the sick sadomasochist Louis Jason Patrick in internet she schedules a meeting with him in Baltimore to release her from her painful life. They meet each other and have kinky sex but along the days together Louis falls in love for Nancy and tries to persuade her to stay alive. Downloading Nancy is a disturbing powerful and heartbreaking movie with a story apparently based on a true event. Yesterday when I saw this film I felt very uncomfortable with the dramatic story of Nancy a woman destroyed by sexual abuses in the childhood and adolescence and rejection and lack of love in her marriage. The gorgeous Maria Bello performing a character without any glamor gives a performance that should deserve a nomination to the Oscar if this ridiculous institution were slightly honest and serious. Rufus Sewell is amazing in the role of a selfish man totally indifferent to the emotional problems of his needy wife. Jason Patrick is also excellent and there is one specific scene absolutely gruesome when he has sex with Nancy and a piece of glass. The nonlinear screenplay makes the difference in this film disclosing the drama of the lead character through flashbacks and intelligent dialogs. This mature movie is only recommended for very specific audiences and the DVD should have a warning in this regard. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Distrbios do Prazer Disturbs of the Pleasure".

	schema:reviewBody "If i compare these two movies I don't do it for their plot or their visuals. Far from that.... Downloading Nancy is a visually ugly movie with washed out colors ugly sets and no gimmicks whatsoever... close to no music but an ambient score fading in and out sometimes swelling louder. There is no drugs no TVShows no mothers no ambitions.... none of that but still I didn't miss anything. What links these movies together is the impact. I have rarely seen a movie with so much empathy and insight beside Arronowskys Masterpiece. This movie is not so much about Nancy a disillusioned wife who went through some hardship and deals with her ignorant and cold husband by feeling through selfinflicted pain. Its not about the fact that she is trying to find someone to kill her over the internet and its not even a study on the phenomena of cutters. I wasn't visually appalled by anything in this movie... yet it was hurting. It doesn't hurt to see Nancy cut herself or being choked. It hurts seeing her curdled up crying on the floor when she finds herself not being killed. It hurts to see her tries to communicate on an irrational level and those around her unable to cope with it. It hurts to see her abandoned and alone on the dance floor and it hurts just as much as seeing her husband his friends the internetchat friend or Nancys psychiatrist showing just the same signs of being unable to speak and cope with those around them and the hidden hurt inside them.Even more than Requiem for a dream I find myself and most of those close to me right in the characters drama. This happens every day every minute yet most don't take drastic measures like Nandy. And I can't help but feel sad for everyone in this movie trapped in this spiral of hidden hurt unableness to communicate and making the same mistakes you suffered from others. This is a movie about empathy and I rarely feel so close to movie characters. Its like staring into a mirror and looking at what you don't want to see and I think that is why so many people hate the movie or walk out of the cinema. Its not the killing and cutting and beating and most of all its not gratuitously focusing on human suffering. When you realize how we really all are one and get the chance to see our parallels rather than our differences... I guess thats good and I guess thats where Nancy herself tragically fails.".

Fast forward to the information age where written documents as well as ways of communicating went digital from the invention of the computer and then a way to connect them to others The Internet. Writing letters turned into emails and inked articles went way of text on a blog. This story uses the modern way of communicating and connecting to others but as an outlet for darker reasons rather than opportunity or forward outlooks. And what makes this tale so haunting is that is was inspired by real events with some cinematic liberties altered from a 1996 case about a woman named Sharon Lopatka who went by the name of Nancy over the computer.Downloading Nancy is about a downonthisworld woman played by Maria Bello who searches for someone on the Internet that would take her life as she's tried herself with scars to show for it. Not to mention going to therapy sessions to resolve her long list of deeprooted issues without any substantial luck. She's married and unable to have kids due to being abused and suffering physical pain as a little girl. Her husband Albert played by Rufus Sewell doesn't understand her need for infliction during intercourse and after 15 years of marriage is fed up with her immature and selfish ways of dealing with problems. He has golf and other hobbies to keep himself distracted not to mention they sleep next to each other yet are worlds apart. Nancy finds her guy or so he says and takes off with only a nondescript note left over to her husband. The newly met man from online seems the perfect match to give her the rough stimulation she feels she needs. Nancy has her highs and lows from emotional to withdrawn giving a torn decision to the man who's now infatuated with her.Slow serious subtle Downloading Nancy builds up by showing rather than telling how this woman got to the desperate manic endall state she's at. There are loose handheld camera shots that put you there. Sometimes hiding behind something to give the point of view of witnessing and experiencing it first hand. The settings are dulled with drab colors and neutral furniture to give an oppressive tone without overdoing it and trying to be creepy. Maria Bello does an excellent job of playing a pessimistic woman with more than one troubling issue to contend with. Her impulsive ways make her unpredictable and unlikable though there is a feeling of pity as she can't even help herself.This doesn't have the typical amount of hope or resolve that you see in Hollywood pictures but it's filled with real feelings of emotion that radiate from the screen. The film doesn't have any good guys or bad guys and it isn't a horror tale as it won't happen to you due to both individuals being willing participants. It just unfolds this strange tale of how the Internet brought these two together who would have otherwise never met as they're several states over. Though Nancy had stacking problems that were becoming too much to handle and this was her way of finding an answer to solve it all by including this man to take charge of her life without question. The amount of blind trust she put into him might say more about herself than him. If you missed 'em see my profile and click chronological for first review Grimm Love or the second Cannibal.

The film doesn't have any good guys or bad guys and it isn't a horror tale as it won't happen to you due to both individuals being willing participants. It just unfolds this strange tale of how the Internet brought these two together who would have otherwise never met as they're several states over. Though Nancy had stacking problems that were becoming too much to handle and this was her way of finding an answer to solve it all by including this man to take charge of her life without question. The amount of blind trust she put into him might say more about herself than him. If you missed 'em see my profile and click chronological for first review Grimm Love or the second Cannibal.

This film is loosely based in fact so it's not Luke we can just say  it's only a movie also this is not just a one off thing another film tackles the same subject Grimm Love starring Keri Russell also has the same story line that movie is much more horrific and graphic but it deals with the same issue of people being unhappy in life.This movie isn't something to cheer you up it's most certainly not going to do that but if you like movies that will divide a room and start a conversation then this is one for you.I wish this movie had found a bigger audience because it's so deserving of a wide audience I really hope Maria Bello gets more roles like this in the future.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm gonna start out by saying that this may be the most depressing and distressing movie I've ever seen and I've seen a few. It hit me from behind I had no idea what I was about to watch. Sure there are movies about for example the holocausts and some powerful horror movies but this movie managed to beat them to it. I was a bit surprised about the low score as this really is such a well crafted movie that it deserves better. Altho I understand some may be put off by it's absolute bleakness. It's slow and it's very hard to watch. On the negative side there is a tiny amount of exploitment as the story is said to be inspired by true events and the direction does underline a bit. This is where I drop the score one point. It's a difficult scenario with inspired by true stories as you can't really know what the directors motive was to put this on screen. Is it his affection for subjects portrayed here or the fact that he wants to make people think about unfortunate people you don't often see on the media.Maria Bello portrays an utterly depressed woman who has been abused as a child and can no longer connect with her husband Rufus Sewell. She then contacts a man Jason Patrick online who agrees to kill her. The story jumps right into it and is not 100  linear which is a bit distracting here and there but also works for the benefit of the dark story.There are as many sides to the story as there are characters involved. It could be seen as a directorial success that even tho the story is partly seen thru his husband it still manages to keep him as a bit of a mystery. The focus is always on Nancy. There are a lot of scenes where Nancys husband is shown after Nancy leaves to meet her killer but we are never really let inside the husbands thoughts. On the other hand Nancy's character may be underlined too much. Is this a directorial decision to focus on Nancy's need for attention or just to have as many scenes as possible to show Nancys downfall I don't know. I'm guessing it's all intentional as the movie is quite well crafted and every detail seems to be there for a reason.There is one scene in particular which had a tremendous impact on me. The one where she starts a food war during a bleak dinner. This is probably the only moment in the movie where you can see a spark in her eye. Only to be shot down immediately by her husbands reaction.Where this movie may fail a bit is that it is easy to see the husband as a baddie. Or at least this is how I take it from the reviews written here. Had the story been portrayed from another perspective we could've seen a tormented man who has focused on his hobby to stay sane in a non working infertile marriage. There are people who are unable to show their feelings. Nancy had a tragic past but this could also be a case of bad matchmaking to begin with.A word of praise must go to Jason Patrick who makes an unbelievably chilling role. It's completely new never seen a character like his played on screen. There are scenes where his eyes show zero emotion yet at times you can feel his empathy and care. I read he replaced Ray Liotta and this is a small victory. Liotta has played so many psycho roles that he would've watered down the whole movie. Jason Patrick hasn't been in a lot of movies and thinking about it now he's a perfect choice for the role.I read somewhere that the director credits his homeland Sweden. He points out that only Finnish people may be more depressed than they. Maybe it is the fact that I'm Finnish that I really felt this movie and didn't see it pointless and slow waste of time as some have said it to be.".

	schema:headline " Depressed housewife hires sadomasochistic gigolo for fun and games";
	schema:reviewBody "As is often the case films about selfloathing characters do not usually make for good drama. 'Downloading Nancy' is no exception. It's supposedly based on a true story about a woman who's murdered at her own request by someone she meets over the internet.The protagonist is Nancy Maria Bello who is married to Albert Rufus Sewell. Albert is a successful software developer who has developed a golf game which his company has successfully marketed to various bars and barrestaurants. Unlike most human beings Albert has virtually no positive attributes except for his ability to be successful in the business world. Throughout the film Albert has a grim and dour expression on his face. He has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and resorts to patronizing prostitutes. When his wife asks for sex he punishes her by masturbating in her presence instead.Nancy is equally onenote as a character. Not only has she had a loveless 15 year marriage but was sexually abused by her uncle when she was growing up thankfully there are no flashbacks of that back story in the film. Her selfloathing takes the form of selfmutilation and a result she's forced into therapy. However she has such contempt for her therapist that no progress can be made.Finally Nancy is so depressed that she contacts Louis over the internet. He's sort of a sadomasochistic gigolo who has sex with women for money while inflicting massive amounts of pain to boot. It's revealed that Louis has two children but no longer sees them the children's mother no longer wants anything to do with him.Nancy's plan is to first have painful sex with Louis and then have him kill her. There's a particularly unpleasant scene where Louis has sex with Nancy while slashing her vaginal area with a broken piece of glass. These scenes are shown as flashbacks after Louis pays a visit to Albert who ties him up and strikes him with a golf club. It seems that Louis has a twofold plan in going to see Albert 1 berate him for his treatment of Nancy and 2 enjoy the beating he receives. It takes awhile before Louis will reveal Nancy's fatefirst he forces Albert to do him the favor of taking his dog to a relative so someone will care for it in the future. Nancy's fate of course is that Louis finally ended up choking her to death but showed some hesitation first as he made it clear that he had some 'feelings' for her. We soon learn that Louis is imprisoned for life for Nancy's murder.What exactly are we to take away from a film such as Downloading Nancy? Are we supposed to feel sorry for victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence? Is that the main point of the film? Is sympathy for Nancy actually warranted? I don't think so. The film's writers create a straw man in the character of Albertsomeone who is so cut off from his emotions that he is the one that is held responsible for Nancy's decline. But are people so onedimensional in real life? I think not. They have the repulsive Louis a man who makes a living by inflicting pain come over and berate Albert for neglecting Nancy. Furthermore his expressions of love towards Nancy before he kills her is supposed to show his 'sensitive side'.In the end it matters little whether the filmmakers have defined where their sympathies lie with the various characters in the film. They are so bent on titillating their audience with scenes of gratuitous violence that Downloading Nancy becomes nothing more than an exercise in poor taste and soft pornography.".

She was destroyed many years earlier by the only person she feels loves her...her uncle...and her therapist is right about this but Nancy won't listen. Good for these gutsy actors.

We don't know how these 15 years have been for him nor for her but I know that you cant stay madly in love with a prson specially if she behaves as loveless and nasty as she does. Why does she hates him ? Because he isn't 'wild'? So why did she marry him in the first place ? Why does she not insist in therapy nd finally decide to ger better eeh ? Why doesn't she game with him ? Or take a hobby of her own ? Or work ? Or help children?  am I supposed to cry because she can't have her own baby? Well I won't .

If we decide that we don't want to live we take matters in our own hands and not give it to a sadist murder to increase our karma further more.... So this is a terrible stupid film about a made up character  I work with victims  cutters so I can separate sleezy fiction from real cases be offended by me but this dangerous and easy piece of garbage has a name Exploitation ....Watch out.

	schema:reviewBody "One of the biggest Swedish boxoffice hits of the last couple of decades this is an almost westernlike story about a man who returns to his backwater town when his father dies.Erik Bckstrm Rolf Lassgrd left his small hometown in the north of Sweden when he was younger to become a policeman in the big city. Now that his father has died he returns to the small town. He starts working on a longrunning case of people poaching reindeer but he soon discovers that not many people have any real interest in the case being solved. Eriks loyalties are tested along with his views on right and wrong.This movie is quite solid more so than most Swedish movies i might add. But still there are a few flaws that needs to be discussed. First of all this movie is not very sympathetic in it's description of the people from northern Sweden. Rather they are portrayed as a bunch of racist moonshinedrinking rednecks. A view to be questioned no doubt. Also what strikes me about this movie is the almost complete lack of emotion it presents. There are terrible things going on on screen brutal and terrifying but they are examined at a distance and without any real moral judgment. It feels clinical.What makes this an enjoyable experience despite the flaws though are several things. Rolf Lassgrd is very good in the lead as the policeman and also the rest of the cast perform well. Especially i might mention Lennart Jhkel as his brother. Also the movie is exciting and has quite a lot of suspense. And while the director shows very little emotion in the way he portrays the events of the film there is still much emotion to be had. Jgarna is a movie that makes you think.I rate it 710.".

The plot itself is reminiscent of such classics as Straw Dogs and Deliverance yet much more down to earth with a great deal of character development especially between the protagonist and his countrybumpkin brother.However the last half of the film especially the ending left me frustrated. I literally booed at the end because of an unsatisfactory resolution. What could have been the best revenge flick of the '90s slowly becomes a dull lifeless disappointment.

One main problem with contemporary Swedish movies is the wooden dialogue which is largely avoided here. The story holds together well in the beginning but the naturalism and believability Sundvall builds up completely vanishes towards the end which is unfortunate and ultimately makes this a rather average movie. The script has some irritating holes like the subplot with Lassgrds love interest which is mysteriously left unresolved. The last act is also a indication of the current Americanization of Swedish cinema which is a rather sad phenomenom. We should make movies on our own terms and be wary of too many american influences those estethics tend to become overblown predictable and unrealistic when translated into Swedish.".

The last act is also a indication of the current Americanization of Swedish cinema which is a rather sad phenomenom. We should make movies on our own terms and be wary of too many american influences those estethics tend to become overblown predictable and unrealistic when translated into Swedish.";

I heard about the film when a youtuber showed a 3 second long clip from it. I could tell from just the framing and acting that this felt real.I personally can't give it a high rating because of its anxiety inducing content. I'm all for suspense and graphic content if it's appropriate. But this st gives me anxiety. All the people and animals dying are innocent and all the perpetrators are so unsympathetic and intimidating that i feel helpless and like a bad human being for not being able to help anyone else. I like the crime aspect to this the directing the writing the acting and that's from my own country. But the lack of heart in some of these characters lack of redemption and justice and lack of strong arcs paints an unforgiving cruel nonrewarding mean and sad world. Fudge this movie makes me feel bad when i think about it. It's so real at other times. If i were to improve The Hunters i'd end it differently. I'd make it so that Erik fights his brother. Perhaps gets an answer from him where Nana is. He then turns Leif in to the police alt. feeds him to cannibal elks because i hate him. The others are charged with crimes or faces some consequences. Others involved the police the criminal's partners are changed somehow. As the ending is now you feel like his efforts are meaningless. The villagecity hasn't changed other than disliking the criminals a bit. Not all people involved has faced proportional consequences. Leif kills himself which means he gets away with everything and gets what he wants once again. Now the film's message seems to be don't go to northern Sweden it's corrupt everyone hates good people nobody changes nothing changes everyone are pieces of st the innocent suffer the evil wins etc. Could have been a fantastic movie.".

Local police turn a blind eye to the culprits so a Stockholm detective who was originally from the area returns home and investigates. Things get complicated when he discovers his younger brother is involved but worse than that the poaching has escalated into murder.I had seen the sequel to this Swedish thriller recently a film called False Trail which was made fifteen years after the first part. I am guessing that The Hunters is a fairly influential film as it comes very early in the cycle of Nordic Noir movies which have become very popular over the course of the last decade or so. Like others in this bracket this one derives a fair bit of its interest from its local flavour in this case the chilly expanses of Lapland. Like False Trail this one also presents a mystery which is resolved for the audience quite early on leaving the tension to come from knowing who is dangerous and wondering how the central detective will resolve the case. For me personally I would have preferred a mystery over the combination of thriller with family drama which both films essentially boil down to a large degree with the detective character put in a compromised position where he has to weigh up his family loyalty over his wider role to society as a policeman with the added complication of small town suspicion of city people ever present. I think both films are broadly similar in terms of quality with neither being especially excellent. I thought they were more an example of a solid if unremarkable detective stories combined with family drama with a northern Swedish backdrop. Nothing wrong with any of that of course but I would say these are good films as opposed to the best Nordic Noir has to offer.".

It really hasn't aged well. Seems like nothing happens and that makes it feel about four hours long. Can't really feel for any of the characters because most of them feel like caricatures of real people if this was a stage production i might had worked.So i cant' recommend this to anyone really can't understand how the swedes can be proud of this movie.

Certainly it's an exploration of the dark side of the human soul with a typical police procedural in the first half giving way to something much more sinister and murderous in the second. Rolf Lassgard and Lennart Jahkel are excellent in the lead roles as a pair of brothers driven apart by living at opposite ends of the moral spectrum.The only reason I'm not a massive fan of this genre is that I don't like the way that the criminals are never made to really pay for their crimes due to the limitations of the justice system which are all too apparent here. I prefer the sort of film where the protagonist goes outside of the law in order to bring the bad guys some true justice. Still THE HUNTERS trades crowdpleasing vengeance for chilly realism offering no easy answers or a perfect ending it's as dark and quietly devastating as it gets.".

	schema:reviewBody "Death Wish 4 The Crackdown the fourth movie in Death Wish franchise is criminally underrated and misunderstood action flick from The Cannon Group Inc. of the 80s. It is a good movie it is not the best or great but it is a decent good movie. Paul Kersey avenges all the children that have died an over dose from drugs that is why I love this film to death! It is my favorite action film the movie that grow on me. This movie has special place in my heart it is my favorite Charles Bronson film of all time. J. Lee Thompson beautiful directed this film it arguably his good film.This is the original Punisher not Frank Castle Jon Bernthal but Paul Kersey is The Punisher. You watch Jon Bernthal as The Punisher 2017 I watch Charles Bronson Death Wish 4 The Crackdown film. It is arguably my favorite and so underrated action flick I really miss movies like are this one today I miss action movies like are this one. I am a huge fan of Charles Bronson I have been watching his movies since I was a kid and Death Wish series are my favorite film series. Death Wish 123 and 4 were really good misunderstood action movies. DEATH!Death Wish 4 The Crackdown it is my favorite Charles Bronson action film in the 80's. Michael Winner who directed the first three films in the series was replaced by J. Lee Thompson. Death Wish 4 The Crackdown had a substantially lower budget and a more limited release than its predecessors. Even with a low budget the film for me works I really miss the 80's. The movie and the character Paul Kersey. Paul Kersey kill's the bad guys drug dealers for all the children and that's all the movie tells you. Charles Bronson acts brilliant and does a fine solid job. John P. Ryan is a perfectly bad guy. SoonTek Oh plays a corrupt cop he plays decent the bad guy. Kay Lenz was beautiful and decent perfectly as the new girlfriend of Paul Kersey. Perry Lopez as the bad guy was also excellent. George Dickerson as detective Reiner was excellent cop i have seen and a real good guy. Almost everyone who played in this movie is dead and it is no longer with us anymore. This movie has my respect. The movie has tons of action and explosions Paul Charles Bronson uses a M16 with M203 grenade launcher to go after Nathan White John Ryan and his men at the roller rink. He shoots the bad guys and he blows Nathan White with grenade launcher to pieces. I miss action movies like this this were real practical effects real actions no CGI crap all real actions. Is it just me or this is just my action movie? I love Paul Kersey he kills all the bad guys with machine gun MAC10 and kills all the drug dealers. The movie has a beautiful score that I love from John Bisharat Paul McCallum and Valentine McCallum.Death Wish 4 The Crackdown is an American 1987 action crime film and the fourth installment in the Death Wish film series. The film was directed by J. Lee Thompson and features Charles Bronson who reprises his leading role as Paul Kersey.910 Grade A".

Not as good as the first face it hardly any action flick with a vigilanty storyline as been as good as the first death wish the 4th one makes kersey a little more human. You want him to find those responsible for the death of his girlfriends's teen daughter. You cheer when he gets the bad guy. Personally I would to have loved to have seen a little more interaction between Bronson and Soon Tekoh perhaps one of the most underrated supporting actors in movie history.

	schema:reviewBody "Death Wish 4 is easily my favorite of the DW series even though I really like most of the first entry. But you see I find graphic luridly depicted rape in films distasteful. I could take it in the first film because there was at least some thematic and emotional need for it though I still think it was overboard and gratuitous. Parts 2 and 3 escalated the rape and humiliation sequences and writerdirector Michael Winner actually seemed to be trying to get us to enjoy the sight of tortured crying beaten naked woman as much as he obviously did combine this with zero plot zero character development and inept action and you had some really really bad flicks. Number four was directed by J. Lee Thompson a frequent collaborator with Bronson since 1976's St. Ives. Thompson took the usual DW revenge formula eliminated the obligatory rape sequence and ratcheted up the action. So what we have is a Death Wish picture more similar to Murphy's Law than any of the other films in the series. Of course Bronson's 80s films are often the butt of jokes to those who remember them at all that is but I happen to enjoy them immenselythere's just something I dig about this charismatic elderly guy running around shooting bad guys I can't even explain it. If you dig the salt and pepper Bronson as well then give DW4 a try.".

Charles Bronson returns as mildmannered vigilante Paul Kersey only this time he's taking on a powerful drug cartel his girlfriend's daughter having died of a crack overdose. Backed by a mysterious publisher named Nathan White Kersey yet again transforms himself into a oneman army dishing out justice where justice is due.Of all the Death Wish films this ranks not only as one of the best but as the most complex. The plot takes an interesting twist or two particularly when it appears White is not who appeared to be and Kersey pits rival drug dealers against one another. It's also fun to watch Kersey employ his inventive methods of thinning the herd as he put it in a previous Death Wish. The scene where he passes himself off as a wine salesman for instance is great. Who would have thought an explosion that massive could result from such a small bottledisguised bomb? And besides all of that who doesn't want to see drug dealers get what's coming to them?Is Death Wish 4 slightly cheesy? Perhaps. Are the characters deep and the production values high? No. Is it completely outlandish to see a senior citizen pickin' off bad guys? Sure. But nobody ever claimed that this movie was going to win awards.

Just wondered. Also couldn't help but ponder from reading Puzo's book and seeing the movies Who lost more close friends family etc. to murder Don Corleone or mildmannered architectconscientious objector Paul Kersey?The original gave a plausible reason for Paul's ability with guns although he had eschewed them following his gun collectorfather's death in a hunting accident.But as these series installments proceeded and you look at them anew now there are other fascinations Charlie performed these roles beginning in his 50's to a period where he had been eligibile for early social security payments for over a decade.Further he rotated between both coasts having no trouble becoming ensconced comfortably every time with successful business activity a host of friends many of whom met their demise and a dual schedule which would keep either a fulltime businessman or a fulltime mob button man busy at his singular profession  but Paul handled both with little detraction from either by the other.And his affinity for hand guns and undoubtedly rifles as previously explained aside  Paul also seems to have had the ability to acquire capabilities with regard a wide variety of heavy weaponry and ordnance exceeding a level reached by say even General Patton. Finally while I've always lived several hundred miles from each coast my best friend is in L.A. and I have friends in New York City and have spent regular extended periods in both. In these flicks unlike any experience my friends or I have had or know of anyone who has  Paul keeps a dual schedule in both his lives whereby he seems never to be impeded by traffic jams or any big city delays  whether engaged in architectural duties dispatching hosts of villains and evading detection just about every time. He also seems to have the time also along with the cleverness of a CIAFBI operative to infiltrate when and where necessary to further his objectives of vengeance.A fascinating body of work even more so decades after original release. Among them though this one has more intricacy and some essence of plotsome twistsetc. not much evident in the others.".

Also couldn't help but ponder from reading Puzo's book and seeing the movies Who lost more close friends family etc. to murder Don Corleone or mildmannered architectconscientious objector Paul Kersey?The original gave a plausible reason for Paul's ability with guns although he had eschewed them following his gun collectorfather's death in a hunting accident.But as these series installments proceeded and you look at them anew now there are other fascinations Charlie performed these roles beginning in his 50's to a period where he had been eligibile for early social security payments for over a decade.Further he rotated between both coasts having no trouble becoming ensconced comfortably every time with successful business activity a host of friends many of whom met their demise and a dual schedule which would keep either a fulltime businessman or a fulltime mob button man busy at his singular profession  but Paul handled both with little detraction from either by the other.And his affinity for hand guns and undoubtedly rifles as previously explained aside  Paul also seems to have had the ability to acquire capabilities with regard a wide variety of heavy weaponry and ordnance exceeding a level reached by say even General Patton. Finally while I've always lived several hundred miles from each coast my best friend is in L.A. and I have friends in New York City and have spent regular extended periods in both. In these flicks unlike any experience my friends or I have had or know of anyone who has  Paul keeps a dual schedule in both his lives whereby he seems never to be impeded by traffic jams or any big city delays  whether engaged in architectural duties dispatching hosts of villains and evading detection just about every time. He also seems to have the time also along with the cleverness of a CIAFBI operative to infiltrate when and where necessary to further his objectives of vengeance.A fascinating body of work even more so decades after original release. Among them though this one has more intricacy and some essence of plotsome twistsetc. not much evident in the others.";

Yes crack has claimed the life of another person Bronson's close to that being the daughter Vacation's Barron of his new girlfriend Lenz. So Charlie goes undercover to bust the bastards after being enlisted by a guy John P Ryan who lost his son to crack. Of course much more realistic to bubblegum pic number 3 my favorite this entry sees a wearied Bronson doing what he does best playing Mr Clich tough guy where the movie really goes into the drug problem but more so just has Charlie kicking arse. He masquerades as a bartender to a playboy drug kingpin who became his cop partner in J Lee Thompson's next flick Kinjite where later Charlie is played for a sucker. Just watching the party scene we can patently see Charlie would rather be somewhere else but if you're a desperate or more so is the case here typecast actor you have to take what you can get. Too this Death Wish has a nice twist near the end I liked something you never would of expected in this though this film is far from the superior original. I think with watching this forth one here's a good time for Charlie to hang up his boots and be done with this franchise in what is an interesting and not badly made pic. Sadly it wasn't with the desperate and final entry six years later the sickest Death Wish yet. Death wish fans will still be content here especially when Charlie brings out the big guns reprising his role as Mr Vigilante Paul Kersey one of his greatest acting performances ever.".

	schema:reviewBody "Death Wish 4 The Crackdown is set in Los Angeles where architect  ex vigilante Paul Kersey Charles Bronson has been happily living with his girlfriend Karen Sheldon Kay Lenz  her teenage daughter Erica Dana Barron. While out with her boyfriend Randy Jesse Dabson Erica is given some cocaine by a dealer later that night Paul  Karen get a phone call to say Erica is in hospital because of an overdose. They rush to be with her but it's too late  Karen dies. The following day Paul is contacted by supposed newspaper publisher Nathan White John P. Ryan who says that he too lost a daughter to drugs  that all drug dealers  smugglers deserve to die  if Kersey wants to dole out a little justice to the drug dealers in Los Angeles he will finance it  give Kersey all the information he has never one to turn down the opportunity to kill some scum Kersey agrees  setsout to bring the Los Angeles drug trade  those who run it down all by himself...Directed by J. Lee Thompson after Michael Winner declined to come back to the series after directing the first three Death Wish 4 The Crackdown is a better film than Death Wish 3 1985 but isn't quite as much fun or quite as entertaining. Death Wish 4 The Crackdown is more of a straight laced thriller in the style of the often imitated Yojimbo 1961 in which Bronson plays two rival drug gangs off against each other in order that they will literally wipe each other out but with a few Death Wish style touches like rape dirty cops  yet another person close to Kersey getting killed. I mean it's just dangerous to know this guy as your likely to either end up raped or murdered. Unlike Death Wish 3 which was a really silly  mindless exploitation flick Death Wish 4 The Crackdown tries to have a little social relevance  bases it's unfortunate events around drugs the perils of taking drugs  the evils of pushing drugs. In fact the film starts off quite anti drug with a tour around an LA county morgue in which most of the bodies there are drug related  Karen a journalist trying to write a story about the dangers of drugs but even her editor saying noone cares anymore but this moral preaching  social message is soon completely ditched in favour of a fairly entertaining action thriller as Bronson plays the two gangs off one another  if you throw in a couple of neat twists then this really ain't too bad. Death Wish 3 had everyone know who everyone else was  Bronson was the face of vigilantism but here he stays in the shadows  the two drug gangs don't know who he is which makes for a more plausible if not entirely realistic film too. There's also a terrific dialogue exchange here that is maybe the hight light of the series where a dirty cop threatens Bronson  says 'I can be very nasty' before Bronson blows him away with a concealed gun  replies without a hint of irony 'so can I'. The pace is generally good but although it's an improvement on the previous film in terms of plot themes  narrative there's a loss of entertainment value somehow it's just not as much fun even if it does work better as a film.The film looks alright it's much more competent than Winner's Death Wish 3 but again somehow it just loses a little entertainment value because of it. The violence is kept to shootouts  bloody gunshot wounds along with a brief rape at the start. I have to hand it to John P. Ryan who gives it his all  just check out his 80's clothes at the end. The action scenes are workman like  are not particularly memorable but get the done. Bronson also scales down his arsenal here too so there's no rocket launchers or huge machine guns.With a supposed budget of about 5000000 this has solid if unspectacular production values the action scenes are alright if a little flat  I would have liked to have seen more things explode. Explosions are good. Again Bronson stars  actually comes across as quite tough while John P. Ryan is a total hoot here.Death Wish 4 The Crackdown is a decent enough vigilante flick with a hint of Yojimbo thrown in there it's not brilliant but it's not too bad either. Fans of the series should like it followed by one more sequel Death Wish V The Face of Death 1994.".

Don't get me wrong I can watch and appreciate films like Ben Hur 1959 or To Kill A Mockingbird 1962 but unlike great deal of the critics community I keep an opened mind and don't confine myself to these sort of films. Death Wish 4 opens with a brutal and nail biting sequence I won't spoil and doesn't let you of the hook until the final minutes. Paul Kersey is now living happily with his girlfriend and her daughter Erica in LA Until one evening Erica dies of OD. Kersey decides to revenge those who in the drug business with the help from rich and respectable newspaper owner who's daughter also died from use of Cocaine. This time the direction goes to the legendary director who gave us in the 60's such classic as The guns of Navarone 1961 and Cape Fear 1962 and he managed to take the DW series into a good direction. The action is great and dialog is a bit cheesy at times but very entertaining. Here we have all the elements of an action film that we loved over the years Corrupted cop twist at the end etc Charles Bronson is as his usual great here and in the supporting cast Perry Lopez shines as the sleazy mob boss Ed Zacharias. I highly recommend this film and give it 10 stars.".

This fourth outing from the novel Death wish by Brian Garfield in which an architect taking the law into his own hands and acting as judge  jury and executioner  it contains suspense noisy actionpacked  intrigue  thrills and lots of violence . Bronson with his usual stoic acting displays efficiently his weapons such as Harry the Dirty and killing mercilessly nasties . Screenwriter Gail Morgan Hickman rewrote the entire script while filming but Charles Bronson constantly had problems with the dialog . It's certainly thrilling  though the morality may be questionable  even in this time as the spectators were clearly on the KerseyBronson's side . This movie represents the seventh of nine teamings of director J. Lee Thompson with star actor Charles Bronson .

The two first collaborated on St Ives 1976 White Buffalo 1977 Cabo Blanco 1980 Ten to midnight 1983  The Evil That Men Do 1984 Murphy Law 1986. After this movie they made Messenger of Death 1988 and Kinjite 1989. Furthermore  it appears a nice secondary cast  as George Dickerson  SoonTek Oh as obstinate cops  John P Ryan  Danny Barron  Danny Tejo  Mark Pellegrino and as heinous drug baron  Perry Lopez .

	schema:reviewBody "Despite being absolute garbage DEATH 3 was a hugely entertaining franchise movie . It might have been entertaining for all the wrong reasons but it was amusing enough for me to give THE CRACKDOWN the benefit of the doubt when it was broadcast earlier tonight .It starts well enough to continue the campy feel of the third film . A woman walks through a darkly lit car park . Her car fails to start then she looks to see The Masked Magician standing there . She tries starting the car again the fear written upon her face . Now David Blaine stands alongside The Masked Magician . Morbid panic sets in . The woman realises as this rate the worst thing in the world is going to happen  yes now David Copperfield stands alongside the duo who want to use her in their next trick . Thankfully Charles Bronson turns up to execute these rude magicians only to find he's shot himself and .... it's all been a dream If you've ever attended a class featuring the mechanics and science of screen writing then you'll been warned straight away that never EVER start a film off with a dream sequence  a rule that has just been broken here . Strangely this explains why the opening sequence feels so unreal . It's a dream therefore it's supposed to be surreal so kudos for the production team for at least understanding internal continuity . Unlike DW3 this movie does take place in a recognisable world but the longer it continues the longer you wished the franchise had died in the previous movie for two reasonsThe first reason is that it's deadly dull . Say what you want about DW3 but at least it's amusing if not laugh outloud funny as you're able to point out how it would be impossible for the events on screen to happen in  our world  . Not here where there is a sort of reality involved . There are some ridiculous moments to THE CRACKDOWN such as Bronson having a machine pistol that has a magazine capacity of several hundred rounds but you've seen that type of goof in so many movies it has become part of cinematic convention . Nearly every 80s action thriller suffers from the same flaws The second reason the movie is so bad is the entirely naive attitude towards cocaine . I wish to state I have never tried a class A drug but I know many people who have . I think nothing less or more for them having done so . Drugs are bad I do agree but the almost obscene rant that his movie takes against users and dealers is not even bad enough to be amusing . Teenage girl takes cocaine for the first time and dies . Hands up anyone who knows someone killed by cocaine ? We're all in the same boat then aren't we ? On top of that Bronson's character spent the first three movies killing muggers  rapists and other human garbage so why does the movie take the offensive stance that someone being killed by drugs is the same moral equivalence as someone being murdered ? As you can imagine Charley boy kills all the bad guys and for some strange reason never realises there will be a few other coke cartels coming along in a few minutes . Maybe being a vigilante he possess a clear insight that if you kill drug dealers no one will take their place unlike what happens in say the real world ? Oh dear I'm starting to realise maybe DW3 was a fly on the wall documentary compared to this ! Just shows what a badly thought out and naive movie it is after all".

Charles Bronson's acting seemed a bit more inspired in this one than in DW3 and its a very enjoyable and well written movie. It did at times seem like a Nancy Reagan Just Say No propaganda film but that didn't bother me too much. I liked the surprises in the plot line and there were a few things that I didn't expect which I enjoyed. The scene in the parking garage near the end is probably my favorite as well as the scene where Chuck goes off on the drug dealer how many kids have you killed with this SHITT? as he throws the drugs at him and kills him. Definitely worth watching and if you are a fan of the DW series this ranks in the top two or three movies........".

The reason for this was because the storyline dealt with the drug cartels so it added a whole different layer and aspect to the movie.It was rather fun to see a young Danny Trejo in this movie. The doll of Trejo during the explosion scene was just hilariously bad.The scene where Paul Kersey played by Charles Bronson crashed the police car the ramp behind the other car was so painfully visible that it was ridiculous. And I actually went back to watch that scene three times just for the sheer laughs of how bad it was.Of course Paul Kersey lost more people that he loved and cared about in this movie. Seems like he is being followed by some curse that claims everyone he becomes close to.Death Wish 4 The Crackdown was actually the best of the four movies in the franchise thus far.".

It's extremely cheaplooking apparently not that much more was spent than B movie companies still in the theatrical business were spending around this time. It leads to a lot of shoddy moments like an explosion in a restaurant that is clearly superimposed instead of actually filming an explosion taking place there. There are other goofs like how you can see the squibfiring cables trailing out of the pantlegs of characters who get shot. Or how a window shatters a second before someone actually runs into it. Clearly veteran director J. Lee Thompson's heart was not into this movie possibly because of his advanced age at this point of his career. The action scenes are pretty lifeless not helped by them being incredibly inept in their editing by Thompson's son at times. It's too bad Michael Winner didn't stay with the series. Even given the sometimes questionable decisions in his career including in this series he almost certainly would have pumped up the energy here. The only bright spots come from a few unintentional humorous moments  It's those damn drugs! a bomb exploding SEVERAL times or how Cannon relentlessly promoted itself in the video store scene.Bronson himself doesn't seem very energetic. The screenplay really doesn't give a lot of extraordinary things for him to do or say here. Curiously the screenplay was written by a woman and in fact this female touch sets things up in the beginning that actually have a lot of potential. However the screenplay abruptly changes track and ignores further exploration of these things to become a dumb shootup. I wonder if this was actually how it was written or things during the production resulted in lastminute rewrites or reedits  it would certainly explain how Kay Lenz's character suddenly disappears early on and doesn't show up again until the last few minutes!".

Personally I'm all for Sequel's As long as they are entertaining and add some things that are new and Death Wish 4 Does that.The Plot Once again involves Paul Kersey Charles BronsonNow Living with a Girlfriend Kay Lenzin L.Aeverything Seems to Be going Good for them until Kersey's Girlfriend's Daughter Dies From a Cocaine Overdose Kersey Goes out to find the Pusher who sold her the Drugs and Kills him however the next day Kersey gets a mysterious phone call from someone Claiming to know who Kersey is and telling him to meet the caller at a specified address he goes to the address and meets a Reporter who's Daughter also died from a Cocaine overdose and with Kersey's Help wants revenge on the entire drug underworld. He offers Kersey Info on all the Drug Dealers in L.A as well as access to more weapons. Kersey Accepts the offer and goes on the Hunt to Destroy the entire Drug underworld.Death Wish 4 The Crackdown Is a welcoming Change to the Series instead of having Kersey just killing Muggers and Rapists we have him taking on an entire Drug Underworld in a reasonably Clever way by setting up Rival Drug mobs against each other the paranoia and Confusion between both the Drug Mobs is exciting and somewhat funny to watch and the action this time is a little Lighter than the 3rd film but thats balanced out with Clever Set Pieces Suspenseful Moments and Funny One Liners delivered from both Bronson and the Supporting Cast but the action is still enjoyable despite it being a little toned down and Bronson definitely seemed to be having more fun in this one than in the 3rd film and another thing is there is not one rape scene in the entire film well except in the opening scene there is an rape attempt but nothing graphic or as Shocking like the previous films Thank God If there's anything bad about the film it's very minor The film isn't exactly original but things like Originality Don't Matter as long as they are not Blatantly Copied and in Death Wish 4 as far as i know it's certainly not I did miss Jimmy Page's Score however and the ending seemed Like a repeat of the 3rd film only not as good but its not Unsatisfying.

Though that changes when Erica dies from a drug overdose one night. Naturally this led Kersey to find out who was responsible and punishes them accordingly. This weaponry and information Kersey holds is backed by a wealthy publisher Nathan White whose daughter supposedly died from drug use too. His goal is to wipe out the drug lords and pushers of L.A. with Kersey leading the way. Hot on his trail are two suspicious cops that might have Kersey figured out.Like I'm sure Charles Bronson is feeling the series is starting to get quite laboured and be nothing more than a milking exercise. So what do we get up to here? The weakest of the franchise? I can live with that. What starts of as an imaginatively crunching opening goes downhill kinda fast and falls away from vigilante motivation. The well thought out material takes on a different slant and so does our weary protagonist. For some that might be a welcome change to the driedup formula. Drugs are the topic of concern here and Kersey feels like nothing more than a tool being pushed around rather than just having a personal agenda of frustration to let out. This is quite an interesting characteristic look on how his obsession is starting to work against him and be played on by puppeteers. Selfishness and righteousness are becoming one and the complex pattern leads to only more trouble for Kersey. The only difference between him and those killers is the moralistic mindset he demonstrates. Sounds great! Well it's too bad the stolidly basic script doesn't complement the dense idea but likes to manipulative spell it out for you instead. Maybe I'm reading too much from the tinpot premise.Since Kersey is here to basically to stop drugs getting onto the streets and intoxicating the easyinfluential young minds that these people prey on. Yep drugs are bad and Kersey is here to put a stop to it. Which makes it come across like Kersey's actions are rational. This one goes even bigger than the last film in its stunts and these are no more than just thugs Kersey is facing. What we got are wellorganised drug traders that are ruthlessly deadly and are important figures. So that's no easy job. But now since his packing heavy weaponry that makes it easy. Yeah right. How improbable can you get! I missed how he went about things in a simple and brisk manner. Oh well times have change and it shows how comfortable the character has become of it. The longwinding fantasy story is totally incomprehensible that it threw up a twist that shockingly caught me off guard. In parts the twisty story actually works in the format of 'Yojimbo''Fistful of Dollars'. Again you don't want to get close to this character how unlucky can one man be?! Charles Bronson's performance is rather frosty although there's a little more effort there in his tough guy image. The underrated actor John P. Ryan is greatly versatile and embodies in his role with great ticker. The pairing of the two makes the picture worth a look. The rest of the support cast are okay in their middling characters. Perry Lopez was considerably lively as one of the big birds of the drug trade and Kay Lenz is given little as Kersey's reporter girlfriend. Also making small recognisable appearances are Mitch Pileggi Danny Trejo and Dana Barron. There's a real sleekness to J. Lee Thompson's generic direction and he knows how to go out with a bang. The action scenes are well presented but extremely routine and there's a Hollywood polish about it. It's lacking something and that's probably a sting in its tail. The film is fluidly shot making good use of the variedly authentic locations. While the breezy music score is lacks that edge and is raggedly dull in its escalating cues.It's not great but I don't think this is terrible despite believing it to be the weakest of the series. There's hunk of entertainment there if you're not looking for anything grand.".

Since a month away in March 2nd Death Wish remake is coming out with Bruce Willis I am reviewing all Death Wish films. I am a huge Death Wish fan and Charles Bronson  Die Hard fan. This is a sequel to the original classic 1974 film Death Wish. It was brilliantly directed by Michael Winner who once again teamed up with Charles Bronson. This film is very entertaining fast paced not boring not dramatic real action movie. I love this film to death I grew up watching it. It is long only 1 hr and 28 mins. it is not that long. It is my third favorite Death Wish film in the series I always enjoy it. This is an action packed stylish revenge flick in the 80's. this movie was filmed in 1981 and come out in 1982 the same year that First Blood come out. The first Rambo film is my all time favorite action film alongside with death Wish II. This sequel in my opinion is better than the original because it has more action and it is styled on a revenge. Charles Bronson is back as Paul Kersey the original vigilante. The film was filmed in Los Angeles California in which the plot was set. Charles Bronson's wife Jill Ireland was in here and she played Kersey's girlfriend. In all Death Wish films Jill Ireland's character Geri Nichols was the only one who wasn't killed off. Charles Bronson refused that his real wife is assaulted and brutalized so she did come on in this movie and she was brilliant not only gorgeous but she arguably acted brilliantly well. Charles Bronson is fantastic as Architect Paul Kersey getting revenge on a muggers who raped and killed his house keeper and his daughter. It is time to settle the score. He is excellent and it is his best performance in here. Paul kersey is his best role in my opinion. I love this film to death I saw it as a kid I watched the trilogy. Death Wish 12 and 3 were all directed by Michael Winner which he did a brilliant job as the director. The film has a lot of action real bloody squibs it is rated R. It has rape explosions great gun fights and great shootouts. Paul kersey is looking for 5 rapist and killers who brutalized his daughter. I love how Paul tracks the first killer down and shoots him right in the chest. You believe in Jesus? Yes I do. Well you're gonna meet him. bang he shoot's him dead. Paul Kersey saves an older men and his wife from been raped again and he kills most of the rapists and save the couple before they would be killed. He shoots down the second mugger in a final attempt he shoots' him dead. I love how Paul Kersey is tracking down the killers one by one like a Predator. I love the idea that actor Vincent Gardenia as Det. Frank Ochoa returned from the original film to be in this sequel. He stood up from Paul he saved Paul's life he killed the sniper aiming on Paul and sacrifice him self. Vincent Gardenia's brilliant performance too bad he is no longer with us anymore. In the final shoot out with a lot of automatic weapons Paul kill's two out of three muggers one get's away. He kill's their friends too who are arm's dealers. He shoot's with his Beretta 84 one shooter trough window glass of the car and the mugger Jiver Laurence Fishburne in the head of radio when he tried to flee and he killed him. I love the final fight between Paul and Nirvana Thomas F. Duffy. Charles Bronson did his own stunts but in which Nirvana pushes Paul in the wall you can see that was Bronson's stuntman. All the actors in this movie does a fine job. No CGI or shaky cam real actions real guns and automatic weapons all made for real. I love action movies like this. Jimmy Page makes a music score for the Death Wish that I love specially in the beginning of the credits. Jimmy Page replaced Herbie Hancock. Actress Robin Sherwood replaced actress Kathleen Tolan who was playing Carol Kersey Paul's daughter. It was never explained what happened to Steven Keats character Jack Toby from the first film. The muggers in this movie are Thomas F. Duffy Kevyn Major Howard Stuart K. Robinson Laurence Fishburne as Laurence Fishburne III E. Lamont Johnson and they are believable. In this movie one of the muggers was also Laurence Fishburne who was called that time in the 80's Larry he also played in Red Heat and A Nightmare On Elm Street Part 3 Dream Warriors and he acted well in this movie.Michael Winner brilliantly directs this stylish action masterpiece and David Engelbach writes an excellent script that delivers. I always enjoy this film and it is one of the best sequels in the Death Wish series. My all time number 1 favorite is Death Wish 3 this is my third favorite Death Wish film. Death Wish II is a 1982 crime thriller action film directed by Michael Winner. It is the first of four sequels to the 1974 film Death Wish.1010 it is my favorite action film in Death Wish series. Today all action movies are wrong in Hollywood they don't make em' like this anymore. Charles Bronson was the best actor.".

	schema:reviewBody "The second Death Wish film has a very strange concatenation of qualities. It can come dangerously close to running off the rails altogether but overall I think it's a more successful film than the first Death Wish.The first peculiarity is that much more strongly than the first film Death Wish II's urban crimeridden backdrop is exaggerated to a point of caricature. Of course there was plenty of crime in Los Angeles during this era but not as depicted here. This is almost Broadwaystyle crime with choreographed gaggles of hoodlums running out of control in designer gangwear making spectacles of themselves. It's over the top but serious in a way that feels uncomfortable at first but then that's just the point and it helps anchor the plot developments that follow.And that plot should be no surprise to anyone who first watches Death Wish I. Death Wish II follows the plot of its predecessor as if it were a fairly rigid template. Even the events that cause Paul Kersey Charles Bronson to take charge and clean up society's scum by his lonesome are very similar. I don't see this as a flaw here as I don't in many other sequels that use a template approach including series like Friday the 13th. This is a direct continuation of the story of the first film and the similarity gives Death Wish II both a natural logical flow and a nice symmetrical structure.Although Death Wish I had its brutal moments Death Wish II amplifies that atmosphere and sustains it through its length. Like the films that best display gritty 1970s New York Citysuch as Taxi Driver 1976 and Basket Case 1982Death Wish II makes you feel almost dirty in the grimy despair way not a sexual way while watching it. It's ironic maybe that Death Wish II does this so well when the setting is Los Angeles as opposed to actually being New York City as in the first film. That director Michael Winner is able to perpetuate that atmosphere whether by accident or design results in the viewer being sucked into the setting and vicariously experiencing the range of unpleasant emotions felt by both the protagonists and the antagonists.Also helping on that end is the score provided by Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page. Although Winner sometimes incorporates Page's music in a discordant jarring wayover the opening credits when it fights for volume with radio banter for examplemore often than not the score gives Death Wish II a sublime otherworldly and eerie edge. It's too bad that Page didn't go on to score many more films.This is certainly not a film to show during family time and it's not particularly uplifting or overflowing with positive messages or socially redeeming values. But it's not trying to be any of those things. It's just a visceral especially on an emotional level disturbing revenge flick and at that it meets its goals well.".

	schema:reviewBody "The supposed correlation between violencesexuality in art and violence in reality has been shoved to the forefront of our culture especially in the past decade when incidents such as the Columbine massacre confirmed politicians' fears of an unregulated entertainment industry in need of a spanking. In nonfanatical everyday reality however I have come to disagree with the equation above. Some would argue that ugly violent nihilistic and generally misanthropic films like Death Wish and its sequels do nothing but contribute to intensifying the more unsavory impulses that lay dormant in the viewer's id.Yet therein lies the purpose of such roughedged unpleasant entertainment. It sparks the id pummels it into submission so that when the experience is over a sigh of relief is uttered.The original Death Wish was a welldone exploitation flick with the professional gloss of an A picture despite its relatively shallow insight into the murky moral terrain of vigilante justice it contained an intensely subdued performance by Charles Bronson and confident direction by Michael Winner.By comparison Death Wish 2 is a typical sequel taking what the original had and dumbing it down to milk some cash for the franchise. In addition to Bronson in the role of architect Paul Kersey a few other characters return to provide at least a superficial connection to the original Robin Sherwood as his daughter Vincent Gardenia as the cop that uncovered his identity. The plot is as before Paul Kersey has begun a new life courting the cheerfully cardboard Jill Ireland which is shattered when a gang of punks including a young Laurence Fishburne rape and murder his housekeeper and daughter. Unlike the original no time is spent watching Kersey contemplate his actions he simply goes to work and in the process is rendered a stoic killing machine.

	onyx:emotionText "The supposed correlation between violencesexuality in art and violence in reality has been shoved to the forefront of our culture especially in the past decade when incidents such as the Columbine massacre confirmed politicians' fears of an unregulated entertainment industry in need of a spanking. In nonfanatical everyday reality however I have come to disagree with the equation above. Some would argue that ugly violent nihilistic and generally misanthropic films like Death Wish and its sequels do nothing but contribute to intensifying the more unsavory impulses that lay dormant in the viewer's id.Yet therein lies the purpose of such roughedged unpleasant entertainment. It sparks the id pummels it into submission so that when the experience is over a sigh of relief is uttered.The original Death Wish was a welldone exploitation flick with the professional gloss of an A picture despite its relatively shallow insight into the murky moral terrain of vigilante justice it contained an intensely subdued performance by Charles Bronson and confident direction by Michael Winner.By comparison Death Wish 2 is a typical sequel taking what the original had and dumbing it down to milk some cash for the franchise. In addition to Bronson in the role of architect Paul Kersey a few other characters return to provide at least a superficial connection to the original Robin Sherwood as his daughter Vincent Gardenia as the cop that uncovered his identity. The plot is as before Paul Kersey has begun a new life courting the cheerfully cardboard Jill Ireland which is shattered when a gang of punks including a young Laurence Fishburne rape and murder his housekeeper and daughter. Unlike the original no time is spent watching Kersey contemplate his actions he simply goes to work and in the process is rendered a stoic killing machine. The characterizationmotivation for the punks is given even less thoughtthey exist for the sole purpose of showing how scummy the scummiest scum of society can be. The film moves from one random encounter to the next wherein Kersey stumbles across gang members and kills them.Of course this doesn't sound like highbrow filmmaking but Death Wish 2 never teases the audience with any notions of greatness.

The only difference is that they make Paul Kersey have more emotional interaction with the creeps he kills which makes it seem to be more Hollywood. In the first Death Wish Kersey would just kill them stone cold without having a conversation. That's why the original was so good as so realistic.".

I must admit that this is an interesting movie psychologically but I don't think any five penny analysts could do anything to these sick people. Everybody is sick in this movie. It has the overall feeling of some really cheap lowlife bar The feeling of disappointment and failure in life. I would say it's the overall feeling of death This movie feels like you would have just heard that you have an incurable cancer. It's an interesting fact that Charles Bronson is or at least has been some kind of popular action hero He looks like a disappointed and tiredtoeverything alcoholic. An interesting worldview and feeling. There is NO humor joy or hope in this film Not even before the bad guys come and ruin it all. The bad guys names tell all Nirvana Stomper Cutter Punkcut Jiver. They are the bad guys and nothing else. They even smoke the herb and become psychotic and aggressive killermadmen after that! I didn't know that that stuff makes that but it's always good to learn. The bad guys first dance chill out and have fun and all of the sudden start to rape and kill people. After that they forget about it. It seems that the main character Bronson is a real psychopath at least he fits perfectly of the description of one. I have to correct what I said before Not everybody is totally sick in this movie Just the ones that are involved in THE WAR. There is some very few goodlooking pictures in this film for example when the antihero walks in the streets at night. It's funny how he judges people that are unknown to him For example when he sees somebody drinking alcohol he looks at him with an expression of total repulsion on his face. Some police story also goes in the background but it doesn't have much to do with the movie.But after all this film manages to represent some peoples the filmmakers very strong feelings and evidently also the feelings of many viewers and isn't that one of the main purposes of any piece of art or selfexpression? Can you judge people for how they feel? If you want to see a really good movie of this genre revengemoralstory I strongly recommend Tony Scott's Man on Fire 2004with Denzel Washington Christopher Walken Mickey Rourke Dakota Fanning.

The absolutely gungho 3 the fun 4 the final 5. With sequences that seems to be at home in movies like Forced Entry or I Spit on Your Grave Death Wish 2 is definitely not your ordinary vigilante movie dealing with themes and graphic imagery that would make the newer cleaner vigilante movies like Death Sentence feel like Terms Of Endearment.In Death Wish 2 it's not all about the violence that makes it sick it's the unhealthy anticipation for it to happen both referring to the two brutal rapesmurders and the vigilante justice that precedes them. Credit goes to Michael Wimmer for portraying this to the utmost degree making the calm before the storm as unbearable as the actual storm itself. In here he beautifully shows us the peaceful and hopeful life that has befallen Paul Kersey Bronson ever since the events of the first film he now has a new job in Los Angeles his daughter has shown signs of recovery from her trauma in the first film and of course there's the obligatory love interest Jill Ireland Who Else?. All of that is destroyed when a group of totally immoral evil horny violent and downright nasty punks one of them being Laurence Fishburne do a nasty house invasion with Bronson's Latina housemaid being the first victim. Needless to say she becomes the subject of asnastyas I Spit on your grave gangrape. Not long after the daughter gets it too with the aggravating fact that the gang engage in the rape of a mentally retarded woman. She then gets an even nastier fate she gets brutally impaled on a fence spikes while trying to escape them.Now you wonder why I had to go further in describing the sordid details of the movie. The simple answer to that question is that is it those scenes that serve as the engine of the entire juggernaut of a movie the driving force behind all the well deservedvigilante killings. If the first one tried to shy away from the cause of Kersey's outrage here it splashes it on your unbelieving face. But to my great surprise the effect of these events seem less on Kersey himself. Instead of going down on his knees and trashing on the floor he remains calm stoic and as determined to kill. And where does that leave the viewer? Taking the emotional brunt not experienced by Kersey they silently cheer him on as he proceeds to brutally wipe out the gang responsible.Like what I said above this is the Death Wish that fully indulges itself in the cathartic need of the people to dish out vengeance on people who deserve it. This film succeeds because it is very successful in creating that need and reinforcing it at the same time with the acts of brutality found in the second part of the film. I also said that it is immorally thrilling because of the entire nature of the film itself. The rapes are presented in a graphic and voyeuristic manner that while some people might turn their eyes from it some will be confused as to whether they will enjoy it or not. If anything it adds to the bleak nature of the film a crude way of making the viewers participants in the atrocities.Overall a great cross of a vigilante thriller and an exploitation movie. Only thing that mars this movie is its attempt in making a romantic angle. But then again it fails in the movie a clear indication that viewers came to see the rapes and the muggings and Charles Bronson killing those responsible one by one.".

This is a graphically violent film that manages to appal and entertain in equal measure.WARNING!!! PLOT SPOILER!!! THE FOLLOWING LINES DESCRIBE THE MOST MEMORABLE SCENE IN THE FILM. READING THIS MAY SPOIL THE FILM. EXTREMELY VIOLENT SCENES ARE ALSO DESCRIBED IN DETAIL AS I FEEL DETAILED DESCRIPTION IS CRITICAL TO MY REVIEW.Death Wish 2 is a VERY violent film. In fact I found some of the violence in Death Wish 2 very hard to take. The biggest problem with Death Wish 2 is the scene where Bronsons maid is brutally gang raped by the youth gang. This is the most violent brutal rape scene I have seen. THIS SCENE WILL SHOCK EVERYBODY! This scene seems to serve no purpose but to titillate and includes the seediest line of dialogue which I have ever heard. When one of the gang is about to rape the maid over the sitting room couch he is told by the gang leader that if he wants her he can take her to bed.This begins a horrible sequence where the maid is flung onto the bed and subjected to a very lengthy hot sweaty brutal gang rape in which she bleeds from her privates a detail missing from the current video versions but intact on older American tapes which were uncut. This scene is unwatchable and really sick. You get the sense that the reason the makers have chosen to depict the rape a very busty and sexy middle aged foreign woman is to appeal to the older woman fantasies of older teens at whom this film seems aimed. The rape scene is made even worse by the fact that I found the actress who plays the maid Silvana Gallardo to be one of the most beautiful sexy women I have seen on screen. She is the only decent actoractress in the movie. Its a shame that she never moved onto better projects than this. The rest of the film is nothing but more graphic depictions of shootings impalings and rape which are moderately entertaining in a morbid way. Charles Bronson gives one of his weakest performances which detracts from the impact of the films horrific content. Being a fan of ultraviolent movies I did find some entertainment value in Death Wish 2 but could not  stomach the despicable manner in which an act of horrific sexual violence was depicted as raw titillation. Very nasty indeed. If you are easily shocked steer well clear of this film!".

Tragedy is never far from this man's door.When a particularly loathsome quintet of punks rapes his daughter and she dies in an escape attempt Kersey is once again motivated to mete out brutal vigilante justice. When the LA cops realize what's happening they consult the cops in NYC knowing what happened there and since the authorities in NYC opted never to prosecute Kersey they have to send out detective Frank Ochoa Vincent Gardenia reprises his role to help cover their asses.While the screenplay by David Engelbach is not exactly believable the belated sequel Death Wish II is still incredibly effective on a visceral level. Even in its cut R rated version it's a pretty merciless meanspirited exercise in sleaze. Director Michael Winner who directed the memorable first film and who would also direct the next sequel keeps the action coming and the pace consistent. It's always a vicarious pleasure to watch a relentless bad ass like Bronson give cinematic scum the vicious comeuppance that they all deserve.And the gang this time are monumentally creepy hulking Thomas Duffy stands out as ringleader Nirvana who proves very tough to take down when the cops move in on him. Laurence Fishburne is another member of the gang but he has very few lines. Other familiar faces add to the enjoyment Anthony Franciosa J.D. Cannon Ben Frank Robert F. Lyons Drew Snyder Paul Lambert Paul Comi Charles Cyphers and Roberta Collins while the love of Bronson's real life Jill Ireland is his love interest a journalist doing a piece on methods of dealing with violence.With a blistering music score by Jimmy Page blasting away on the soundtrack and much effective use of L.A. locations this is intense stuff and offers up some choice sequences. One of course has Bronson meeting with one of the thugs and promising the young man that he will be meeting Jesus shortly. The other has him intervening as a man and woman are being assaulted and when they're being interrogated later they sing his praises to the consternation of the investigating detective Frank.Understandably this entry in the series may be too tough for some people to take but those who delight in seamy vigilante cinema are sure to find viewing this a pleasure. Followed by the over the top comic book styled Death Wish 3.Seven out of 10.".

	schema:headline " A problematic exploitative  challenging death wish...";
	schema:reviewBody "Winner's first Death Wish sequel is in a narrative sense a stronger film than its predecessor that is if you forgive the plethora of coincidence on which the film's main plot rests. The protagonist middleclass architect Paul Kersey has moved from New York to Los Angeles and put his vigilante past behind him. The final stage in his healing should be the reintegration of his damaged daughter into his life and the wider society and his marriage to a socially conscious radio reporter Geri Nichols Jill Ireland Bronson's wife in reality. Yet lightning strikes twice as his doting maid and the recovering daughter are raped and murdered by a gang of street thugs and Kersey becomes a vigilante again taking out the members of the gang onebyone. To paraphrase Wilde to have your daughter raped once Mr Kersey may be regarded as a misfortune to have it happen again looks like carelessness Nevertheless this rather contrived inciting incident gives Winner the opportunity to create a film which whilst it is certainly sensationalistic offers a provocative challenge to viewers whether they be bleeding heart liberals or string 'em up reactionaries. Kersey heads to the streets disguised in working class casual labourer getup takes a room in a twobit dive which he uses as a base for his revenge. This hotel is opposite and above two sparsely populated innercity missions from which emanate Christian prayers preaching and hymns looking to save the souls of the society's criminal classes and dregs. Kersey intends to get to them first. His initial revenge killing here features the coldblooded summary execution of a young blonde thug who wears an ostentatious cross Kersey asks him do you believe in Jesus? and the thug nods yes Kersey ripostes well you're going to meet him now and blows him away the young man's chance at redemption for his sins has been taken from him. Rat are shown scuttling away and the film asks are the criminal classes mere vermin to be cleaned off the streets or have they souls which can be saved? The association between Kersey's prey and animal life is continued later when he wounds one tracking the young man by means of his blood trail.The film also contrasts Kersey's actions with an argument for criminal rehabilitation. Geri is researching the methods by which a criminologist doctor has been rehabilitating offenders and by another ripe coincidence the final member of the gang ends up in the doctor's clinic. Bronson inveigles his way in and metes out death to the perpetrator by means of electrocution. An orderly who works at the clinic catches him and lets him go. There is a class argument being enacted whereby working class men support Kersey and middleclass dogooders think they know a better way. The film heavily weighs the argument in Kersey's favour by showing the thugs as barely human scum but the visceral nature of the debate as portrayed is food for thought. Kersey hardly ends up rewarded for his actions  he loses Gina and is little more than the ghost of a man haunting his regular middleclass lifestyle by the film's close. The idea that Kersey is making himself a shadow of his former social self is portrayed on screen by some nicely done expressionist cinematography.The film's argument is problematized further by the graphic portrayal of the violence especially the sexual violence meted out to Rosario Kersey's maid. A long drawnout gang rape plays out on screen with the stripped woman whipped and humiliated by laughing goons  there's an extent to which Winner and his core audience is revelling with them in their sexual sadism. If ultimately the film's makers and viewers are of the same bent as the criminals then their siding with Kersey is very much a personal death wish.".

	schema:headline " Nasty 80s Fun";
	schema:reviewBody "Death Wish 2 is a nasty piece of work and I mean that in the nicest possible way. There is no pretence about this film whereas the original Death Wish painstakingly presented Paul Kersey as a victim of violence who had been pushed to breaking point Death Wish 2 finds him in John Rambo territory as a borderline crazy person bent on revenge. Unlike the original Death Wish 2 has no political message and never waivers in its approval of Paul's vigilantism. While this is by no means as good as the original which I consider to be a minor classic Death Wish 2 is a great example of the short lived early 80s embrace of ultra violent entertainment before these kind of movies were labelled video nasties and expelled from the mainstream.The main reason why the Death Wish series became increasingly ridiculous is the improbability of one man suffering so much bad luck. This time around a group of thugs break into Paul's home and gang rape his Latina maid. This scene is truly grim and more detailed than most of the more infamous rape  revenge movies of the 80s. The scene is particularly distasteful as poor Rosario gets roughed up so much worse than any other female victim in the series  all of whom happen to be white. Unfortunately I don't think that it is a coincidence as the entire Death Wish series had dubious racial undertones.The action becomes increasing twisted when Paul's daughter Carol still traumatised from the attack in the original film is kidnapped and raped. The nastiness of this act stems mostly from the creepy smile on Carol's face. When Carol is subsequently impaled on an iron gate the transformation from the socially aware film of the 1970s to the sleazy pure action of the 80s sequel is complete. This time around Paul doesn't even bother with the police choosing instead to take all of the thugs out himself.The second half of the film is fairly predictable and a bit slow in comparison with the downright nastiness of the opening half an hour. Paul walks around the streets of LA he definitely gets around shooting muggers rapists and his daughter's attackers. This time around Paul doesn't hesitate shooting anyone and the conflict he demonstrated in the first film is nowhere to be seen. Instead everyone from civilians to the police comment approvingly on his particular approach to crime control. Needless to say Death Wish 2 is about as politically incorrect as they come and yet endearingly of its time.Michael Winner does a good job of capturing the atmosphere of early 80s LA with amusing glimpses of religious fanatics coke dealers and general crazies. The 80s fashion on display is pretty funny and the scene where the thugs dance to their ghettoblaster makes me laugh every time. The acting is highlighted by Jill Ireland's extraordinarily wooden turn as Paul's new girlfriend. Her ability to lower the tone of any Charles Bronson movie borders on the supernatural. Lastly Jimmy Page's soundtrack deserves a mention it is different to say the least.If you are looking for cheap nasty morally corrupt entertainment then you should enjoy Death Wish 2. I certainly did.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first sequel to the legendary 1974 vigilante film Death Wish is not an easy film to watch. The film is dark and grainy the characters are too broadly drawn and there are some disgusting acts of violence. There are a couple good shootouts however and it's always nice to see Bronson dish out his own brand of justice.Our story picks up a few years after the events of part one. Bronson has relocated in Los Angeles and is working as an architect and currently redesigning a radio station building. His daughter is living close by in an institution. She is still greatly disturbed by her traumatic rape in the last film. She can venture out in public under the supervision of her father but she still cannot speak. On one such trip Bronson his daughter and his girlfriend Ireland get into an altercation with a gang of five muggers. The muggers steal Bronson's wallet and find out where he lives. They then show up at his place and... help the maid prepare dinner.Well that isn't quite what happens. This is a Michael Winner film and nobody does rape scenes like Michael Winner. In one of the most shocking scenes ever found in a mainstream film the house keeper is repeatedly raped be these creeps. Depending on the version you see the rape lasts from only a couple minutes to nearly fifteen minutes! This film has been cut to ribbons by editors over the years as each station has their own idea of just how much of it they want to show you. Anyway Bronson and his daughter eventually show up at the house where he is beaten and left for dead while his daughter is kidnapped by the punks. In another tasteless scene his mute and helpless daughter is also raped and then jumps to a gruesome death from a window. I think that scene is really a lot worse than the housekeeper scene.Of course you know where we're headed. Bronson goes on the war path and tracks these five creeps and their associates down and blows them away. Not only are there some neat shootouts but also a few good oneliners along the way. If you can get through the brutality of the first half hour you will enjoy seeing Bronson do what he does best.Bronson's performance is calm and dignified like always. There are two outstanding supporting performances by Vincent Gardenia and Jill Ireland. They share a wonderful scene together as Gardenia hot on Bronson's trail like in part one questions Ireland about Bronson's whereabouts at night. He also informs her of Bronson's history of killing muggers in the Big Apple which leads to a hilarious scene between Bronson and Ireland later on. And YES... that is THE Laurence Fishburne as one of the muggers. He's the one Bronson shoots in the head through a radio. You'll have to see it to understand what I'm referring to.One may be tempted to defend this film by saying that yeah it's pretty nasty but so is real life crime! I won't deny that but I don't buy the argument here. This film with its broad caricatures of street hoods and no less than three sexual assaults is really just a piece of exploitation. The film does have its good moments and apparently enough of them for it to gross 16 million dollars and spawn several more sequels. But Death Wish II is really not going to impress anyone who isn't a rabid fan of Charles Bronson. I would strongly urge anyone and everyone to take a look at part 3 though! That film is an absolute blast! 5 of 10 for Death Wish II. So sayeth the Hound.".

This second routine entry with excessive violence concerns about Paul Kersey  an ageing architect who becomes again into vigilante and wiping out the band of mobsters . The main amusement results to be to guess the kinds of deaths that Bronson executes against the villains  as he carries out retribution and vendetta .

Mediocre screenplay manages a couple of nice twists  but it's too formulary to pursue the ambiguities it reveals . Here filmmaker emphasising a hostile  nightmare terrain and relying his virtually sympathies with the confused  violent Paul Kersey . Bronson with his ordinary stoic acting displays efficiently his weapons such as Harry the Dirty and killing mercilessly nasties . Screenwriter rewrote the entire script while filming but Charles Bronson constantly had problems with the dialog . It's certainly thrilling  though the morality may be questionable  even in this time as the spectators were clearly on the KerseyBronson's side . Furthermore  it benefits from some good support actors  as here appears a nice secondary cast  such as  Vincent Gardenia  J.D. Cannon  Anthony Franciosa  Robin Sherwood  Thomas Duffy  Robert F.

Atmospheric cinematography by two great cameramen  Thomas Del Ruth and Richard H. Kline .The studio  Cannon  Yoram Globus Menahem Golam  produced this one in enough budget . This was the first film that both star Charles Bronson and director Michael Winner made with Cannon Films and producers Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus .

Although he also achieved some important successes as the Death Wish series . The original film Death wish had great commercial hit  it was followed by various extremely violent sequels to this successful 1974 movie  that's  of course  the best from the series  being starred by Hope Lange  Stuart Margolin  William Redfield and Jeff Goldblum .

	schema:reviewBody "Paul Kersey Charles Bronsonhas moved from New York City to Los Angeles as a means of starting over again. His daughter has been released from hospital although she's still in a semicatatonic state. Kersey has a new love interest and a housekeeper and everything seems to be going OK for Kersey. However when Kersey's wallet becomes stolen after he's been mugged the gang find address confirmation in Kersey's wallet and proceed to Kersey's home where they kill his housekeeper and kidnap his daughter and then kill her. Following these events Kersey goes back to his old ways and sets about tracking down the gang of muggers.I think what I liked about Death Wish 2 is the fact that it is more focused than the first film. The narrative in the first film was shaky to say the least and I found that the events in the second half never really connected with what had happened in the first half  he killed lots of would be muggers but never seemed to pursue those that perpetrated the original crime against his wife and daughter which never made any sense to me. Thankfully with this film it's much more straight forward  Kersey goes after the muggers that killed his wife and daughter and that's all there is to this film and it's this straight forward and focused plot that makes this a stronger film. Like the first film it's quite graphic and brutal but again this does give the film a very realistic feel to it. As a direct result of the stronger narrative it ultimately means that the film flows much better and it never really gets to a point where it becomes boring.The only real glaring weakness I could find with this film lay with Jill Ireland I felt that her acting was a bit wooden and her character was probably one of the most bland characters that I've ever seen. I also never really bought into their romance either. Thankfully her character and their romance don't make that much of an impact on the film and Winner mostly just allows Bronson to do his 'thing' which was perfectly OK with me.One final thing I'll say about this sequel is don't be put off by its current rating of 5.9. It's an underrated sequel which is much better than its rating suggests. If you liked the first film then you will like this film. As for me I preferred it to the first film but I know I'm in the minority on that one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Winner has never been known for his subtlety and never has his lack of restraint or taste been more apparent than it is in this belated and to be honest quite unnecessary sequel to his 1974 breakthrough hit DEATH WISH. Whatever the restaurant critic boulevardier and occasional filmmaker spent the eight year interim doing he certainly can't have been brainstorming because this is little more than a rehash of the first movie with a couple of twists. Firstly this one takes place in Los Angeles rather than New York which hurts the atmosphere somewhat. Secondly because this is a sequel and has a Roman numeral after the title someone has decided that it makes sense to have twice as much onscreen unpleasantness. And you know where this review is heading right? THAT scene in which Bronson  the only man alive who could have the bad luck to get mugged whilst queueing for a Cornetto  finds that the horror that befell his family in the Big Apple has followed him to the City of Angels. I have a soft spot for trash cinema and exploitative sleaze in general  I grew up during the video boom in England and a lot of the first films I saw were entertainingly dreadful so you could say I acquired the taste early  but the gang rape scene is so lurid prurient and revolting especially in its uncut form I found a precert copy of this film in a thrift shop that it's wellnigh unwatchable. Not only that there's absolutely no reason for its inclusion in the film other than to make the bad guys even badder and to rub the audience's nose in the grime. It's horribly out of kilter with the outrageous bordering on ridiculous shoot'emup carnage that follows as is a similarly disturbing scene in which Bronson's mute daughter is raped again  remember the first film? before jumping through a closed window to her death a messy and graphic impaling on metal railings. This is Winner going for broke playing naughty boy games with the censors and the fact that the BBFC cut three minutes out of the cinema release couldn't have hurt the publicity drive one bit. Video was uncensored in England until 1984 so the first home release wasn't subject to such officious meddling and I can only wonder how the 'lucky punters' who bought this thing after seeing it in the cinemas reacted. I'm guessing however that they didn't just mutter I didn't see that bit at the ABC and leave it at that! Once you get past the opening salvo of misogynist sleaze however DEATH WISH II turns out to be whisper it pretty good fun in a mindless hideous crowdpleasing way. The violent thugs are lined up and shot down in the manner of an arcade game Bronson is his reassuringly hardfaced hardassed self and it's all unrealistic enough to put a decent amount of distance between the onscreen carnage and the viewer. There's also a goodly amount of cheese for connoisseurs such as the hilarious 'street' dance moves from the ghetto blastertoting freaks drug dealers straight from central casting a FACES OF DEATHstyle electrocution rubbish dialogue from all and sundry and Jimmy Page's bizarre score which alternates between fauxclassical passages earsplitting stringbending and weird electronic swoops...hang on it's Spinal Tap! Let's hear it for Derek Smalls he wrote this! In all seriousness DEATH WISH II is a hard film to like. The rape scenes make it objectionable almost from the getgo and the setup for Bronson's second bite at the revenge apple is revoltingly overdone by anyone's standards. Technically it's about average with Winner's restless direction taking in some bizarre setups and disorientating editing along the way and most of the performances are flat enough to be medically classed as comatose. But if you're in the mood to see predatory hooligans wasted in various nasty ways the final hour may be diverting enough to give you a few chuckles on a slow night. Just don't say I didn't warn you.".

This film is brutal but crime is brutal I think the director did this as in the original not as a selling point but too show the brutality of crime on the victim and the remorselessness of the criminal. This make me understand why Walsh does America Most Wanted.  Criminals the dogs they are do these things and gives the more protected liberal minded person and idea of the kinds of animals the police deal with.  This movie is not for kids! Should something this honest be made? I do not know the answer.  This part of the movie show why Bronson snaps.  The only difference in this film from the original is this time Bronson gets a look at the anus criminals and hunts them down. One other viewer thinks the bad guys act too strange normal people do not do these things but crazy people act crazy.  What hurts this film besides the script is the editing and music.  I like the 80's LA feel but the film is choppy or rushed.  The directing is good but who ever edited this ouch. 510".

I like the 80's LA feel but the film is choppy or rushed.  The directing is good but who ever edited this ouch. 510";

Kersey has put away his old habits until Olivia's exhusband Tommy O'Shea who happens to be mob figure uses her business to run an illegal money laundry scheme and tries at every optometry of scary her from testifying against him in court. They go one step to far when they disfigure and then later on kill Olivia. By law Chelsea is to live with her father. This tips Kersey's world up side down and vengeance mode comes kicking back in.What a crying shame. I'm shocked to see the user rating for this Death Wish instalment to be so low. Making it by far the weakest of the series. I don't agree but hey you can't have it all your own way right. Anyhow this was the filth and final Death Wish to date and it was actually the first one I ever saw. Maybe that's why I seem to cut it a bit more slack then say number four.So it's been going on for twenty years and Charles Bronson who was around 70 at time is still around looking to quite fit and rather animated. Definitely more so than his two previous efforts. Back to form with his dry icecool persona and showing some feeling along the way. What I like about this outing other than being a improvement over Death Wish 4 is that it seems to go back to the dark underbelly and cruel vibe maybe more so that worked in the earlier forays. Kersey is up against more upperclass foes than the usual street pests. At heart is goes back to the basic heavyhanded revenge yarn where the detailed situations are harrowing and the violence is simply coldblooded. He might not want to return the favour as firstly he lets the cop do their job but his finally forced back into his beloved sidetrade as it's in the blood and the loved ones are taken away from him again. Once you start there is no going back even when the police know his secret. The way he subtly toys around with the guilty criminals to get them rather anxious waiting for their turn to be mowed down. Only adds to that ominously nasty touch that waits and the dark humour has real snappiness to it here. The deaths scenes are at times wickedly inventive well it beats going up to someone and just shooting them and rapid stunt work is exceptionally pulled off with such thrilling poise. Oh and how can I forget about the gratuitous slow motion? Some times it works and other times your thinking Oh why?. Anyhow you gotta love it on this occasion! As director and writer Allan Goldstein stylishly tailored it on a much larger scale that seemed to pay dividends with its competently showy set pieces and crisp pacing. There's always something there to hold your interest. In all there's no denying it's by the numbers and the predictable plot has a fair share of clichs grounding it. Although it goes out there to delve a little deeper into the material a highly witty and concise script Idiots with guns make me nervous. and truly making you feel for the characters. The hammy bad guys are typically portrayed as slimy ruthless tyrants that deserve what they get. You'll sure be cheering on Kersey here after you cop a taste of the lively performances of Michael Parks who's tremendously scummy as Tommy O'Shea and Robert Joy makes light work as the paranoid nutter Freddie 'Flakes'. LesleyAnne Down's presence simply glows and is credibly good as Olivia Regent. Giving able support are Saul Rubinek Kenneth Welsh and Miguel Sandoval. The technical side of the production is soundly staged. The special effects are put to good use and come off well. What is nailed down is a traditionally sounding music score that likes too flutter about with loud echoing cues and the standard camerawork sufficiently frames every shot with nice scope.By me saying it shares some common ground with the original films. I guess you'll be hoping for something rough around the edges and some exploitation to fit right in. Too bad as that isn't going to happen. Those looking for the obligatory rape scene too which appears in basically all four forget it. This one is going for the mainstream pool. Even the ending has that copout feel about it with what has gone all before it.For all your troubles it's nothing more than a glossed up blunt actioncrime vehicle for Bronson which manages to mix the good and notsogood aspects of the series. Only fans should bother.".

With his life back to normal no more shooting of criminals and having a classy and beautiful ladyfriend Olivia Regent LesleyAnne Down who has a cute and adorable daughter Chelsea Erica Lancaster things couldn't be better but then They came on the scene. What They did to Paul's future wife and to his and her friends including little Chelsea made Paul turn into the crime fighter and personal avenger that he tried to put behind him. In the end They'll never be the same or in one piece again after the outraged and infuriated Paul Kersey does His Thing or Job on them. They are a Westielike organized mobster gang headed by Paul's lover Olivia's former husband and little Chelsea's father Tommy O'Shea Michael Parks. Tommy is a borderline psycho who loves to hurt and torture people that he doesn't like or who don't obey him as fast as he want's them too. Getting his hands on the garment industry in NYC Tommy has a stranglehold on Olivia who has a line of clothes thats produced from a business that she owns there. The O'Shea mob starts to put the screws on Olivia's business and those working for her. The local D.A Tony Hoyle Saul Rubinek gets a number of workers in the garment center to agree to testify against O'Shea and his mob. Unknown to D.A Hoyle there's a member of his staff who's tipping off O'Shea to who's to testify and has the O'Shea mob murder them before he D.A Hoyle can provide them with police protection. One of those who's at first viciously mutilated and later murdered by the O'Shea Mob is non other then Oliviathis brings the wild animal out of the peaceful and kind Paul Kersey.Charles Bronson's Paul Kersey takes on organized crime in Death Wish 5 unlike the mostly unorganized street thugs and criminals that he took on in the previous four Death Wish films. Again like Kersey did in the earlier movies he does the bad guys in and finishes them off in the most spectacular ways that he can devise. Even though he was 73 at the time in 1994 Charles Bronson is very believable as the avenging vigilante Paul Kersey knocking off the entire O'Shea Mob. Kersey does his unpleasant and bloody job not only with bullets but with cyanidelaced pastries exploding soccer balls and clothes making and knitting machinery.Tommy O'Shea as well as his gang gets his comeuppances by being dropped by Paul into a boiling vat of acid and made to look a lot slimmer and 150 ponds lighter. Not realizing that their no match at all for the angry and rampaging Kersey the O'Shea mob tried to trap him by kidnapping and holding hostage Chelsea at the plant and do him in. Kersey was on to them from the start and in the end it was he who was the hunter and they the O'Shea Mob who were the hunted with the results in this deadly catandmouse game being a forgone and bloody conclusion for them not Paul Kersey.".

Surprisingly especially considering the general quality of their output they manage to improve on the poor quality of DEATH WISH 4. The production values as low budget as they may be aren't as cheap as they were before Bronson is a bit more lively in his performance and the screenplay tries more for a story of substance. What really makes the movie fun at times is its twisted sense of humor. There's some nice black comicmoments such as with one particular mobster's funeral scene or the later plastic wrap sequence. Even better is Michael Parks' performance as the chief bad guy. His various comments improvised? about anything are hilarious and he lays on the ham very thickly to be a lot of fun to watch.It still could have been better. One of the two big problems with the movie is that it takes about half of the movie for Bronson to start his rampage of vengeance. Even with Parks' entertaining performance you'll likely be squirming in your seat with impatience for Bronson to get it on. And when he does get it on it's kind of underwhelming  there's not much of a body count and the length of time between kills is relentlessly padded. At least the end results are not the worst way the series could have ended. By the way Golan actually announced Death Wish 6 The New Vigilante in the trade papers not long after this one was released though his company going bankrupt put an end to that plan.".

	schema:reviewBody "Every Death Wish movie is a classic. They continue to get higher body counts and plenty of action. I never get sick of watching Bronson blow away these scumbags. All of Bronson's movies are great and I think he is by far the greatest actor that ever lived. My favorite films of Bronson have to be the later ones. Kinjite Death Wish 15 Murphy's Law etc. Bronson had big budgets to work with and plenty of people to blow away. The ending of each Death Wish just gets better and better. Blowing people away with Rocket Launcher's Cannon's Bazooka's throwing villain's into Acid. How can any action fan not love this stuff? My favorite Death Wish film is part 4. What a great plot and plenty of Bronson action but Part 5 is also very good and the Villian played by Parks does a really great job. I saw this film in a packed theater and fans were clapping and cheering for each Bronson kill It was great! The DVD was even better. Death Wish 5 had a good plot and plenty of bad guys for Bronson to play with. I would really like to see Bronson make at least on more Death Wish movie. In part 5 his closing line was Call me if you ever need any help. Well Mr. Bronson today's action heroes are a joke and we could use your help to mop up these clowns. Guys like Vin Disel Arnold Stallone Van Dam Siegal to name a few. Even at your age these punks can't hold a candle to your acting or screen presence. I hope to see you again on the silver screen soon. That is my Wish".

And that's totally understandable knowing what he's been through. So both the bad and the good guys are real extremes also in their sickness in these movies. You have to be freakin' crazy to fight these crazies. Fight evil with evil. If you have to fight you have to fight dirty. Because war in itself is bad evil and crazy. These citings are not from this movie they're just clichs. Is there any other way? But compared to the bad guys Bronson's character is also very very sad and sympathetic. It's sad that some people have to see and experience so much evil in this world. It is a very interesting character and portrait of a time and a frame of mind.And the bad guys are not as comical as in some other Death Wishes they are somehow more realistic.From the start setting of this film some mental professional would suggest that Bronson's character is begging for blood and violence in his life He has hooked up with some psychosadistmob boss's exwife who has a daughter with the mentioned. But let's not be shrinks. Shrinks both amateur and pro seem to be wrong very often maybe as often as nonshrinks. Maybe it's just because they have fallen in love. And maybe BronsonKersey has heard about this only later.One of the most important questions that these movies rise is What would YOU do? Would ethics and philosophy of forgiveness be enough if some person would for example kill some of your loved ones with no reason. Would you think that that person has deserved forgiveness and is worth of that? If that person would be a repeated killer who has been in jail a couple of times already for hisher former crimeskillings? Would you think of that person as an equal to some person you love and who you know is trying to be as good person as heshe possibly can? The movie is very well directed shot acted. Good editing and music. The atmosphere is whole. Some nice pictures. It's also more sexy than all the other parts combined. This might be one of the 3 best of the 5 Death Wishes but wouldn't 3 have been enough? Obviously not because these movies are just a small glimpse of the vigilanterevengemovies genre... Worth seeing.".

Death Wish 3 is my second favorite....because there is a lot more gunfire action than that of Death Wish 5.But stillI give Death Wish 5 four stars.As I had seen in this last of the Death Wish films Kersey's fiance Olivia owns a topoftheline fashion design company fictionally called Olivia Regent and she celebrates with a big fashion show for the New York's elite. Her nemisis O'Sheay the head member of a ruthless mob syndicate has other plans. The name O'Sheay means indirectly that this is an Irish mob.O'Sheay mixes in with the New York's elite in the fashion show and finally begins the demise of Olivia when Olivia and Kersey dine at a topoftheline restaurant. O'Sheay disguises his face and as Olivia goes to the washroom I had seen the big shock.....O'Sheay going into the women's washroom disguised as a transvestite and ramming Olivia's face into the bathroom's mirror glass a few times changing her face forever. In a world where beauty is king this despicable act tells me how evil can ruin innocent lives.The big allusion in the flick seems to be the bath of sulfuric acid in the fabric factory when one of the mobster's friends tests out this acrid and deadly tub on one of Olivia's manniquins and several of her alreadydesigned evening dresses. It would be the same dangerous liquid that would be used when O'Sheay is pushed back by Kersey's rifle right into the tub. And the rest....would be history.The big turning point was when members of the policeacting on orders of O'Sheaystorm into Olivia's home and kill Olivia...and attempt to kill Kersey also. This happened because of a twisted justice system when Kersey thought the police would come to Olivia's house to acquire protective custody from O'Sheay's mobsters so that Olivia could testify against the mobsters in order to bring them down and send them to jail for a very long time. But when Olivia dies Kersey realizes that all of this is a farce.And most importantly what was unusual in the first Kerseystyle vigilante death when he kills all of the mob perpetrators was that one of the mobsters was not killed by the usual Kersey propa gunbut instead by canoli tainted with cyanide powder....where the first mobster who died thought that powder was innocent flour.".

Also what is interesting here is when Bronson gets rid of the scum using different methods than just the usual old gun. In this vein I liked most the radiocontrolled football which blew apart Flakes' face and the death of the villain at the end in the acid bath when we see his flesh melting away off the face in the acid.The only reproach I would make to the film are its picture and sound quality  on the dvd at least . These are really not up to scratch for a film made in the 1990's.I eagerly await the day when Death Wish 3 and Death Wish 4 will be available on dvd. Bronson is truly a great actor whatever the role he plays but he is especially effective in the part of a vigilante.".

Paul Kersey is an everyday man who goes vigilante after someone hurts any of his relatives close friends heck even distant acquaintances.

Of course there would not be any Death Wish films if the screenwriters came up with an original idea. When Death Wish came out in the early 70's it was original and Paul Kersey was seen as a hero for fighting back against the street scum that killed his wife and rapped his daughter. Charles Bronson played the part well and you shared his rage and pain for what happened to his family. Since the first movie it just sunk into endless boring violence with no point at all. Paul Kersey just morphed from victim to the very scum he set out to kill in the first movie. What a sad end to a wonderful film Carrier for Bronson. Part 5 just stinks and is rotten to the core. Not just in film making but acting as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "While not as wellknown today as some of his later films Alfred Hitchcock's spy thriller Foreign Correspondent is entertaining exciting and masterfully constructed.  Though lacking the star power of some of the great director's more famous movies the cast is very good the settings are wonderfully conceived and the story and writing keep the viewer's attention at all times.  It has everything we hope for from Hitchcock action suspense and a good dose of humor.The plot is a complicated one beginning when American reporter Johnny Jones Joel McCrea is sent to Europe just before the outbreak of World War II. Expected to send back news about the possibility of war Jones stumbles across an espionage ring that is using kidnapping and murder in an attempt to get important government secrets for use in the coming war.  The action goes from England to Holland and back to England with Jones constantly escaping from danger as he tries to get the details of the spy plot for his newspaper.  It does take some effort to follow everything that is happening but there are many action sequences and a lot of good writing  with many fine touches of humor  that make it easy to pay attention.In the lead role McCrea performs with the easygoing understatement that typifies the heroes of Hitchcock's earlier films.  Laraine Day is pleasant if unspectacular as McCrea's romantic interest whose father played nicely by Herbert Marshall is also one of the key figures on the international scene.  The supporting cast also has some fine actors.  George Sanders for once gets to play a good guy Robert Benchley is very funny as McCrea's fellow foreign correspondent and Albert Basserman is touching as an old diplomat who has seen too much of the world's troubles.But it is the action sequences and the settings that really make the film. Hitchcock's expert hand can be seen in almost every setting and he displays a wealth of creative ideas here equal to any of his films.  Particularly good are the memorable windmill scenes and the exciting climactic sequence in midocean.  This final sequence is not only thrilling it also perfectly completes all of the film's action and themes.Foreign Correspondent contains plenty of excitement humor and suspense along with some of Hitchcock's best set pieces.  It is highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alfred Hitchcock directed many great movies but few testify to his ability at marrying suspense action and comedy as does Foreign Correspondent a film which coincidentally carries Hitchcock's boldest political statement That neutrality doesn't work when others are bent on war.Joel McCrea stars as American newspaperman Johnny Jones sent to Europe on the eve of World War II by the newspaper's publisher precisely because he's a man of action unschooled in politics and economics someone who doesn't know the difference between an 'ism' and a kangaroo the old publisher declares. Jones goes along with the idea even with changing his byline to the pompous Huntley Haverstock because as he puts it give me an expense account and I'll cover anything. Fate intervenes when a photographer apparently murders Europe's last hope for peace right in front of Jones spurring the reporter to react in a way that leads to a series of outrageously precarious and doublecrossing incidents culminating in a plane crashlanding into the Atlantic Ocean.Hitchcock arrived in the U.S. with a flourish his first Hollywood movie being the Oscarwinning Rebecca and this his second that same year 1940. Some back in Great Britain complained Hitchcock's leaving his native country as it faced Hitler all alone was desertion but Hitchcock was doing all he could for King and Country as Foreign Correspondent pulls all the stops to shake American viewers from their neutrality.That sort of desperation would ruin most films but here it only prods Hitchcock to singular and repeated acts of inventiveness as he shakes the tree. We see Jones climb out the window of the Hotel Europe knock out the letters EL to underscore the film's message and find his way into the hotel room of the girl he has been trying unsuccessfully to woo. There's an assassination in the rain and shot from above so we see little more than wet hats and umbrellas and a long sequence inside a creaking windmill that has you thinking our hero's about to be discovered by the bad guys every 20 seconds. The film feels more vital for sequences like this You can't imagine anyone trying to get away with this yet Hitchcock keeps pulling it off.Then there's the other revolutionary element of the film its humor everpresent throughout the picture in a way that doesn't cut against the grain of the suspense so much as amplify it by keeping you offguard and invested in the action. This is best exemplified by Edmund Gwenn's plummy turn as an evil assassin no spoiler he's introduced to us that way bent on killing Jones but so affable and borderlinesnarky in his menace you can't root against him as much as you'd like to. As Gwenn's Rowley leads Jones up a church steeple to set up an accident you wonder how Jones will get out of it but still chuckle at how Rowley tries to keep Jones from going back down You must see the 'orse guards! Gwenn is one of two fantastic examples of reverse casting the other being George Sanders as a good guy named ffolliett.Hitchcock is very careful in presenting the bad guys. He never says they're Germans though the implication is obvious. The chief baddie is ruthless but not without decent impulses in a way that mirrors but goes beyond Willy in his later Lifeboat. Hitchcock knew when the film was released he would be attacked by those who wanted to keep appeasing Germany. For Foreign Correspondent to be successful it needed to bring the audience along without noticing the ride laughing with and pulling for Jones right up until the moment he does a radio broadcast in London while bombs burst around him an eerie foreshadowing of what Edward R. Morrow would be doing for real only days after Foreign Correspondent opened in theaters.You can't help but admire a film that was on the right side of history but Foreign Correspondent may play better now than it ever did because of the way its pure cinema techniques work today a style Tarantino and Leone admirers will no doubt recognize and appreciate but that anyone can enjoy.".

With America still in the midst of trading with both sides of the European war Hitchcock made a spy thriller that quite clearly cast the Germans as the bad guys minus the word Nazi which only appears once at the beginning of the film while being shamelessly patriotic the last scene is both inspiring and laughable.But Hitchcock could afford to go out on a limb. He started making FC a week after the release of Rebecca a movie that garnered large amounts of critical acclaim and won Best Picture. But with all the praise heaped on Hitchcock's first American movie his second has often gone unnoticed although it is certainly up to par with  if not better than  Rebecca.Foreign Correspondent tells the story of Johnny Jones an American newspaper writer chosen to go to England to report on the war as Huntley Haverstock for the New York Globe. While in England he attempts to interview a Dutch statesman Van Mier but instead witnesses the man's assassination. The resulting pursuit throws JonesHaverstock into a Nazi spy ring that intends to use a secret clause to create German victory in the impending war. Along the way JonesHaverstock meets an English reporter who assists him and the daughter of a renowned pacifist.The acting is excellent all around with special kudos given to Robert Sanders as the English reporter Scott ffoliot and to Edmund Gwenn in a minor but important roll as Rowly the friendly hit man. Laraine Day and Joel McCray have that special chemistry that adds to the romance part of the movie while McCray and Sanders' straightfaced humor is enjoyable.Hitchcock's directing is magnificent like usual. As always there are certain scenes that are signature Hitchcock The assassination chase through the sea of umbrellas and later in the Dutch countryside. The tower murder scene. And the plane crash scene has inspired cinematic plane crashes for decades. All in all Foreign Correspondent shows Hitchcock at his best in the midst of a string of movies that saw him reach the top of the British filmmaking world and rapidly ascend to the same position in America. And it once again proves that Hitchcock was indeed the father of the spythriller genre.".

The suspense is unrelenting building to a spectacular climax. It had many of those dazzling Hitchcock sequences the assassination in Amsterdam the scene in the cathedral tower and especially the sequence in the windmill which is pure magic!Of course it also had that classic sense of humor and a slew of terrific character roles including Edmund Gwenn as the most cherubic and cheerful hit man you've ever seen! The final scene was strictly American propaganda but that can probably be forgiven considering the subject matter of the film and the time of it's release.All in all a wonderful example of the master at his best that deserves to be dusted off and enjoyed alongside some of it's more celebrated cousins!".

	schema:reviewBody "Admittedly partly due to the presence of Joel McCrea this is one of my favorite Hitchcock films. As with Saboteur Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper and in this case Joan Fontaine  he wanted Barbara Stanwyck for Saboteur but couldn't get them. Cooper turned down the role of Johnny Jones and lived to regret it.Today Foreign Correspondent can be seen as a fierce call to bring America into the war. It's amazing today how long America stayed out. In the film Johnny Jones writing under the pen name of Huntley Haverstock is given the assignment of going to Europe and digging around for information about the impending war  and particularly to have a conversation with Professor Van Meer who may be one of the men who can help keep the peace. Johnny witnesses Van Meer being killed right in front of him and chasing the perpetrators he winds up searching a windmill in one of the many remarkable scenes in the film. While on assignment he falls in love with Carol Fisher whose father is the head of a peacemaking movement.The film is striking for its underlying humor and lightness despite the seriousness and shock value of the events. It's also remarkable for some against type casting i.e. George Sanders is a newsman and a good guy for a change and Edmund Gwenn  Santa Claus!  is a killer. That's another remarkable scene.There are several spectacular moments. The rainy scene on the steps when Van Meer is killed is one when Jones looks for the perpetrator all he can see is a sea of samecolored umbrellas. The windmills are another  claustrophobic inside a peaceful picture outside. There is a marvelous shot of Johnny escaping from killers by slipping out of his hotel bathroom window and walking along the ledge. The litup sign HOTEL EUROPE can plainly be seen and Jones breaks one of the lights as he goes by. Best of all is the airplane crash into the ocean which is fantastic and looks both agonizing and real. The final scene of the film a radio broadcast was added some time later  five days before the Germans started bombing in fact.Shot in black and white Foreign Correspondent is loaded with atmosphere and the tension of the coming war. Joel McCrea a very likable easygoing actor in the same vein as Cooper though maybe a bit livelier is excellent in his role here as a gentle but adventurous man caught up in bizarre circumstances. Laraine Day never used much by her own studio MGM and often loaned out is great as the pretty intelligent and principled Carol. As Scott ffolliott Sanders is charming and plays beautifully with Day and McCrea. Herbert Marshall has a slightly different role for him and is very effective.Though many may not agree I consider this one of Hitchock's best films and totally underrated. Why did Gary Cooper turn it down? It was a thriller which in those days was considered a Bclass genre. After Foreign Correspondent this was no longer true.".

From Edmund Gwenn's great casting larking cutthroat to George Sanders' wry snobbery to Eddie Conrads's eyebrowrustling Latvian Hitchcock puts together a very lighthearted setting.  Into this brush of sparkling romance hack journalism and amateur politics comes a nest of Axis spies.  The McGuffin is a particular clause of a peace treaty and our cast is whirled around this center.  Many of the setpieces the assassination the windmill the crash landing are virtuosi in themselves but are not meant to distract from a weak script unlike many of today's films.  The main plot the secret kidnapping of a diplomat keeps its steam. Subplot 1 the romance between lovely Laraine Day and McCrea is charming and believable.  Subplot 2 the intrigue is masterfully handled by Hitch and it is his forte.  When first viewing this you will be glued to the screen attempting to figure things out before Hitchcock in typical fashion releases the pressure by revealing some secret thing.  The patriotism is perfectly suited to 1940 and we in America would do well to heed the warnings against isolationism even today.  I give it a 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a recent viewing of my VHS copy of Foreign Correspondent I hadn't realized how dated it was and also how silly the plot was. Not worthy of the master of suspense.Foreign Correspondent was the second film that Alfred Hitchcock made in America and it was a one shot deal for independent producer Walter Wanger. That other well known independent producer David O. Selznick got some big bucks for Hitch's services. Or maybe he saw how ridiculous the story line was for Foreign Correspondent. Hitchcock's all purpose McGuffin in this story is a person the Dutch Foreign Minister played by Albert Basserman.The devilishly clever Nazis hatch a scheme in which they kidnap Basserman substitute a double and assassinate the double. So after getting Basserman what do they do? They don't spirit him away to Germany they take him to England instead. Supposedly so that collaborator Herbert Marshall can get the text of a secret clause in a treaty the Dutch have signed with some other country not named. A little sodium pentathol in Germany would have done the trick.I think the idea was totally ridiculous and I can't believe Alfred Hitchcock didn't find it so.The purpose of this film was an attack on those in Great Britain dubbed the Cliveden set who hung out at Lady Nancy Astor's estate named Cliveden. These folks wanted peace at any price with Hitler and it's still a subject today for debate whether they were just fools or out and out traitors. Hitchcock opts for the latter. Still the film has its Hitchcockian touches his fans love so well. The chase scene through the windmill country the climax when the Atlantic clipper with Joel McCrea Laraine Day George Sanders and Herbert Marshall is shot down after war is formally declared. Even at that I can't believe that a submarine possessed sufficient fire power to down an airliner why didn't the airliner just raise altitude?Joel McCrea was Hitchcock's second choice after Gary Cooper turned him down. Hitchcock and McCrea got along well he wanted to use him for later films like Saboteur but they never worked together again.And that's a pity because Foreign Correspondent isn't Hitchcock at his best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes Alfred Hitchcock would get hold of a Big Idea and run with it and the results were usually disappointing  Rope Spellbound The Wrong Man. But there's nothing pretentious about Foreign Correspondent. There's a secret clause to one of those secret treaties and there's a murder or two the kidnapping and torture of an old man and an impending war but these are ground instead of figure  pegs on which to hang an adventure story blended with some comedy and romance.Joel McRae is an ordinary reporter sent to Europe to root out the real dope behind the winds of war. A Hollander Mr. Van Meer Albert Basserman is the tenderminded architect of a plan to keep the peace and Steven Fisher Herbert Marshall is his chief functionary. Other important characters include Herbert Marshall's naive and trusting daughter Laraine Day and a flippant but rightthinking British reporter George Sanders. McRae and Day fall for one another. Sanders plays a rather important role in the story. And mention must be made of Robert Benchley too as Stebbins McRae's careless and selfindulgent colleague in London. Edmund Gwenn is a thug hired by the bad guys that is the Germans to see to it that McRae ceases his meddling permanently. Eduardo Cianelli appears as a Nazi thug.It's not exactly a whodunnit because we discover halfway through the movie that Herbert Marshall is a spy working for the other side to discover the contents of the secret clause in the secret treaty. Instead it's a salubrious mixture of Hitchcock set pieces that promote suspense and generate laughs.The plot moves from New York to Amsterdam to London and is full of surprises. Here are some striking incidents. 1 A double for Van Meer is assassinated on the steps  shot in the face in fact like the citizen in Battleship Potyemkin  and the killer gets away by bustling through a crowd of umbrellas. The scene was shot on a California stage. And why did Hitchcock set it up as he did? Well he stated it's Holland and what does Holland have but rain tulips and windmills? 2 McRae Day and Sanders chase the murderer's car and it suddenly disappears next to a windmill. McRae pokes around in the windmill with unexpected results. If you've ever wondered what the inside of a windmill looks like this will give you some idea of what the inside of a windmill looks like inside the head of the art director Alexander Golitzen. 3 The TransOceanic clipper crashes into the sea near the end and you have never seen such panic and such wild and windblown seas.There isn't space to detail the plot but it isn't as I say all that important anyway serving mostly as a link between episodes and sometimes even a little confusing. But everything else is outstandingly entertaining. Robert Benchley contributed to the dialog. He was a humorist for the New Yorker for some time and was readily recognizable to the audience because he had his own series of short subjects that I must say weren't very funny. He made up for it by having the face of a resigned Humphrey C. Earwicker and a keen ear for absurdist dialog that was honed at Harvard. During an earnest conversation he's interrupted by the phone ringing. He picks it up shouts No and slams it back down. A few minutes later there is another ring and Benchley says No  tell him it's ridiculous! and hangs up immediately. No explanation is ever offered. It must have appealed to Hitchcock because it ran parallel to his own sense of whimsy. Benchley wrote all his own dialog and most likely contributed some other bon mots. When Laraine Day rises to give a presentation at a boring meeting a luncheon guest leans towards McRae and remarks that the female of the speeches is deadlier than the male but it's almost lost in the background clatter.The casting is notable in many ways. Herbert Marshall was familiar to the audience of the time  but as a humane avuncular sophisticated presence in films not a heavy. Edmund Gwenn a heartless killer is so short and harmless that he was to play Santa Claus in Miracle on 34th Street. Martin Kosleck a Jew who managed to escape from Europe is introduced as the Nazi goon he was to play for the rest of his movie career. George Sanders always reliable is at the top of his form here. Albert Basserman the elderly dogooder was nominated for an Academy Award.Not to be missed if you're looking for an exciting and delightfully engaging film.".

McRae pokes around in the windmill with unexpected results. If you've ever wondered what the inside of a windmill looks like this will give you some idea of what the inside of a windmill looks like inside the head of the art director Alexander Golitzen. 3 The TransOceanic clipper crashes into the sea near the end and you have never seen such panic and such wild and windblown seas.There isn't space to detail the plot but it isn't as I say all that important anyway serving mostly as a link between episodes and sometimes even a little confusing. But everything else is outstandingly entertaining. Robert Benchley contributed to the dialog. He was a humorist for the New Yorker for some time and was readily recognizable to the audience because he had his own series of short subjects that I must say weren't very funny. He made up for it by having the face of a resigned Humphrey C. Earwicker and a keen ear for absurdist dialog that was honed at Harvard. During an earnest conversation he's interrupted by the phone ringing. He picks it up shouts No and slams it back down. A few minutes later there is another ring and Benchley says No  tell him it's ridiculous! and hangs up immediately. No explanation is ever offered. It must have appealed to Hitchcock because it ran parallel to his own sense of whimsy. Benchley wrote all his own dialog and most likely contributed some other bon mots. When Laraine Day rises to give a presentation at a boring meeting a luncheon guest leans towards McRae and remarks that the female of the speeches is deadlier than the male but it's almost lost in the background clatter.The casting is notable in many ways. Herbert Marshall was familiar to the audience of the time  but as a humane avuncular sophisticated presence in films not a heavy. Edmund Gwenn a heartless killer is so short and harmless that he was to play Santa Claus in Miracle on 34th Street. Martin Kosleck a Jew who managed to escape from Europe is introduced as the Nazi goon he was to play for the rest of his movie career. George Sanders always reliable is at the top of his form here. Albert Basserman the elderly dogooder was nominated for an Academy Award.Not to be missed if you're looking for an exciting and delightfully engaging film.";

	schema:reviewBody "Excitement suspense and humour are just a few of the hallmarks of this highspeed espionage thriller that does such a great job of entertaining from start to finish. With numerous plot twists and dialogue that's sharp and witty the interest level never drops and no doubt this contributed to making Foreign Correspondent the great commercial and critical success that it eventually became. Over the years it's become one of Alfred Hitchcock's most underappreciated films probably for the simple reason that it's been overshadowed by his numerous great achievements in the years that followed. The fact remains however that especially for a movie released in 1940 it's technically impressive full of interesting characters and contains a number of very memorable set pieces.In 1939 Mr Powers Harry Davenport the aptlynamed editor of the New York Globe is utterly exasperated by the lack of hard news that he's getting from his European correspondents about the growing threat of war and so decides to send a crime reporter to find out exactly what's happening. The reporter he chooses for the job is Johnny Jones Joel McCrea a young brash and politically nave character who says give me an expense account and I'll cover anything. Powers renames his new foreign correspondent Huntley Haverstock and immediately instructs him to leave for London to attend a conference being held by the Universal Peace Party at which the eminent Dutch diplomat Van Meer Albert Bassermann is due to speak.On his way to the event Haverstock has the good fortune to meet Van Meer and shares a taxi with him but the old man is totally uninterested in talking about political matters and so doesn't provide Haverstock with any useful information. At the conference the young American meets Carol Fisher Laraine Day the daughter of Stephen Fisher Herbert Marshall who's the peace organisation's leader and is shocked when Van Meer doesn't turn up to speak to the audience apparently because he'd been called to attend another conference in Amsterdam. The determined reporter decides to go to Amsterdam to follow Van Meer's activities and is then drawn into a frantic sequence of events when he witnesses a shocking assassination gets involved is a car chase and in a windmill in the Dutch countryside discovers that Van Meer has been kidnapped and drugged by a suspiciouslooking group of men.After Van Meer and his captors suddenly disappear Haverstock returns to London with Carol who he'd met with her friend Scott ffolliott George Sanders during the car chase. Haverstock and Carol fall in love and plan to marry but when they return to Carol's home and Haverstock sees one of the men from the windmill with her father he strongly suspects that Stephen Fisher is a Nazi agent and with the help of ffolliott attempts to rescue Van Meer and expose Fisher as a traitor. The events that follow then put Haverstock in some lifethreatening situations before he's eventually in a position to try to get his story back to his newspaper in New York.The way in which the assassination is carried out in this movie is truly shocking and the suspense generated during Haverstock's time in the windmill where he's trying to avoid being seen by Van Meer's captors is tremendous. There's also a brilliantly filmed plane crash which is remarkably realistic as is another tense scene involving a highlevel escape from a hotel room.Joel McCrea does well as an ordinary guy who's totally out of his depth in his new job and George Sanders Laraine Day and Albert Bassermann are all excellent in their supporting roles.Foreign Correspondent which is overtly antiNazi and made a strong appeal for the United States to end its policy of neutrality made its point so effectively that it even drew great praise from Joseph Goebbels who was the German Minister of Propaganda at the time! Whilst the propaganda content of the film is clearly a reflection of the time in which it was made its terrific combination of adventure comedy and romance is so enjoyable that its enduring appeal is guaranteed.".

Although there are longer Hitchcocks this has the highest thrills to length ratio aside from North by Northwest. Although this movie is relatively unknown the windmill scene is a fairly well known bit. No small wonder as it has moments that are iconic of Hitchcock's suspense and shifting lighting patterns that add an ominous effect. A much used technique as repetitive motions or sounds in film punctuate the scene with a sense that something is watching or nature is playing a part. There are many other great scenes but I will spare those who haven't seen it of losing part of the incredible suspense.However with a thriller this excellent there must be more than thrills and direction to complete the film. For one matter there is acting. Although the leading roles require more than is always present you never feel like there is any bad acting. To bring acting of absolute perfection into play there is Albert Bassermann as Van Meer. As he changes topic in mid sentence rambling with a scratchy voice coughing and retching. Although he learned his lines phonetically he somehow knows exactly when to change tone or when to put a gleam of defiance into his eyes. As another matter there is cinematography and lighting that corresponds perfectly with the suspense. The shots will contrast each other but without being too obvious and the shot patterns of certain scenes are very similar to North by Northwest. Finally it has a compelling story backed by a fine screenplay with dramatic lines that still avoid being clunky. This is the rare treasure of a film that is enjoyable and also great.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're going to sit through a piece of WWII propaganda you might as well ensure that it's directed by Alfred Hitchcock. 'Foreign Correspondent 1940' was the director's second film in Hollywood David O. Selznick had hired him out to independent producer Walter Wanger and the resultant production was released shortly after the Best Picturewinning 'Rebecca 1940.' The film feels very close to several of Hitchcock's British spy pictures  particularly 'The 39 Steps 1935' and 'Secret Agent 1936'  and is a marked improvement on both of these a greater production budget allowing the Master of Suspense to wellandtruly spread his creative wings. The film was a minor success at the 1941 Academy Awards not winning any Oscars but receiving nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role Albert Bassermann Best Art Direction Best Cinematography Best Special Effects Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture. However it's safe to say that the film was definitively overshadowed on the night by the director's other entry and 'Foreign Correspondent' has remained a lowkey Hitchcock ever since.The year is 1939 and Europe is on the brink of a second World War. Johnny Jones Joel McCrea a hardedged American journalist is sent across the Atlantic under the sophisticated new title of Huntley Haverstock to unearth exclusive details of the impending cloud of doom and he falls into more trouble than he would have dared to imagine. The Germans are desperately and ruthlessly attempting to infiltrate British Intelligence and one much be wary of all those with which he makes acquaintance. Jones falls in with Stephen Fisher Herbert Marshall president of a peacecampaigning organisation and very quickly falls in love with his pretty daughter Carol Laraine Day. Meanwhile enemy spies have plans to kidnap important Dutch diplomat Mr. Van Meer Albert Bassermann who learned his lines phonetically and it will take every ounce of Jones' courage and dedication if he is to save the day for Britain  even though he's really only doing it for the exclusive story!'Foreign Correspondent' is most fondlyremembered for its various incredible setpieces was there ever anybody more adept at producing incredible setpieces than Alfred Hitchcock? and the dramaticromantic subplots that link them are almost immaterial. Your heart will pound during the assassination in the rainswept street your heart will stop as Jones creeps silently and perilously through the enemyoccupied windmill your heart will explode as the transAtlantic clipper dives terminally into frigid depths of the ocean cascades of seawater charging through the cockpit of the aircraft. The resultant sequence on the floating aircraft wreckage would no doubt influence Hitchcock when he directed 'Lifeboat 1944' one of many moments in which Paul Eagler's visual effects left me speechless. McCrea brings just the right amount of classic American cynicism to the character of Jones and his chemistry with Day is just good enough for me to overlook the fact that he proposed to her after about two meetings  as he himself said that cuts down our love scene quite a bit doesn't it?".

The Germans are desperately and ruthlessly attempting to infiltrate British Intelligence and one much be wary of all those with which he makes acquaintance. Jones falls in with Stephen Fisher Herbert Marshall president of a peacecampaigning organisation and very quickly falls in love with his pretty daughter Carol Laraine Day. Meanwhile enemy spies have plans to kidnap important Dutch diplomat Mr. Van Meer Albert Bassermann who learned his lines phonetically and it will take every ounce of Jones' courage and dedication if he is to save the day for Britain  even though he's really only doing it for the exclusive story!'Foreign Correspondent' is most fondlyremembered for its various incredible setpieces was there ever anybody more adept at producing incredible setpieces than Alfred Hitchcock? and the dramaticromantic subplots that link them are almost immaterial. Your heart will pound during the assassination in the rainswept street your heart will stop as Jones creeps silently and perilously through the enemyoccupied windmill your heart will explode as the transAtlantic clipper dives terminally into frigid depths of the ocean cascades of seawater charging through the cockpit of the aircraft. The resultant sequence on the floating aircraft wreckage would no doubt influence Hitchcock when he directed 'Lifeboat 1944' one of many moments in which Paul Eagler's visual effects left me speechless. McCrea brings just the right amount of classic American cynicism to the character of Jones and his chemistry with Day is just good enough for me to overlook the fact that he proposed to her after about two meetings  as he himself said that cuts down our love scene quite a bit doesn't it?";

	schema:headline " The Road To War  Hitchcock Style";
	schema:reviewBody "If one would look at the late British films that Hitchcock made such as THE THIRTY NINE STEPS THE LADY VANISHES and SABOTAGE one can see that Hitchcock was aware of foreign elements that were antiBritish and that his nation had to confront and fight. Foreign spies attack England from within in THE THIRTY NINE STEPS and SABOTAGE and Miss Froy Dame May Witty is spying on a country that is very much like Germany in THE LADY VANISHES. To these films one can add Hitch's second American film FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT. Although the Second World War was one year old when FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT came out it is set in the year 193839 and ends after September 1939.Joel McCrae is Huntly Haverstock actually Johnny Jones the new foreign correspondent sent by an American news service to Europe to cover the collapsing international situation. He meets Van Meer Albert Basserman who is the strong man of Holland and who is the key to maintaining European peace. Van Meer promises him an interview but when they next meet the statesman acts like he does not remember him. This does not appear to matter until a few minutes later an assassin shoots Van Meer with a gun concealed in a camera. The scene where the assassin escapes in a sea of umbrellas is justifiably famous among Hitch's fans but many people don't recall that the assassin shoots at McCrae who is chasing him killing at least one other person on a bicycle. Actually this whole sequence suggests Hitch's interest in real crime in 1934 the King of Yugoslavia and the Foreign Minister of France were killed by an assassin in Marseilles when headed for a conference. The assassination was filmed very graphically including the killing of the assassin after he shot several other people. Hitch probably saw it and filed away the incident for future reference.McCrae tries to get the authorities to hear his views about the actuality of the assassinated man being the real Van Meer. A few people believe him. One is Stephen Fisher Herbert Marshall a leading peace advocate and his daughter Laraine Day. Also is Mr. ffoliot George Sanders  this time a nice guy who has attached himself to Day as a friend. Gradually McCrae finds that if the authorities do not fully believe him others do  the foreign agents who were responsible for the assassination. Hitch did nicely in this his first spy film in American. He has the famous backward windmill sequence. He also concluded the film with a memorable plane crash. But most interesting was his use of SPOILER COMING UP Marshall as the head of the foreign agents.Hitch had come from England in the heyday of Lady Astor's suspect Cliveden Set which strongly urged neutrality or even alliance with Nazi Germany. Many of the members were socially prominent types. Marshall's Fisher is very plausible as a lover of peace and gradually is revealed as an enemy of the British. But the screenplay gives Marshall real dignity. He sees himself as a patriot for his native land presumably Germany. To her credit Day understands his behavior and does not desert him when he is revealed at the end. And then comes the air disaster and Marshall finds a way to make a dignified and brave exit from his disgrace.There is more to the film than I have suggested here. There are touches of humor by McCrae's bureau chief in Europe Robert Benchley. There is also the black comic business involving Edmund Gwenn on Westminster Abbey's roof trying to get rid of McCrae.All told it was a good followup to REBECCA and it showed that Hitchcock was not just a oneshot director.".

	schema:headline " Worst MacGuffin Ever";
	schema:reviewBody "Alfred Hitchcock popularized the term MacGuffin as being what the spies are after but the audience doesn't care. In this movie the MacGuffin is Clause 27 of a treaty between two countries. It is a secret clause so secret in fact that it is only known to the two people who signed the treaty because it was never written down.Now whether it is a treaty a contract or any other kind of agreement the whole point in writing it down and having people sign it is so that there is no question as to what was agreed to. Anything not written down can be denied later especially since there are no witnesses to this oral agreement between the two signatories. I guess we are to assume that the two diplomats trust each other so much that an oral agreement and a handshake will suffice.This raises the question as to how anyone other than the two signatories knows of the existence of Clause 27. The spies know about it as does Scott ffolliott so I guess the two signatories must have announced that they had signed a treaty with an unwritten clause. It seems to me it would have been better to keep not only the content of the clause a secret but its existence as well.One of the signatories is Van Meer. To find out what is in Clause 27 the spies kidnap Van Meer with the idea of torturing him until he talks. But to keep the world from knowing that Van Meer has been kidnapped they get a man who looks like Van Meer to take his place so he can be assassinated. Presumably the impostor did not know about that part of the plan.If the world thinks Van Meer has been assassinated then that means that as far as everyone else is concerned only one person knows what is in Clause 27. Van Meer might have trusted this other fellow but can we expect the country he represented to honor a secret clause whose content is known only to the diplomat of the other country and take his word for it? So with Van Meer's faked assassination it would seem that the clause has just become worthless. Or maybe the spies were planning on releasing Van Meer after he spilled his guts saying Fooled you. Van Meer is alive after all but you still have to honor the secret clause that we now know about.Moving right along if I had been Van Meer and the spies started torturing me to tell what was in Clause 27 I would have just made up something. After all it's a secret so how would the spies have known the difference?But enough of this. The point of the MacGuffin as noted above is to give the spies something to pursue that the audience is not expected to care about. But that's just the problem. Maybe we are not supposed to care about what the MacGuffin is but we sure are supposed to care about what makes the MacGuffin important. Over and over again we are continually being prodded with a preachy message about the need to take a strong stand against Germany. In short this is another of Hitchcock's propaganda films the first one being The Lady Vanishes 1938. This is why Stephen Fisher who is the leader of the Universal Peace Party a pacifist organization actually turns out to be a Nazi spy. You can't trust those peaceniks. The problem is not with the message per se but with the enervating effect of propaganda. Who wants to watch a movie and be lectured to? Of course there are enough good scenes in the movie especially the one in the windmill to make the movie enjoyable overall but it is somewhat spoiled by the warmongering.Fisher has a daughter named Carol who is the love interest of the title character Johnny Jones who is forced to take on the pseudonym of Huntley Haverstock. He agrees to get Carol to go to the country with him so that ffolliott can make Fisher think his daughter has been kidnapped and thus arrange a prisoner exchange for Van Meer. The pretense is that Haverstock needs to hide from the spies who are trying to kill him because he knows who they are. When Carol and Haverstock get to Cambridge they get a room at a hotel.Ooh la la. One room for the two of them! Even if it is just for the afternoon it sounds very cozy and Carol seems just fine with it. But then ffolliott calls Haverstock and tells him he needs more time to talk to Fisher and so Haverstock will need to keep Carol there overnight. Haverstock agrees and makes an arrangement with the hotel for another room for Carol. Carol overhears this and is appalled.Now I know that things back then were different regarding sex but I cannot figure this one out. The very fact that Haverstock is getting a separate room for her indicates that his intentions are honorable. But the woman who was just fine having one room for the afternoon is outraged that he would get a separate room for her for the night. I guess she thought that the second room was just for appearances and that he was planning on slipping into her room later that evening just the sort of thing a man might have on his mind while hiding from spies who want to assassinate him. Since they were hiding from the spies she should have figured that something had come up necessitating a longer stay. The reasonable thing for her to do was go up to him and say Why are you getting another room for me so we can stay overnight? But not much else in this movie makes sense so there is no reason for this scene to be any different.".

Well he certainly gets involved. Can he live to tell what he knows? The film is a little too long and the first half an hour is pretty boring. We then get some tense scenes starting with a shooting. At last some suspense. Unfortunately the realism of the film is sloppy at this point. For example the victim's killer would have been caught about 20 times over. Also the killer's getaway car would not just have disappeared like that on a large empty road given that the pursuers had the car in sight. Another instance of stupidity occurs at this point in that the bad guys don't seem to be looking out for the car that has been chasing them. These villains are cretinously stupid not to have someone pick up that McCrea is snooping around the windmill. He stands out like a sore thumb.Another memorable section sees hitman Edmund Gwenn Rowley bide his time and attempt his murderous instructions on McCrea. He has a couple of goes. And while these are suspenseful Gwenn plays for comedy so it's never quite effective. And that's a problem with this film there is far too much lightheartedness eg the Latvian bloke which takes away any real danger.George Sanders ffolliott turns up after the first boring half an hour that wasn't necessary and immediately becomes the best of the cast. In fact the lead man McCrea completely disappears from the proceedings after about two thirds of the film and we follow Sanders as he unravels and solves the whole mystery. By himself. McCrea wasn't needed  Sanders even already knew about wealthy aristocratic Herbert Marshall Fisher.The film does have two other memorable sequences. The first is the sea of umbrellas as the assassin makes his getaway  very creative. The other is what elevates this film to the score I have given it  namely the whole plane crash episode. I found this particularly eerie given the current explanation of what happened to that Air Malaysia plane recently. The one that just disappeared. There is real footage of the view that the pilots would have had as the plane dives towards the sea. We then get the water pouring in and a frightening aftermath. Maybe the passengers were already dead come the impact in the real life situation. Still it made me think and go all sombre about it.Unfortunately this film lacks something. Oh yeah Hitchcock is easy to spot in this one so keep an eye out near the beginning.".

I returned to F.C. out of the fondness I felt for it the first time I watched but after viewing it again that good will is played out. This is halfhearted boilerplate Hitchcock. It's really disappointing to watch him go through the motions with his motifs and these circumlocutious plots while simultaneously refusing to forego entertainment in favor of ideas or at least find a happy medium. I resent him squandering his technique on material that's not even worth his interest. One of the joys of watching Kane is that Welles rarely lets his ideas become subservient to sentiment of the period. The opposite is true here. The script quickly exhausts coincidence and a recurring singledegreeofseparation idea that Dickens favored Johnny just happens to pass his contact on the street so the story can have him share a cab ride. The random car Johnny jumps into in Amsterdam just happens to contain his love interest. A random room Johnny breaks into just happens to be that of his love interest. The villain just happens to be the gal's dad. Hitchcock has a higher tolerance for these silly narrative copouts than I do. Foreign Correspondent makes me extremely appreciative of Citizen Kane and filmmakers who take the artform seriously.Joel Macrae plays an excruciating meathead that we're all supposed to get behind because he's snarky and lighthearted. And the plot likewise works overtime to provide him with occasions to be so. It's all very cloying. I wanted to strangle him. He's an absolute dunce. While many viewers resent the tacked on ending in which Johnny finally gets serious and commits to a cause I find it to be the only legitimate minute or two in the movie. The rest treats WW2 as a meaningless event to be manipulated to suit the emotional needs of the protagonists. The CrawfordMacMurray vehicle 'Above Suspicion' is similarly facile in its treatment of the war.Foreign Correspondent is a feeble reason to string together setpieces that never engage your mind. In place of any real ideas we have an old codger van Meer delivering purehearted sentimental drivel to excuse the dumbest members of the audience for not being mentally alive.Hitch will take this asinine picaresque mode featuring an endless string of meaningless developments to its absurd foregone conclusion in North by Northwest. These narative objectives are corny and low.".

In this case the suspense occurs in the windmill as we are mezmorized by the gears spinning sinisterly and the spies milling about.

The story is about Cage and Pearlman teaming up to take a witch to a castle where she will be put on trial. Chaos and terror ensue as they treck the mountainside and forest. The film depicts the times very well...and most the accents aren't that bad. But the thing i wasn't expecting was to see Cage actually put some effort into his role. Instead of woodenly walking through the film with terrible hair Cage shows some true emotion and his hair ain't half bad. Cage is hit or miss sometimes he's good Bad Lieutenant sometimes he's bad The Knowing. I think Cage gets an A for effort. It's no his best acting but it's an improvement. Pearlman is great as the sidekickfriend and gets most of the good lines. The special effects are kinda lame and the film drags in certain spots but overall Season of the witch is a decent thriller with some cheesy dialouge. This movie isn't bad as everyone makes it out to be. If you have low expectations like I did you'll probably get a lot more enjoyment out of it.Oh and the priest named De Balzak...pretty hysterical name.".

This is one of those sword and sandal fantasy films that tread the middle ground having an interesting premise set up in a fantasy fellowship quest only for the execution to be hovering around mediocre standards following a rote formula of introducing the problem gathering the players and have them encounter sequence after sequence of battle obstacles on the way to their objective.Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman play buddies Behman and Felson respectively knights of the Crusade who make a reputation of being fearsome warriors fighting for a higher cause only to desert their army and turning their backs from continuing onto Jerusalem after realizing that they are nothing but fighting pawns for the whims of man. Their services get called for by a town inflicted by a plague because of a curse by a girl Claire Foy whom they deem a witch and the agreement forged was for them to escort her to a monastery for a group of monks to decide on the authenticity of the claim and if so decide and inflict punishment.Gathering Priest Debelzag Stephen Campbell Moore guide Hegamar Stephen Graham one of the remaining fighting fit soldiers of the town with Eckhart Ulrich Thomsen and a priest in training Kay Robert Sheehan whom the party picked up early in their journey the group has to band together if they are to get to their destination in one piece with the accused girl being locked up in a cage but always seem to be drawing undue attention to herself raising questions about her innocence as we get to see her demonstrate abilities and superhuman strength even while putting on a saccharine sweet face. Now while all these may point to certain plot loopholes and irrational human behaviour I'm willing to overlook these flaws since they do get addressed in the final reveal so all's not totally lost in Bragi F. Schut's story.Battle sequence design was a little sleepy and although the introductory big battle scenes involving soldiers of the Crusade were plentiful it didn't go beyond the usual slashparry stabwashrinserepeat cycle coupled with cheesy dialogue exchange between Behman and Felson that try to pass off as comedy. There's an awfully long and painfully executed crossing of a creaky bridge that doesn't seem to want to end but otherwise passable CG was employed in an attack of wolves and the money shot in the final battle where all hell breaks loose in the monastery with grotesque looking winged beasts and the expected big boss to fight in an all out melee done arcade style.Some will probably find the themes here quite objectionable especially since it sets its sights squarely on how religion gets manipulated by the few and made suggestive queries what if the Crusade wasn't a calling made by god as claimed by the messengers but of more negative forces since it involves the killing of innocents. What more this was played out in quite direct fashion when the final act made that crossreference in point blank fashion. It's bold in its statement and association which otherwise the story here lacks any selling points to make an audience sit up and take noticeI'm not sure what Ron Perlman is doing here  the billing on the poster doesn't seem to give him much respect preferring to marquee Cage alone instead so while there are inside nods to Hell and the devil and demons here I'm hoping that we'll get to see another installment of Hellboy instead. Under Dominic Sena's vision you'd know what to expect when you scan through his resume being responsible for flicks like Whiteout Swordfish and yet another Nicolas Cage starrer in Gone in Sixty Seconds. They're no more than Guilt Trips with potential not lived up to so don't expect a classic or a masterpiece but at best entertainment that will struggle to satisfy jaded audiences.".

I heard from a unenthusiastic review one of numerous scathing reviews out there as anyone with the internet can tell about the on screen shenanigans with Nick Cage and Ron Perlman were so enjoyable that it made the rest of the movie bearable. Going in with that anticipation I found myself not only pulled into their characters' fun and convincing friendship but also into an intense and yes even edgeofyourseat suspenseful movie. I forgot about my troubles for the day and enjoyed a good adventure.It was inspired yes by DnD video games and a number of other swords and sorcery books and movies that preceded it but it is its own story. In a market saturated with sequels prequels reboots comicbook diarrhea etc... it's nice to see a story that is it's own however simple.Yes it plays by the numbers. You know guys will die. Hell you probably know who and in what order if you've seen movies of it's ilk. You know there is a supernatural bad guy. And you know there will be one liners oh are there ever oneliners! But the characters are fun to watch even a little engaging. You may not want to see them die. I didn't. They weren't a group of scum with a bullseye for heraldry. The enemy was threatening and tricky a real danger to our protagonists. And the one liners were gasp funny! Yes even Nicholas Cage is worth the price of admission here. If this was just another paycheck role for him he looked like he was having a lot of fun with this roll. And I don't know about you but I like to see my actors have fun in a movie that costs me 912 bucks to see..It looses some points with me for the CGI. obvious CGI is obvious. But honestly the crispy gray CGI contrasting against a darker colorful moody lighting STILL didn't detract from the encounters or the climax. If you come to the movies to have CGI convince you that magic and demons are real you come to the movies for jaded and asinine reasons. If you wanna see pretty visuals with a meandering pointless story go see Tron. But if you wanna see a fun yet dark heroic adventure go see Season of the Witch!".

In a market saturated with sequels prequels reboots comicbook diarrhea etc... it's nice to see a story that is it's own however simple.Yes it plays by the numbers. You know guys will die. Hell you probably know who and in what order if you've seen movies of it's ilk. You know there is a supernatural bad guy. And you know there will be one liners oh are there ever oneliners! But the characters are fun to watch even a little engaging. You may not want to see them die. I didn't. They weren't a group of scum with a bullseye for heraldry. The enemy was threatening and tricky a real danger to our protagonists. And the one liners were gasp funny! Yes even Nicholas Cage is worth the price of admission here. If this was just another paycheck role for him he looked like he was having a lot of fun with this roll. And I don't know about you but I like to see my actors have fun in a movie that costs me 912 bucks to see..It looses some points with me for the CGI. obvious CGI is obvious. But honestly the crispy gray CGI contrasting against a darker colorful moody lighting STILL didn't detract from the encounters or the climax. If you come to the movies to have CGI convince you that magic and demons are real you come to the movies for jaded and asinine reasons. If you wanna see pretty visuals with a meandering pointless story go see Tron. But if you wanna see a fun yet dark heroic adventure go see Season of the Witch!";

The plot was good the scenery was great. All in all it was a good way to spend a few hours. To all the Cage fans  I generally enjoy him I just don't feel that he and this part were meant to be.

	schema:reviewBody "Season of the Witch has a long and troubled history production took place in November 2008 and it was originally supposed to hit cinema screens both in the UK and America in March 2010 but it was pulled from release sat in limbo for several months and seemed likely to bypass cinemas altogether and be quietly dumped straight onto DVD. Instead additional footage was shot in September 2010 amidst rumours of extensive reediting and eventually a new release date of 7th January 2011 was announced. Initially intended as a dark medieval horror film rated R in America it had been reconceived  and was marketed as  a PG13rated period fantasyactionadventure.The movie's narrative is uncomplicated and relatively straightforward in the 14th century veteran Crusaders Behmen and Felson Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman grow weary of being ordered by the Church to slaughter women and children whose only crime is not being born Christian. Deserting they set off on the long journey home and eventually reach eastern Europe to find it stricken with plague. The Catholic authorities have found a scapegoat for the spread of the disease a young woman Claire Foy whose 'confession' of being a witch they obtained via torture. Arrested for desertion Behman and Felson are offered a full pardon if they will transport the girl to a remote monastery where the resident monks will perform a ritual to strip her of her powers enabling her to be killed and thus ending the plague. While nothing about the movie is particularly remarkable or groundbreaking the cast all acquit themselves as talented professionals and for most of it's running time Season of the Witch is an entertaining and watchable effort. There are a number of wellhandled setpieces on the knights' journey that whittle down their travelling companions such as an attack by ravenous wolves that transform into hellhounds and a perilous passage over a collapsing bridge. And although the film doesn't dwell on the widereaching effects of the plague the Crusaders encounter some grisly and impressive sights hundred of crows carrion eaters remember circling over a city a dying Cardinal a cameoing Christopher Lee hideously deformed by the disease a starving dog  it's body ridden with weeping sores  feasting on a corpse an apparently lifeless village in which two inhabitants suddenly emerge to silently dump a body in the street before retreating back inside and an open mass grave full of liquefying cadavers. The movie also touches upon all the blood that has been shed in God's name and the blinkered arrogance of those who claim to be His representatives. Some of the characters also express doubts is the girl truly a witch? Is her early escape attempt merely the action of a terrified young woman who  understandably  wants to avoid being executed? And even if she does possess supernatural powers is she responsible for the plague? But eventually the travelling party arrive at the monastery... and the film goes horribly wrong. All the moral uncertainties are abandoned and the movie becomes a disappointingly conventional struggle between clearly defined Good and Evil. The allaction climatic setpiece is marred by hectic and muddled editing. But worse of all is what happens to the title character. In the trailer that played in cinemas prior to the film's aborted release in early 2010 there were three shots taken from the movie's climax as it was clearly originally conceived before the film was substantially reworked Claire Foy walking straight towards the camera in close up as the caged wagon burns and melts into molten scrap behind her her then levitating  spinning  through the air over the heads of her captors and finally Foy grabbing Nicolas Cage by the throat and slamming him against a wall. All those scenes are still in the film  but Foy is no longer in them. Instead she's been digitally removed from the footage and replaced by a CGI monster. Yes that's right  at the movie's conclusion the witch transforms into an unimpressive sevenfoottall CGI winged demon that looks as though it's wandered in from the final reel of The Golden Child 1986. Ugh. In my opinion it's unnecessary misguided and a complete mistake. For example I thought the 'levitation' shot in the original trailer looked stunning... but in the released film Foy merely morphs into a dodgy special effect then blandly flies away. It's hugely disappointing. Hopefully the original ending with the heroes battling a demonicallypossessed Foy as opposed to an enemy comprised entirely of pixels will be included as an extra on the DVD. Even more ideally I'd like to see a two disc set with the original director's cut on one disc and the theatricallyreleased version on the other but it'll never happen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Season of the Witch is a genuinely suspenseful and thrilling start to  the 2011 movie year. With a cast comprised of screen veterans and  relative newcomers this period piece about witchcraft and true  nobility will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.  After a gripping prologue which establishes that witches do in fact  exist and can be quite deadly the movie dives straight into the heart  of the Crusades in the mid14th Century the stage for some of the  bloodiest and most brutal battles in history and also some of the  greatest abuses of authority by the Christian church. Two knights  Behmen and Felson played by Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman enter the  wars eager to fight at each other's side. However as the horrors of  war set in the two become convinced that it would be better to desert  and risk execution than continue the savage pursuit. It's a bit of a  clich but director Dominic Sena handles it very well.  The pair are eventually captured and brought to justice. However the  town in which they are arrested lies in the middle of a plaguestricken  region. Even the local Cardinal played by Christopher Lee has fallen  ill. He promises the knights they will be pardoned if they agree to  help lift the curse he believes is the cause of the plague a young  woman accused of witchcraft must be taken to a monastery where certain  rites must be performed that would end the curse. The girl of course  would be executed.  The errant knights have no desire to aid the church that has been the  cause of so much suffering but Behmen believes the girl's chances of a  fair trial are much higher if they travel with her. It is not long  before the small band of travelers encounters trouble though and even  Behmen cannot ignore the likelihood that the girl is behind it all. As  the young priest who accompanies them warns him the girl will try to  sow doubt and dissension in the minds of whomever comes close enough to  hear her speak. Soon it becomes clear that even traveling with her  places each of their lives in danger.  Season hovers on the edge of clicheness fairly often. There are a few  moments that could have gone either way including the buddy dynamic  between Behmen and Felson and the inclusion of Kay the young altar boy  who accompanies them hoping to become a knight like his father was.  These moments however lend a muchneeded lightheartedness to a movie  that keeps your heart pounding almost nonstop and the caliber of the  acting and directing keep it from going over the edge.  The balance of seasoned and upandcoming actors also works well in  Season. Claire Foy in particular is a delight to watch as she runs  the gamut of roles from simple peasant and hapless victim to shrewd  manipulator and evil menace. Cage and Perlman seem a touch out of place  at times in medieval Europe but as friends willing to fight together  even in the face of Hell they fit perfectly. It's not the standard  winter movie fare perhaps but it's definitely spellbinding.  ".

	schema:reviewBody "Thankfully I waited until this came out on DVD borrowed it from a friend and then watched it. This is one of the most atrocious movies that I've had the opportunity to view in the last decade. Where can I possibly begin?Let's start with the basic premise. A girl is accused of being a witch and spreading the Black Plague across Europe. She's held in a dungeon in some random European locale and needs to be transported four hundred leagues which is about a six days journey to a monastery in an even more remote random European locale by a batch of relapsed Catholics held together by a suspiciouslooking priest. Of course she's in a prison wagon and of course all sorts of bad things happen. And I might add not just any old bad things. Clichd bad things. Wolves attacking at night in a forest. Your quintessential rope bridge spanning a thousand foot gorge in the mountains. Ooh and guess what? The planks are old and rotted and the ropes are unraveling and about to give way. Stop me if you've heard this one.Someone decided that it would be a sneaky move to cast doubt and suspicion on the priest. After all priests are great bad guys right? So you have this innocentlooking waif their word not mine who keeps screaming that she doesn't want to be alone with the priest Really? How subliminally antiCatholic is this?. The priest does his part by keeping his cowl up and looking suitably creepy and everyone else looks at him with a marked lack of trust. Now about halfway through this loyalties shift and the people who wanted to provide this girl with a fair trial are now suddenly hellbent on killing her and the priest is the good guy again. Whew! Crisis averted. Speaking of antiCatholic Nicholas Cage's character who is so memorable that I've already forgotten his name less than twenty minutes after watching the movie is a Crusader. He decides that he's had enough of crusading after he and his trusty sidekick played by Ron Perlman who should have stuck with Hellboy arrive at an epiphany about the evils of killing in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost. They make absolutely no bones about this fact to anyone and their heartstirring rebellion culminates in Cage's guy saying very dramatically I serve God. I no longer serve the church! gasp! It's farcical.Speaking of farcical...have you heard the one about the bunch of actors who are portraying Europeans but all speak with Midwestern accents? There's not a bad British accent anywhere in here. You know I've never yearned for a bad British accent until this movie.Long story short the girl's not a witch she's a demon. The demon's revealed to be a horrible CGI people get burned everyone dies the young kid and the girl ride off into the sunset Black Plague avoided.Best part of the movie? Watching Ron Perlman trying to keep a straight face while he delivers his lines. Or is it Nicholas Cage trying to rediscover his inner Sorcerer's Apprentice? I'll never get these two hours back.".

The priest does his part by keeping his cowl up and looking suitably creepy and everyone else looks at him with a marked lack of trust. Now about halfway through this loyalties shift and the people who wanted to provide this girl with a fair trial are now suddenly hellbent on killing her and the priest is the good guy again. Whew! Crisis averted. Speaking of antiCatholic Nicholas Cage's character who is so memorable that I've already forgotten his name less than twenty minutes after watching the movie is a Crusader. He decides that he's had enough of crusading after he and his trusty sidekick played by Ron Perlman who should have stuck with Hellboy arrive at an epiphany about the evils of killing in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost. They make absolutely no bones about this fact to anyone and their heartstirring rebellion culminates in Cage's guy saying very dramatically I serve God. I no longer serve the church! gasp! It's farcical.Speaking of farcical...have you heard the one about the bunch of actors who are portraying Europeans but all speak with Midwestern accents? There's not a bad British accent anywhere in here. You know I've never yearned for a bad British accent until this movie.Long story short the girl's not a witch she's a demon. The demon's revealed to be a horrible CGI people get burned everyone dies the young kid and the girl ride off into the sunset Black Plague avoided.Best part of the movie? Watching Ron Perlman trying to keep a straight face while he delivers his lines. Or is it Nicholas Cage trying to rediscover his inner Sorcerer's Apprentice? I'll never get these two hours back.";

Are these villagers going to be punished somehow for their injustice? No people witches actually exist. Why this first scene? To prepare the watcher for more cruelty without any sense. We cut to two crusaders under the lead of a murderer whose only objective is to kill infidels. Well you say don't worry the moral of the story is coming.They take a girl to trial. For half an hour you expect the film to show how credulity should be despised because for the love of Pete who's going to believe that you should burn a person for witchcraft? In a fantasy film where characters have a purpose and our hero an objective well... OK but what's this? Don't trust on coherence. The sweet girl they see and that is going to be judged for causing a pest well yeah it is actually a monster and it is really causing the disease. So of course you can stab maim and kill without a hint of conscience.There are too many flaws in the mind of the writer. Styria part of Austria becomes the cost of... Syria? I don't know. Jackrabbits exist in the middle ages. The conquest of Jerusalem is a fanatic race to kill the inhabitants. There is a fictitious battle of Edremit a siege of Tripoli moved from 1102 to 1334 the battle of Imbros which happened in 1717 is moved to 1337 the battle of Artah is also moved from 1101 to 1339 the Battle of Smyrna beats me... it can be the name of the 1922 Battle of independence of Ataturk... that happened in 1922. The last crusaders were expelled in 1291 in the name of Herodotus soul! These guys are fighting 50 years later. That's how good is the script made probably with a map in the hand and a LOT of imagination.Acting is good.Do not waste your time in this movie unless you like stories without coherence nonsense killings more than regular computer animated characters that say nothing and films where everybody is killed. It's a miracle that the director and cameramen weren't killed in this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Plopping out in early January time honoured dumping ground of inferior product and draped in mediocre to poor reviews Season of the Witch had quite a lot stacked against it. But for all this it ended up being one of the better films I've taken in on a whim albeit far from any kind of classic or even especially good. Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman play disillusioned crusaders against witchcraft who get caught trying to escape their service and are recruited for a particularly tricky witch escorting mission. So we get an arduous mission through harsh medieval lands trekking interspersed with action and capped with a nice blazing finale and it should be a blast should be a lot more entertaining than it is but owing to lack of budget or balls or some combination of both it ends up being rather forgettable. The first noticeable problem is studied downplaying from Cage and Perlman they have some measure of chemistry and a small smattering of good lines but there's no fire. Both have potential for greatness and both have a facility for the fantastical but for some reason neither of them chew too much scenery or puff with much in the way of rage so the film constantly feels like its missing its opportunities as well. The ethereal Claire Foy suffers similarly as the witch she has a sweetly otherworldly way to her and lights up the screen so its a shame she doesn't have more to do. As for Christopher Lee well he's barely in it and just about anybody else would have been a worthy substitute. These problems aside Season of the Witch manages to be quite good fun for enough of the time that I overall enjoyed the experience. Its well enough shot to conjure an effectively macabre and misty mood at times while Dominic Sena handles his directing duties with fair adeptitude making for some exciting and sporadically stylish action. The pacing is a bit off but never truly dull and one or two low key spooks the highlight being a rather neat opening keep things interesting in between the few action set pieces while the ending is very daft and rather good fun. If only it gelled together better if only it realised whether it wanted to be a rousing medieval fantasy or a creepy horror and got a better handle on its tone heck if only it wasn't aimed at a younger audience with its PG13 certificate so it could get away with a few actual shocks. Bah it could have been a lot worse 510 from me.".

I didn't think I could get three out of three for great films. I was wrong though not in the same league as the last two Season of the Witch continues the chain of a great year of films for 2011.Season of the Witch obviously wasn't highly publicised as much as other Hollywood films and most critics I have read in newspapers and quite a few people on here have lambasted this movie for being terrible which is fair enough as everyone is entitled to their own opinion and even I thought I wouldn't give this higher than a five or six out of ten on here but I really enjoyed this.Basically set during the ages of the Crusades in the 14th century we are introduced to two of the main characters Behmen Nicolas Cage and Felson Ron Perlman who are knights and part of the Crusade fighting in wars for God and the Church but during one battle Behmen kills an innocent woman and realising what he's done he and Felson abandon the Crusades and become deserters. Eventually they come across a small town where they find the plague spreading and a cardinal Christopher Lee when the two men are captured asks them to transport a young woman Claire Foy who he believes is a witch to the monks in a remote abbey to ascertain if she is actually a witch and kill her to end the plague. Eventually Behmen and Felson agree as long she is given a fair trial. On the journey four other people join them a priest Debelzaq Stephen Campbell Moore a swindler who has journeyed to the abbey before and acts as their guide Hagamar Stephen Graham a young altar boy who dreams of being knighted Kay Robert Sheehan and another knight Eckhart Ulrich Thomsen The cast give good performances all round. Nicolas Cage gives a great one and perfectly fits into the role gracefully. He's done some very different and daring roles recently to flex himself like The Socerers Apprentice and playing Big Daddy in KickAss and like Season of the Witch it's paid off and I commend him for that. The other performance which I thought was the best one was Claire Foy as the girl accused of being the witch she was excellent and perfectly transitions herself into being a frightened innocent girl one moment to being very manipulative and menacing the next Ron Perlman Stephen Campbell and Robert Sheehan give decent supporting performances. Also there was a convincing buddy friendship between Cage and Pearlman with some witty one liners though a bit clich were used to useful comic effect the script isn't the best but it's certainly not too bad and is average enough. Other great things about this movie is the action which was choreographed well and entertaining with suspense and tension particularly the moment where the characters have to cross a deteriorated wooden bridge the cinematography was lovely with some gorgeous scenery and the special effects were superb. Yes there is little character development and the plot is quite simplistic but even so there is a good twist near the end which I wasn't expecting. However this is a great film overall and one which should have received much more recognition from critics and a higher rating on here overall. No it might not be anything Oscar winning but it fulfils it's function to entertain for the whole ninety five minutes. I felt I had got my money's worth and I never got bored throughout. Very enjoyable fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nicholas Cage needs to pick his roles more carefully. Some actors can carry period films but unfortunately Cage isn't one of them.Here we are supposed to buy Cage as Behman a disillusioned 14th century knight who has deserted the Crusades and the Church and returned to Europe with his comradeinarms Felson. It sounds alright on paper but Cage looks uncomfortable in his chain mail leather costume and horrendous hairpiece.The land is ravaged by a mysterious plague and the religious masses believe it is the work of witchcraft. As deserters Behman and Felson are arrested but soon get roped into a mission to transport a 'witch' who looks just like an abused frightened girl to a faraway monastery in order to stop the plague.Accompanying the two former Crusaders on the mission are a righteous priest a noble knight a guide for their journey and an altar boy who wants to become a knight. Soon however Behman realizes that there might be more to the girl than meets the eye and that she might actually have some evil powers lurking inside her after all.The film sets itself up as a supernatural adventure film but despite a couple of really good sword fight scenes something is missing. The characters don't have much time to develop and the paperthin plot with its many clichs just makes everything feel rushed.Making things worse is the fact that Cage and Perlman are forced to utter some of the most forcedShakesperean dialogue ever put to film. It sounded like a secondary school production of Hamlet.And despite the European setting for some reason the director has deemed that all the accents should be American which means the British and European cast members have to put on fake American accents. One of them even sounds like a New York cabdriver! The only thing saving this movie for me are the thrilling fight scenes and this one suspenseful scene where the group are trying to cross a shaky rotting wooden bridge. The supporting cast do a much better job than the two leads especially Clare Foy who plays the witch.Strictly for Cage fans or people who don't have very high expectations from a Nic Cage film.".

Soon however Behman realizes that there might be more to the girl than meets the eye and that she might actually have some evil powers lurking inside her after all.The film sets itself up as a supernatural adventure film but despite a couple of really good sword fight scenes something is missing. The characters don't have much time to develop and the paperthin plot with its many clichs just makes everything feel rushed.Making things worse is the fact that Cage and Perlman are forced to utter some of the most forcedShakesperean dialogue ever put to film. It sounded like a secondary school production of Hamlet.And despite the European setting for some reason the director has deemed that all the accents should be American which means the British and European cast members have to put on fake American accents. One of them even sounds like a New York cabdriver! The only thing saving this movie for me are the thrilling fight scenes and this one suspenseful scene where the group are trying to cross a shaky rotting wooden bridge. The supporting cast do a much better job than the two leads especially Clare Foy who plays the witch.Strictly for Cage fans or people who don't have very high expectations from a Nic Cage film.";

The relationship between Behmen and Felson and their characterisation is similar to Antonius and Jns but obviously without the intelligence or the depth of themes. Both sets of men are on a similar mission battling an supernatural force and going through Europe during the height of the Black Death. But the issues of lose of faith felt very false in Season of the Witch.Dominic Sena is a gunforhire director. He gets the job done and made a fast pace movie but with much of visual flair. The action scenes were standard decent enough but we have seen this all before. The fights were clean and quick it was not like Ridley Scott's brutal realistic style Zack Snyder violence comicbook style or Peter Jackson's epic sense of filmmaking.

The humour was also weak and this is a film that is hard to take seriously.The acting in Season of the Witch was appalling. Cage just gave a lazy phonedin performance and many of the actors of seemed like they did not care whoever thought he could play a Medieval knight should reevaluate their career in the film industry. The actors' voices and looks were wooden and shows that none of them did not really care. It is made even more shameful because some of the talent who was involved. I would have though Perlman should have learnt from his from his experience with In the Name of the King and I would not be surprised if Cage earns an Razzie nomination. But there is some hope Foy was able to show some range playing someone who can be seem innocent to someone with menace. Foy was a decent bit of casting because of her young girly look but that is the only bright spark on the acting front.The script by Bragi F. Schut is a poor piece of work. The dialogue is laughable in a bad way the story is thin and characterisation is nonexistence. We do not get to know anything about the characters and we simply see a bunch of clichs.

Set during the time of the first outbreak of bubonic plague  a warrior is tasked with learning the truth about his fate as he is charged in leading a fearsome witch  as Beheman and his group of mercenaries have to go a remote location. It's an exciting story plenty of battles  action and excitement . The scenery is beautiful and so was the cinematography . The music was great. The acting and directing was acceptable . A beleaguered church ruled by Cardinal D'Ambrosio Christopher Lee deeming sorcery the culprit of the plague commands the two knights named Beheman Nicolas Cage and Felson Ron Perlman to transport an accused witch Claire Fay to a remote abbey where monks will perform a ritual in hopes of ending the pestilence. A priest a grieving knight Ulrich Thomsen a disgraced itinerant and a headstrong youth Robert Sheehan who can only dream of becoming a knight join a mission troubled by mythically hostile wilderness and fierce contention over the fate of the girl. The group must fight mysterious creatures for consuming every living thing in their path . Eventually surrounded by the frightening and ferocious foes they must conquer his personal fears and help battle the illusive invaders who emerge out of the shroud of fog in the black of the night. When the embattled party arrives at the abbey a horrific discovery jeopardises the knight's pledge to ensure the girl fair treatment and pits them against an inexplicably powerful and destructive force .This sword and witchery epic movie begins with a real sense of wonder and surprise with impressive battles set in Crusades and wind up with continuous struggles against weird beings . The picture packs great loads of action  special effects abundant  horror breathtaking combats and a little bit of gore and blood . Stunning battles scenes illuminate the fullblown adventure with a plethora of engaging action set pieces on the combats in which the heads and limbs are slice off here and there and everywhere while other parts of body are slit open . The film gets an impressive control of the crowd scenarios with a climatic and overwhelming finale battle . Exceptional and colorfully cinematography is shot on location in outdoors from Hungary  Salzsburgo  Innsbruck  Tyrol Austria  Croatia and Shreveport  Louisiana . The camera work by Amir Mokri in this film is dangerous and thrilling . Our perspective is intimate and that lends a great deal of excitement to the movie experience . Beautiful scenery tense and bloody battles and a claustrophobic climax in a castle lift this story . Musical score by Orvasson is evocative and spectacular . There's something for everyone here  fans of horror fans of action fans of medieval adventure should all find something to enjoy about this film . It may not be the best film ever made but its still one passable movie. The motion picture is professionally directed by Dominic Sena who has got a career full of hits as 60 seconds  Operation Swordfish  California but also some failure as Whiteout . Rating  Acceptable and entertaining film that will appeal to Nicolas Cage fans .".

However is she really a witch or was she just randomly blamed for causing the pestilence in their country?I do not know how Nicolas Cage chooses his projects but he sure gets the cheesy ones like Wicker Man Sorcerer's Apprentice and in the same general vein this one. Different times in history but the same lame storytelling. The acting of everyone involved was so over the top and yet they were taking it all so seriously. The supposedly exciting scenes like crossing the rickety old bridge the attack of the wolves and even the Grand Guignolstyle faceoff with the demons at the end were plagued with unsatisfactory special effects. You know they were meant to be special because they sure took a lot of screen time. However I found them unexciting and predictable.OK this may be entertaining for a lazy afternoon where you can simply turn off your brain and watch it to while away the time. But watching it in January where all the Oscar bait films are being screened it surely exposes how bad this film really is.".

Different times in history but the same lame storytelling. The acting of everyone involved was so over the top and yet they were taking it all so seriously. The supposedly exciting scenes like crossing the rickety old bridge the attack of the wolves and even the Grand Guignolstyle faceoff with the demons at the end were plagued with unsatisfactory special effects. You know they were meant to be special because they sure took a lot of screen time. However I found them unexciting and predictable.OK this may be entertaining for a lazy afternoon where you can simply turn off your brain and watch it to while away the time. But watching it in January where all the Oscar bait films are being screened it surely exposes how bad this film really is.";

Two of the students portrayed by David Keith and Heather Locklear eventually marry and a child is born a firestarter played by Drew Barrymore who can set anything ablaze with just one angry thought.  Martin Sheen and George C.

The music written and performed by Tangerine Dream is perfectly suited to the movie and in my opinion is some of Tangerine Dream's best work.  The special effects are convincing and at times chilling.  Readers of Stephen King's bestselling novel will be happy to know that this movie is for the most part faithful to his original story despite a rather clipped ending.In all if you have a taste for conspiracy thrillers with a healthy dose of science fiction thrown in you'll like this one though it probably won't be your favorite.".

The first three were THE DEAD ZONE CUJO and CHRISTINE. The fourth and least commercially successful was FIRESTARTER based on King's 1980 novel. The fact that it didn't fare all that well with critics or audiences doesn't diminish the fact that it remains despite some flaws one of the best adaptations of King's works as well as a commentary on the dangerous of government interference and dissembling in people's lives.Drew Barrymore who made a starmaking turn in E.T. THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL is the young girl possessed of a devastating kind of psychic power called pyrokinesis the ability to light fires just by concentrating long and hard about it. Her power is the result of her parents David Keith Heather Locklear having undergone a bizarre chemical experiment in 1969 conducted by a secret government agency known as The Shop. Since then eight of the ten patients originally involved have died horrible deaths and Locklear has been murdered by agents of the Shop. Now Keith and Barrymore are on their own with Keith's only ability to protect Barrymore being his own psychic ability. But once in the hands of the Shop led by Martin Sheen and George C. Scott they are the subject of various experiments on their abilities. Barrymore gets special attention of course because of her fiery power especially from Scott. In the end of course Sheen and Scott and the rest of the Shop's minions find out what happens when you play with a power that you don't fully appreciate...There are admittedly flaws with FIRESTARTER most of them having to do with the slightly perfunctory way that Mark L. Lester CLASS OF 1984 directs the actors this even though he has some superb ones notably Sheen and Scott. The dialogue is also a little clunky at times too. But overall FIRESTARTER succeeds more often than it fails due to King's own narrative genius Barrymore's credible performance and the special effects wizardry of Mike Wood. The scenes of the Shop being incinerated at the end by Barrymore's burning rage after her father has been killed are particularly spectacular. FIRESTARTER also benefits from brief but welcome cameo roles by Art Carney and Louise Fletcher who become her protectors after the firestorm.However flawed it might be FIRESTARTER does provide plenty of suspense and atmosphere without an extreme amount of bloodshed though the fire scenes are quite hairraising all the same and is well worth seeing.".

Charlie quite plainly can combust virtually anything with her mind.Though all the acting in this film is good Barrymore and Scott are truly awesome. Scott plays a brilliant sociopath and can go from a kindly old Viet Nam vet to a ruthless killer with one quick change of facial expression. And Barrymore at the age of 8 if you didn't pick up on that the first time I said it gives her character a fully believable personhood with great depth.Like the novel this is more of a horrorthriller than classic King ghost stories  like The Shining. It is also less classic King horror  like Carrie. And its also not a great drama like Dolores Claiborne Misery and Stand By Me. Though it fits into roughly the same category as Hearts in Atlantis it is not a literary as this much later King work and the characters are not as well developed. Although the book could be said to be one of King's earlier experiments with what would become a formula for his lesser works King's writing is so lucid and his characters are so interesting believable and nicely examined that his 'B fiction' is still somewhat above the average bestseller. The film follows the book very closely and like the book is sort of a prototype for the more formulaic films in the King portfolio.The directing is very good the cinematography especially the effects is excellent and the film is as a whole entertaining. But for those who have not read the book the film will likely come off as 'no big deal.'

Firestarter isn't the best known of his books and that's slightly odd as this film adaptation is one of the best based on his stories. The film takes obvious influence from Brian De Palma's 'The Fury' as aside from the fact that this one is about a young girl that can start fires and De Palma's film features a boy with psychic abilities the way that both plots play out is very similar indeed. The plot has a number of problems and the characters don't always act logically but this is offset by the likable nature of the film and characters that are easy to get along with due to their relatively simplistic nature. The film follows the aftermath of an experiment in which people were given an experimental drug. The ultimate result of this experiment was a child born of Andy and Vicky McGee a child with a unique ability known as 'pyrokinesis'  the ability to start fires at will.The film benefits from a range of cult stars. A young Drew Barrymore takes the title role and although her acting skills hadn't been honed by the time this film was released and she is more than a little bit wooden she provides an interesting lead. David Keith and Martin Sheen back her up well in supporting roles but the main acting plaudits go to the great George C. Scott who is good in what is probably the meatiest role of the piece. The running time is a little long for a film like this but it's well used and the fact that the story doesn't get caught up with needless elements such as the girl's mother and father falling in love is definitely a good thing. The plot is very relaxed for most of the way through and director Mark L. Lester seems content to just let things play out. That is until the last fifteen minutes when the plot reaches its full potential and explodes with a fun and exciting finale. The film does feel more than a little bit like a TV movie at times and the dumbed down techno soundtrack doesn't help this. Overall the film definitely isn't perfect but it's an enjoyable watch and King films have definitely been a lot worse!".

It is impossible to cram a five hundred page book into one two hour movie and make it work favourably. For much of the picture the pacing feels awkward and rushed more interested in moving the plot along than developing the characters.Brian De Palma's Carrie followed the story of the book just as closely. But seeing as Carrie is less than half the length of Firestarter it made for a much more comfortable adaptation.Stanley Kubrick had the right idea with the Shining. The book was about the same length as Firestarter and as a result the plot was butchered heavily to make it work for the screen. Stephen King and much of his loyal fanbase have misgivings about Kubrick's adaptation a lot of people who love film and recognise it as the different medium that it is regard it as a masterpiece.Mark Lester's Firestarter isn't all bad however. George C. Scott's John Rainbird is inspired casting and probably the best thing this film has going for it. The scene at the Manders' farm and the conclusion at the Shop's headquarters make for enjoyable viewing and are handled capably.It's a shame that as a whole the film doesn't work too well. I'd definitely like to see this readapted into another film or a miniseries. The book isn't exactly King's best but it has a lot of potential for another screen outing. 510".

The scene at the Manders' farm and the conclusion at the Shop's headquarters make for enjoyable viewing and are handled capably.It's a shame that as a whole the film doesn't work too well. I'd definitely like to see this readapted into another film or a miniseries. The book isn't exactly King's best but it has a lot of potential for another screen outing. 510";

	schema:reviewBody "Suspenseful and terrifying entertainment that goes beyond its genre  dealing with a girl who has the unwanted and often uncontrollable gift of Pyrokinesis as a result of a government experiment  lighting fires by mere thought . A couple Victoria 'Vicky' Tomlinson McGee Heather Locklear of Dynasty and Andy McGee David Keith  he was 14th choice who participated in a potent medical experiment gain telekinetic ability and then have a child named Charlene 'Charlie' McGee Jennifer Connelly  Taylor Neff were considered and Bridgette Andersen the star of Savannah Smiles tested for the role of Charlie ultimately played by Drew Barrymore who is pyrokinetic . Charlie McGee whose character was modeled on King's daughter Naomi has an extraordinary power or is that haunted  sometimes uncontrollable and an evil destructive force . Meanwhile a secret government agency known as The Shop led by Captain Hollister Martin Sheen took over at a late stage from Burt Lancaster who had to withdraw following heart surgery and send a sniper named John Rainbird George C Scott and plot to kidnap the duo for study them and testing their abilities.This exciting tale packs noisy action  explosions  suspense  thriller  chills  poignant plot and results to be an enjoyable though frightening entertainment  including some silly and embarrassing scenes . The movie delivers the goods with hairrising thrills as when the little girl executes the astonishing abilities . It stars Drew Barrymore in one of her first roles after E.T.  as the gifted child of the title who has the ability to ignite objects around her . David Keith is good as the daddy who attempts to protect her from the nasties . Secondary cast is frankly excellent as Freddie Jones as Doctor Joseph Wanley  Art Carney as Irv Manders  Louise Fletcher as Norma Manders  Moses Gunn as Doctor Pynchot and Antonio Fargas as a Cabman . The fire special effects  themselves  of course  are the real protagonists  and they're surprising  astounding and quite convincing . The special effects gave work to a great number of technician people and lots of stunts . This film was originally going to be directed by John Carpenter. According to Carpenter Universal executives removed him from the project in the wake of the box office and critical drubbing they received for The Thing Carpenter had reportedly talked to his Assault on Precinct 13 actor Darwin Joston about taking on the role of John Rainbird which was ultimately played by George C. Scott . Strange soundtrack by Tangerine Dream was composed and performed by means of synthesizer they never actually saw the film and sent filmmaker some music and told him to choose whatever he liked . It was followed by Firestarter 2  rekindled 2002 by Robert Iscove with Marguerite Moreau as Charlene Charlie McGee  Malcolm McDowell  Dennis Hopper and Danny Nucci and in which Charlie has been in hiding for nearly all her life from a topsecret government fringe group headed by a maniacal who wants to find and use her as the ultimate weapon of war. The motion picture was well produced by Dino Laurentiis and professionally directed by Mark L. Lester. Director Mark L. Lester confirmed that this is his most difficult film that he ever made . He's a cool director and producer American World Pictures of B movies  his greatest success was during the 80s when he directed hits  such as Commando Showdown in Little Tokio and Class of 99 and this Firestarter.".

	schema:reviewBody "Firestarter 1984  out of 4 Weak adaptation of the Steven King novel about a young child named Charlie Drew Barrymore who has the special power of being able to set things on fire by just using her thought. She's on the run with her father David Keith from various government people wanting to exploit her talent as she tries to control her gift. I haven't read the novel that this movie is based on so I can't comment on what this got right or wrong. However I'm one who never expects a movie to follow the book 100 so with that in mind I can only say that this film is a complete mess. Thankfully this thing offers up an allstar cast including some legends because without them this film would be nearly impossible to get through. Clocking in just under twohours the film feels twice as long and I think a lot of the blame has to go to director Mark L. Lester. His direction is all over the place and not for a second did I feel any tension in the story and I also thought the pacing was pretty bad. I will say that not all of this might be his fault because the screenplay itself has a fair number of problems. One such problem is that the entire thing never really seems to know what it wants to do. Is it a horror film? Science fiction? Is it trying to be some sort of hard negative look at the government and their powers? The film is all over the map in regards to what it's trying to do but sadly it doesn't do any of them very well. The performances are actually pretty good and are the best thing in the film. Barrymore delivers a strong and believable performance as the haunting girl and I've always liked Keith in just about everything he's done. Heather Locklear does a nice job in her scenes as the mother and we get vets like Martin Sheen and George C. Scott offering up fine performances. The highlight of the film deals with a couple farmers played by Art Carney and Louise Fletcher. Yes FIRESTARTER has three Oscarwinning actors. The special effects are another plus and help give the film some energy. I must admit that the entire story struck me as being silly and especially early on as we see Keith's character getting nosebleeds from doing his psychic powers and Barrymore crying from setting people on fire. These scenes really made me laugh the majority of the time and once we keep seeing the same thing over and over it just gets boring.".

These scenes really made me laugh the majority of the time and once we keep seeing the same thing over and over it just gets boring.";

I suppose one could say that this film plus Carrie was the forrunner on screen that is of such films as XMen and Heroes on TV. The acting was superb. If you want to know who is a good actor and who is average see them in a death scene. The way Brian Keith acted when he found his wife dead brought tears to my eyes such was the realism. As for Drew Barrymore I continue to be astounded by her acting ability it is just a shame though not in this case that the films she is in do not do her ability justice. The special effects for the time 1984is excellent and if you do not believe me watch the end of Firestarter and then watch Xmen two the bobby at home scene and you will see what I mean. As for me the highest praise I can give this film is to say that as soon as I finished watching it I hit the internet and bought it on DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ive only seen FIRESTARTER once and that was about 18 months ago on the Scifi channel . Its mainly a forgettable movie with a plot thats been reused a few times on THE XFILES . It wasnt until I was flicking through this site killing time that I remembered seeing it and would have totally forgotten seeing the movie in the first place if it wasnt for the fact that this movie is disturbing and I dont mean that in a good way!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! The story revolves around Andrew Mcgee and his daughter Charlene who are on the run from government spooks who are after Charlene because she has telekinetic abilities to make things combust . Its a simple plot but theres two elements to the story that disturbed me . One is the introduction of the main villain John Rainbird  The McGees have been captured by the spooks at this point  who in order to find out the secret of Charlenes powers tries to gain her confidence . What I found so disgusting about this is that its like watching how a paedophile may manipulate a victim  it really made my skin crawl and considering Rainbird states hell personally kill young Charlene after hes  Got what hes wanted  the allusion to child molesting and child murder is complete . Okay I accept that the audience detesting Rainbird and wanting him to be cruelly killed is accepted as part of the drama but what I dont accept is the number of people killed by the Mcgees who are just doing their job . This was the second reason I disliked the movie intensely  in several scenes government officials are burned to death after trying to arrest the Mcgees . Okay the McGees could claim self defence like the action sequence at the end where they flame the government base but if you heard on the news today that several government law enforcers were killed in the line of duty after trying to arrest suspected terroristscriminals where would your sympathy lie ? Would it be the with the law enforcers or the suspected terroristscriminals ? These scenes of fiery deaths are even more disturbing watching Charlene being played by the angelic child actress Drew BarrymoreOne other thing I can recall about FIRESTARTER  is that the cast are wasted. Louise Fletcher and George C Scott both won Oscars in the 1970s  Okay Scott turned his down but you know what I mean  while theres some classy support from character actors like Martin Sheen and Freddie Jones but ultimately I found myself asking what are these actors doing in such a low brow movie ? In fact FIRESTARTER is so bad I started wondering why Heather Locklear agreed to appear in it".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a movie with not the best reputation out there. It feels and looks like a late sequel to Brian De Palma's The Fury which was still a movie I liked better than this one.Seems that one of the foremost reason why this movie isn't well liked is because it has some controversy in it. Drew Barrymore who still was a 8 or 9 year old kid at the time is killing a lot of people with her kinetic powers in this movie. Sort of the same reason why there was some controversy about KickAss at the time. She kills by literally setting people on fire and blowing stuff up with her powers never thought I would ever been seeing Drew Barrymore blowing up George C. Scott. People tend to not like seeing kids doing stuff like that even when it's in 'just' a movie. I personally have no problems with it so it's nothing I hold against the movie but I of course can still see the reason why some people have issues with it.But still I also didn't liked this movie all that much. I was still really liking this movie during its first half when it was being a movie in which the main characters were on the run but I really started to loose interest fast the moment they got captured and locked up for research. All of the pace and excitement seemed to be gone after that and the movie just never really recovered.You can definitely 'blame' the fact that this movie is being based on a book for that. I'm sure the story and character development and emotions all worked out fine in Stephen King's novel but it just isn't a type of story that translates well to the big screen. It makes too sudden big jumps in its story has too many distracting and pointless sidetracks and characters and the contrasts between the first and second half of the movie are just too big. Apparently a remake of this movie is currently on the way but I have a scoop for you It will bomb! The story just isn't good or interesting enough moviewise and too many elements within it really don't work out too well on film.It's pretty amazing to see how much talent was involved with this movie while at the same time it also had a quite lowbudget. It's based on a novel by Stephen King has action expert Mark L. Lester as director Frank Capra Jr. and the Dino De Laurentiis Company behind the movie its production and it's starring David Keith Drew Barrymore Heather Locklear Martin Sheen and George C. Scott. So lots of big names behind this movie which make it perhaps a bit of an interesting 'failure' without at the same time calling this movie an horrible one though.No it really is not an horrible movie by any means but it at the same time just isn't working out well either. It's a movie that you can definitely watch but when you don't you're not missing much with it.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Firestarter starts as Andrew McGee David Keith  his young daughter Charlene Drew Barrymore escape the clutches of some federal agent type guy's you see a shadowy Governemt organisation called 'The Shop' conducted some experiments on Andrew  Charlene's mother Victoria Heather Locklear who then got together had sex  ended up with Charlene who as a result of the experiments is a pyrokinetic  can start fires by just thinking about it. Now the evil guy's  gal's who run The Shop want Andrew for his own telekinetic abilities  Charlene for hers Andrew knows they want to conduct experiments on himself  Charlene for their own evil purposes  is determined not to let The Shop get hold of them...Directed by Mark L. Lester  adapted from the Stephen King novel of the same name Firestarter is fairly mean spirited but watchable horrorthriller. The script by Stanley Mann which takes itself very seriously is at it's most enjoyable during it's first half when Andrew  Charlene are on the run which is when it is pretty interesting  relatively absorbing unfortunately the second half of the film switches gears completely  it becomes evil scientists vs. Charlene  lets face it there was only ever going to be one winner. I'm not happy about the long sequences of Charlene making people burn to death I'm sorry but I felt no sympathy for her as a character  the scenes of these people burning whether they had done anything to her or not were pretty strong  Lester certainly likes to dwell on their pain  the screams they make as they burn. I usually love exploitation  the nastier the better but these parts in Firestarter just didn't sit well we me at all  thought they were gratuitous  unnecessary. The character's aren't great the dialogue is OK  I didn't really see why they wanted to capture Andrew  Charlene so badly I mean whose bright idea was it to suggest they could control her anyway? Ultimately what did they intend to do with her? It moves along at a reasonable pace  isn't too boring but I doubt I'd want to watch it anytime again soon.Director Lester does a good job the suitably fiery climax is pretty brutal as Charlene dishes out some swift  severe punishment. Apparently Lester replaced John Carpenter who was originally set to direct but after the critical  financial failure of The Thing 1982 which coincidently is one of the biggest travesty's in cinematic history the money men at Universal 'removed' him from the project. I wouldn't call it scary it's not particularly creepy or exciting either but it does have a certain sinister atmosphere. There are some strong scenes of people being set on fire  burning to death here the special effects do a great job perhaps even too great a job as they come across as excessive. Forget about any gore or violence as there isn't any.Shot in North Carolina  boasting a very healthy sounding budget of about 15000000 Firestarter has a very slick  professional look about it it's well made with impressive fire effects  it has high production values. There's a surprisingly good cast here Martin Sheen who took over from Burt Lancaster at short notice Drew Barrymore who was riding high on the success of E.T. 1982 coincidently E.T. was the reason why The Thing bombed at the boxoffice George C. Scott complete with comedy eyepatch  Heather Locklear are all probably recognisable to the average filmgoer.Firestarter is a decent enough time waster it's an OK Stephen King adaptation it has a good cast  some impressive fire effects but as a whole it's average with a predictable  lightweight story that ultimately goes nowhere. Followed by the madeforTV sequel Firestarter II Rekindled 2002 which brings the villain John Rainbird back from the dead somehow...".

It moves along at a reasonable pace  isn't too boring but I doubt I'd want to watch it anytime again soon.Director Lester does a good job the suitably fiery climax is pretty brutal as Charlene dishes out some swift  severe punishment. Apparently Lester replaced John Carpenter who was originally set to direct but after the critical  financial failure of The Thing 1982 which coincidently is one of the biggest travesty's in cinematic history the money men at Universal 'removed' him from the project. I wouldn't call it scary it's not particularly creepy or exciting either but it does have a certain sinister atmosphere. There are some strong scenes of people being set on fire  burning to death here the special effects do a great job perhaps even too great a job as they come across as excessive. Forget about any gore or violence as there isn't any.Shot in North Carolina  boasting a very healthy sounding budget of about 15000000 Firestarter has a very slick  professional look about it it's well made with impressive fire effects  it has high production values. There's a surprisingly good cast here Martin Sheen who took over from Burt Lancaster at short notice Drew Barrymore who was riding high on the success of E.T. 1982 coincidently E.T. was the reason why The Thing bombed at the boxoffice George C. Scott complete with comedy eyepatch  Heather Locklear are all probably recognisable to the average filmgoer.Firestarter is a decent enough time waster it's an OK Stephen King adaptation it has a good cast  some impressive fire effects but as a whole it's average with a predictable  lightweight story that ultimately goes nowhere. Followed by the madeforTV sequel Firestarter II Rekindled 2002 which brings the villain John Rainbird back from the dead somehow...";

A long time has passed but I have the DVD now and I have to say I never knew just what some of the critics were talking about when they panned the movie. I have read the book too and it's not 100 faithful but I'd say it was at least 85 or 90  like the Stephen King story. Not to mention the stellar cast who all did MARVELOUS with their material. Martin Sheen was terrific Art Carney and Louise Fletcher were wonderful George C. Scott was menacing perfection David Keith was probably the most impressive to me as the father who worried himself sick about his child...and the scenes where he had to go find his murdered wife were outstanding. And 8 year old Barrymore did a wonderful job. I love the music too of course a moody ambient score by Tangerine Dream but I thought the sound quality was a little disappointing. Apparently years and digital enhancements haven't helped. Still this is after over 2 decades a cut above today's crappy ultraviolent horror offerings and still a lot of fun to watch. I still can't see why the critics called it wasted talent of a lot of the best actors. It's a really good movie.".

Drew plays daughter of parents who in their youth participated in a government experiment gained some abilities and then got married and brought to world daughter whose extreme pyrokinetic abilities are just waiting to be triggered. The movie reminds of Carrie a little bit but while Carrie focuses on horror angle Firestarter is more of an action drama. The secret government agency is trying to capture this family they kill mother Heather Locklear so father David Keith and daughter live on the run until agents find them attack them and all hell breaks loose. The movie keeps a balance between the dramatic display of inner fight between a sweet little girl and a killing machine and welldirected action scenes with good effects. Legendary Tangerine Dream were in charge of music and their eccentric compositions give a weird note to movie atmosphere. Overall this is one of the best King adaptations I saw so far. I saw all King movies done before this one and several done after and only The Shining Christine and The Shawshank Redemption are better.810".

My most memorable movie moment of Firestarter is the scene when Barrymore walks out of a burning barn ready to kill and burn everything and everyone she sees  a little girl with an adorable face but with the power of the devil. Although Firestarter has the feel of a movie of the week and has several shenanigans e.g. the bad guys make the laughably bad assumption that Keith has lost his powers and therefore doesn't need that much supervision overall it is very entertaining mostly due to Barrymore's adorable portrayal of her character and the part when Barrymore goes off on the bad guys is very satisfying.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments".

	schema:headline " Classic Indian drama of love sacrifice downfall redemption";
	schema:reviewBody "GUIDE 1965 is an unsung classic of Hindi cinema starring major Bollywood star Dev Anand. It's a beautifullyproduced modern love story and focuses on what happens when a tourist guide takes up with an exdancer who has been abandoned by her archaeologist husband and then guides her career as she becomes a musical star. It has much in common with classic Hollywood romantic musicals in the way it seamlessly incorporates songs and musical numbers into the action and charts the success of its female star. It adds to this ragstoriches show biz story some characteristic Indian twists which give it greater scope and deeper meaning. Based on a novel by R.K. Narayan GUIDE stars Anand as Raju a glib wellliked freelance tour guide who takes visitors Indian and foreign to historic sites around Delhi and tells them storiessome true some embellishedabout these magnificent places. When Raju takes Rosy Waheeda Rehman the exdancer under his wing it causes a rift between him and his mother friends and coworkers so he leaves with Rosy and helps her to embark on a career as a singing and dancing performer.However as Rosy achieves stardom Raju falls into bad habits palling around with the money men drinking and gambling heavily. Eventually he is arrested for forging a check and is sent to jail. When he gets out he starts life anew and wanders alone far and wide before winding up in a remote desert village where thanks to the endless stream of pearls of wisdom he dispenses he is taken as a holy man. In the midst of a terrible drought he is compelled to embark on a fast so as not to disappoint the villagers who believe his fast will bring rain. All the while Rosy and his mother are searching for him.The story is not told in quite this order. We first see Raju as he is getting out of jail and we first see Rosy as she begins her search for him. The story then unfolds in flashbacks from both his and Rosy's perspectives. If there is any flaw in the narrative structure it is that the exploits of Raju in his reign as holy man or swami are given short shrift while the love story tends to bog down during the lovers' disillusion and drift apart. We needed to see more of Raju's life in the remote village. Given that the film is only 170 minutes rather short for a Bollywood film another halfhour of storytelling would not have hurt.Still it is an accomplished work boasting all the class elegance and artistry of a classic Hollywood or European drama and few of the notable excesses of Bollywood films. It maintains a discreet cinematic distance that keeps the emotions in check while adding richer layers. There are songs and dances but not too many and they are all beautifully shot and staged particularly the lavish lengthy sequence showing Rosy's rise to stardom as a stage performer. The two leads Dev Anand and Waheeda Rehman are both genuine movie stars in the classic sense and carry the film as well as any of their counterparts in other cinemas. Rehman for one has a presence which clearly recalls such Italian actresses as Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida. For those who are new to Bollywood this film is a useful way to explore the roots of the Bollywood musicals that are finally attracting serious attention among film fans in the U.S.".

	schema:headline " A classic tale effectively adapted to the screen with great writing music and performances";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on R.K. Narayan's famous novel The Guide Vijay Anand's Guide is a doubtless classic of Hindi movies. In a way the movie broke tradition by presenting a relationship between a simple man who works as a guide and an unhappilymarried woman he assists. The film's most remarkable feat is the lack of overperfection. The characters are devoid of any heroic qualities. They are like everybody else flawed and imperfect people who have their ups and downs and not typical selfsacrificing figures. The first scene when Dev Anand's Raju is released from prison made me predict that in typical Hindifilm style he was actually there for no reason and was probably accused for no fault of his own. After all we are so used to seeing movies in which the lead characters are imprisoned either because they sacrificed themselves for somebody else or because they were deceived. Here Raju really did commit a crime. It's interesting how the story moves through several ironic turns. In the first half we see that Waheeda Rehman's Rosie is emotionally dependant on Raju as in him she finds a friend and confidant and he is the one who inspires her to fight for her dignity and is her only support system. Later in the film the story turns over when with the help of Raju Rosie achieves fame as a dancer. She is stronger and feels more confident. There we see that it is actually Raju who is dependant on her both emotionally and financially. He loses himself to drinking and gambling and is an altogether different person. Well so is she and that's what gives us a fascinating look at the complexity of their relationship. The second half is by my estimation much stronger than the first but that's a good thing the trouble is when it's the other way around. In many ways the second half namely the parts showing the conflict in Raju and Rosie's new life as a couple is reminiscent of many classic Hollywood pictures involving relationships. The narrative structure is done well never daring to torture the audience and instead making everything easy to follow despite many complex proceedings. Yes there are moments which I felt were unnecessary and the film may be quite overlong but otherwise it is welledited although of course it is more a case of good storytelling and due credit for the consistency goes to Vijay Anand for writing such a good script and directing it so well. The dialogue is for the most part excellent  it is rich and meaningful and it's easy to see why many of the film's lines are famous to this today. They bring depth to the story and never sound cheesy or corny just very appropriate and convincing. The film is also one of the most remarkable cinematographic achievements of the times and the colour cinematography makes for an easy watch. The music by S.D. Burman is sublime and rightfully each song is considered a classic. The songs are executed with impressive energy and colour they never feel out of place and are all situationally relevant as they enhance the meaning of the story. My favourite number is of course the highly popular Aaj Phir Jeene Ki Tamanna Hai just because I saw it as an uninhibited celebration of the human spirit and it is just an exhilarating and joyful number.Raju and Rosie have been known as iconic characters and due credit for this must go to the actors though they are well written. Dev Anand as already mentioned plays an imperfect man who is still rather classy as a character and it is a demanding part for any actor. This is the role of a lifetime for this popular actor he sinks his teeth into it and delivers. He is convincing even in the most crucial moments where a lesser actor could have failed and brings character to Raju. Waheeda Rehman shines as the conflicted Rosie in a performance that in spite of being so restrained conveys so much of her inner pain and dissatisfaction from life. Her transformation is very convincing as later in the film we see an altogether different woman who is indifferent to her surroundings and to Raju as well. It never looks peculiar where it could have because we saw a much more warm side of her character early in the movie. It goes without saying that her dance numbers are simply superb  they are some of the best portions of the film and they contribute significantly to the building of her character. Each one of them constitutes an expression of her state of mind whether happy or tormented and there is a certain fervour in her expressions and moves that explosively brings out her otherwise repressed energy and emotion. Anand and Rehman are supported by several actors who provide strong support even if not all of them are great actors. Kishore Sahu is good as Marco Rosie's ignorant husband although he has several weak moments. The glorious Leela Chitnis is wonderful as Raju's loving mother. Guide is a great film though I would never call it flawless. In all fairness I found myself disappointed a bit with the conclusion of the story although I did see the redemptive tone of the ending. It is of course handled very well but the chapter where Raju is mistaken as a holy man just didn't work for me as much despite the spiritual side of it. I still appreciate Guide and believe that fans of Hindi movies and even foreigners who have not seen Indian movies will enjoy this movie. It is a fine dramatic musical and all I think is left to say is welldone.".

Kishore Sahu is good as Marco Rosie's ignorant husband although he has several weak moments. The glorious Leela Chitnis is wonderful as Raju's loving mother. Guide is a great film though I would never call it flawless. In all fairness I found myself disappointed a bit with the conclusion of the story although I did see the redemptive tone of the ending. It is of course handled very well but the chapter where Raju is mistaken as a holy man just didn't work for me as much despite the spiritual side of it. I still appreciate Guide and believe that fans of Hindi movies and even foreigners who have not seen Indian movies will enjoy this movie. It is a fine dramatic musical and all I think is left to say is welldone.";

	schema:headline " Guide is about losing and finding your way in life";
	schema:reviewBody "Guide is a transcendental movie about finding or losing your way and finding it again. At one level it is purely corporeal  about life's search for fame fortune and love but at a metalevel it asks what are we really searching for? Just fame fortune love? Or is it altruism God or something even bigger than that? Guide looks for answers to nothing less that the deepest and toughest questions of life.Guide is about the many paradoxical situations of life. A village looks for guidance from a man who is lost himself. A girl who is trying to find freedom from her seedy background finds imprisonment in a loveless marriage. A woman and a man dream of a successful future together but are disenchanted and separated by the very same future they built together. Guide explores these situations subtly and honestly. True to reality life itself is the protagonist and life itself is the villain and the characters are but parts of a universe that is trying to comprehend itself through them.Unlike much of Bollywood fare this movie has rich characters and strong character development. The main characters truly evolve through the movie. Vijay Anand's dialogs are excellent and express emotions as honestly as few movies have. A few scenes really stand out  one where Rosie and Raju penniless pretend to be a famous artiste and her eager fan another where Rosie sadly alienated from her lover says there is a wall around my heart and it seems like nothing can reach inside it  not happiness not sadness.Last but not least the songs are a delight and they only enhance the depth of the story. When Rosie tastes for a day the freedom she craves we sing with her I feel like living again. On our journey with Raju and Rosie when they feel the cozy warmth of love and togetherness we feel like singing the colors of our dreams are now the same when they feel sad loneliness we lament the day ends but alas the night lasts forever.Guide is a great human drama but what elevates it to an epic is the mystical undercurrent to the story. Sophisticated and progressive for a Bollywood movie made in 1965 Guide is a timeless masterpiece and very few Bollywood movies made before or since come close in scope ambition and depth. It swept most major awards in 1965 except shockingly for Best Music  which was won by Suraj and will probably be a strong contender for these awards in any other year.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched Guide around eight years ago and my memory fails me a bit. But so strong is the movie that it has left a strong impression on me. Some events of this comment might be a little off the mark but overall it is a true attempt.Guide is popular director Vijay Anad's best remembered movie. The movie won both critical acclaim and good box office sales. Based on acclaimed Indian novelist of Malgudi Days fame K R Narayan's book The Guide Guide is the story of two people Raju Dev Anand and Rosy Waheeda Rehman and there flaws. While Raju is a enthusiastic young tourist guide Rosy is the cheerless forlorn wife of an architect Marco. The setting is the scenic city of Udaipur known for the lake palace. Marco is much older than Rosi and it is quite evident that the married life is not going smooth. Marco is more interested in the motionless wall sculptures of the caves he is studying with Raju's help than in his wife.At heart Rosy is a girl. When she meets Raju the guide she blossoms into her true self thanks to a suicide attempt Raju saved her from. Raju encourages her to develop her individuality  live her own life independent of Marco who to add to his evil outlook is shown as a heavy drinker. The song Aaj fir Jine Ki Tamanna Hai based on Rosi sung by Lata Mangeshkar roughly translates to Today I want to live again.. The songs effectively portrays both Rosi's suppressed energy and her quest for freedom. Rosi is interested in dancing something her husband wont allow her to do. Thanks to all the support she gets from Raju she falls in love with him.In 1960's Hindu society such a relationship was definitely unacceptable  Even in Cinema. To show a relationship outside the sanctity of married life was a bold move. It required Director Vijay Anand's abilities to portray it and still win acclaim and viewer ship. It also required Waheeda Rehman's abilities at acting to be sanctimonious in spite of living outside her marriage.Raju and Rosie marry and now starts ..sadly ever after..Rosi can now freely realize her dream as a dancer from Raju's support. During the classical music influenced Piya tau see naina laage re we see Rosi's rise in fame as a dancer. As Rosi becomes a popular dancer Raju get more irresponsible. Acrimony creeps into their relationship because of Raju's jealousy and his sudden habit of drinking and signs a fraudulent cheque.The guide looses his own track.. only to seek it again as a hermit..The movie starts with Wahan Kaun hai Tera Musafir Jayega Kahan? sung by SD Burman where will you go oh traveler you know no one there. The song sets us up for the movie's philosophical tone. Guide has no heroes or blacks and whites every character has a spectrum of good and bad sides. The last and final song of the movie is a duel song Mohse chhal kiye jaye sung by Rosi and Kya se kya ho gaya bewafa by Raju present both there arguments. It is only near the end that Raju becomes a chance hero. Some villagers assume he is a saint and Raju forgets who he is and probably because he wants to pay penance for his mistakes he starts to believe in his new life.Vijay Anand went on to see more success at box office with his thrillers. But Guide remains his best movie. A Classic Guide swept the Filmfare awards  winning 7 Filmfares best Movie Director Actor Actress Story Dialogue and Cinematography. I wonder how on earth did it miss the Filmfares for its music.spoiler warning 'Guide' is a celebration of a flawed character who seeks love pain redemption and death. ".

Dev Anand was accepted by the Indian moviegoers instantly since he had chiseled features mixture of Gregory Peck  Rock Hudson!wore hats at a rakish anglewalked sort of sideways! and spoke Hindi with a clipped and poetic accent.

Dev Anand is not an actor in the sense of acting talent like Raj Kapoor or Rajendra KumarSangam but he got away because of his good looks.

Accepted she did and the rest is history a cinematic masterpiece caught in Eastman color by cinematographer Jal Mistry. There is a scene where Raju Dev Anand is drunk and sings his heart and soul to Rosie Waheeda Rahman who has emotions crushed between a pillow and she walks down the stairs and their hands meet between rails. This was the master director Vijay Anand at work using haunting melody of music that was the staple of great music directors like Dada Sachin Dev Burman whose music will linger for ever. Guide is a movie you will treasure to be taken out and watched once in a while lest we forget the fact that there were gifted craftsmen who made great movies when movie art was a passion practiced by chosen few.

The songs are among the memorable classics beautiful lyrics that are spectacularly picturised thanks to the amazing cinematography and the dazzling locations and support the narration. The characters are so brilliantly written with different layers showing us very real human beings. None of them are perfect and very easily relatable.Dev Anand and Waheeda Rehman have acted together in a number of films yet 'Guide' remains the most memorable film as their chemistry is simply electrifying. Not surprisingly the characters Raju and Rosie have been immortalized by the two fabulous leads. Dev Anand as Raju delivers his best performance while Waheeda Rehman as Rosie underplays her part to near perfection and portrays Rosie with lan and I loved her expressions in the song just before Raju is arrested.Finally 'Guide' remains one of my favorite classics that I'll recommend to anyone. In my humble opinion it is one that will surprise you with it's storytelling and characters and one that will stay in your brave brain for quite some time.".

Circumstances changes and at work he gets involved with an archaeologist's neglected wife RosyWaheeda Rahman. He ends up helping her against the will of his mother separate from her husband and become a world class dancer. Raju becomes a very rich and successful man as her lover and secretary. Raju cant handle his success and ends up in a jail under the charges of forgery. Free from jail Raju decides to travel as an anonymous soul and is mistaken for a 'mahatma' by simple villagers. Raju's inner conflict and cosmic conflicts becomes one as a mad villager by mistake set hesitant Raju sail on philosophical voyage.The film is based on a novel by RK Narayan which is as good as the film. 'Guide' is the best Indian film by any standard or scale. It is a sure Oscar winner. Graph of the character 'Raju' is unimaginably big. There is just no connection between where it starts from and where it reaches finally although he remains a 'guide' throughout. This is one of those films which changes you as a man. This film is flawless. Pace is fast and non linear. It keeps going back and forth in flashbacks but narration is tight. I think this film is the essence of most Indian philosophies like 'Atma' soul Parmatma supreme soul of perfect consciousness Tapasya austerity Moksha liberation etc. Last 30 minutes deals with philosophical questions like 'Is there God?' 'are we being watched?' etc. There are lots of things in the film which is not in the novel including the ending which I think is the most important factor of the graph of the character. Dev Anand is brilliant in this film. This is definitely the best film of most of the cast and crew except for may be SD Burman. Though as a soundtrack this is SD's best too. Background music is filled with flute pieces and sitar which works great to set the mood for a grand philosophical finale. 'wahan Kaun Hai Tera' is probably one of the best video I can think of. In the song people throw money at sleeping Raju considering him a beggar. In the next frame he leans on a tree and cries like a child and then runs like hell. This song beats any choreography I have seen in my life including 'Anand' and 'Pyasa'. The transformation of a common man to 'mahatma' is RK Narayan's genius which Goldy Anand has very neatly transported onto celluloid screen. By the way this film is considered a bible from the filmmkinh point of view. You can imagine if its the best of Goldy 'God' Anand himself. If you are an Indian and you like films and you have not seen this film then you are like VP Singh who had not heard of Bachchan until 1983 . So don't be a total dumb like him and watch it.".

In the song Waha kaun hai tera when coins are thrown at him the expression of self deprecation given by him is one such example. Goldie's direction  treatment to the subject which was far ahead of its time is unparalleled.Finally what can be said about Sachinda's compositions.

And with music and lyrics by S. D. Burman and Shailendra vocals mainly by Rafi and Lata complemented by incessantly inventive camerawork and direction and sets in the very best '60's tradition you have something special.And there's a gripping rollercoaster script too Dev Anand as Raju is released from prison for forgery goes to a small village and inadvertently becomes the villagers swami while his story comes out in flashback. He was a slicktalking guide for a rich man who just like a fool didn't love his younger beautiful wife Rosie played by Waheeda Rehman who in turn loved dancing and Raju helped set up her career as a stage performer and fell in love with her and  well far more to it than just that. The characterisations are fairly deep but episodic as style was definitely preferred over substance by director Vijay Anand  and the Style is relentless continually restless cameras and snappy movement on screen to streams of audio interpolation or character interplay or invective means attention must be paid right from the start. The songs are beautiful and more important than usual because they're integral to the plot. Even Waheeda ecstatically dancing by herself carried a wealth of information and plot development. Out of such a great selection my favourites were Piya Tose Naina Laage Re and Saiyaan Beimaan both sung by Lata with their colourful sets and costumes and vibrant dance routines  in fact they're two of my favourite Lata songs ever the stately Gaata Rahe Mere Dil duet by Kishore Kumar and Lata always sticks in my mind afterwards. And Aaj Phir Jeene was voted 12th Bollywood movie song of alltime by listeners to UK BBC Asian Network in 2013. The song lyrics are beautiful but the dialogue is also wise  life and death may be illusions as averred by Raju's soul but this surely is fact!Dev said people thought him mad for pursuing with this Hindi version when an English one had flopped and there was a cool initial reaction to the film when it was released. For those wishing for the first time for a view of Olde Bollywood start here. This proper version is nearly three hours long and yet still leaves you thinking that there could have been more and was it rushed just like real life. Not perfect what is  but once seen never forgotten.".

	schema:reviewBody "If I were to make a list of movies I would want to watch moments before I die it would be The Seventh Seal Waking Life Wild Strawberries Groundhog Day Pyaasa and a few others. But one movie which I would pick above all great ones I have mentioned is Guide by Vijay Anand. It is hard to put into words what this movie means to me.For starters it reminds me of my grandmother and the expression on her every time she saw the film. Sometimes when you watch a movie again and again eventually the emotional connect gets somewhat diluted but not this one. Based on the book by R.K. Narayan Guide treaded into areas considered taboo for Indian society let alone films whether it is the extra marital affairs or living in relationship. But the greatness of the movies lies in the fact that the brilliant script and the honesty of the performances never distracted the audience from the crux of the film. Easily Dev Anand and Waheeda Rehman's best performances who handle a delicate subject with maturity and create the arc of the character through the film that actors so crave for. It was a once in lifetime role and they made it their own.The plot revolves around Raju makes a living by acting as a guide for tourists on one hand and a conman on another. He meets with Rosie Marco during one of his tours and is attracted to her. He finds out that Rosie is unhappily married would like to separate from her spouse and take up acting and dancing. With Raju's encouragement Rosie succeeds and both become rich beyond their imagination. Raju's lifestyle becomes easy and he succumbs to gambling and drinking in a big way. He forges a signature is caught arrested tried in court found guilty and imprisoned. Rosie will now have nothing to do with him. After Raju completes his prison sentence he is released and travels far and wide in an attempt to meet Rosie and also to try and avoid returning to the city. He is mistaken for a Saint and asked to preside over a temple in a region that is stricken by severe drought. Raju must offer prayers for rain and appease the people or else they will expose him for fooling them. The question remains will he succeed in conning devotees that have come far and wide to watch him perform a miracle?What makes the film stand the test of time is the truthful writing of the characters. Instead of reducing them to caricatures and making the film simplistic they are shows as human being. Flawed ambitious capable of love or hatred jealousy greed and ultimately redemption. And how can I complete review on Guide without mentioning the music by S.D.Burman truly one of the all time greats. But the champion of the film is arguably Vijay Anand. Till date I reckon he is technically one of the finest Indian directors. Unfortunately we did not see a lot of him behind the camera and too much in front of the camera for my liking.A masterpiece of the highest order which not only abides by the bollywood format but asks some pertinent questions about presence of God nature of the man existentialism.".

	schema:reviewBody "My all time fav movie. Reviewing a classic gives you a thrill and is an extremely challenging rather than reviewing some crap movie which are churned out today.Navketan International have made some of the great movies like Jewel ThiefJhonny Mera Naam Hum Dono Kala Bazar . But Guide is one of the biggest and most memorable movies under their banner. Based on R.K. Narayan's novel 'The Guide' the film is immortalized by director Vijay Anand's bold unconventional strokes. Who would have dared to show a man and woman living together outside the sanctity of a marriage way back in the 1960s? The movie revolves round Raju Dev Anand once a successful tourist guide who hesitates to return to his hometown of Udaipur after his release from jail and decides to search for his fortunes elsewhere. He ends up in a remote village temple wearing over his threadbare clothes a saffron scarf which had once belonged to some passing mendicant and finds himself suddenly elevated to the position of a holy man. Raju's mother and Rosie reach there and watch helplessly as Raju slowly drifts towards death due to the fasting.The film is enhanced richly by the two central performances. Dev Anand gives perhaps his best shaded performance in the title role playing him perfectly with just the right amount of grey and his perfectly nuanced performance won him his second Filmfare Award for Best Actor. Good as Dev Anand is however the life and soul of Guide is undoubtedly Waheeda Rehman. It was a daring role to play in those times of a woman who leaves her stifling impotent husband and lives with her lover a guide who helps her in her ambitions to become a famous dancer. Waheeda was in fact told she was committing professional suicide taking on this role.The other big star of Guide was its musical score by S.D. Burman. The film represents perhaps Burman Dada's greatest work and he is aided tremendously by Shailendra's lyrics and the flawless rendering of the songs by Mohd. Rafi Lata Mangeshkar Kishore Kumar and himself.Initially Guide had a tough time being sold because of its so called bold theme but thanks to Production Controller Yash Johar's perseverance the film was finally sold and released to great critical acclaim and was a big commercial success. R.K. Narayan was most unhappy with the final film as he felt it deviated too much from his novel. One of the major changes that Vijay Anand did was to change the setting of the film from Malgudi to Udaipur and while this did give the film an exotic grand visual look admittedly perhaps this took away from the ambiance of the small town of Narayan's novel. The ending too of the film was significantly different from that of the novel. But then Vijay Anand has always maintained that he was never interested in merely copying any work of art from one medium to another unless there was scope for value addition and to be fair to him he has made Guide into a rich and unforgettable cinematic experience.Guide was made in two versions simultaneously an English version in collaboration with Pearl S Buck and directed by Ted Danielewski to introduce Dev Anand to western audiences and of course the Hindi version directed by Dev Anand's younger brother Vijay Anand. The English version said to be closer to the novel and in spite of a nude scene using a duplicate instead of Waheeda Rehman flopped miserably but the Hindi version remains a classic to this day.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was reluctant to see this movie. As a veteran of Desert ShieldStorm I spent my first 90 days intheater in the Weapons Co of A Swofford's Battalion. I later was moved to the 1st Bn of 7th Marines but having been in the same unit for some of the same time I felt I could offer readers a unique perspective on the film's accuracy.From a purely aesthetic perspective I thought the film was well done. The acting was very good and the script was well written witty and accurate. The actors were well suited to their roles. My personal preference for a good plot would have been disappointed were it not for my personal interest in the film. In my opinion this film is an outstanding dramaticdocumentary so adjust your expectations accordingly. If you are expecting a driving plot line and all the accompanying dramatic tension then I think you will be disappointed as many whose comments I heard exiting the theater certainly were. But if you think of it as a chance to take a glimpse into a point in history and see it as some of those who lived it did then I think you will be impressed.Many people may think that the obscenity of some of the interactions was overdone for effect. But whatever anyone's personal judgment of that behavior that is the closest portrayal of Marines or soldiers being themselves I have yet seen on screen. Marines are vulgar. They do watch porn. They do fight among themselves. They do both hate and love the Marine Corps. There is an omnipresent antiwar conspiracy theorist. The do say ridiculous things. There are some who are over the line. The reality of the Marine Infantry is that things happen there every day that are well beyond conventional sensibility and which strain credibility to the average civilian. It's all true. I love the Marine Corps and I am still serving  I don't have an axe to grind. It just happens to be true.Are there parts of the film that I find incredible? Yes. But they are not the essential things. There is a scene it's even in the trailer in which everyone is firing their weapon into the air. I wasn't there but I can't fathom a breach of discipline on that scale. I can't say it's impossible but I am doubtful. But whether it's true or not is not important. At its essence this is a film about Marines how they adjusted to the Marine Corps each other and a war. If there are a few incredible details then we can just be grateful that Hollywood didn't impose a carchase on us.This is a film about Marines. At that time there were very few who turned down scholarships to Ivy League schools to come in. We were from strange backgrounds. We were obscene. We did want to get our kills. Many of us were frustrated that our war was only 100 hrs long. We knew we were filling the footsteps of giants  the Marines of Iwo The Chosin Belleau Wood  and I think we all wanted a chance to earn a place next to those men. In our wild adrenalized youth those aspirations just took the crude form of looking for a kill. Or at least that's how I've put it in perspective 15 years later.If you go and see this film try to recall yourself at 18 as I was. Suspend your judgment of the obscenity and vulgarity until you're sure you would've done it differently. I can't speak for Swofford but I am still incredibly proud of my service there. The insanity of this film reminds me why because it is characteristic of the immense hardship that our youth bears on behalf of the rest. Do the characters look stressed? It's not hyperbole. We were 18 and we thought we were going to die over there. Still at HHour everyone marched North. In my opinion you better fill some big shoes before you judge that. So don't go into this film champing at the bit to pigeonhole it as Anti or Pro war with all the prefab rhetoric that comes with such a judgment. You have an opportunity here to look back into our little moment in history. Swofford has invited you into our memories. They are not Right and they are not Left they are just our story as Swofford lived it. If that kind of thing interests you then go and see this movie.".

	schema:headline " Pleasantly surprising";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw a promotional screening of the film sponsored by my university. Following the screening was an audience QA with the author and main character Tony Swofford.And it was no surprise that the very first question from the audience was quite ambiguously Do you support the military? When Swofford dismissed the question as too broad and complex to be answered with a simple yes or no the inquirer followed up with Well do you support the war? Swofford dismissed this even more readily.To me this was perfectly representative of how the film handled its potential political implications.As Troy says early on in the film To hell with politics. We're here now. And that's essentially how the movie went. It bypasses the soapbox and simply tells you how it was from the perspective of a single soldier. And while the opening boot camp scenes may seem like Full Metal Jacket Lite the rest of the film is truly unique.Sam Mendes directs with his usual brilliance showing once again his affinity for bright vivid color even in the largely monochromatic desert.Jake Gyllenhaal gives an excellent performance as Anthony Swofford complemented by the able talents of Jamie Foxx and Peter Sarsgaard.The film's only real flaw is that like the war on which it was based it's pretty slow and not a lot really happens.In the strictest sense I would have a hard time even classifying this as a war film and it's certainly not a deliberately political film.But in its own way it tells an intense personal story. Beyond that you're simply left to make your own judgments.710".

Following the screening was an audience QA with the author and main character Tony Swofford.And it was no surprise that the very first question from the audience was quite ambiguously Do you support the military? When Swofford dismissed the question as too broad and complex to be answered with a simple yes or no the inquirer followed up with Well do you support the war? Swofford dismissed this even more readily.To me this was perfectly representative of how the film handled its potential political implications.As Troy says early on in the film To hell with politics. We're here now. And that's essentially how the movie went. It bypasses the soapbox and simply tells you how it was from the perspective of a single soldier. And while the opening boot camp scenes may seem like Full Metal Jacket Lite the rest of the film is truly unique.Sam Mendes directs with his usual brilliance showing once again his affinity for bright vivid color even in the largely monochromatic desert.Jake Gyllenhaal gives an excellent performance as Anthony Swofford complemented by the able talents of Jamie Foxx and Peter Sarsgaard.The film's only real flaw is that like the war on which it was based it's pretty slow and not a lot really happens.In the strictest sense I would have a hard time even classifying this as a war film and it's certainly not a deliberately political film.But in its own way it tells an intense personal story. Beyond that you're simply left to make your own judgments.710";

	schema:headline " Bold and Brilliant Melancholy";
	schema:reviewBody "JARHEAD is the third in a string of successful films by Sam Mendes first wowing audiences with American BEAUTY and then continuing our admiration with ROAD TO PERDITION. With JARHEAD Mendes solidifies himself as one of the most extraordinary filmmakers working today.The first thing that may surprise audiences is that this is not necessarily an antiwar piece. Mendes and screenwriter William Broyles Jr. have been careful not to make this film narrow in view. Instead by focusing on the psychological turmoil of one soldier Anthony Swofford Jake Gyllenhaal JARHEAD is able to speak specifically about this man's experience and how it relates to those around him.Mendes drenches the screen with sights and sounds that literally envelope us in the horrors of warfare. These explosions of vision and noise are counterbalanced however with scenes of great sadness and warmth. One scene that comes quickly to mind is a boot camp drill where the young soldiers are crawling under barbed wirethe sound design is such that we hear every character screaming or grunting as the gunshots zoom overhead. But then the scene changes. An event occurs that allows Mendes to silence all of the violence and machismo of war. Amongst the hysteria of the scene one of the soldiers freaks out and a gunshot is discharged. Mendes lets the camera witness this as if it hadn't expected it to occur. The characters are in shock and so is the audience. It's just one of many powerful moments where Mendes changes from loud visceral warfare to quiet poignant moments.Not that there's much warfare here. In fact the lack of warfare becomes a theme for this film. Peter Sarsgaard in a great performance reaches his breaking point during the final third of the film and it's a riveting moment where the lack of warfare has finally made him explode. His performance is very strong throughout but it is not until the second half of the film when he finally gets the chance to break loose. Don't mistake the first half of his performance as simply being onscreen... charisma that palpable doesn't happen by accident. It is because he uses his scenes and lines wisely in the first half that we end up so engrossed and fascinated by him in the second. A true supporting performance. Oscar nomination hopefully on the way.Jamie Foxx surprised me here and not because I didn't think he was a fine actor. Obviously he is. But his character is so wellconceived and works wonderfully as the counterpoint to the Gyllenhaal character. Foxx plays his scenes confidently but also with touches of gravitas that even in RAY we haven't seen before. The scene that we get a glimpse of at the end of the trailer is wonderful in its fullness and helps Mendes' film give us a wellrounded opinion of Swofford's opinions on the war. Foxx is by turns hilarious and profound.And then there was Jake Gyllenhaal. Wow. This is an incredible performance. Watch for a dozen scenes where he literally explodes off the screen but how he also juggles the quieter moments with great aplomb. What makes Swofford an intriguing character is that he doesn't always get our sympathy or for that matter want our sympathy. He is scarred by war and his family and the life he left behind and he is just looking for a way to get out of the sand and the sexual dysfunction of war and the lack of gunfire. Gyllenhaal captivates our attention from his very first glimpse and his voiceover performance laces the film with irony and melancholy. He is a great physical presence in the film as well. I could cite more than a few dynamic scenes that he performs masterfully in but I'll just mention one. Swofford points a rifle at a fellow soldier after a failed night watch and then turns the rifle on himself asking the fellow soldier to discard a round into his mouth. It's an indescribably painful scene to watch but it's also an example of Gyllenhaal's brave and honest portrayal of this bruised man.Some people have begun to write about this film as lacking structure or story and in saying that I'm afraid they may have missed the point. This is a story about ambiguity of self about dislocation about ambivalence to war and love about sexual frustration. In these terms I think Mendes  Co. have found the perfect way to cinematically allow us to experience the same sort of blank complexity that Swofford must have felt. And that's why I find this a remarkable adaptation of a memoir that I admire deeply.I could go on and list scene after scene that make this a memorable film but I'll let you experience it yourself and decide for yourself. In summation JARHEAD is a viscerally unforgiving psychologically heartbreaking masterpiece.I don't know that this is an Academy film but it is certain to garner nominations. I would nominate it as Picture Director Mendes Adapted Screenplay Broyles Jr. Actor Gyllenhaal Supporting Actor Foxx Supporting Actor Sarsgaard Editing Score Cinematography Sound.".

A movie which portrays the Marine grunt for what he is... certainly no angel but the absolute backbone of American military toughness. The barracks and field life portrayed in this movie is perhaps the most accurate portrait Hollywood has produced.With only a few realtively minor technical inaccuracies this is a movie whose full richness can probably only be experienced by those who were in the Corps at that time. And for that degree of accuracy I am grateful to the author and those who produced the film. Too often producers and directors overlook the details that make a military film credible to veterans  such as the details of the uniform the sounds and function of weapons the behavior of the characters. Not so in Jarhead. And the dialogue was right on.Having read several of the other comments it is clear to me that there are events depicted in the movie which may not be clearly understood or properly contextualized by someone who has not served in the Marine Corps infantry. Do not let that stop you from seeing the film  it is an excellent view into a world most people will never see. I left the theater feeling proud of my service and although I miss the daily life of an active duty Marine Jarhead left me feeling strangely happy to be able to look back on it  and to sleep in my own home my own bed tonight.

We're here now. Such is the fidelity of a roughhewn few who are ready to fight when called upon. Grunts really don't expect most people to love us or understand us but we hope there are some folks out there who might appreciate the fact that we are there.

And the longer you wait the more stircrazy you become within your own mind.The acting is superb and the cinematography is stellar. It's an antiwar film without being distinctly liberal about it. It's a true story and for the most part Mendes tells it like it is. So you can make your own judgment about it. But based off what you see and all that happens you have no choice but see the absurdity not only in war but perhaps in some of the USMC's tactics as well.

His best friend who suffered with him through the combat that never came dies as a civilian possibly a suicide as he was thrown out of the Corps with a dishonorable discharge. Subdued and solitary I waited outside the theater for my wife. So what did you think? I asked her when she came out. Definitely not a John Wayne movie she said. No I responded reminded of Clint Eastwood sharing a victory cigar with a young Marine beneath an American flag raised atop a hill in Grenada in Heartbreak Ridge. It wasn't as dark as the book I said. In the book she replied you couldn't see Swofford's smile. Jake Gyllenhaal does display an engaging youthful grin in the early part of the movie. He plays the twentyyearold Swoff very well. And Jamie Foxx does Sgt. Sykes brilliantly. Against the backdrop of a night made at once hellish and spectacular by blazing oil wells the Sergeant tells Swoff that he Sykes could have joined his brother and had a nice safe job stateside but with no chance to see such sights as this. I love this job he says. I thank God for every day he gives me in the Corps. Oorah... You know what I mean Swoff? Foxx's delivery is flat point blank neither sarcastic nor enthusiastic. He is an exhausted soldier giving himself a pep talk he scarcely believes in any longer. Get out your Oscar Nomination forms.At dinner we tried to recall what was book and what was movie. I did not remember the scene in which the soldiers are interviewed by a TV journalist from the book but from Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. From Full Metal Jacket also I believe came the bizarre business of a soldier's sardonically making a corpse his buddy. The warissurrealhell moral of the movie reminded me of Coppola's Apocalypse Now  a film the young jarheads watch with sexual intensity in Mendez's movie. But the scene in which the soldiers sit down to enjoy a home movie one Marine's wife has made  of herself being humped by their next door neighbor  that we all agreed was in the book. I remember when Battle Cry came out in 1955. Unlike the BoyScoutclean soldiers of most WW II movies of that era these Marines said Hell and Damn. And one of them actually shot the finger at some troops riding past  What a shocker! A Jacksonville NC Daily News reporter interviewed several Marines from the local base who saw the movie. ExcerptTheir reviews seemed to be positive especially concerning the portrayal of the relationship between Marines and how deployments and war are mostly about sitting around and waiting.I thought it was good said Lance Cpl. Richard Usher 19 from Tampa Fla. From what I know it's accurate. They did say 'Oorah' way too much. Lance Cpl. Josh Rader 29 of Georgia said he thought the movie was one of the more accurate portrayals of the Marine Corps with the only more accurate movie being Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. A lot of the training they dramatize it more Rader said. I'd say it's probably more accurate. Lance Cpl. Adam Blades 20 with 1st Battalion 2nd Marines agreed but took exception to the actors' ages. The actors were a little old he said. The majority of guys going over there are like 18 and 19. But it was pretty cool. As accurate as I've seen. ".

Sam Mendes' superb adaptation of Anthony Swofford's novel is the best and most artistically astute gruntseyeview of modern warfare since Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. Mendes successfully does for Desert Storm what Kubrick did for Vietnam.We are provided here with a full array of the varied types of men the bored those looking for a way out the slightly crazy thrilled at the chance to blow things up and kill people those with some vague sense of the honor serving one's country has brought to generations past who go to war and how in the end All wars are different but all wars are the same. Expertly displayed here is the utter futility of our modern wars in the Middle East. Most of the film's runtime is dedicated to the boredom the Marines experience as they train endlessly in the desert to fight some distant enemy that never really shows his face. The war is quick and the men are sent home without ever firing a shot at the enemy yet as it is so beautifully noted We are still in the desert and men and women are still being sent to fight a war for what....oil? Oh and the oil is beautifully on display here lit up at night across the desert sands and raining down on soldiers and corpses alike with wanton abandon. Cinematographer Roger Deakins takes over nicely for the late Conrad Hall as Sam Mendes cohort in capturing jawdroppingly beautiful cinematic compositions and painting them on the big screen.Some have complained that Jarhead lacks an emotional core but I dare you to find more emotional scenes than Jake Gyllenhaal coughing up a mountain of sand in a frenzied nightmare Peter Sarsgaard cowering in the tower in the midst of a psychological breakdown after not being allowed to take the sniper shot he has been training endlessly to take or one of the final scenes where a nameless Vietnam vet hops aboard the bus as the Marines come home to cheers and a parade in a sad and haunted attempt to experience the hero's welcome he never received for his war.All war movies are not the same and this one is a bitter cut above the rest.".

The Marines are cheering wildly and the killing. They couldn't be happier that the natives are being fried. That's what's supposed to happen to the enemy.They missed the whole ironic point of the scene of course. The world is simply not a Biblical one of clear good and evil. But if they missed the point it's not simply because a lack of sophistication and a desire to destroy is part of their adolescent nature but because they now belong to a system that reinforces that view.I think I kind of missed the point of THIS movie myself. I'm not sure why it was made because it doesn't tell us much that's very new. The scenes in boot camp I'm absolutely certain were vital to the development of Swofford's character and those of his colleagues but it's not very new. We've seen it before in movies like Full Metal Jacket. Not that it's filled with clichs  the bragging Texan the Brooklyn wise guy. Those are absent. It's just that there's nothing much to replace them. A football game that must be played in heavy chemical suits in 110degree heat for the TV cameras looks sounds and probably is real enough at least until the Jarheads start ripping off all their clothes while the cameras roll. Other incidents like a truck full of parachute flares that explodes accidentally on Christmas Eve are a little weak in credibility although okay maybe it did happen.The film shows us that the Marines are bored to distraction while waiting to be deployed in a combat area. There is an interesting description of how latrine waste is dealt with. But it's a little more disgusting than it is funny. The antics of the bored aren't very funny to a mature audience either. And there's very little drama.Jake Gyllenhaal I don't find to be a very appealing actor although I haven't seen him in anything else. Peter Skarsgaard is fine and so is the staff sergeant.Chris Cooper as a cheerleading officer is GENUINELY funny because he's not trying to be. He asks his troops something like What do we do with the enemy? Kill 'em! I must be going' deaf because I can't HEAR you! KILL 'EM! Eww now I got a real erection. The movie needed more scenes like this. The first time most of us probably heard that routine  I can't hear you!  was either in second grade or at a summer camp in the Poconos. And here are these bemuscled Behemoths eagerly playing the same game so steeped in a subculture that promotes blowing heads off and producing the pink mist that they don't realize the reptilian level at which their brains operate.That's not to demean the Marine Corps. We need a Marine Corps and in order to do the job they may have to do they must be trained to do that job without hesitation in the unswerving belief that it is the right thing to do the Biblical thing to do. And they're not retards or dummies who are easily brainwashed either. I taught at Camp Lejeune for a few years and was never disappointed in their cognitive abilities.The problem isn't with the Marine Corps or with the young people who buy into the organization's values but with a larger and deeper system that makes the Marine Corps and its members necessary. It's a system rooted in human nature that knows no national boundaries and doesn't recognize uniforms.But that raises Big Questions that a movie like this of essentially ethnographic ambition isn't designed to deal with. The spirit of Camus hovering overhead notwithstanding the movie is careful to avoid controversial considerations. Skarsgaard says  politics. We're here and that's that. What we get out of this movie is a picture of daytoday life as it was for Swofford. And the photography is splendid. Otherwise it left me a little unfulfilled.".

	schema:headline " Distortion and Disappointment";
	schema:reviewBody "Having served three years in the Marine Corps as an enlisted man two in Vietnam with an infantry company in combat I found the film to be a major distortion of the Corps. The film generally sets out the Corps as a unit that has no direction and their officers and staff NCO's are idiots i.e the Bn Commander acting like a rock star during his speech to the troops in the tent. I assure you this simply not the case. I spent 27 months in Vietnam and never saw anyone in that type of setting that conducted themselves anything other than serious and professional. As aside during my time in Nam I had six Bn commanders so I know from experience these facts.In addition the film suggests that the Corps operates with poor equipment and again I assure the reader the equipment may not be the latest such as the Army enjoys but it always operational notwithstanding normal wear and tear issues. A great example is the battery problem shown in the film. Being a 2531 field radio operator I take exception to that scene in the film. No properly trained radio operator ever goes into the field without two batteries both of which are checked for charging prior to leaving a rear area. This is only one of numerous such operational distortions in this movie which leaves the viewer wondering about the professionalism of the Corps.Being somewhat of a film buff I found the entire film to be fragmented poorly edited poorly filmed  almost surreal and without any direction to guide the viewer. Finally the acting was shallow at best including I am sadden to say Mr. Fox's performance. Comparing this film to Full Metal Jacket which I found to be factual and well executed is like comparing a college freshman film director's work to one of the greats like Houston.This film served no one not the viewing public not the actors and other technicans who worked on the film and most certainly not the Marine Corps. Honest critical thinking about war and the military presented in a film is always welcomed by an informed society but historical distortion pretending to be art is simply that a pretender.".

	onyx:emotionText "Having served three years in the Marine Corps as an enlisted man two in Vietnam with an infantry company in combat I found the film to be a major distortion of the Corps. The film generally sets out the Corps as a unit that has no direction and their officers and staff NCO's are idiots i.e the Bn Commander acting like a rock star during his speech to the troops in the tent. I assure you this simply not the case. I spent 27 months in Vietnam and never saw anyone in that type of setting that conducted themselves anything other than serious and professional. As aside during my time in Nam I had six Bn commanders so I know from experience these facts.In addition the film suggests that the Corps operates with poor equipment and again I assure the reader the equipment may not be the latest such as the Army enjoys but it always operational notwithstanding normal wear and tear issues. A great example is the battery problem shown in the film. Being a 2531 field radio operator I take exception to that scene in the film. No properly trained radio operator ever goes into the field without two batteries both of which are checked for charging prior to leaving a rear area. This is only one of numerous such operational distortions in this movie which leaves the viewer wondering about the professionalism of the Corps.Being somewhat of a film buff I found the entire film to be fragmented poorly edited poorly filmed  almost surreal and without any direction to guide the viewer.

	schema:headline " A Powerful Statement on the Psyche of the Warrior";
	schema:reviewBody "A man fires a rifle for many years and he goes to war. And afterward he turns the rifle in at the armory and he believes he's finished with the rifle. But no matter what else he might do with his hands love a woman build a house change his son's diaper his hands remember the rifle. This is the essence of Jarhead. Its not about peace its not about war. Its not about governments Iraq or morality. Its about the people those who are bred and trained to kill someone and the ramifications of that instruction.Make no mistake about it a human does not inherently want to kill. Studies have shown that there is an impulse that makes a person hesitate before killing another whether this is nature or nurture is another argument. All armies understand this the way they take a civilian and turn them into a soldier is by beating and sweating it out of their recruits until they are a welloiled machine. But what happens to these men when this part of their being is torn from their bodies? As Swofford played subtly but sublimely by Jake Gyllenhaal goes from boot camp to sniper school to Iraq and then home again we see thousands of images of destruction and the loss of innocence as these men are bred to kill. Swoffs family wrecked by his fathers ruined psyche incurred from Vietnam. Swoff hit by his drill sergeant for uttering an independent and antiauthoritarian thought. Swoff laying in the mud as Staff Sgt. Sykes Jaime Foxx chews out a dead man who while training with live fire could not control his urge to run and as a result got killed. Swoff and the marines cheering on the Valkyries of Apocalypse Now. Swoff almost killing a friend because the poor guy messed up.Marines the Jarheads that is don't see this as bad. When Swoff is transferred and stumbles upon a man being branded he believes that he too is to be branded. Troy played by Peter Sarsgaard tells him not to worry to be a part of this glorious tradition he has to earn it.And Swoff laps it all up. Hes hooked. He wants to see the Pink Mist the splatter of brains when the sniper hits his mark.Sam Mendes director of American Beauty and Road to Perdition lays it on a bit thick at parts but its necessary to the point being made. Endless seas of sand reflect the boredom of the soldiers as they await their orders. A horse walking through a burning oil field covered in petroleum sees Swofford and the two become one. White and nonwhite soldiers channel their will to fight through a scorpion fight. And in the end it all breaks down when they finally see some action just as the war is ending.Why does Troy break down in the end? Why when the responsibility of picking off an Iraqi official is taken away from him does he attack his commanding officer? He won't even take the shot thats Swoffs job. And yet Troy breaks down and weeps. Because the one thing in life that he is good at the one thing that he has been training himself for and desires has been taken away from him. He has it in his grasp and it is taken away by the very people who taught him to do it.And what about Sykes? Hes not the typical superior officer hes not R.Lee Ermeys nearpsychotic Drill Instructor even though he humiliates Swoff for trying out for bugling again to show contempt for the nonmarine the innocent nor is he a strict fatherfigure in the vein of Lee Marvins Major Reisman although he does give good instruction and even speaks to Swoff mantoman on one occasion. But what does he say? He could have a house a car a job with a great income sleep with his wife every night and time with his kids. So why is he here? Because I love this job he says. I thank God for every expletive deleted day he gives me in the corps. Hoorah. This is both a parody of militaristic bravado by Sykess character and also an affirmation that he could not leave his job killing people even if given the choice.So what is it about this film that sticks out to me? The imagery is powerful from the burning oil fields to the magic walls that open and close as they reveal pieces or broken fragments more likely of home. The character development is also powerful fully crafting over a dozen multidimensional marines some for and some against the war in a time when other films barely make one memorable character. But in the end its the lack of answers. These men ask powerful questions  who runs the country what am I fighting for what are we going to do  not just of themselves or the situation or the audience but of the soldiers life overall. Beginning with conception going through the boredom and terror of war and ending when they return home fulfilled and unfulfilled at the same time.But even the end will not be the end for these Jarheads. After the war ends Swoff and the men go home to find themselves in a parade. This is the joyous front where people celebrate the warrior for a job welldone. Then they are faced with the dark half when a Vietnam vet jumps on their bus and salutes them. They are faced not with an option but a mirror. This man  this sweaty torn and pathetic man  cant escape Vietnam even twenty years later even when the country and his countrymen have forgotten him. And this is their future  Swoff Sykes and even Troy despite getting branded and thus accepted  without option. Their hands will always remember the rifle.".

	schema:headline " 'Jarhead'The real 'suck'";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1987 Time magazine ran an infamous cover that consisted of a marine in his dress blue uniformwith a blackened eye upon his face. The cover was intended to depict the shame befallen the marines after the Clayton Lonetree spy scandal and it was met with outragehow dare Time suckerpunch the entire Marine Corps because of the crimes of just one of its members? Yet after seeing the movie Jarhead Anthony Swofford's autobiographical account of the marines during the first Gulf War a black eye is the least of the marines' problems.The fundamental theme of Jarhead's portrayal of marine life is that heroes do not exist. One cannot depict the Marine Corps accurately without noting that at least some of its members perform feats of strength endurance and bravery and that to build an entire institution of such men certain virtues are required. Yet like Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket a movie acclaimed for its supposed depiction of Viet Namera marines none of these men and certainly none of these virtues are to be found.Instead what one finds in Jarhead are empty men who drift though life denied of what they truly want and who choose to make up for it in emotional outbursts and sadistic and debased pleasures. Again and again this is what Hollywood sees when it looks at the marines.Yet as far as I can tell there's no massive backlash by marines against this moviein fact I'm amazed at the positive reaction many marines have had. Are these marines so starved for heroesso hungered for a portrait of their lives in uniform that they will find merit with those who portray the character of their commitment as utterly bereft of meaning or purpose simply because the actors put on a marine blouse or use a jargon that rings familiar? I served five years in the Marine Corps during the time Jarhead was set and I can certainly recount stories both humorous and horrific. But overall if I had to characterize my and my fellow marines' service it would be the honorable commitment to the betterment of one's self and the defense of the American nation. The men I worked with might not have talked about it everyday. There might have been the occasional breach of conduct or character and some may have even failed miserably in achieving the standard of excellence that is the hallmark of the corps.Yet overalland in the metaphysically significant sensethe only sense that matters in art almost every marine I knew was in the corps for a purpose and that purpose was good noble and just.That's why I for one was proud to wear the marine uniform and that's what no Hollywood movie that I know of has ever been able to accurately capture in a film about the marines. Given the freedoms the marines have fought so valiantly over their history to preserve it's a tragedy they haven't received better from Hollywood in return.".

	schema:reviewBody "What an awful movie. I was so surprised to see IMDbvisitors rated it 7.3 average! Yeah yeah I know I am not ye' movie critic but I do believe I have somewhat of an opinion when it comes to movies. In fact I consult IMDb rather often before renting or buying a new DVD and I must say that with very few exceptions I always agree with the IMDbrating of a movie of whatever kind by the way. Having heard a lot about Jarhead and IMDb's rating from 6 and up the movies are mostly good  real good I saw Jarhead yesterday and I was very disappointed. Sam Mendes is a good director and I was left in awe. SO bad! The acting was far below anything I have ever seen. There's a bunch of Bmovies with better acting. Jokes were not at all funny drama was pathetic tension what tension? Realistic? All a bunch of crap. The storyline wasn't that bad but it died in bad acting useless scenes what was that about his horse?  covered in oil ah how sad ... and then?. The burnt bodies lying around the dead of Troy was that Troy by the way?  who cares? his girlfriend who left him the idiotic socalled climax when they bomb that base on the end. I am sorry but I have no idea why you dudes and dudettes rated this movie so highly. Maybe I didn't understand? Was it all a satire on some movie I haven't seen? Was it supposed to be sad shocking cult? There was absolutely nothing in this film that caught my attention except for the fact that I was bored throughout the whole thing. Could someone please explain me why heshe thinks this movie deserves a 7.3 avg? Not for a moment Jarhead was interesting no please don't give me the that'sexactlywhatitwasaboutcrap  to film boredom one must not bore the viewer with bad acting bad jokes and emphasizing so much on the lack of sexual relationships. Das Boot didn't need all that. And THAT'S a movie worth 9 outta 10! Anyway sorry I saw it. But even more sorry for the fact that 'the people who are supposed to know' rated it that high. Guess I'll take IMDb's ratings not so close to heart anymore.".

	schema:headline " Jarhead Brings Gulf War Home";
	schema:reviewBody "I remember the Gulf War all too well. It was my own initial experience with a television war those who are older doubtless remember that the Viet Nam war was the very first of those and I was terrified of the repercussions even as I couldn't look away from the antiaircraft tracers lighting up my TV screen.Jarhead as many people know is a slang term for a US Marine. One of those newly minted jarheads is Anthony Swofford Jake Gyllenhaal who largely to even his own surprise finds himself enduring the rigors of basic training and then still more brutal training for his assigned specialty. Swoff tells one drill sergeant that he's in the Marines only because he took a wrong turn on the way to college. His explanation doesn't go over well. Later he does everything he can think of to drum himself out of the Corps.Eventually between the friendship and support of his partner Allen Troy Peter Sarsgaard and the tough example set by his commander Staff Sergeant Sykes Jamie Foxx Swoff becomes very very good at his new job a scout sniper. Needless to say when the news breaks that Saddam Hussein has invaded Kuwait Swoff's group is one of the first to be sent overseas.The troops are welcomed to the desert by Lt.

But despite the brevity of Swoff's experience his own fighting war lasts only a little over four days he and everyone else is changed by their experiences and not all of those changes are easy to live with.Jarhead gives us the firsthand experience of one soldier in the Gulf War with all of the attendant good and bad moments. As such it's fascinating in and of itself. But director Sam Mendes has added dramatically to the story with some truly brilliant edits some creatively managed flashbacks and some astounding settings the burning oil wells are bizarrely heart breaking even as the depiction on screen is awesome the destruction wreaked by American bombs is graphic and moving. Of course the fact that the film is based on a book written by the real Anthony Swofford about his own experiences in the Gulf War means that even Hollywood effects can't take away from the back of our minds that much of what we see is real or at least was.Jake Gyllenhaal has become a very good actor indeed and holds his own with Oscarwinner Jamie Foxx whose performance could very well garner him another awards season nod for his supporting role. Peter Sarsgaard is also just terrific. The rest of the supporting cast  who have far more limited roles  is also good. In fact the one real criticism I have about the film is that I would have liked to have known more about each of the men who served so honorably and who were so altered by that experience.Jarhead isn't a war movie per se in the sense that it shows a lot of shoot 'em up action. But it may be one of the few war movies that actually conveys graphically the sheer boredom and hurryupandwait that is the reality for many soldiers. And that the men perform so well despite the emotional obstacles of where they are and what they might have to do and that they're a cohesive group when it counts no matter the flaws of each or any of them is unquestionably honored here. I recommend Jarhead for virtually everybody.POLITICAL NOTES The comparison between the Gulf War and the current conflict in Iraq is inevitable particularly as some continue to believe that Saddam Hussein should have been deposed in that war rather than as a part and parcel of the current and ongoing War on Terror. But the very real difference between the two is that in the first Americans were viewed as the liberators of Kuwait. In the latter some countries look at Americans as the despots who overthrew a sovereign nation. While perception doesn't win or lose battles it does make the difference between victory and defeat in the court of public opinion.Obviously it's tempting to call that opinion inconsequential. But the reality of it is that such opinion can shape alliances trade and more for years to come thus making mere perceptions important to everything from national security to economic health. Regardless however Jarhead does serve one important function and that's to humanize our fighting men and to reinforce the fact that they are fighting for our country and for freedom. Whatever your opinion on anything else I'd hope you'd remember at least that much.FAMILY SUITABILITY Jarhead is rated R for pervasive language some violent images and strong sexual content. Parents should be aware that the R rating is entirely warranted. But with that caveat I'd recommend Jarhead for mature audiences who are interested in current events the military or just plain good moviemaking.".

	onyx:emotionText "I remember the Gulf War all too well. It was my own initial experience with a television war those who are older doubtless remember that the Viet Nam war was the very first of those and I was terrified of the repercussions even as I couldn't look away from the antiaircraft tracers lighting up my TV screen.Jarhead as many people know is a slang term for a US Marine. One of those newly minted jarheads is Anthony Swofford Jake Gyllenhaal who largely to even his own surprise finds himself enduring the rigors of basic training and then still more brutal training for his assigned specialty. Swoff tells one drill sergeant that he's in the Marines only because he took a wrong turn on the way to college. His explanation doesn't go over well. Later he does everything he can think of to drum himself out of the Corps.Eventually between the friendship and support of his partner Allen Troy Peter Sarsgaard and the tough example set by his commander Staff Sergeant Sykes Jamie Foxx Swoff becomes very very good at his new job a scout sniper. Needless to say when the news breaks that Saddam Hussein has invaded Kuwait Swoff's group is one of the first to be sent overseas.The troops are welcomed to the desert by Lt. Col Kazinski Chris Cooper who commands a large segment of the Marines deployed there and who tells them they must maintain constant vigilance and be ready to fight at a moment's notice. But months go by with nothing to do but drills and more drills and the boredom anxiety heat and desolation of their circumstances begin to wear.

I like Jamie Fox in The Kingdom which is a much better film. Jake Gyllenhaal was brilliant in Zodiac and End of Watch. I don't know if I've seen a film that spent so much of it's dialog on cursing as this movie does. As the story progresses you really feel the movie start to drag a bit and wonder if anything is actually going to ever happen. In the end this Marine unit misses the war and there is no fighting or shooting at all. Then to wrap up the movie is a retarded party seen with everyone drinking around bonfires and shooting their guns in the end. The only real saving grace of this film is Lucas Black's character and Peter Sarsgaard to some extent. There are so many much better warmilitary films then this including the above mentioned The Kingdom and Green Zone if you like Middle East zones. I must also say that if this is how Marines typically act and are organized they certainly aren't the well oiled machine I thought they were supposed to be.".

It was highly disappointing all the buildup and hell of training and they do not get to use their skills. There are also random scenes throughout such as a horse covered in oil and I was very annoyed when Gylenhall and Saarsgard are told not to take the shot and an air strike is called instead.

His lover Alla is aware of his family life but gets offended when for example he cannot meet her so that he doesn't come home late or when he doesn't want to go home in a new jacket she gives him to avoid having to explain to his wife. Alla and Nina Andrei's wife both leave him forgive him and return to him at the same time and Andrei continues with this kind of life full of suffering and deceit.

	schema:reviewBody "As a student of Russian language and culture one of my biggest pet peeves is the way people who lived during the Cold War talk about the Russian people and about Russian society. Most people have terrible misconceptions about Russian Society. One of the most interesting epochs of Soviet History is the Brezhnev Era. Some of Russia's most celebrated dramedies such as Rjazanov's The Irony of Fate were coming out at this time. If you want to get a small taste of what Russian Society was like although it is impossible to fully understand what you don't live through this is one of the best films you can find. In addition it's quite witty and even belly laugh funny at times Andrei's neighbor and the Danish professor go mushroom picking. If you enjoy films which perhaps don't focus on plot but rather conduct deep character analyzes by portraying a series of events and their effect on the characters then this is the film for you. It is actually slightly reminiscent of American comedies by Wes Anderson and Alexander Payne. ABSOL'JUTNO STOIT VAM SMOTRET' I KAK MOZHNO BYSTREE!!! NU CHTO ZH SIDITETO.. BEGOM!".

By the way Georgi is the name like George. There is a rumor that heroes of his movies have latency homosexual complex but it is just a joke. But who knows? The film is pure genius. This is the story about soviet intellectual not an average soviet man from Brezhnev's era English to Russian interpreter who read some lectures in some university. He live in a big apartment with many rooms  it is very unusual situation in Soviet Union for family with one child the hero have one daughter. This is the symbol of privileged position for brain workers in Sovet Union society. But his work is silly and insignificant. He is in trouble with his slinky mistress genius actress Marina Neelova smart and understanding wife also genius Natalya Gundareva RIP colleagues and so on. The problems are snowball running and his life is start to decline. This is not a comedy  this is a sad story that may be associated with brothers' Cohen movie Fargo or something like that. The quality of actors play is brilliant and absolutely realistic. I strongly recommended another Danelia astonishing film called KinDzaDza strange adventures of midaged soviet foreman and his accidental fellow young Moscow student on another planet kinda postapocaliptic totalitaristic Mad Max style world  the strong satire on all human civilization".

	schema:reviewBody "Not long ago I enjoyed Afonya a previous film by director Georgiy Daneliya and I couldn't help but notice that Autumn Marathon works by performing a similar trick in a very different way it takes for its main character a man who should be considered quite bad by all measures of reason but makes us like him and sympathize with him for the situations he's clearly responsible for getting himself into. But here it's not from indifferent charm that we feel for him but as a embodiment of a very human quality of wanting to satisfy those who ask things of us. He's having an affair and can make neither his wife nor his lover happy because he wants to please them both  but that's only a part of a nonstop torment he causes himself including taking on translation work he doesn't have time for to help his boss then not finishing it because he was helping a colleague who end up taking his commissions. It's a fine tragic flaw in that it's easy for anyone to find some sympathy even if they are not personally a twotimer. The titles call it a sad comedy and that's an appropriate phrase  it borrows the structure and design of a comedy without having to worry about being funny every moment. So it satisfies in many of the same ways and with a cast of good supporting characters often is quite funny.The wellorchestrated ending is great and almost existential  and appropriately simultaneously the funniest and saddest part.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a subjective concept 'goodness' is interpreted in various forms. However it can be easily assessed if it is seen through the prism of 'actions' performed by people. Russian film Osenniy Marafon Autumn Marathon is a tragicomic tale wherein the concept of 'goodness' abounds through the portrayal of an EnglishRussian translator who would help anybody in need. His weakness is that he doesn't know how to refuse anybody who has come to seek help. However there is more trouble in store for him due to his tendency to intentionally utter numerous false statements to both family members and colleagues. Russian director Georgi Danelia put himself in a creative quandary by making a film about a man who has too many negative qualities despite having a charming outer appearance. This is one reason why authorities who worked for the promotion of Russian cinema were reluctant to promote this film as it chose to depict a philandering liar who would cause immense grief to both his mistress as well as wife. Although the film's theme might appear a little outdated to contemporary viewers but it was an immense success during its release in late 1970s. This brings us to question why there was tremendous opposition to this film in official circles as adultery has always remained a recurring theme in Russian literature. It is not a secret that many duels were fought with loss of lives over extra marital affairs. Lastly Russian actors namely Oleg Bassilashvili Natalya Gundareva and Marina Neyolova are credible in their respective roles as husband wife and mistress who suffer immensely as a web of lies is woven around their erratic lives.".

As an English to Russian translator Andrey is not responsible for the creative material. He merely translates what others have already written. This along with his inability to say no to his boss' requests portrays him as a weak man incapable of managing his own life. Additionally Andrey is an educated man living in a rather large apartment for the times yet his life appears to be going nowhere. This only further solidifies idea of him being an inferior man. Similar to his job his wife hardly notices him. Because of this Andrey has found a mistress. With all of these people in his life the main character struggles to please everybody. This film classified as a dramacomedy is great as it shows life in Leningrad during the Soviet Era. The man is a part of the intelligentsia the educated middle class. Additionally cultural references are present throughout the film and includes such items as mushroom picking and communal living.".

	schema:headline " A sad comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "This film takes a while to get going but once it does it's a pretty good film. I strongly recommend it to those who'd like to see how ordinary people lived in the USSR in the early 80s.The film takes place in Leningrad now St. Petersburg which is Russia's second largest city after Moscow. The cinematographer is this film is a very good one and there are a lot of great compositional shots... I'd say that the cinematography in this film seems more western than a lot of other Russian films. The editing work and script by contrast is not always so good especially in the beginning of the film for the first 12 hour I didn't even know who the main character was!. The actors are all very believable though and by the end of the film I pretty much understood everything that I was so confused about at first.This film isn't a traditional comedy it's more of a sad morality tale told with some humour to keep it from becoming depressing. If you liked Moscow Does not Believe in Tears you may like this movie as well. Interesting to note is that the director was female EDIT Sorry folks he's male. I assumed that the director was Russian in which case a last name ending with a would signify a female.Overall I'd give it a 710. Westerners may want to watch this if they want to see a typical Soviet movie from the last half of the century. Most critics only notice the more avant garde movies of Soviet cinema like Andrei Rublev or Battleship Potemkin and that becomes people's impression of what Russian movies are like. This is for those who want to see a simple movie about a man's life that can be pretty much universal anywhere there is no overthetop patriotism or strangeness in this film and it's a good film regardless. BTW the Russian voices are better than the English voiceovers.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film takes a while to get going but once it does it's a pretty good film. I strongly recommend it to those who'd like to see how ordinary people lived in the USSR in the early 80s.The film takes place in Leningrad now St. Petersburg which is Russia's second largest city after Moscow. The cinematographer is this film is a very good one and there are a lot of great compositional shots... I'd say that the cinematography in this film seems more western than a lot of other Russian films. The editing work and script by contrast is not always so good especially in the beginning of the film for the first 12 hour I didn't even know who the main character was!. The actors are all very believable though and by the end of the film I pretty much understood everything that I was so confused about at first.This film isn't a traditional comedy it's more of a sad morality tale told with some humour to keep it from becoming depressing. If you liked Moscow Does not Believe in Tears you may like this movie as well. Interesting to note is that the director was female EDIT Sorry folks he's male. I assumed that the director was Russian in which case a last name ending with a would signify a female.Overall I'd give it a 710.

Professor Andrey Pavlovich Buzykin is manipulated by everyone around him especially the women in his life. His mistress Alla is constantly pestering him about having children with her and leaving his wife Nina. Nina is clearly wellaware that her husband is lying to her and most likely cheating so she manipulates Andrey into feeling sorry for her by moping around the house and saying that no one needs her. His fellow writer Varvara uses him and adds to his web of lies as he helps her translate which will cause her to take his place with the publishers. Basically the whole film is sometimes painful to watch because Andrey's lies to his wife and mistress become more complicated with each scene. At the end he seems to be peaceful when both women finally leave him but at practically the same moment his mistress calls and his wife comes back home. In the final scene of this dizzying chaos Andrey hasn't learned his lesson and lies to his mistress that his wife has left and lies to his wife that he left his mistress. In my Russian Film class we discussed how Andrey really isn't that bad of a guy and just wants to please everyone but as a grown man he should know better. Throughout the film it is clear that his lies hurt everyone around him and make his current life almost impossible to keep up with. I wish the film would have ended with him starting anew but alas this ending is much more in line with the reality that the older we get the less likely we are to change.".

If you ever get a chance to see it don't miss it because it's unique.";

The story is very well developed with hilarious situations and Vittorio Gassman has a magnificent performance in the role of the the antihero Brancaleone.

Unlike the Monty Python film however this one never deviates from the story line and the actors never break character. It is also not quite as fully anarchic as the Python film.  There is in fact a very touching death scene near the end of the film.  Superbly paced it seemed to me that there were no weak spots or comedic lulls.  The poorlytranslated English subtitles on my DVD were often very funny in their own right unintentionally I'm sure.  But even though I don't understand Italian and missed some of the linguistic humor mentioned here I still got a great deal of enjoyment out of it.  The look of the film is fascinating particularly some scenes in which the costuming makeup and set design evoke Fellini at his weirdest.  Also the use of the spectacular Italian countryside and old villages is outstanding.

It's been many years since I've seen the movie so I just ordered a copy to enjoy again and again.

	schema:headline " Generally Enjoyable SciFi Horror";
	schema:reviewBody "A reclusive scientist working on a cancer cure inadvertently unleashes deadly creatures onto the local population turning it into an...Island Of Terror!'Island Of Terror' is an interesting midpoint between 50s scifi and 60s Hammer horror  too light for what Hammer and Amicus usually produced but their gravitational pull is evident. There's something very Quatermass about science unleashing havoc yet science also providing the solution. There's a nice element of mystery to set the scene with people being brutally murdered offscreen and their corpses being discovered sans bones but at the same time you are left in no doubt that there must be some connection with the scientist up in the manor house and his secretive experiments. Soon enough the horror he unleashes becomes apparent and it's up to the three 'responsible' scientists played by Edward Judd Peter Cushing and Eddie Byrne for whom the film goes to great pains to show how responsible they are as they wisely spend a lot of time studying notes before taking action and applying science methodically while the uneducated locals must wait patiently because science takes time and there's a process to things. Yes there are monsters coming over the hill but there's a procedure to everything and it has to be followed. One can't really disagree with any of this but the way in which the film portrays the scientific method if anything shows how long ago it was held in such high regard  it's just hard to imagine a film doing this today. The nature and form of the monsters themselves instantly brings to mind the classic Star Trek episode 'Devil In The Dark' although their appearance and design is more classic Doctor Who. Which is quite fitting given that Quatermass inspired early Doctor Who lead Peter Cushing had been playing him on the big screen for the last two years and both 'Dr Who  The Daleks' and 'Island Of Terror' were scored by Malcolm Lockyer.Cushing I have to say is wonderful in this film. A far cry from the sombre puritans or mad scientists he would soon become wellknown for here he is dashing rounded and somehow far more natural in his performance. This is more of the Peter Cushing the world used to see before horror films took over his life and it's great to see within the part of his filmography I'm more interested in. Unfortunately the rest of the cast are extremely theatrical by comparison with Edward Judd getting very declarative by the end  he reminds me of the way Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes would practically give speeches on the proper order of things before the closing credits. I'm almost expecting him to turn to the quivering frequentlyCarole Gray and say 'Don't worry my dear  science will save you!' Nonetheless Judd is the archetypal squarejawed hero and fits the part.Director Terence Fisher was a firmlyestablished horror veteran by this point with the Dracula series and one of my favorites 'The Gorgon' his recent successes. Having seen the latter again fairly recently I noticed the same approach to mood lighting although this time around the 'big reveal' happens earlier and Fisher leaves the design team to breathe life into the antagonists of the piece. I think he would have gotten away with it for the most part but for aspects of the design read appendages that require puppetmasters more skilled than those on offer for them to stand a snowflake's chance in hell of convincing the viewer. They work fine when they're hovering menacingly around a door frame but not so much when the dreaded miscreation they're attached to shuffles into view. The only reason it even halfworks is because the cast face their foes with the same conviction the Doctor Who stars were so frequently seen to give down on the sound stages of Lime Grove.Less defensible unfortunately is Malcolm Lockyer's frequently light and fluffy score. His trademark cues and melodies worked wonders in 1965's 'Dr Who  The Daleks' where the words 'kids matine' were practically stamped into Roy Castle's forehead but it's hard to feel a sense of creeping foreboding in 'Island Of Terror' when the camera is panning through the eerie deserted scientist's mansion accompanied by xylophone motifs. This is a film where the production values need every other department on board to help project a convincingly menacing atmosphere  not have the composer imagining cartoon bees dancing on toadstools. Again this underscores for me how the film sits between two genres and noone's fully made up their minds which way it should go.Putting all these elements together I find myself giving 'Island Of Terror' a 6 out of 10. I'm frequently drawn to Peter Cushing like a magnet and he's in fine form here. I love the idea behind the monsters of the piece and the respect given to science as it triumphs over all when used properly. Alas the creatures' design needed a slight revision on the drawing board under the title 'Let's be realistic about what we're able to do here' while James Bernard should have been placed in the conductor's chair. A pleasing effort and worth a look especially if scifi of the period appeals.".

	onyx:emotionText "A reclusive scientist working on a cancer cure inadvertently unleashes deadly creatures onto the local population turning it into an...Island Of Terror!'Island Of Terror' is an interesting midpoint between 50s scifi and 60s Hammer horror  too light for what Hammer and Amicus usually produced but their gravitational pull is evident. There's something very Quatermass about science unleashing havoc yet science also providing the solution. There's a nice element of mystery to set the scene with people being brutally murdered offscreen and their corpses being discovered sans bones but at the same time you are left in no doubt that there must be some connection with the scientist up in the manor house and his secretive experiments. Soon enough the horror he unleashes becomes apparent and it's up to the three 'responsible' scientists played by Edward Judd Peter Cushing and Eddie Byrne for whom the film goes to great pains to show how responsible they are as they wisely spend a lot of time studying notes before taking action and applying science methodically while the uneducated locals must wait patiently because science takes time and there's a process to things. Yes there are monsters coming over the hill but there's a procedure to everything and it has to be followed. One can't really disagree with any of this but the way in which the film portrays the scientific method if anything shows how long ago it was held in such high regard  it's just hard to imagine a film doing this today. The nature and form of the monsters themselves instantly brings to mind the classic Star Trek episode 'Devil In The Dark' although their appearance and design is more classic Doctor Who. Which is quite fitting given that Quatermass inspired early Doctor Who lead Peter Cushing had been playing him on the big screen for the last two years and both 'Dr Who  The Daleks' and 'Island Of Terror' were scored by Malcolm Lockyer.Cushing I have to say is wonderful in this film. A far cry from the sombre puritans or mad scientists he would soon become wellknown for here he is dashing rounded and somehow far more natural in his performance. This is more of the Peter Cushing the world used to see before horror films took over his life and it's great to see within the part of his filmography I'm more interested in. Unfortunately the rest of the cast are extremely theatrical by comparison with Edward Judd getting very declarative by the end  he reminds me of the way Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes would practically give speeches on the proper order of things before the closing credits. I'm almost expecting him to turn to the quivering frequentlyCarole Gray and say 'Don't worry my dear  science will save you!' Nonetheless Judd is the archetypal squarejawed hero and fits the part.Director Terence Fisher was a firmlyestablished horror veteran by this point with the Dracula series and one of my favorites 'The Gorgon' his recent successes. Having seen the latter again fairly recently I noticed the same approach to mood lighting although this time around the 'big reveal' happens earlier and Fisher leaves the design team to breathe life into the antagonists of the piece. I think he would have gotten away with it for the most part but for aspects of the design read appendages that require puppetmasters more skilled than those on offer for them to stand a snowflake's chance in hell of convincing the viewer. They work fine when they're hovering menacingly around a door frame but not so much when the dreaded miscreation they're attached to shuffles into view. The only reason it even halfworks is because the cast face their foes with the same conviction the Doctor Who stars were so frequently seen to give down on the sound stages of Lime Grove.Less defensible unfortunately is Malcolm Lockyer's frequently light and fluffy score. His trademark cues and melodies worked wonders in 1965's 'Dr Who  The Daleks' where the words 'kids matine' were practically stamped into Roy Castle's forehead but it's hard to feel a sense of creeping foreboding in 'Island Of Terror' when the camera is panning through the eerie deserted scientist's mansion accompanied by xylophone motifs.

He goes to the mainland to see Dr. Stanley Peter Cushing a pathologist. Stanley and Landers go to David West Edward Judd who is an expert on bone disease. Intrigued by the bizarre symptoms West's girlfriend Toni Merril Carole Gray follow Landers back to the island.They discover that wellknown cancer specialist Dr. Philips has been doing experiments on the island.

These creatures which Stanley names 'Silicates' are roaming the island......Made by obscure British company 'Planet Productions' this great little flick was produced by Richard Gordon who also gave us the cult favourite Fiend Without a Face'. With the expert hand of Hammer Director Terence Fisher at the helm Gordon has produced a similarly grotesque set of creatures to terrorize his highclass cast. True the 'Silicates' are rather funny looking like huge rubber cow pats with a vacuum cleaner attachments that they use to grab their victims with and suffer from the old zombie problem of moving very slowly but they make for a wonderful sight gliding along in search of food and the manner of death they deal out is so horrible having your bones dissolved and sucked out while alive that damaging humour is kept at bay. There are some great attack sequences as various cast members are digested with nicely disgusting slurping sounds by the creatures whom during one sequence even drop out of the trees! More fun is had when they divide and what looks like a gallon of watery tinned spaghetti flows out! They are a bizarre and wonderfully entertaining creation.The cast is in top form with Peter Cushing in particular giving us a delightful turn as the pathologist with a welcome streak of gentle humour. It's a role that only Cushing could play with this amount of laid back ease and he is a joy to watch. Edward Judd is nicely stoic and handles his scenes with Cushing well showing he was a much underused actor. Carole Grays character is the only weak link as she is strictly the clich woman in peril sort who is given little to do. Thankfully her love interest scenes with Judd are few and short.The island atmosphere is captured well and Fisher makes what would normally be a tranquil setting a place of lurking menace. He also takes the viewer by surprise with his treatment of some of the characters never letting his audience get too complacent in the expectations.Add to all this a lean and never wasted running time a suitably manic and funky soundtrack composition plus a typically cynical '60s epilogue and you have a film that should be much more widely known and available.Planet Productions' also made Night of the Big Heat' once again with Cushing and Directed by Fisher but this time throwing Christopher Lee into the mix as well and both these films although Island of Terror' is very much superior both are worth tracking down. In these days where the UK only makes small scale independent and normally U.S influenced horror films this movie reminds us that Britain once produced some unique and delightfully entertaining genre pieces.Great fun!".

Peter Cushing Edward Judd and Eddie Byrne head a cast of stalwart British character actors that includes the ever reliable Sam Kydd and Niall MacGinnis as they try to uncover the truth behind the gruesome deaths occurring on their lonely fog shrouded island. It's a great little horror film that succeeds due to its excellent narrative pace its logical progression and its unpretentious nature. Despite its relatively low profile the film is on a par with many of the best Hammer films being made at the time. This should be no surprise as the director is none other than the man calling the shots on much of Hammer's most admired output  Terrence Fisher. He handled most of the Frankenstein movies and a number of the Dracula films including the startling debuts in each case. He was also responsible for The Mummy Curse of the Werewolf The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Gorgon. With such a pedigree of atmospheric chillers Island of Terror continues that success but manages to feel new and fresh. Malcolm Lockyer Dr Who and the Daleks provides the music and special mention should be made of the great use of Barry Gray's electronic sound effects. Gray was of course the man responsible for the grand music that accompanied most of Gerry Anderson's marionette series and he knew how build tension with quietly suspenseful sound too. The special electronic sound FX that swell out of the gloom adds a foreboding tone to the proceedings whenever the monstrous silicates are near. Are the monsters when finally revealed a bit silly looking?  maybe to modern eyes but for this reviewer their slow progress and ever multiplying numbers rank up the tension nonetheless. And their method of reproduction is revolting in the best possible way. Highly recommended for fans of Cushing Fisher and British horror.".

Yes maybe they honestly never saw this film and maybe the Startrek writers never imagined a short round silica based life form that dissolved bones with injected acids and ate minerals for food... But you gotta admit it is a GREAT idea for a monster!Seriously I voted a 10 for this movie because I have the VHS version want a remake for DVD with enhanced synthetic stereo sound. My rating is not based on just how well the movie scared the crud out of me when I was a kid but that it still gives me the creeps and that sucking slurping noise is enough to scare anybody! Hardly a week goes by that I don't miss seeing movies like this and others like Forbidden Planet Fiend Without A Face great sounds too! and other classic monster movies. Sure I watched Dark Fury and the just released Riddick 2 flick and love them all but I admire what it takes to make a film with NO budget NO special effects except a rubber silicate jumping out of a tree on top of a guy that just looks up and says AAAAHHHHHHH!and still pull off a film that made audiences afraid of the dark after the movie ended.My vote... keeping the monster out of sight is better. Forbidden Planet did it with great results. Fiend Without A Face also did a great job  in fact they would have been better off if they KEPT those brainspine rubber things off the screen IMHO.Finally IMDb my hats off to you for truly being the planets best source of movie info!".

The film takes place on an island off the Irish coast and that's an immediate bonus....films where the population is trapped on a ship island or in a house always add to the dread of any film in my opinion.  It makes for a smaller cast and you get to know the characters a bit better....this is definitely the case with this film.  A medical research team it seems has been experimenting and attempting to find a cure for cancer certainly a noble effort but instead they develop a new breed of creatures that live on the bone of humans and animals.

	schema:reviewBody "Tom Blakely's Planet Productions made just four features three of which were this film 1964's Devils of Darkness and 1967's Night of the Big Heat their last. For ISLAND and NIGHT they secured the services of Hammer director Terence Fisher and Hammer star Peter Cushing adding Christopher Lee to the cast of NIGHT for extra measure. DEVILS was an odd footnote the first British vampire film set not in the Gothic world represented so well by Hammer but in the modern day otherwise undistinguished. Terence Fisher expressed no fondness for science fiction and his early black and white Hammer entries Four Sided Triangle Stolen Face and Spaceways all 1952 are all overly talkative and extremely dull. 1964's The Earth Dies Screaming was a modest step up a very low budget alien invasion represented by a tiny cast and one single robot. Fisher's two Planet features make quite a matched set perhaps not as revered as his better known Hammer efforts but allowing him to focus on his cast of characters presenting them in dangerous situations that create tension. Fisher always emphasized the human side of his monsters and even in these two sci fi entries he remains true to form. Both scripts benefit from finely etched characterizations and wonderful actors bringing them to vibrant life. In ISLAND OF TERROR an isolated island off the East coast of Ireland is the setting of an invasion created by scientists searching for a cure for cancer creating a form of life that survives by devouring the bones of people and animals. Sam Kydd plays the constable John Harris who discovers a missing farmer dead in a cave the body a mass of jelly. Eddie Byrne THE MUMMY THE VENGEANCE OF FU MANCHU STAR WARS is the island doctor scoffing at the apt description of the corpse there was no face just a horrible mush with the eyes sittin' in it. Both actors well known faces in British cinema are so natural in these roles that the horror of the situation is instantly established with great credibility and this is BEFORE the introduction of the heroic Peter Cushing who never fails to convey sincerity in even the smallest of parts. Here Cushing occasionally takes a back seat to second billed Edward Judd but both work well in tandem putting together the scientist's notes as to what went on in the laboratory and learning how to stop the onslaught of terror. Cushing was usually the voice of reason the authority figure a character the audience trusts completely to present all the facts to them yet here his character is not so sure of himself a quick quip to try to hide his fear a more believably written hero and this marvelous performer delivers one of his very best. The low budget special effects especially the eating sounds deliver on a modest scale and the harrowing sequence where Cushing is attacked and implores Judd to chop off his hand at the wrist is the stuff of childhood nightmares. A first time viewer may be surprised at the unusual depth of characterization and Niall MacGinnis NIGHT OF THE DEMON DR. TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS TORTURE GARDEN as the island's leader Liam Gaffney as the first victim even the smallest of roles are played faultlessly. Of course when one puzzled islander remarks some peculiar goingson going on on this island there's always a risk that unintended humor might overcome the intended but it's not fatal. Superior to NIGHT OF THE BIG HEAT and proof that Terence Fisher could make excellent science fiction provided he had a script that presented human characters little different from the ones in his Gothic chillers. Make no mistake this is definitely a CHILLER and one of Richard Gordon's infrequent productions ranging from Mother Riley Meets the Vampire Bela Lugosi Grip of the Strangler Boris Karloff Corridors of Blood Karloff and Christopher Lee Devil Doll Curse of Simba The Projected Man Tower of Evil all four with Bryant Haliday Horror Hospital Michael Gough The Cat and the Canary Carol Lynley and finally Inseminoid Judy Geeson and Stephanie Beacham. Thirty years of genre cinema with the greatest stars of their day.".

DEVILS was an odd footnote the first British vampire film set not in the Gothic world represented so well by Hammer but in the modern day otherwise undistinguished. Terence Fisher expressed no fondness for science fiction and his early black and white Hammer entries Four Sided Triangle Stolen Face and Spaceways all 1952 are all overly talkative and extremely dull. 1964's The Earth Dies Screaming was a modest step up a very low budget alien invasion represented by a tiny cast and one single robot. Fisher's two Planet features make quite a matched set perhaps not as revered as his better known Hammer efforts but allowing him to focus on his cast of characters presenting them in dangerous situations that create tension. Fisher always emphasized the human side of his monsters and even in these two sci fi entries he remains true to form. Both scripts benefit from finely etched characterizations and wonderful actors bringing them to vibrant life. In ISLAND OF TERROR an isolated island off the East coast of Ireland is the setting of an invasion created by scientists searching for a cure for cancer creating a form of life that survives by devouring the bones of people and animals. Sam Kydd plays the constable John Harris who discovers a missing farmer dead in a cave the body a mass of jelly. Eddie Byrne THE MUMMY THE VENGEANCE OF FU MANCHU STAR WARS is the island doctor scoffing at the apt description of the corpse there was no face just a horrible mush with the eyes sittin' in it. Both actors well known faces in British cinema are so natural in these roles that the horror of the situation is instantly established with great credibility and this is BEFORE the introduction of the heroic Peter Cushing who never fails to convey sincerity in even the smallest of parts. Here Cushing occasionally takes a back seat to second billed Edward Judd but both work well in tandem putting together the scientist's notes as to what went on in the laboratory and learning how to stop the onslaught of terror. Cushing was usually the voice of reason the authority figure a character the audience trusts completely to present all the facts to them yet here his character is not so sure of himself a quick quip to try to hide his fear a more believably written hero and this marvelous performer delivers one of his very best. The low budget special effects especially the eating sounds deliver on a modest scale and the harrowing sequence where Cushing is attacked and implores Judd to chop off his hand at the wrist is the stuff of childhood nightmares. A first time viewer may be surprised at the unusual depth of characterization and Niall MacGinnis NIGHT OF THE DEMON DR. TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS TORTURE GARDEN as the island's leader Liam Gaffney as the first victim even the smallest of roles are played faultlessly. Of course when one puzzled islander remarks some peculiar goingson going on on this island there's always a risk that unintended humor might overcome the intended but it's not fatal. Superior to NIGHT OF THE BIG HEAT and proof that Terence Fisher could make excellent science fiction provided he had a script that presented human characters little different from the ones in his Gothic chillers. Make no mistake this is definitely a CHILLER and one of Richard Gordon's infrequent productions ranging from Mother Riley Meets the Vampire Bela Lugosi Grip of the Strangler Boris Karloff Corridors of Blood Karloff and Christopher Lee Devil Doll Curse of Simba The Projected Man Tower of Evil all four with Bryant Haliday Horror Hospital Michael Gough The Cat and the Canary Carol Lynley and finally Inseminoid Judy Geeson and Stephanie Beacham. Thirty years of genre cinema with the greatest stars of their day.";

	schema:reviewBody "As with any SciFiHorror film fan in his late thirtiesforties I first saw this gem as a kid on TV probably on some late show specializing in such fare. The scare flic worked its scares on me but good  several scenes in particular. The one scene that really stands out for me is the first time we see one of the 'Silicates' in action  all the way from the start as it latches onto the local doctor and to the end as it finishes sucking all his bones out we see the local cop get it before this but the scene cuts off before he dies. That sucking sound coupled with the doctor's cringeinducing scream of pain haunted my nightmares for days after. I could really feel the doctor's pain as he died with that lingering deathscream on his lips. The film didn't shy away from letting the audience know this was not an instant death the victim takes about a minute to die as the bones are sucked out  and they are in agonizing pain for that entire minute. I tried to imagine what it would be like lying awake later a 10 or 11year old kid as I said not much sleep during that time. The kicker is though when I saw the film again in later years as in when I was in my late twenties and so on it still induced a chill in me. The entire pic taking place on an isolated island contains a sense of foreboding and is a sort of waking nightmare. Most of it is not during night as one would expect but in daytime the usual comfort of sunlight and bright outdoors doesn't work with these slithering things. You do have a couple of competent heroes in Peter Cushing  Edward Judd but even they're scared out of their wits when directly confronted by these monsters. This pic works on several levels including science amok introducing a new life form where one shouldn't exist and just the plain unknown. I've seen this so many times now that I can rationalize around the scare tactics now and merely take comfort in a wellmade programmer like they just can't or won't make anymore. They even include a final twist in the end that still gives me the willies  hey how about a sequel? Or at least a quality nonPal DVD?".

In short if you spend the rest of your life having never seen a fondly remembered film then your fondness remains intact  so much so that I had hoped to rewatch this movie as an adult but it's not an easy film to find and I don't recall it being broadcast apart from its initial screening on ITV one Friday night circa 1981 That changed tonight and it's interesting how many people on this message board say it's a victim of false memory syndrome . It certainly wasn't a contender for the Oscars but it's difficult to believe that a film so dumb and more than a little bland could stay in the memory so long . Yes it's certainly watchable and remains so but that might be down to watching so many excessive gory films between 1981 and 2012 rather than ISLAND OF TERROR having massive merits of its own .Two obvious things let the film down  the screenplay and the directing The premise is the standard scientists try to make things better for humanity but almost succeed in destroying the human race but the premise is totally undermined by every plot turn . Supposedly the location of the story is set on an Island off the East coast of Ireland which is strange because most of the characters have Scottish sounding names . It could be the East coast of Northern Ireland which would make sense . Nothing else makes sense however such as the Islanders having no phones but an endless supply of guns and dynamite . This was three years before the troubles started but would the average Island in Ulster be selling boxes of dynamite at a corner store ?

It caught my attention especially because it was directed by Terence Fisher and stars Peter Cushing. These two worked together in making the finest films for the Hammer studios like most entries in the Frankenstein series The Hound of the Baskervillers and The Mummy. Island of Terror is not a Hammer film yet it often feels like one since the set pieces are so alike and the screenplay uses the same proportions of wit British humor and severe shocks. The story takes place at a small Northern Ireland island where the local doctor has a bizarre case of a boneless corpse on his hands. He travels over to the mainland to recruit eminent scientists Brian Stanley Cushing and David West Edward Judd for helping him with this matter. Back at the island they discover that the horror is caused by monsters that were the result of failing medical research by another scientist. The monsters look like crossovers between tortoises and elephants feeding on bones while leaving the flesh untouched. If that's not bad enough the creatures reproduce themselves and they're slowly moving towards the island communityTerence Fisher makes great use of the isolated island location and the feeling of being completely trapped perfectly reflects on the screen. The story doesn't waste too much time and features more than enough action and frighthighlights to please the most demanding horror fan. The monster designs are surprisingly convincing and also the special effects are praiseworthy. The few shots of extorted corpses are efficiently icky and very well pictured. As the plot becomes more intense Fisher terrifically adds sequences of hysterical villagers. A small but outstanding little detail. Veteran horror star Peter Cushing certainly doesn't give away his finest acting performance here but he's always worth admiring even though he's outshined by Judd and the female loveinterest played by a gorgeous looking Carole Gray. Island of Terror isn't top class horror at least not compared to some other films around that time but it contains enough imagination and style to pass for excellent undemanding entertainment. I wonder why the idea of bonesucking creatures cool name Silicates isn't used more in horrorscience fiction epics.".

	schema:reviewBody "On a remote Irish island bodies are being discovered without any trace of bone. Baffled Dr Landers Eddie Byrne flies to the mainland to consult renowned pathologist Dr Stanley Peter Cushing who is equally baffled. They consult Dr West Edward Judd to see if he can shed any light on things but neither can he. They fly back to the island and their investigations lead to a reclusive scientist who accidentally created creatures which thrive on human and animal bone while trying to find a cure for cancer. This also resulted in the loss of his life. Now they must find away of destroying the creatures before they wipe out the entire island...Cheaply made scifi horror which is much redeemed by Terence Fisher's impeccable narrative pacing a skill which he no doubt gained through is many years as an editor. As with the best of his Hammer films ISLAND OF TERROR has a great feeling for place and period and one can almost feel himself on the remote Irish island even though the film was shot at London's Pinewood studios. There are fine performances to enjoy as well from Peter Cushing at his scene stealing best as Dr Stanley and Edward Judd a second league but nevertheless an extremely good actor excels in his part as Dr West.

	onyx:emotionText "On a remote Irish island bodies are being discovered without any trace of bone. Baffled Dr Landers Eddie Byrne flies to the mainland to consult renowned pathologist Dr Stanley Peter Cushing who is equally baffled. They consult Dr West Edward Judd to see if he can shed any light on things but neither can he. They fly back to the island and their investigations lead to a reclusive scientist who accidentally created creatures which thrive on human and animal bone while trying to find a cure for cancer. This also resulted in the loss of his life. Now they must find away of destroying the creatures before they wipe out the entire island...Cheaply made scifi horror which is much redeemed by Terence Fisher's impeccable narrative pacing a skill which he no doubt gained through is many years as an editor. As with the best of his Hammer films ISLAND OF TERROR has a great feeling for place and period and one can almost feel himself on the remote Irish island even though the film was shot at London's Pinewood studios. There are fine performances to enjoy as well from Peter Cushing at his scene stealing best as Dr Stanley and Edward Judd a second league but nevertheless an extremely good actor excels in his part as Dr West.

	schema:reviewBody "Terence Fisher and Peter Cushing have made some great horror films together most of them for the brilliant Hammer studios. This film wasn't produced by the studio but it could well have been as it has all the makings of a Hammer Horror film. Silly monsters daft dialogue a campy style and as mentioned Peter Cushing all feature all of which were favourites of Hammer films. Island of Terror follows the story of a doctor who unwittingly creates a barrage of seemingly indestructible monsters while trying to find a cure for cancer. Enter Peter Cushing and co.  a team of scientists that are on hand to fight back against the monsters and uncover the mystery behind them. Island of Terror is a monster film made very much within the common monster movie mould. One could maybe even go as far as to say that this is the quintessential classic monster Bmovie from the sixties as all the clichs and staples of the style of film are featured heavily.Some of the dialogue in this film is ridiculous to such a high standard that I would call it 'priceless'. See for example the instance when Peter Cushing is told about the discovery of a boneless corpse to which he replies that's unbelievable. It's moments like these that make Bmovie so much fun and nobody delivers silly lines like Peter Cushing  Hammer Horror has made him a master at it and he shows us that in this film. Cushing's performance on the whole in this movie isn't up there with his best  but it's hard to keep up to the high standard that Cushing had set for himself with performances the likes of Baron Frankenstein and Van Helsing so as his character in this movie has much less depth you cant expect as great a performance. The real stars of the show are the creatures which are as fascinating as they are ridiculously silly. The creatures look quite a lot like those old vacuum cleaners you used to and probably still do get before Dyson took over. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if they actually ARE just painted vacuum cleaners. The moments when these things fall out of the trees makes watching the whole thing worthwhile and if it's a silly monster movie you're after  you've just found it.".

While Island of Terror of 1966 a nonHammer film provides the typical Hammerfeeling it is not nearly as praiseworthy as any of the aforementioned films. The film is however irresistibly entertaining and provides delightful Monsterfun that every fan of classic camp Horror should enjoy.The film actually starts out very creepy when a man on a remote Island is found dead lacking even a single bone in his body. The police inspector Sam Kyddof the small island community and the local physician Dr. Landers Eddie Byrne are horrified and clueless. They hence travel to London to ask for the help of renowned pathologist Dr. Brian Stanley Cushing. Along with bones expert Dr. David West Edward Judd and West's foxy girlfriend Carole Grey Dr. Stanley visits the island to investigate the mysterious death...SPOILERS Ahead! Stanley and West uncover the truth behind the incident lies in scientific experiments gone wrong. When researching a cure for cancer scientist accidentally created monsters that liquefy and suck out the bones of all living creatures... The island is an uncanny setting and the idea of bonesucking monsters is actually awesome in my opinion but man these monsters... These monsters must be some of the most ridiculously looking things ever brought to screen. Seriously the things look like hairy vacuum cleaners. This makes the film funnier but it makes it way harder to take it seriously and destroys all creepiness. This is not to say that Island of Terror is not a terrifically entertaining film however. The film is highly recommendable to all my fellow fans of British Horror the ridiculous monsters just make it funny rather than eerie. Peter Cushing however is great as always. And what would be more entertaining to a lover of Classic Horror than cheesy Monster fun starring Cushing? Also regarding the way the monsters look there is a very wellmade and surprisingly gory armchopping scene. Overall the extremely cheesylooking monsters steal the creepy potential from this film. However they bring delightful entertainment in exchange. Highly recommendable to my fellow fans of campy stuff!".

While Island of Terror of 1966 a nonHammer film provides the typical Hammerfeeling it is not nearly as praiseworthy as any of the aforementioned films. The film is however irresistibly entertaining and provides delightful Monsterfun that every fan of classic camp Horror should enjoy.The film actually starts out very creepy when a man on a remote Island is found dead lacking even a single bone in his body. The police inspector Sam Kyddof the small island community and the local physician Dr. Landers Eddie Byrne are horrified and clueless. They hence travel to London to ask for the help of renowned pathologist Dr. Brian Stanley Cushing.

It's easy for anyone to say that the effects are stupid and it doesn't have a Star Wars budget but to do this is to miss the point entirely.  Just like Dr Who the idea is the STORY not the effects and also to put forward some really interesting scientific ideas in the context.  Like Quatermass the power of it is in the atmosphere the tense chilling suspense like everyone being holed up in the island's village hall KNOWING that the Sillicates are OUT THERE in the dark and COMING THIS WAY.  Planet Film productions are so atmospheric so brilliantly written and executed and were definitely the forerunners for most Dr Who plots of the late 60s70s.  Check out also Night of the Big Heat by Planet Films which is basically a carbon copy of this film island cut off from mainland rampaging monsters  and this time Christopher Lee!. But do see it please ignore the effects they are but props on a stage used to illustrate the valid terrifying scientific ideas and concepts at work here.

We had read the fabulous work and knew its major themes so searching for a visual adaptation was exciting. We found one version with Pierce Brosnan and then a black and white one both of which were not fulfilling. This movie picks up the quest for a visual characterization of Daniel Defoe's title character and leaves me somewhat satisfied at least more so than the previous ones I've seen. Missing the first few minutes I began in on the movie just after Crusoe is shipwrecked. The film has great visuals and moves from one eventoccurrence to another pretty steadily but it was lacking in both depth of the Crusoe character and a general study of the character's relationship to nature and God two aspects that the original story effectively focuses on. I did not experience a depth of connection with Aidan Quinn who played Crusoe and it feels like he is more just a random character in a made for TV movie rather than the rugged time tested and matured Robinson Crusoe I tend to imagine. I kept hoping the movie would have a 7 or 14 or even 21 years later scene where we gasp and wonder how the time has changed Crusoe and wonder what he's been up to like in Cast Away with Chuck Nolan. While there are some touching moments I give it 610 stars for the previous reasons. I wanted a more integrated piece that zeroes in on the man Robinson Crusoe rather than a film that jumps from one island event to another and doesn't return to the title character and his story. Still it's watchable.".

	schema:reviewBody "What was Kevin Smith thinking? An audacious critic of society and film in particular and no stranger to poking fun at himself I can foresee a few years down the road a sheepish Smith laughing off his involvement in this torturously unfunny genre film. What he may lack in compelling direction skills he more than makes up for in witty screenplays with equal balance raunch and insight having crafted classics such as Clerks and Chasing Amy. With Smith absent from the writing role there is absolutely no reason to seek out Cop Out.Calling Cop Out a 'buddy cop' film would be a gross misnomer. To qualify as such we would actually have to witness some aspect of 'buddy'. Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan who costar have absolutely no chemistry and I did not believe for a single second they would ever be friends or even be able to tolerate one another for that matter. Furthermore I did not believe for a single second that Tracy Morgan could ever be a cop. I am willing to suspend some disbelief in movies like this but c'mon. This role would have been kin to casting Betty White in Taken. Morgan is a very funny man in supporting situations with 30 Rock being an apt example Although that show benefits from Tina Fey's screenplay. If she had penned Cop Out this review could be reading far differently but as with actors like Chris Rock and Chris Tucker a little goes a long way.Then we have Bruce Willis who just seems eager to leave. I have never seen Willis mope his way through a movie like this all of his roguish charms seemed drained by the horrific writing and familiarity of the gags. To make matter worse yet we get a horrendous performance from Sean William Scott also a very funny man whose character is as annoying as it is perfunctory. Many have been calling this a familiar rehash of buddy cop flicks of years past I wish. I would have begged for a Beverly Hills Cop XXII over this near abomination.The plot in case you care centers on Willis' and Morgan's Jimmie and Paul two NYPD detectives who stumble into a drug ring after Jimmie's prized baseball card is stolen in front of his eyes during a robbery. He needs the card to pay for his daughters wedding and as he searches with the help of the criminal by which it was stolen William Scott uncovers more than he had in mind.In summation this film fails as a comedy fails as an action film fails as a breakout role for Tracy Morgan fails as a return to the cop genre for Willis and mars Kevin's Smith's mostly unblemished track record. Originally titled A Couple of Dicks the title was then changed to what you now see on the marquee. I can only assume this was a backhanded reference to the state of Smith's creative integrity.Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com".

It suffers from a generic storyline questionable performances and the simple fact that almost none of the intended sources of humour achieve the desired effect.Bruce Willis an old timer and Tracy Morgan a new timer are an odd couple indeed but they had potential. The problem is that their levels of commitment to the film are polarized. Willis seems lazy and uninterested never putting much effort into it. Morgan on the other hand tries way too hard. His larger than life style of crudeness is more clumsy than funny and he upstages pretty much everyone else in the cast.After about ten minutes we have a pretty good idea of how this film is gonna play out but we go with it in the hope that the trip is worth while. Unfortunately there are more silly contrivances and poorly written lines than there are laughs. The only time when Cop Out is funny and remotely clever is over a Good Cop Bad Cop routine that Willis and Morgan have. There are enough action movie jokes to make it clear to the audience that at least Kevin Smith has the selfawareness necessary for satire. But from what I saw Cop Out isn't really a satire at all. It no better or worse than any other failed copcomedy. I'm not sure if it's laziness or lack of thinking behind it but Cop Out hasn't got the goods".

This movie however fails in every way possible. The plot is bad and not even remotely interesting. A valuable baseball card that Jimmy Monroe Bruce Willis is selling to pay for his daughters wedding gets stolen from him and he and his partner Paul Hodges Tracy Morgan gets themselves into a big mess trying to get it back.I don't know what Bruce Willis was thinking when he agreed to do this movie and watching him on screen makes me believe he had some regrets. He actually looks bored during most scenes and there is no chemistry between him and Tracy. As if it's not bad enough that Bruce puts on the worst performance I have ever seen from him Tracy Morgan managed to make me hate his character so much that I actually hoped he was hurt in the scene where a kid kicks him in the nuts.To top things off there are two other buddycops in the movie played by Adam Brody and Kevin Pollak. They add nothing to the story except for 20 minutes extra run time.Looking for a nice buddycop movie to get some quick laughs? Then keep looking. Cop Out is nothing more than 1 hour and 47 minutes of your life that you can never get back.".

Angry about the fact that no one involved seemed to give a toss  in fact they might as well have spent the whole movie just standing there holding up two middle fingers at the audience.But I'm angry most of all at Kevin Smith the director of this piece of utter garbage. He used to be talented. He used to make great movies like Clerks Dogma even Mallrats. Yeah that's right I'm the guy who liked Mallrats. These days he churns out lazy rubbish and then goes on Twitter and whines at anyone who dares to criticise it. He's thrown his talent away and he's so wrapped up in the bubble of his own selfimportance that he doesn't seem to realise it.

But as it turns out the hatred was not only positively correct but even though it gets 20 on Rotten Tomatoes I consider it overrated. It's that bad.The characters were annoying and uninteresting and the performances are just terrible. Bruce Willis is dull and uninteresting Tracy Morgan is like a mumbling Bill Cosby wannabe Sean William Scott is like a mix between Ashton Kutcher and Jar Jar Binks and the rest of the characters were just..... there. The back stories behind all these characters are clich and uninteresting which just makes the film even more boring.The humor in the film is just a bunch of obnoxious ramblings and pop culture references with some unfunny sexual humor thrown in. There's actually one scene where Tracy Morgan is purposely using a bunch of lines taken from movies for no reason whatsoever. They tried to be clever by adding in the famous YIPPE KAY YAY MOTHER F!! line and have Bruce Willis say I haven't seen that movie! but it's poorly executed and just comes off as dry.The cinematography in the film is just lazy. The camera is always moving in circles there's one or two moments where the directed object is out of focus and it's especially shaky in the action scenes.

	onyx:emotionText "I went into CopOut expecting the hatred to be overblown. I'm usually a fan of these clich action movies as long as they're entertaining even on a mindless level. But as it turns out the hatred was not only positively correct but even though it gets 20 on Rotten Tomatoes I consider it overrated. It's that bad.The characters were annoying and uninteresting and the performances are just terrible. Bruce Willis is dull and uninteresting Tracy Morgan is like a mumbling Bill Cosby wannabe Sean William Scott is like a mix between Ashton Kutcher and Jar Jar Binks and the rest of the characters were just..... there. The back stories behind all these characters are clich and uninteresting which just makes the film even more boring.The humor in the film is just a bunch of obnoxious ramblings and pop culture references with some unfunny sexual humor thrown in. There's actually one scene where Tracy Morgan is purposely using a bunch of lines taken from movies for no reason whatsoever. They tried to be clever by adding in the famous YIPPE KAY YAY MOTHER F!! line and have Bruce Willis say I haven't seen that movie! but it's poorly executed and just comes off as dry.The cinematography in the film is just lazy. The camera is always moving in circles there's one or two moments where the directed object is out of focus and it's especially shaky in the action scenes. It makes the film seem like an incredibly cheap cashin which I suppose it is.Do yourself a favor imagine yellow Do Not Cross banners running around this film.";

More than that though the film is a brilliant throwback to the glory days of such 80's buddy cop franchises as Lethal Weapon and Beverly Hills Cop. You'll recognize key dialog from the former while the composer for the latter Harold Faltermeyer makes a glorious return to the genre with a quirky retro score that sets the mood just right. Bruce Willis plays the straightman to Tracy Morgan's...well...Tracy Morgan is really just playing every character he's ever played here but the way in which he bounces off of Willis who himself seems to be trying hard to keep a straight face in many scenes keeps it from feeling tired or stale. While this oddcouplecop formula has been done to death in the past it works for this film and is done in a loving way that pays tribute rather than rehashes.Smith whose films are mostly talk proves himself to be a competent action director at times throughout the film. It's funny to think that the man who made Clerks made a polished studio film such as this but it's a sign of maturity more than sellingout so rest easy fanboys. The script by Mark  Robb Cullen is whipsmart witty and never leaves you longing for a laugh. Even if you don't gel with the story about a rare baseball card landing into the lap of a highpowered druglord you'll always find yourself laughing along with the film. It also helps too that each and every player seems to have had a good time making the film and that translates into the final result.One could make the argument that Smith himself could have rewritten the film and made it all the funnier but much of the humor in the film comes from the onscreen chemistry. It's about as good of an 80's buddy cop throwback as you'll get and is rounded out with a brilliant cast that also includes Guillermo Diaz Kevin Pollak Adam Brody and Jason Lee among others. Go into expecting a simple yet effective way of just how fun an action movie can be. As for Smith he's shown significant range and hopefully the film will help break him out from just being the guy who directed those Jay  Silent Bob flicks. Thankfully Cop Out is anything but.".

It's blatantly obvious that the screenwriters drew no inspiration from real life and instead cut and pasted elements of other films. You know like any lazy screenwriter.I despised this film from the getgo. It opens with an interrogation scene where Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan play surprise surprise! Good Cop Bad Cop. Morgan rushes into the interrogation room spouting a multitude of famous oneliners to the suspect. Now why in God's name would a detective who served nine years on the force do something like that? There's no method to his madness. After he runs out of quotes from action movies he starts quoting movies like Jaws. How does that make any sense? I know what you're thinking. It's a comedy! Still every joke has to contain an element of truth. Just watch Eddie Murphy's portrayal of Axel Foley in the Beverly Hills Cop movies. Though his character is overthetop and exaggerated he's still believable as a cop. Because you're able to buy into the reality you're able to laugh.Kevin Smith's films all have their imperfections. However one word you can never use to describe his films is unoriginal. Cop Out is an exception to that rule. I don't think I can name a single moment that wasn't ripped off from other films mainly buddy cop flicks. It's bad enough that it contains the excruciatingly stale premise of a stuckup white cop and his loudmouthed black partner teaming up to crack a case. No we also have the smug rival detectives played by Kevin Pollak and Adam Brody who constantly bust their chops. The villains are stereotypical Latin gang members. There's even a scene in which the main villain guns one of his henchmen down in a church praying to God before he commits the evil deed. Seann William Scott plays an obnoxious suspect who tags along with the two detectives and ultimately assists them in nabbing the villains. Willis plays a divorced dad and his daughter's new stepfather Jason Lee is a pretentious tool. Stop me when you spot anything and I mean ANYTHING original.Morgan is obviously a talented comedian as we've gathered from his work on Saturday Night Live. However like many inyourface standup comedians he needs to be kept on a leash. There were way too many moments where Smith allowed Morgan too much freedom. There's one scene where he jabbers on for about three minutes about his resistance to take a dump anywhere outside of his home. Wow. Hilarious.Willis is convincing in his role because...well...he plays a cop in every other movie! Unfortunately he's not given much to do as Morgan constantly upstages him with his unfunny shtick. If the screenwriters had any brain cells they'd realize that it's just as important to give the straight man some funny moments. Just watch 48 Hours! Nick Nolte had almost as many amusing moments as Eddie Murphy. On account of that Willis appears bored throughout the film. Who knows? Maybe he signed on for the gig simply to return the favor to Kevin Smith who did a cameo in Live Free or Die Hard. I can't stress how unbelievably awful this movie is. This movie proves that Smith should definitely stick to directing his own scripts. As much as I like the guy directing is not his strong suit. You watch a Martin Scorcese flick that wasn't written by him and you can still tell it's a Scorcese flick. Without Smith's sharp and witty dialog the film may as well have been made by some hack TV director.".

Seann William Scott plays an obnoxious suspect who tags along with the two detectives and ultimately assists them in nabbing the villains. Willis plays a divorced dad and his daughter's new stepfather Jason Lee is a pretentious tool. Stop me when you spot anything and I mean ANYTHING original.Morgan is obviously a talented comedian as we've gathered from his work on Saturday Night Live. However like many inyourface standup comedians he needs to be kept on a leash. There were way too many moments where Smith allowed Morgan too much freedom. There's one scene where he jabbers on for about three minutes about his resistance to take a dump anywhere outside of his home. Wow. Hilarious.Willis is convincing in his role because...well...he plays a cop in every other movie! Unfortunately he's not given much to do as Morgan constantly upstages him with his unfunny shtick. If the screenwriters had any brain cells they'd realize that it's just as important to give the straight man some funny moments. Just watch 48 Hours! Nick Nolte had almost as many amusing moments as Eddie Murphy. On account of that Willis appears bored throughout the film. Who knows? Maybe he signed on for the gig simply to return the favor to Kevin Smith who did a cameo in Live Free or Die Hard. I can't stress how unbelievably awful this movie is. This movie proves that Smith should definitely stick to directing his own scripts. As much as I like the guy directing is not his strong suit. You watch a Martin Scorcese flick that wasn't written by him and you can still tell it's a Scorcese flick. Without Smith's sharp and witty dialog the film may as well have been made by some hack TV director.";

	schema:reviewBody "When did we become so uptight about comedies and about things that makes us laugh? When did we become so demanding about jokes and humor? It's a mystery to me that viewers didn't get a clue about what was so funny in Cop Out an homage to actionhumored flicks of the 1980's but brought into a new decade. This film is light well intentioned hilariously funny and with good performances by the unusual team made by Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan.Willis and Morgan play two suspended detectives with some personal goals to achieve. Willis wants to pay for his daughter's wedding and he needs money for it and he would get the money by selling a rare baseball card but it was stolen from him and he needs to get back Morgan's character doesn't trust his wife so much believing that she has an affair with the neighbor so he keeps investigating possible affairs. But both of these cops are on the run trying to find Willis card that end up on the hands of some bad guys.The plot is silly but that's what is funny about Cop Out. Not only the team made by Willis  Morgan were cool but the team made by Kevin Pollak and Adam Brody as the serious detectives were responsible for the most interesting and funny moments of the film Seann William Scott goes very well with his usual comedy style here playing a thief. The only problem with this film is the villain played by Guillermo Diaz because this guy is so dangerous that there's no sense of comedy about him it's not funny and when director Kevin Smith tries to make of him a funny guy it is just too forced weird.The 1980's references and the film references mentioned by the film buff detective played by Morgan are the best. Harold Faltermeyer's musical score in a moment taken from Beverly Hills Cop was a nice and funny reference you watch the scene and you instantly remember where did they took from. And the references of Die Hard Beetlejuice In the Heat of the Night and many other classics used in a comic and interesting way but it only works if you know the mentioned titles.An easy entertainment simple and very funny. 1010".

Now for me what really carried this movie was the character that Seann William Scott played it was hilarious even though it was just a supporting role. He was so cool in this role and I loved every moment of it. Now on to Tracy Morgan well I have to say that I found him amazingly annoying in this role and I just wanted to reach in there and .... oh well never the less I think a guy like Chris Rock or Chris Tucker might have been better for this particular role.Moving on to the story. Well the plot and story was good and constantly moving so you weren't really bored at any point in the movie. And there were lots of hilarious scenes and moments as well. And there were also just enough twists and turns in the story to make it interesting.The music in this movie sort of made me feel like I was watching a remake of the old Eddie Murphy movies Beverly Hills Cop. At times it was like the music was a remix or a homage to the music from those movies. That was kind of a bit too much for me.I hadn't actually heard anything about this movie prior to picking it up for the first time. But of course by that way I had no expectations to the movie which I think worked well in favor of the movie. The movie does provide good entertainment but there isn't much in it that you haven't already seen in other movies.

I know Kevin Smith didn't write this snoozer but I'm guessing he had something to do with some of the dialog as nearly all of what is supposed to be funny is centered around sexual acts and private parts which has Kevin Smith written all over it.

But this actually improves upon them imo. It didn't have that serious section that those did. This was wall to wall laughs. It wasn't just me. Everyone in my theater was laughing beginning to end.The cast was sooooo perfect. He chose really funny people to fill out his cast all the way down to a pretty small role for Adam Brody who I didn't realize was hilarious until I saw him in 'Thank You for Smoking' where he was just great. I didn't like Tracy Morgan for a long time. I don't know maybe I got used to him. But he's seemed okay on 30 Rock. He's hilarious in this. But the funniest of the funny is Seann William Scott. You should see it just for his role. Susie Essman Guillermo Diaz the 11 year old kid everyone really makes it work. In the beginning Willis looked a little bored he works as often as anyone so maybe that should be expected but eventually he got with it and then it was all smooth sailing.I've seen some bad reviews and I don't know why. Maybe you have to be a movie fan or Gen X or something to get all the references. And there is a doozy that references a cult favorite that I truly and loudly LOL'd at. I'm sure I missed some jokes because I was laughing at other ones. But I'll catch it when I watch this one again. And I know this movie is going to be super rewatchable. Even the songs they used were perfect. I would only not recommend this to people who have a problem with bad language. But why would they even be considering it anyway?".

I didn't like Tracy Morgan for a long time. I don't know maybe I got used to him. But he's seemed okay on 30 Rock. He's hilarious in this. But the funniest of the funny is Seann William Scott. You should see it just for his role. Susie Essman Guillermo Diaz the 11 year old kid everyone really makes it work. In the beginning Willis looked a little bored he works as often as anyone so maybe that should be expected but eventually he got with it and then it was all smooth sailing.I've seen some bad reviews and I don't know why. Maybe you have to be a movie fan or Gen X or something to get all the references. And there is a doozy that references a cult favorite that I truly and loudly LOL'd at. I'm sure I missed some jokes because I was laughing at other ones. But I'll catch it when I watch this one again. And I know this movie is going to be super rewatchable. Even the songs they used were perfect. I would only not recommend this to people who have a problem with bad language. But why would they even be considering it anyway?";

Tracy Morgan is probably the biggest reason for this disaster but let's not let the Director off this hook either. He shares a lot of the blame. Morgan shouldn't be allowed before any movie camera at least not with a script like this. His overacting was annoying and embarrassing to watch unless you were 4years old. The only actors who did the right thing were the bad guys who performed the way they should have. As for Willis he just went along for the ride and he was okay but should have known better and needs to pick partners directors and scripts more carefully. I wanted to shut this down within the first 6minutes. The silliness and nonsensical acting by Morgan slowed down some and I wanted to see if this movie could save itself. It didn't.But as I have said about many Hollywood comedies goofy and silly things are mandatory. It's a law out there. But this was way over the top. One more thing. The sound and any character's mouth movements were way off too. First you see the character saying something and then later you hear what that character said. I think but I cannot be sure that the dialogue was dubbed in after the scenes were shot. Looked like it. Maybe it was the DVDViolence Yes. Sex No. Nudity No. Suggestive Language Yes.

It's set in the future features spacecraft and the men and women who fly them and is about a rescue mission to another spacecraft. Yet before long it's quickly obvious that Event Horizon is in fact a horror film set in space and a surprisingly effective one at that. While not a masterpiece it is a reasonably disturbing film.Event Horizon opens in the mid 21st century where man has attempted fasterthanlight travel. The vessel built for this was the space ship the Event Horizon and it contained at it's heart an artificial singularity a miniature black hole if you will that will open a door to another part of the universe. Upon first test of the engine the ship disappeared not to be heard from again. Seven years later it reappears in orbit over Neptune and a rescue ship the Lewis  Clark is dispatched to determine if there are survivors and what happened to the Event Horizon. Along for the ride is the ship's designer Dr. Weir Sam Neill whos going through a strong trauma in his life after his wife has recently committed suicide. The crew of the Lewis  Clark commanded by Captain Miller Laurence Fishburne listen to Weir's explanation of what happened to the Event Horizon and then receive a transmission from the ship that is garbled but seems to suggest a not so pleasant fate for the crew. The Lewis  Clark crew dock with the Event Horizon and begin investigating the ghost ship but find strange happenings occurring throughout with different members of the crew seeing strange things Miller sees a man he left for dead on an exploding vessel medical officer Peters Kathleen Quinland sees her crippled son and the ships engineer Justin Jack Noseworthy looked into the singularity engine and is put into a state of shock and Weir begins seeing visions of his wife.It quickly becomes apparent that the Event Horizon has been somewhere other than another part of the galaxy and it has brought something back with it.Event Horizon is not a groundbreaking entry in the horror genre that's for sure. Many aspects on display have been utilized in countless other films. And yet director Paul Anderson manages to give us the requisite chills and leave us on the edge of our seats. A primary element that helps the film is the Event Horizon itself. Designed with a very Gothic look in mind the ship just looks and feels scary. It is place I can't imagine anyone ever being comfortable being in. The dark empty hallways and rooms are menacing themselves and that helps ratchet up the tension. Anderson also does a good job of crafting suspenseful scenes involving the character's visions. Almost every one of those sequences will leave you unsure of what you will see and that keeps the audience in a state of unease.As the film progresses there is an increase in makeup effects grusomeness so I would agree that it makes it a difficult film to watch as it goes on. However most everything in the last halfhour is payoff to the setup so while it's not always pretty to watch it makes it all the more effective.Acting wise Event Horizon is decent but nobody will be well remembered for their work. Sam Neill is probably the most memorable as the slowly disintegrating Weir tumbling to madness before our eyes. Laurence Fishbure is effective as the hardnosed captain and everyone else gets the job done.A lot of people gave Event Horizon flack upon it's release and again it's not the most original horror film made but it is one of the more disturbing I saw in the mid to late '90s and I would give it a recommendation just be careful watching it by yourself.".

For one thing there is no predatory alien hunter on the loose and instead the horror is far more psychological. Not that there isn't a fair amount of violence and gore but the gradual sense of unease that builds up to it is crafted more on the crew's growing sense of anxiety and paranoia. Plus there is no definitive explanation given for what they are experiencing. Just what are these Ghosts from their pasts doing on this ship? And what exists on the other side of the black hole? Another dimension where mankind was never meant to go or as the movie itself suggests but doesn't confirm the very depths of hell itself? Couple this with the excellent set design  the ship is modelled on the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris  and the pulsepounding moments in the latter half when the chaos sets in and you have one tremendously enjoyable horror film.

	schema:headline " So brilliant its hard to believe Paul Anderson directed AVP.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is without a doubt one of the greatest horror films ever made! I wouldn't classify it as scifi even though it does pay homage or some would say ripoff to many of the greats such as Alien and The Black Hole. This is a pure horror film and also has a bmovie charm. This is the kind of movie William Castle would be directing if he was still alive today but much better! It is the best haunted house movie of the lot but its set in a spaceship.OK the movie doesn't have the most complicated plot or character development it works because of the atmosphere and Paul Anderson has pulled off a onetrick pony here. The atmosphere in this film is so friggin brilliant that you forget you're watching a movie and it physically affects you! James Cameron and Ridley Scott reached this level of brilliance in the Alien films and David Fincher with Seven.I've seen this movie over 20 times. It is incredibly entertaining with fine performances amazing special FX one of the best and creepy music scores ever the best space production design ever the best subwoofer explosions the best cinematography energetic and brilliant direction...I could go on....It's also become a bit of a cult classic nowadays. I've loved the film since it was first released and every friend I show it to agrees and considers it a sleeper. It is also one of the only films I know that induces fear into the audience and provokes them to curse in awe. Every time my mates and I watch it we are gobsmacked in its craziness! 1010  Easily in the top 10 horror films of all time! One of the most entertaining movies ever made. Paul Anderson has never surpassed this film and it will be the one he is remembered for.".

I was 35 when I first saw this movie after it had finished I felt like I was 10 years old and had just finished watching an old scratchy BW werewolf flick.It had been so long since I had truly been disturbed in a scared way I'd almost forgotten what it felt like. Schindlers List troubled me but not in this way this was a true feeling of shock and horror. Four or five minutes after the screen had gone blank and the music faded I'm still staring at the TV screen in a nicely terrorized state. I had to shake myself to snap out of it. Fabulous!!!!!I love seeing peoples faces after I have told them to watch this film. They give me that Oh my God!!!!!! look and breath in deeply at the same time. They too have been truly traumatized for a short while. When they discover the nature of the garbled video message is a great recoil moment within the film and one I can still remember some 5 years after seeing it. If you're easily scared don't watch this movie you'll have a heart attack. If you haven't been scared in a while then be prepared for how marvelous that feeling is. YOU HAVE BEEN DULY WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!".

	schema:headline " Decent scifihorror  Underrated";
	schema:reviewBody "EVENT HORIZON is a pretty good scifihorror movie which you'll either love or hate. It's a very dark and depressing movie which completely justifies the 'terror' in the tagline. Perhaps the continuing terror is why some people probably dislike it.As far as I know most horror movies lack a decent story or decent acting or character development. That's why I'm not into horror movies that much. But Event Horizon has an interesting story that is an ideal and most of all original environment for a horror movie. Even though character development is limited as the film progresses you'll get to know most of the characters better. Especially Sam Neill's Dr. Weir and Laurence Fishburn's Cpt. Miller characters.The acting was done very well by most of the cast most notable Laurence Fishburn and Sam Neill who did a good job. The sets on the other hand are brilliant and creepy at the same time. I would not feel comfortable walking around in any of those rooms especially the engineering room featuring the Gravity Drive sphere with 3 magnetic rings within a room filled with deadly spikes on the walls and ceiling. This adds more tension than there already is to the movie which makes the experience only better and worthwhile.The special effects in this movie are quite a treat. Ranging from an external view of the gigantic Event Horizon around Neptune to Dr. Weir and his 'HANDywork' with his eyes.In my opinion this is a good but underrated scifi horror movie with lots of freaky moments that will keep your heart racing. If you like the depressing endless terror you'll like this movie quite a bit. If you rather have happy endings and laughs you'll probably dislike it.For the best experience watch this movie in a dark room at night or even past midnight with the volume turned up a bit over the normal setting.Rated 710 on IMDb but I personally would give it a 7.510.".

	schema:reviewBody "Event Horizon is a decent movie. There's no question it's never going to win awards for originality or anything else frankly but what it does it does well. It's based on the idea of a space ship which disappeared just under a decade ago reappearing mysteriously prompting a search and rescue vessel to go in and investigate. Telling more would spoil the premise so no more will be said. It is all set in the future as much scifi is and deep in outer space of course. The performances are as polished as you'd expect from Sam Neill as the doctor and Laurence Fishbourne as the scout ship captain so there are generally no complaints there. The gore levels at times are not for the squeamish but what else would you expect from an 18 UK rated movie? There are a fair number of predictable moments and cliched lines but the overall production is more than decent and able to keep your attention focused on the plot. A good effort all round and the overall 5.5 rating it received here is a touch harsh. I'd say 7.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Event Horizon' is very much an atmospheric scifi horror. It does not rely on gore although there is enough of that but rather it is the creepy atmosphere that engages the viewer. Andersen successfully creates a tense depressing and claustrophobic atmosphere. The suspense and pace are well maintained. It pays tribute to several movies of the same genre like 'The Shining' 'Aliens' etc. Character development is slightly weak but the actors do a good job and the viewer cares for them. Sam Neill Laurence Fishburne Kathleen Quinlan Joely Richardson Richard Jones and Jason Isaacs do a fine job with what they're given. The sets look very unwelcoming and creepy. The special effects and sound effects are good. The cinematography is superb. The plot is a little complex and difficult to follow in the beginning leaving the viewer wondering with what exactly is going on but this becomes easier with repeated viewings. In my view 'Event Horizon' is an underrated film and perhaps did not get enough recognition because it did not have any stars or enough 'monsters' and 'blood' or perhaps the subject was a little too complex for some to grasp.".

Solaris an intellectual film from the Sovietera genius Andrei Tarkovsky  is the more complex film. It does not attempt to explain whether the hallucinations are caused by an external force space fever passage into a timespace warp or just the fact that you can't ever run from yourself not matter how far you go. No monsters.Event Horizon is a cross breed between these two legendary deepspace films. The monster is there but it inhabits the minds of the crew learns everything about them every fear every memory and causes their insanity. Solaris with action and an identified external cause. The idea was pretty damned good the special effects and visuals were brilliant and they hired a good cast. Some of the moments will scare the beejeepers out of you.But they went over the top in some ways. Too many explosions. A fistfight with the monster what's that all about? Too many emptyheaded discussions about what man was or wasn't meant to know. Ultimately too little really original. Reviewers were sharply divided on this film. Some said it was a truly brilliant scarefest others thought is was a zerostar waste of their precious time. I don't know.

I loved it!!! Now 12 years later a finally purchase the film on DVD ordered from the states as I can't find it anywhere in New Zealand and I watched it with a couple friends who have never seen it before. Suddenly I was 14 again! A scared child too frightened to look away from the screen. Caught in an icy grip of fear and excitement! A feeling I haven't felt since the first viewing of 'Event Horizon'. Brilliant! I jumped in all the same scenes I jumped in 12 years ago and i was so absolutely absorbed in this film. My friends felt the same way i did and we all sat on the same couch with the lights off while this film quietly terrified us!Now I'm not exactly a huge horror movie enthusiast as i find most horror films to be stupid cheesy and just not scary in the slightest. Horror films now are especially ridiculous as that Saw series when will it end? is just silly and repetitive which is a shame as the first film is a pretty descent thriller which seems to be another problem for horror films is that there are too many sequels with each film becoming further and further detached from the original making the whole premise and idea of the film pointless and boring.Which is exactly the reason Event Horizon works. It is a standalone film. No sequels. No actual killer as such...it is the presence of an unseen evil which corrupts the characters into becoming warped and ultimately the cause of their own demise. For a horror film the kill count is surprisingly low and no one actually dies during the first hour of the film. It's the suspense of the film and the actual idea behind it which is so unbelievable frightening that you find yourself absorbed and unable to look away from the screen....gripped in fear. That's why this film is so brilliant. The cast is great. It's not overly convoluted. It's scary beyond belief. The story is good enough to keep the viewers attention and adrenaline pumping and the special effects have held up surprisingly well for a film that was filmed back in 1997.I really wish there was a Director's cut edition of this film.If you've seen this film and you were not frightened...you are either really warped lying or talked all the way through it. i suggest a rewatch by yourself with the lights off and all other distractions laptop cellphone switched off as well and just sit and watch...I guarantee fear will gnaw at you eventually.And if you enjoyed this film you should also check out Pandorum as it is also fairly good though not quite in the same league as Event Horizon.Liberate tutame...ex inferis.".

And from the moment I heard the rocking Orbital opening track I was transfixed. I was in the perfect mood to watch this film and it delivered more than I could have hoped in a cinema experience. After repeated home viewings it does lose its shock factor yet it is still a great film though I have to add it really was meant for the big screen. The sets are great the gore is shocking  the ship design is truly beautiful. Admittedly the Event Horizon borrowed its look from '2001' yet they took that long majestic shape  gave it a more modern gritty feel. A few bits of ham acting listen to when Richardson says the hulls been breached didn't detract from this excellent Hellraiser Vs 2001 style flic. Watch it with the lights off and the sound up. 1010 for the Cinema experience. 8.510 as a complete film".

When Alien presented this story line it was new made sense the movie had a great pace and was genuinely disturbing. The same storyline about 18 years after the original was out is a farce. Event Horizon simply does not even remotely create the dense atmosphere of horror that was created in Alien. The turningevil of the scientist is very predictable. None of the characters they all resemble the cool marines from Aliens by the way including a couple of the typical weak women is described well and one hardly cares for them. And when you don't care for the characters you are not afraid that something might happen to them. A great defect for a horror movie because if you don't care the movie is not scary. The movie is full of pathetic clichs. When the rescuers hear from the ghostship they get an audiomessage with the usual distorted screaming on it. They filter it and voil one of the cool marines finds out that it actually is Latin and translates it immediately. Latin sounds spooky to some people and that's probably why someone in deep space has nothing better to do then sending messages in Latin while he is being massacred. Incredible. The idea to give the ghostship an evil consciousness is ridiculous the ship is a haunted house in space. If you expect a good horrormovie avoid this one. YOu will be disappointed.".

And then when he begins to kill the crew because they want to leave all of a sudden he has superhuman power and easily overtakes a man with a sharp knife in his hands not to mention he has no eyes!I actually started laughing by the last of the death scenes because it was fun to see what new terrible death they could produce.  The only real scene that held my attention in horror was the footage of the first crew being tortured and the captain holding his eyes and speaking in Latin. The rest of the movie contains mediocre acting  I was especially disappointed by Laurence Fishburne who usually is outstanding borrowed plots and a story that drags on and on.At the end Sam Neill says Hell is only a word. the reality is much much worse.

	schema:reviewBody "I had extremely low expectations for Event Horizon.The film was made in a period where a lot of filmmakers thought that when you have enough money to use and abuse CGI your movie doesn't need a decent script.With that in mind I thought Event Horizon was going to be a clich horror film that makes no effort to build suspense and just throws CG blood and gore in your face.I was wrong.Dead wrong.Event Horizon is the creepiest and most suspenseful horror movie I have ever seen.It manages to create a feeling of dread and foreboding like no other film I have ever seen before.This is due to a combination of great cameraworkappropriate music andbelieve it or not CG.Yesthe CGI is actually used appropriately herenot just added for the sake of it being there.That saidthe special effects are topnotchfor 1997.Another thing I liked was that the ship itself wasn't the main threat.It was the characters.They become obsessed with their past mistakesthings they had locked away in their minds and didn't want to remember and that begins to drive them insane.Truethe ship is the catalyst for thisbut the focus is more on the characters themselves.This reminds me of Cubeone of my favorite movies.The characters themselves are a bit underdevelopedbut they aren't cannon fodder like in many other horror films.Each of them has their the distinct personality and background information is given about some of them.I think this was alright for the purpose of this film.In my opinion if they did add more character development it would have ruined the pacing.Event Horizon is a very well madebut sadly underrated horror movie.I strongly recommend it.".

	onyx:emotionText "I had extremely low expectations for Event Horizon.The film was made in a period where a lot of filmmakers thought that when you have enough money to use and abuse CGI your movie doesn't need a decent script.With that in mind I thought Event Horizon was going to be a clich horror film that makes no effort to build suspense and just throws CG blood and gore in your face.I was wrong.Dead wrong.Event Horizon is the creepiest and most suspenseful horror movie I have ever seen.It manages to create a feeling of dread and foreboding like no other film I have ever seen before.This is due to a combination of great cameraworkappropriate music andbelieve it or not CG.Yesthe CGI is actually used appropriately herenot just added for the sake of it being there.That saidthe special effects are topnotchfor 1997.Another thing I liked was that the ship itself wasn't the main threat.It was the characters.They become obsessed with their past mistakesthings they had locked away in their minds and didn't want to remember and that begins to drive them insane.Truethe ship is the catalyst for thisbut the focus is more on the characters themselves.This reminds me of Cubeone of my favorite movies.The characters themselves are a bit underdevelopedbut they aren't cannon fodder like in many other horror films.Each of them has their the distinct personality and background information is given about some of them.I think this was alright for the purpose of this film.In my opinion if they did add more character development it would have ruined the pacing.Event Horizon is a very well madebut sadly underrated horror movie.I strongly recommend it.";

I'm one of those who approve of books being made into films as long as they reasonably stick to the novel because they bring a new perspective and life to the story.However I had read nothing but horrible things about this film before I went to see it. Now that I have all I can say to all those who had only negative things to say is HAVE YOU READ THE BOOK? Love in the Time of Cholera retains the same authenticity and tone on the screen as it did on the page. Yes the characters are strange people but that is what makes them memorable we see parts of ourselves in them and parts of their culture that molded them into who they were. Bardem's Florentino is being called a creepy stalker but his actions in the novel are no different then those on the screen and reflect the passion and desperation of the world he lives in. Fermina is being called cold and unlikable but in the novel that's what she is a haughty proud woman who keeps her heart buried.I know the number of bad reviews out there will undoubtedly outnumber the good ones. I don't care. I urge you to go see this film. The novel it follows is a classic and is one of the greatest love stories of all time. Its characters are not perfect they are human. The scenery costumes and overall atmosphere of the film are authentic and moving. But at the heart of the images there is a love story that is timeless character traits that hit close to home and a happy ending that it seems few of us find.This is why we watch movies. It's not the entertainment the celebrities or the technological feats. It is the stories that make us think that cause us to question the world we live in. We all didn't watch To Kill a Mockingbird for the comedy or memorable performances though they were. We watched it for the time it portrayed the people it involved and the message that made us ponder what our world was is and is going to be.Love in the Time of Cholera is a movie about us. The faults successes failures and dreams we all have. It is worth anyone's time to see it at least once.".

Ronald Harwood's screenplay is a patchwork quilt that attempts to tell the story of longing for love in the manner of a novellatravelogue and despite the presence of some very fine actors in the key roles director Mike Newell forgets to grasp the atmosphere that makes the original novel ethereal.Young Florentino Ariza Unax Ugalde is a poor dreamer working as a telegraph operator and sees and falls in love with young Fermina Daza Giovanna Mezzogiorno daughter of a wealthy mule trader Lorenzo Daza John Leguizamo who upon hearing of the infatuation whisks Fermina away as Florentino pledges undying love and fidelity to Fermina. Florentino's mother Trnsito Fernanda Montenegro his uncle Leo Hector Elizondo and his friend Lotario Thugut Liev Schreiber comfort him and try to encourage his mating with another woman but as Florentino matures now Javier Bardem even the long list of sexual encounters cannot turn his mind away from Fermina. Fermina marries Dr. Juvenal Urbino Benjamin Bratt travels widely has his child and ultimately discovers her husband's infidelity. Florentino inherits his Uncle's shipping wealth becoming one of the wealthy class that would have made him an eligible suitor for Fermina when he originally met her. But time changes everything except Florentino's commitment to Fermina and after the death of Dr. Urbino he has the chance to realize his long awaited dream of being with the now 70 year old lover.The story spans fifty years in an unnamed city in Columbia here Cartagena and across the beauty of both South America and Europe. All of the basic elements are in place the important missing piece is the magic of Gabriel Garca Mrquez's prose. The huge cast is wasted on a script that is less than pedestrian Javier Bardem tries to make Florentino a credible sympathetic character but is stuck in the mud of his lines the brilliant Fernanda Montenegro attempts to paste together the pared down role of Florentino's mother an unremarkable Giovanna Mezzogiorno fails to make Fermina worthy of Florentino's devotion John Leguizamo is grossly and embarrassingly miscast fine actors such as Unax Ugalde Liev Schrieber Catalina Sandino Moreno Ana Claudia Talancn Hector Elizondo and others are little more than cardboard caricatures of the original creations.One wonders how Newell and Harwood could have strayed so far from the mark of the potential that this beautiful novel promised as a cinematic transition.

It's not hard to imagine that the book must have been a romantic experience chronicling a man's love for a woman spanning decades it's also not hard understanding why you would want to take this story and turn it into a movie.What is hard to do is sit through it.There is obviously a lot of hard work and craftsman ship on display. Whatever the budget was most of it made it to the screen  which cannot be said for most productions. However it's never clear what the tone is is this a comedy or a drama? Films can have it both ways and win but here it seems to be they shot it two ways and weren't sure which way to goso they did both. Bardem's character Florentino seems to go between being Chaplin and Norman Bates with his bowler's cap  comedic reactions on the one hand and his obsession with his crazy mother who arranges trysts for him on the other. His character at times seems to be brilliant and charming and at others borderline mentally retarded.Complicating matters here Florentino is played by two actors Unax Ugalde as a teen and Bardem later in life. The choice to swap out the Ugalde for Bardem comes at a strange point in the story it's when Fermina the love interest has not seen him in sometime. This might sound like the perfect point to swap out but with Fermina played by the beautiful Giovanna Mezzogiorno though most of the film it's confusing when Bardem steps in now as Florentino. It is here that the Fermina dumps Florentino with really no explanation but most will feel for her decision as in a span of time that has not touched her...he as aged horrifically! And on top of that this old man before her seems to be firing on a few lost cylinders. Is this a boy in love or a psychotic about to rampage? You be the judge. Stalker.For his time on screen as Florentino Ugalde is saddled with a prosthetic nose hoisted upon him to resemble Bardem. This is a HUGE mistake as is frankly ALL the makeup in this film which could single handedly be the death blow to the film because it is uniformly so bad that for most of the presentation you simply cannot take your eyes off of it. That fake nose that fake beard and Mezzogiorno in her 70's she doesn't look a day over 30.As mentioned I did not read the book but it seems the adaptation here may be too faithful jamming in every aspect of the book. Part of what makes an adaptation difficult to pull off is the knowledge of what to leave out and in some cases what to add! Here you're treated to so much information so many locations and lots of frighteningly bad makeup the romance is left to the wolves.When Florentino and Fermina finally do get together in the end of the film it's a relief not to see them together but to think the film will be over soon...but it's NOT. It goes on as now he must win her over! This film is filled with good intentions...and we know where that will sometimes get you.Bardem is lucky NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN opens this week so anyone who caught this Colombian train wreck can get the bad taste out of their mouth.".

	schema:reviewBody "The greatest challenge for filmmakers of period pieces is to infuse the work with some degree of relevance to modern culture. Perhaps in order to feed the current appetite for antihero male fantasies of social revenge and success Mike Newell has managed to flesh out the sexual journey of it's retronerd protagonist replete with the popular contagion of entitlement and nowexpected rewards of conquest.Gabriel Garca Mrquez' 1985 novel Love in the Time of Cholera remains a testament to Romance as Illusion and Love as a higher calling to those with the maturity and understanding of humanity to appreciate it. However in Newell's ambitious adaptation save for the characters aging fiftyodd years there is neither much maturity nor understanding of humanity. When the neophyte romantic Florentino Ariza Unax Ugalde spies the young Fermina Giovanna Mezzogiorno promenading through the plaza one day he is forever smitten. Captivated by her beauty a mystery due to the irredeemable casting blunder he pledges to remain a virgin until they can be together. After a heated exchange of letters a sweet minstrel stroll in her courtyard and a longdistance barrage of telegraphed yearnings Fermina harshly rejects him citing the temporary insanity of youth. At this point all passion exits the film for good. Fermina 's father John Leguizamo who inexplicably transports Queens gangtough shtick to 19th century Columbia manages to broker his daughter to Juvenal Urbino a successful doctor Benjamin Bratt after she recovers nicely from a false bout of cholera. The doctor too you see is so taken with his patient's beauty he must have her for his own. Maybe there is more in the water down there than cholera something that addles the senses of men. The lovely Catalina Sandino Moreno as one of Fermina's countryside ladiesinwaiting outshines Fermina in every scene they share. You wonder why the men aren't lining up to place a bid on her.Fast forward to an older Florentino now played by Javier Bardem using sex with women lots of women to alleviate the pain of his separation from Fermina. His pain endures for more than fifty years. Did I mention he alleviates his pain with lots and lots of women? Pain never looked so good.Part drama part comedy there is a curious tone to this movie it's difficult to tell where the laughs were intended. At first what seems like a campromp purposely anachronistic and selfreflexive the movie confounds when it appears that the actors are playing it for real. Due to the nerdy fecklessness of the young Florentino we're willing to overlook some of the earlier stilted moments. Yet there is some dialogue so unfortunate supposedly lifted verbatim from the ruminationheavy novel that it's doubtful it could be uttered out loud in any century with a straight face. Bardem one of a handful of actors who can elicit our investment in his character no matter how despicable and selfserving his actions carries the film. Ugalde who plays the younger Florentino as a puppy dog eyed Romeo who looks like he could be Bardem's younger brother deftly sets up the delusional character's obsessive nature that is handed off like a baton for Bardem to carry the rest of his days. Giovanna Mezzogiorno on the other hand must age from late teens to her seventies and she does so less convincingly. The filmmakers evidently didn't trust that audiences could overlook the horror of an older actress to take us from maturity on. Bratt must make the transformation across the years as well but the three of them seem to decompose at different rates making for a few jarring scenes. Some critics have lauded the makeup crew's accomplishments. Frankly the pancake looks as though it's in danger of sliding from faces in the jungle heat. Bardem alone here in the ability to age in voice posture tempo and demeanor in addition to the cosmetics helps provide a signpost as to where we are in the life cycle just in case Florentino's evergrowing list of sexual conquests doesn't mark the time clearly enough.What's lacking most in the script by Ronald Harwood so adept with his exquisite Diving Bell and the Butterfly is a thriving spirit a transcendence an irony. The movie is simply a superficial accrual of loathing Florentino's of society of Love of the fate that denies him earthly happiness and which spurs his mission to bed more than 600 women in order to drive out the demon of Fermina that possesses him Fermina's of herself as her body has the audacity to age of her fading beauty and of her husband's wandering eye. Such is the fate of women whose sense of selfworth relies solely on their appearance. Even at seventy she still can't bear to make love with the lights on. You'd hope that she would grow comfortable in her own skin at some point in her life. Lucky for her decrepit old Florentino doesn't see her as she really is he's still imagining her as a youthful sprite from a bygone time.The novel is a rich examination of love in its many incarnations with deeper themes underscoring how Romantic Love can disease the soul just as the dreaded cholera ravaged humankind. This adaptation is plagued with the endemic and dated shallowness of a telenovela steeped in the tradition of patriarchal virulence disguised as drama and conflict. Interesting how Newell takes the book's passionate struggle of a male masochist trying to reconcile his idealism and mutates it into an Apatowstyled adventure of a virginal lovesick loser turned lothario who still gets the girl in the end. Uninspired camera work and sloppy transitions sadly waste the exotic locations. For all the sumptuous scenery and meticulous period set design the movie has the feel of a Lifetime Television for Women M.O.W. Maybe there's a new cable network I don't know about MidLifetime Television for Men that this project can kick off.".

As much as I believe that cinema has the potential to be the most powerful and greatest art it can only come very close to greatness when the job is an adaptation of the most magnificent novel ever written. The same is true when trying to adapt Shakespeare or convey the power of any genius' work like in films about van Gogh Pollock Zola etc.From my point of view I felt that the challenge in adapting the book was for the most part one of ellipsis i.e. what do you keep and what do you remove? The scenes and lines of dialogue in the film taken directly from the book create a tapestry of brilliant surgery if not the perfect essence of the book certainly a brilliant essence or cinematic interpretation. But unfortunately for me one who has been tortured for twenty years by the sting of the book's many poetic details and minutia it is hard not to gasp at what is missing. Before viewing the film I prepared myself for a 138 minute distillation of an incredibly rich and detailed prose manuscript of 348 pages. I thought then and I realize now that it would take a ten or twelve hour filmed version of the book to sate my twentyyear damaged psyche but I am not so deranged as to hold it against a two hour film adaptation of the masterwork. The film stands by itself. It is a magnificent work. Maybe it couldn't be better. It just doesn't capture all of Marquez. It can't. An American audience even an educated worldly one is still formed and informed by our Puritan society. People don't make movies in Hollywood about coveting another man's wife dumping your fourteen year old lover resulting in her suicide to pursue the woman you really love and so on and so on... The film had to make comprises to get an 'R' rating and not cause our repressed and fearful media and good white Christian core to flip out. Compromise drives Hollywood. Compromise drives the business of movies. Compromise does not play a role in world of Marquez's characters.I believe and hope that very soon the film and book will become organically linked as closely as any film and book can be. It may even create a bond as strong as the Puzo GodfatherCoppola connection. I certainly hope so. It could create an artistic and cultural advance which is so vital for humankind and becoming more difficult to achieve in an impossibletobelieve world of reemerging fundamentalists who are hellbent on pummeling us all back into the stone age.I applaud all of principals who made this wonderful movie.Bravo!Viewers of Love in the Time of Cholera will gain more insight into what love really means.".

While the cinematography is great and the soundtrack beautiful the rest of the movie is the stellar opposite.The story fails to be romantic in any way. The lead actress has no chemistry with any of the actors she's supposed to be attracted to and they don't have much chemistry with her either. There are cameos galore but with no real purpose except maybe that the actors wanted their names on the the cast list for what they hoped would be as lauded a movie as was the book on which it was based.While the lead actress plays the same role throughout the movie even though she doesn't pass as a teenager much less as a 72 year old woman even with extensive makeup the lead male role is inexplicably split between two actors  the later being Bardem who because of the excessive makeup and blush applied to him is supposed to pass as a 20 year old more so than the 29 year old actor who had played the character in his teens. This reveals another major problem of this film all the actors always have on too much makeup even when it is not needed and this is particularly distracting when you see a closeup on the actors on the big screen of a theatre and all you see is foundation and blush. The actors seem to age at different rates and with no dates or indication of how much time has passed between scenes it all becomes very difficult to follow particularly when other characters such as Bardem's character's mother don't age at all they're just fortunate enough to become senile.Most of the acting is on par with a bad telenovela and even in the few cases where the actors give good performances such as Hector Elizondo there's no depth to the character. At one point you're lead to believe that his character has died and that Bardem's character has taken over the business only to have him pop up again half an hour later to announce that he's retiring. Most of the actors muddle through strained accents none of which match up and the most hilariously out of place is John Leguizamo who plays his character as if he's the lovechild of his characters from Moulin Rouge and Spawn but with a heavy New York accent this time.There's no sense of love between any of the characters not even familial love between the uncle and nephew as the uncle is quick to accuse his nephew of coming to see him only because he wants something. As far as romantic love the lead actress doesn't seem to love Bardem's character at all let alone her husband. And Bardem's character just comes off as a strange disturbing stalker who so loves and is committed to the woman he pursues that he sleeps with any woman that walks by including his 16 year old niece or some other relative. None of the lead characters are in the least bit even likable so it's difficult to feel any empathy for anything they're supposed to be feeling or going through.I admit there are a few laughs in this film unfortunately most of them don't seem to be intentional. In the end they hardly make up for having to sit through more than two hours of characters you don't really care about. I found myself envying the characters that died in the film  at least they didn't have to stay for the end.".

Young Fermina was too old as was America. I would have cast a 15yearold as the young Fermina and have had her reappear as America with died hair or similar artifice. I cannot forgive the script for ignoring the perversion and her suicide. I would have rather America had been entirely written out.Bardem was the perfect Florentino.

Does that sound like an insensitive capsule summary? Well that's what I felt this film did to the story.I could tell it was going for a sweeping love epic of a serious nature trying remind its audience what love really is and how long it can last when true. Yet mostly I felt that the poor man was somewhat pathetic that his love was forced and false to a degree and the woman he loved was silly and backboneless. My rational side kept reminding me that it's a story that there are other things that must be taken into account  differences in class differences in family situations the setting early 20th century Colombia  but emotionally all I could see were two very silly selfish people. I feel like this is a result of the way it was directed and perhaps edited as well. The tone was off.Aside from that the film was beautifulbreathtaking shots of Colombia.

	schema:reviewBody "The screenplay writer took much pains to try and conserve the essential meaning behind Garcia Marquez's writing but failed to capture the sentiment behind each scene. Another disappointment was directors interpretation of Dr. Urbino Juvenal character played by Benjamin Bratt. He seems like a soulless social clown who does not know anything about his surroundings or of the social society of which he is apart of. The director's portrayal of Ariza and Daza's relationship as one of a rekindled romance during the latter part of the film is incorrect as i believe that Marquez' intention was to show that two characters towards the end of their lives who had finally found a connection because they had suffered similar circumstances that had left both characters empty. Although it is true that most novels fail to capture the meanings behind such sentiment this was at most a mediocre attempt. Out of a possible 10 i have to give it a 4 only because a writer as masterful as Marquez should not be misinterpreted in this way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some novels such as Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel Garcia Marquez should be allowed to stay in the written page. As has been the case with other attempts to capture the author's work for the screen most alas have ended in failure. One can question the people behind this project about what they had in mind. A work of this magnitude certainly deserved better than this bland account by Ronald Harwood a man that has done better and by the director Mike Newell. Missing is the poetry and magic of the book and most of what is not being shown on the screen.Evidently as usually is the case with these ambitious projects there are a lot of things that get in the way. First and foremost trying to bring together such a large mostly Spanish speaking cast to play the various characters needs a surer hand and clear vision of how to translate this novel to cinematic terms and still bring out the essence of the story. This work supposedly has been read by more than sixty million readers so to make a mediocre adaptation of it should have been enough to have left it alone. The basic problem lies with the way Florentino Ariza has been conceived. As played by Mr. Bardem in one of his less effective performances in a while it robs the character his voice and the way one conceived it in one's mind. We are constantly reminded this Florentino is Javier Bardem at all times and not the man who longingly aches for Fermina most of his life. We are watching the actor going through some dialog period. On the other hand Mr. Bardem is only an actor and the reading he gives should have been guided better. Just watch him under the Coen brothers' clear vision in No Country for Old Men.The Fermina of Giovanna Mezzogiorno is also a problem in our all overall enjoyment of the picture. An excellent actress she is bogged down by a script that doesn't add much to her talent. John Leguizamo is totally miscast as Fermina's father as is Fernanda Montenegro a great actress who doesn't fare well at all here.The cinematography by Alfonso Beato is about one of the the best things in the film. Alfonso Beato's music doesn't add much drama to the whole picture either. For pure enjoyment pick up the original novel and have a great time with the magic world Gabriel Garcia Marquez wrote in one of his most memorable works.".

	schema:headline " Was this comedy or drama?";
	schema:reviewBody "From the opening scene I thought it was some kind of spoof that the camera would pull back and we would actually have been watching a play within a play kind of thing. I was at first taken by the terrible hair and makeup done on the lead actress to make her look elderly. I even asked my friend sitting with me what is it that I'm not buying in this first scene? To which she replied probably making young people look old badly. My thoughts exactly.Much of the other 6 people in the theater must have agreed with us as people actually began laughing out loud. The movie then seemed to take a bizarre turn towards becoming a soap opera or more appropriately a telenovela. Complete with the clich over the shoulder shots dramatic pauses and some over acting for good measure.It was almost as if all the the actors were in separate movies. Giovanna was in a silent movie sort of a Greta Garbo I'm not going to show any emotion kind of way and on top of that had zero warmth to her character. Then John Leguzamo was full on Moulon Rouge camp. The tone changed scene to scene. Sometimes it was big and sometimes it seemed random and pointless with nothing going on. BTW what was Unax's choice there in eating the flowers? I'm so in love I'll just eat some flowers? I can see the directors notes now bigger do it bigger indicate if you have to. Also I never saw ANY chemistry between Javier and Giovanna in the first entire half off the movie. I kept thinking I agree with the other characters in the movie he should just get over her. There are so many better options like 736 of them! She was like I love you and miss you and then I hate you stay away from me I never want to see your face again. It felt like a lot of the justification for that was missing. Or maybe she was psycho.Finally and I'm sorry but she just did not have the beauty to have all these men fighting over her and wasting their lives for her. She looked 30 from day one when I suppose she was suppose to be 13 and when she was losing her virginity with Benjamin Bratt it was so unbelievable that people were laughing. It was like watching a modern day 40 year old women say I have never been touched before it is scary to me. No thanks.I can see where the story was suppose to be really moving and beautiful. Javiar did a nice job. I like Benjamin Bratt too although at one point I could see the shiny glue attaching his beard. How does the director miss so many of these things? I suppose because he was busy deciding if it was a comedy or an epic drama...or maybe some bizarre gray area in between.".

	onyx:emotionText "From the opening scene I thought it was some kind of spoof that the camera would pull back and we would actually have been watching a play within a play kind of thing. I was at first taken by the terrible hair and makeup done on the lead actress to make her look elderly. I even asked my friend sitting with me what is it that I'm not buying in this first scene? To which she replied probably making young people look old badly. My thoughts exactly.Much of the other 6 people in the theater must have agreed with us as people actually began laughing out loud. The movie then seemed to take a bizarre turn towards becoming a soap opera or more appropriately a telenovela. Complete with the clich over the shoulder shots dramatic pauses and some over acting for good measure.It was almost as if all the the actors were in separate movies. Giovanna was in a silent movie sort of a Greta Garbo I'm not going to show any emotion kind of way and on top of that had zero warmth to her character. Then John Leguzamo was full on Moulon Rouge camp. The tone changed scene to scene. Sometimes it was big and sometimes it seemed random and pointless with nothing going on. BTW what was Unax's choice there in eating the flowers? I'm so in love I'll just eat some flowers? I can see the directors notes now bigger do it bigger indicate if you have to. Also I never saw ANY chemistry between Javier and Giovanna in the first entire half off the movie. I kept thinking I agree with the other characters in the movie he should just get over her. There are so many better options like 736 of them! She was like I love you and miss you and then I hate you stay away from me I never want to see your face again. It felt like a lot of the justification for that was missing. Or maybe she was psycho.Finally and I'm sorry but she just did not have the beauty to have all these men fighting over her and wasting their lives for her. She looked 30 from day one when I suppose she was suppose to be 13 and when she was losing her virginity with Benjamin Bratt it was so unbelievable that people were laughing.

But it would have to depart as much from ordinary Masterpiece TeeVee as this cleaves to it.The book if you do not know it relies on an already deep tradition of Spanishspeaking writers that brings metaphor to life by mixing illusion and reality. This is a third generation writer in this tradition and he counts on you knowing the previous generations so that you can appreciate the subtle craft in placing both in a reality.The centerpiece of course is how to fabricate a perfect love suspend it in earnest imagination and make it real through writing. That last bit is the third generation bit the idea that the writing of illusion makes it real. Students of narrative folding as a device to engage will recognize this trick as one designed to put the reader in the story. Everyone in the story is a reader of what Florentino writes. His passion in writing is immediately accessible to every other woman he meets and allows him to enter 622 of them.That number of course is the number of menstrual cycles he waits for his love while engaged in maintaining the passion. This links to one of the two main metaphors also partly illusory the boats on the river. The other metaphor is love as a disease and the triangle established by the doctor dedicated to eradicate it. The structure is rather clinical made attractive by the same passion in its writer as the writer character has. It matters that it is written in Spanish a language that allows a connected flow of phrases and a tradition that assumes romantic fever.I think Ruiz could have done this. Newell has no idea what to do with this and is left with simply trying lush shots and reading passionate text.Here's an indication of his general ignorance for practical commercial reasons the language must be English. But instead of having his characters speak English naturally and with passion he has them adopt an accent which we will recognize as Hispanic speaking English as a second language. This is characterized by hypervigilance to the consonants separating words where the primary language centers of the brain are telling the speaker that they should flow with sonances. An astute listener and if you are not you do not deserve to have passion in reading will know people with this whose words flow in their mind but become discrete pebbles in the mouth breaking the flow of liquid life this whole story exploits.Here's an indication of his cinematic ignorance It matters what is shown how and in what way for how long and in what order. He films this as if every element that plays a role in the plot deserves equal weight. Thus if we have a telegraph key that does something or a boat people are on or a ladder that slips why we see those. All exist with equal weight. All are shown with the same reality and perspective. All have the same frame. But this manner of narrative is all about color and weight all about the rhythms of love in reality. Some things should be sharp magnetic bright. Others foggy or not even touched. Some seemingly full and sensual but allowed to be discovered not so in a way that never informs the next lust.Its all about rivers and inconsistent flows. All the sex is denoted by displayed breasts. This again is a commercial necessity but the material is vaginal in focus. Such intense mysteries must always be. All of the mechanics of the story begin and end there even in mention of the food.Ted's Evaluation  1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.".

The actors' delivery of their lines with bad thick Spanish accents made it impossible to believe anything they said. All you could think was These are actors acting. Fernanda Montenegro in the role of Florentino's mother delivers what is probably the only engaging performance in the whole movie. Don't even wait till it comes out on DVD!

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film on it's opening day I was curious as to what kind of a deep love story it was but after the ending I raced out of the movie theater very upset and disappointed. First of all this is not a romantic film period this movie is a comedic stalker flick with no real story. There was no real bond to develop between the characters that made them have any feelings for each other. A young and delusional Florentino sees a pretty face and a nice body and thinks that he's in love when he's really in lust. She rejects him shortly after and whether than just moving on he decides to waste 50 years of his life while Femina has moved on with her life and married.The characters of Florentino and Femina barely knew each other and throughout most of the film he spends his time writing poetry and having sex with other women. This film is degrading and unrealistic in different ways Florentino's character was empty and completely delusional about the concept of love. The truth is that in any good love story you see two people begin to grow a friendship and that friendship grows into intimacy and the intimacy grows into love it is a mutual feeling between two people that turns into a strong bond and the characters continue to grow and love each other throughout the film and their love is so strong that they begin to overcome many obstacles but none of the elements that I just mentioned were in the film. In the beginning they start exchanging love notes but Femina later realizes that it was just a phase. Florentino's character could've moved on and married a good woman there's plenty of fish in the sea and there will never be a shortage of women. The two characters did not love each other Femina did not love Florentino she rejected him to pursue a life of stability and security and married a doctor and started a family and although they were at a rough start she began to love the doctor while Florentino wastes 50 years of his life in a delusional dream world of senseless poetry and sexual encounters all at the expense of a married woman who did not love him  and this is what you call a love story ? The fact of the matter is that there is no time table on love it's not about waiting for 50 years 5 years or even 100 years. Love has no time table loves comes from the heart and it is a mutual bond between two people. In all honesty if you really want to see good love stories I highly recommend the Notebook starring Ryan Gosling and Rachel Mc Adams and the Holiday With Jude Law and Cameron Diaz but this is a terrible and degrading film and sends out the wrong message to the audience and if you're thinking about seeing this film I strongly urge and advise you to reconsider.".

So the opportunity for fishoutofwater gags is wasted and the first 15 minutes do exactly nothing to further any plot apart from setting up a running gag both remain at home much longer than planned thinking up every kind of excuses not to return to Rome.Back in Brescello it's business as usual quite literally Many of the episodes are just rehashes of similar ones from films 1  2. There's little tension and few if any surprises every subplot develops as expected.Summaryy While the film feels like a nice old acquaintance it fails to hold my attention or bring something new to the world of DonCamillo.".

The lovely Margaret Lindsay is Tone's discarded fianc and there's a wonderful performance by Alison Skipworth as Tone's housekeeper.Davis of course draws all of the focus with the fire in her eyes the bite in her voice and those flashes of vulnerability.

	schema:headline " One of Bette Davis best performances";
	schema:reviewBody "Bette Davis began appearing in films in 1931 at the age of 23.  She was an extremely hard working actor and by the time she made this film in 1935 she had appeared in 27 films including Of Human Bondage' for which she received her first Oscar nomination the year before.The story is compelling.  Don Bellows Franchot Tone is an architect who claims that his life was changed forever by a theater performance by a young actress named Joyce Heath Bette Davis who came to prominence quickly and vanished almost as fast.  He was so moved by her performance that he reevaluated his life and took on a new direction moving from being a stockbroker to indulge his more creative side by studying architecture.  One day he comes upon Joyce Bellows who is stinking drunk.  He recognizes her and attempts to engage her in conversation but she is cruel and derisive. When she passes out he takes her back to his place to sober her up and care for her.  Despite her decrepit condition he is captivated by her and falls madly in love with her breaking off his engagement to Gail Margaret Lindsay.Don begins the process of rehabilitating Joyce and though she is resentful and bitter at first she is won over by his devotion to her and agrees to take a part in a play that she always wanted a play that he used all his money to back.  However Joyce has a secret that dooms the relationship. She is a dangerous woman who ruins the men who love her.  The world comes crashing down on her and on the men in her life.This is a wellcrafted story that keeps the viewer intrigued from beginning to end.  Davis is electrifying in the role.  I consider this and her performance in All About Eve' where she also played a bitter actress to be her best.  She throws herself into the role and delivers a performance that ranges from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows.  She won her first of two Academy Awards for this film and went on to be nominated a total of 13 times.This film is a must for anyone interested in Ms. Davis body of work and for the classic film buff in general.  I rated it a 10.  It is a terrific story that is enhanced by a riveting performance by one of the legends of film.".

Less flighty but still quite close to Mildred Rogers Joyce Heath is one of those women that need a quick reality check in order to bring them back to Earth. At the start of the movie she is this washedup actress who's taken to drinking herself into a near coma and is practically panting in selfhatred.

A late twist in DANGEROUS doesn't quite work as much as to leave Tone and Davis hanging and in a doomed relationship situation but it's really secondary even when John Eldridge playing Davis' slacker husband who won't grant her a divorce is creepy but brief.

	schema:reviewBody "DANGEROUS is best remembered for being the film that won actress Bette Davis her first Best Actress Academy Award. Her presence breathes life into this comatose production and for that alone the film receives a '5' rating from me.A woeful inadequate script severely hampers what could have been a ponderous memorable film. Davis as alcoholic actress Joyce Heath is required to spout such drivel as Oh I love you I love you I love you for bringing me back to life! Similar garbage lines to this fasttracked John Gilbert's descent from silent stardom to talkies disaster yet Davis won an Oscar for her role. Go figure.Of course the Academy has handed out plenty of undeserved acting awards over the years. Think of Katharine Hepburn in MORNING GLORY and Mary Pickord in COQUETTE and that's just for starters. Davis was better in at least two dozen other films. See Davis in DARK VICTORY THE LETTER THE LITTLE FOXES or ALL ABOUT EVE if you want a truly great performance. Her Oscar win here is often thought of as a holdover award for her work in the 1934 drama OF HUMAN BONDAGE. Indeed Joyce Heath seems to be channeling Mildred Rogers when she hurls abuse at the man who is trying valiantly to help her without the horrible Cockney accent thank God.DANGEROUS appears to be a reversal of the superior 1932 film WHAT PRICE Hollywood with an actress instead of an actor needing to be rescued from the throes of despair. Unfortunately DANGEROUS lacks any of the deep insight into alcoholism although Davis makes a believable drunk or the human condition that could have made it into a compelling film. It instead opts for long drawnout speeches that seem to stretch the relatively short running time by a mile.Franchot Tone plays Davis' love interest who meets herplastered in a seedy bar. Tone is always worthwhile to watch onscreen yet he fails to do anything particularly memorable with his character here check him out in MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY if you want to see a terrific Tone performance. At least Davis manages to amp some of her bad lines up a notch in her delivery. Tone never really looks at ease in his role and the expression on his face seems to say 'My God get me out of this dog...and fast'. He does generate some electricity with Davis in their love scenes yet these moments are also lacking in emotional intensity or complexity.There is nothing really remarkable in DANGEROUS in terms of production design cinematography editing or costuming. The direction is particularly uninspired with only a few despairing closeups of Davis here and there changing the pace and outlook of the film. The twist near the film's conclusion is meant to knock the viewer for six yet comes off looking fairly predictable. The actor playing Davis' first husband is just plain terrible. Margaret Linsday gets a thankless role in support and is fairly wooden as the goodgirl socialite.Watch it for Davis yet nothing else. 510.".

The fact that she couldn't see it for the stinker it was only means that she was desperate for the opportunity to break the mold and play bad girls. This movie ties itself into absolute knots in order to redeem her for its final moments but that is only the most egregious of its many many flaws. Let's seethe wooden Franchot Tone the wooden dialog the invented quotations from the scripts that Joyce Heath is playing are truly absurd and the fact that the script is so threadbare that there is a lift of the most famous Davis dialog from Of Human Bondage.

To make up for her being denied it in 1934 as waitress Mildred Rogers in the Sumerset Maugham classic Of human Bondage. Bette Davis' performance as the down and out former Broadway actress Joyce Heath could have easily have won her that coveted award. Even without the Acadamy's member feeling guilty for not giving it to her the year before. In some cheap gin joint Joyce is spotted by socialite architect Donald Don Berrows Franchot Tone who's out painting the town red and green with his fiance the beautiful and blueblooded Gail Armitage Margaret Lindsay and his friend Ted Dick Foran. Telling the two that he has to take care of some pressing business Don goes to see Joyce and after buying her a drink tells her what an impact she made on his life after he first saw her in a play some five years ago. Joyce had convinced Don to go into a life of creativity architecture just by seeing her stunning and creative performance on the theater stage. Taking Joyce to his country home to dry out Don falls in love with her which causes him to worry about his upcoming marriage to Gail whom he feels he's cheating on. Breaking the truth to Gail about his and Joyce's feelings for each other and how even if he breaks up with her which he fully intended to doit would never be the same between them. Gail hurt and upset gives Don back his engagement ring and calls ittheir upcoming marriagequits.In an effort to revive Joyce's career Don get's Broadway producer George Sheffield Pierre Watkin to direct the play But to Die which Joyce was to star in. Don in turn puts up 80000.00 of his own money to finance the play. With Joyce back in top form opening night looks like it would be a complete success but there's one thing that she didn't tell Don about her past. Something that will later come back to haunt her and that's that she can never marry him! Joyce is already married and her husband Gordon Alison Skipworth the man who's career she destroyed will never give her a divorce! The only way Joyce can get him out of being married to her is like the saying goes Untill Death do Us Part.Bette Davis' performance in Dangerous lifts up the movie far above the soapopera that it's script would have made it with a lesser talented actress. The fine supporting cast also greatly helps Miss.Davis pull the whole thing off successfully. The ending of Dangerousis nowhere as predictable as you would have thought in a at first sight predictable movie. Joyce seeing the light and instead of hurting the two men in her life Don  Gordon uses her selfish destructive and unfeeling personality for the very last time that in a strange twist of fate straightened out all the loose ends in the movie. It was that decision on Joyce's brought that her back to the life that she discarded so long ago that she thought she'll never have again.".

Before long she practically begins to run his life while showing little to no gratitude he goes so far as to neglect work and fiance' over his constant attentions for her! Eventually she sees the error of her ways he finds the courage to break off his engagement and even lands her a comeback in the role she had always wanted to play. This being a melodrama however things do not quite go as planned the actress not only 'falls off the wagon' during the rehearsal period due to insecurity but Tone himself keeps harassing her with a marriage proposal  which cannot be honoured because unbeknownst to him she is already married! When her husband who considers Davis his mealticket refuses to give her a divorce she decides to take matters into her own hands...In the end the film remains eminently watchable for several reasons not least the recognizable Warner Bros. style  but sensibly it pales beside the performances that would constitute the star's greatest years which were still ahead of her 19381946.".

The object of her displeasure is Franchot Tone who tries to rescue her from her alcoholism and rehabilitate her career. And maybe try to hit on her. But she's a jinx and a malicemouth and he's engaged and this isn't working out.Bette gives a typically brilliant performance in a movie with a plot line that's been done before and breaks no new ground probably so even in the mid30's. The ending is Hays Officeinduced and not as satisfying as it could have been. Franchot Tone is not in top form here and is somewhat mechanical and the great Alison Skipworth is wasted in a small insignificant part. Dangerous is worth seeing for Bette Davis and to compare this film with her earlier picture. See if you don't agree she was gypped.".

It's as if she didn't believe in the part either and was content to act it out with a display of superficial mannerisms. Franchot Tone gives an equally shallow characterization while George Eldredge's portrayal of Miss Davis's husband admittedly he has some incredible lines must rank as one of the most amazingly inept of the 1930s. The rest of the cast is a bit more competent though aside from Margaret Lindsay's attractive socialite and Alison Skipworth's housekeeper she is wasted in this menial part the roles are quite small.For the most part director Alfred E.

	schema:reviewBody "DANGEROUS Warner Brothers 1935 directed by Alfred E. Green may not have become an aboveaverage Bette Davis drama by today's standards but it did become the first of two feature films to win Bette Davis the Academy Award as Best Actress. While Davis' performance as the unsympathetic Mildred in OF HUMAN BONDAGE RKO Radio 1934 starring Leslie Howard should have at least earned her a nomination for her standout performance many claimed Davis got the award for DANGEROUS as an oversight from the earlier film. Regardless of how Davis won for DANGEROUS it slowly but surely paved the way for better acting roles ahead and her second Academy Award win for JEZEBEL 1938 and other nominations that were to follow.DANGEROUS opens in a crowded New York street where Roger Farnsworth Walter Walter notices Joyce Heath Bette Davis passing by in an alcoholic haze. Going inside for cocktails in a gathering of men consisting of Charles Melton George Irving Reed Walsh William B. Davidson Don Bellows Franchot Tone and later Pitt Hanley Richard Carle a discussion occurs to whatever happened to Joyce Heath a once popular leading actress of the Broadway stage. It is learned that the downward path for this now downandout actress started when her leading man died followed by a series of other unfortunate circumstances to label her a jinx. Don claims he owes a lot to Joyce Heath for his profession as a successful architect. Later that evening Dan along with Gail Armitage Margaret Lindsay his socialite fiance and close friend Teddy Dick Foran have an evening on the town before Dan has Teddy escort Gail home so he could attend to the drunken Joyce Heath whom he had noticed earlier in a dive of Jerry's Joint surrounded by an assortment of cheap drinks. After passing out while acting out her role from Romeo and Juliet Don takes her to his Old Quinn farmhouse in the country where he and housekeeper Widow Williams Alison Skipworth look after her. Regardless of Mrs. Williams labeling this poor unfortunate girl as Dangerous Don does everything in his power to help her regardless of her outbursts. During the course of time Don breaks his engagement to Gail so he could spend more time helping Joyce break her theatrical superstition. He arranges for her to star in But to Die an upcoming play for producer George Sheffield Pierre Watkin. Dan even finances 80000 of his own money to do it. All goes well until Dan proposes marriage to Joyce and later finding she being in a serious car accident with a strange man John Eldredge reportedly connected to Joyce's mysterious past.Of the five 1935 film releases to star Bette Davis DANGEROUS is certainly a worthy offering next to BORDERTOWN opposite Paul Muni. Aside from OF HUMAN BONDAGE DANGEROUS marked the official start to what would develop into the Bette Davis method of acting. Her opening scene where she denies ever being Joyce Heath remedies that along with her alcoholic binges that followed. It's no doubt the transformation where her Joyce character realizes her selfdestruction and destruction to others around her was enough for honor Davis as being the second actress to win the Academy Award for playing an actress in this instance on stage as well as off. Franchot Tone on loan from assignment from MetroGoldwynMayer and second for Warners Tone sets the tone as one out to help a woman wanting no help from him or anyone. Tone even goes through similar defeats as Leslie Howard did in OF HUMAN BONDAGE where Joyce tells him how she really feels about him through wording strong enough to cause hard feelings. Aside from the frequent underscoring to the recent song Mine Alone that was introduced by Everett Marshall in I LIVE FOR LOVE 1935 the scene that stands out most during its 78 minutes is where Joyce drives a speeding automobile into a tree in the middle of a country road in order to settle a score. This highlight alone was later clipped and profiled into a document tribute to Warner Brothers thirties films of The Movie Crazy Years 1971.As with most successful films DANGEROUS served as the basis for a semiremake titled SINGAPORE WOMAN Warner Brothers 1941 starring Brenda Marshall. As with most remakes it failed in comparison. Formerly distributed to video cassette and available on DVD DANGEROUS which seems to improve with repeated viewings can be seen and studied whenever broadcast on the Turner Classic Movies cable network.

	schema:reviewBody "Dilwale made me glad to be a Westerner just so I could experience the sheer rush in the glorious way this film simply throws its Indian sensibility in your face. It is one of the most completely openly joyful films I have ever seen. In many ways a totally Western film it is yet completely unWestern and absolutely invigorating.I found the rather oddly looped in places mix of Hindi and English dialog to be a lot of fun to follow as incomplete as the subtitles sometimes seemed. The IndianWestern pop structure of the songs was entertaining and infectious. The choreography is simply amazing and some of the most sheerly athletic I've seen. The Indian roots of the dance routines were at first almost unnervingat once familiar yet bizarre almost surreal to my Western eyes. It was sheer fun making the cultural adjustment.The plot is predictable almost pedestriancertainly not what you'd call never done before and yet I found myself completely absorbed in the story and rooting for the main characters. This is in large part due to Shahrukh Khan's and Kajol's performances as Raj and Simran. He is totally endearing and she is totally hot! and their on screen chemistry is as cute  perky and smoldering  steamy as Fred and Ginger at their peak. It was simply put fun to watch them having so much fun.Director Aditya Chopra was I understand only 24 when he made Dilwale and the film was so successful its Indian first run lasted a worldrecord 11 years and may still be going on as far as I know. A heckuva testimony to Bollywood indeed. This movie has instantly become one of my favorite musicals and I look forward to finding more films from Chopra Khan and Kajol. What a treat!".

He is totally endearing and she is totally hot! and their on screen chemistry is as cute  perky and smoldering  steamy as Fred and Ginger at their peak. It was simply put fun to watch them having so much fun.Director Aditya Chopra was I understand only 24 when he made Dilwale and the film was so successful its Indian first run lasted a worldrecord 11 years and may still be going on as far as I know. A heckuva testimony to Bollywood indeed. This movie has instantly become one of my favorite musicals and I look forward to finding more films from Chopra Khan and Kajol. What a treat!";

Debutant director Aditya Chopra so perfectly brings these two together at the backdrop of a realistic family setting that its hard not to fall in love with them. Its chemistry at its finest. For Srk it was his first Raj characterplaygirl type guy with the right values and morals which he plays to perfection. For Kajol DDLJ was a career making movie. As Simran she's beautiful sweet sensitive and a bit stuckup too. Thank god Madhuri didn't have the dates to work in DDLJ cuz no actress suits Srk better then Kajol. There are countless heartwarming scenes between em' in DDLJ. Each one of them is uniquely different and just as much fun to watch. The entire setting of DDLJ is very simplistic which brings out that special oomph in their romance. The songs are firstclass. The strong supporting cast of Amrish Puri Farida Jalal Anupam Kher and Satish Shah definitely helped the movie to become the classic as its now seen as.Bottomline DDLJ is 'romantic comedy' with Indian emotions at its peak. From the cast chemistry music direction and the awesome pairing of SrkKajol....its perfect!".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently took a class about India in college and towards the end of the semester we watched a few clips from some Bollywood and Tamil movies. I was very moved and inspired by the clips alone! Then I told my friend who happens to be Indian from my work study job invited to an Indian Movie Night at her dorm. We watched K3G and I was so touched by it! It was simply wonderful. Most of all I became a SRK and Kajol fan. Their onscreen chemistry is remarkable! I can't explain it! Anyhoo I asked my mom for some Bollywood movies for Christmas and one of the movies I got was DDLJ. And let me tell ya'll it is now my favorite movie of all time. SRK and Kajol shine beyond reason in this flick. The script is excellent everything is excellent especially the acting and memorable songs! The supporting cast most notably Simran parents sister and Raj's dad were figging awesome! Mr. Amish sic Puri who played Kajol's dad acts wonderfully with just his eyes! One of the funniest lines in the movie is when Raj's friend walks into Simran's dad store and says Uncle can I have some beer?! Gosh it's the way that cat said the line that made it so FUNNY! After watching it again yesterday I realized that I love so many Hollywood movies particularly classic ones and yet I couldn't state my all time favorite one. But while watching the making of DDLJ I own the special edition version with two DVD's inside I became rather teary eyed. I mean I'm getting teary eyed writing this review at this moment! This film touched not only my heart but my soul as well. They are so many underlying messages in DDLJ that can strike a cord in a nonIndian's like me I'm Nigerian American soul. In end I hope people who read this will buy DDLJ Renting will be useless because you'll want to watch it over and over again... love this priceless gem of a movie and this goes out to the girls wanna come...fall in love with a cool crazy sexy guy like Raj!PS THIS IS THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!".

With his first film he got rave reviews and was immediately classified as one of the best directors in Indian Cinema. With DDLJ Aditya showed us what falling in love respect and family values are all about. This film also confirmed the Pair of Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol as one of the best in the Indian Cinema. It made Kajol and Shah Rukh superstars over night and two of the most sought after actors.DDLJ also started the trend of love stories in Indian Cinema. Before DDLJ most Indian films were action films. But DDLJ changed all that and the way of war was changed to a way of love. It's incredible how this film changed the Indian Cinema and the way of making films. DDLJ is a Forever Classic.It recently set a new record for the longest running film when it crossed the 500th week mark that means it's a 10 time golden jubilee the previous record was 275 weeks and was held by SHOLAY another forever classic. All I can say is you must watch this movie because After Raj met Simran love wasn't the same...come fall in love all over again.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was the top Bollywood film of the 90s and after seeing it I really can't think of one that was better. There are some that are just as good but I can't recall seeing one that's better. The story's pretty routine boy meets girl in Europe they fall in love girl is engaged to some other idiot and the rest writes itself... Sound familiar? Well it wasn't back in '95 or even if it was it wasn't done as well and Aditya Chopra's treatment of the story was a big reason for it's success. In every other movie the couple first wants to kill each other before falling in love. But in this movie it's slightly different and more plausible. Shahrukh doesn't want to kill Kahol  I mean Kajol  and she doesn't really hate him either she just like the rest of us is annoyed by the guy. Their situations aren't that farfetched and their Europe storyline is played out quite realistically of course the piano scene is an exception. This was the beginning of the Shahrukh plays Shahrukh era and for what it's worth he hasn't made a better movie or given a better performance since. Sure there are places where he overacts but there are just as many places where he's able to hit all his cues. His comic timing was never better and there was still some sincerity in his eyes a reminder of the fact that he was still an actor which has since been replaced by the cockiness of a megastar. This is the movie that shot him to superstardom and put him alongside Aamir and Salman. Kajol is just as good if not better and I think after their next movie they'll win the Nobel Prize for Chemistry. The supporting cast is fine although no one really stands out. There are many moments in the film most notably in the script where you might feel a sense of deja vu. But keep in mind that this was the original it's everything else that's a rehash. Bollywood headed straight for the sewer after this movie with almost all films many of them starring Shahrukh copying the same formula. Even at its 3 hour length the movie never drags till after the twohour mark. I also want to comment on the film's Art Direction because it warrants a mention. Whether it's in Europe England or India the movie has a very natural look to it. Unlike today's big films like Dil To Pagal Hai or K3G this movie looks good without trying to look good and I think that's a quality that's been lost on today's films. Too much attention is spent on the look at the expense of the story if there is one!. The soundtrack of course is a classic truly one of the alltime bests with almost every song being a hit. The film won an unprecedented number of awards while breaking many records. There was a feeling that Aditya would follow in his father Yash's footsteps but regrettably the pressure got to him. He followed this up with the dreadful Mohabbatein which was slammed by audiences and critics alike. But so what. His first film was good and with the current state of Bollywood movies  Devdas anyone?  you really can't get better than this.".

	schema:headline " The beauty of mainstream Hindi cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "Aditya Chopra's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is a superb example of the genius of Hindi commercial cinema. If you see it you'll get that it's not very different as a love story. It is even ordinary. But it becomes special for many reasons. First and foremost for its fresh naive spirit. Secondly the many paradoxes it contains it is powerful yet subtle largerthanlife yet simple funny yet sad magical yet realistic and so on. Thirdly it is one of the first films portraying Indians who live outside their country in this case London. It also shows the yearning of the firstgeneration NRIs who live far away from their homeland and for many reasons find it difficult to come back. Yet the film remains mainly a poignant melancholic romance. Raj and Simran the characters played by Shahrukh Khan and Kajol represent the last generation of youngsters who were innocent and naive. They were much more simple respectful and full of life. Such people almost no longer exist nowadays. The film relates their love story in a rather mesmerising way. Every scene is important. There are many great moments in the film. Raj and Simran's entire acquaintance and interaction in the first half is charming. Their separation at the end of the first half when both make each other understand of their true feelings without explicitly admitting it is moving. The traditional wedding preparations in the second half are wellmade the values they show Raj's attempts to conquer Simran's father and the couple's deepening relationship are interesting. The only thing I regretted was the typical fight scene towards the end.Shahrukh Khan and Kajol who undoubtedly form a great film couple are both excellent in their roles. They act from the heart and ably bring their characters to life. Shahrukh Khan is incredible as Raj a modern guy who understands the value of family and marriage and yet he has the look of a careless fool who does not take anything seriously. Khan acts with great ease wit and humour and his inner fear of losing his beloved is always understood. Kajol as the dreamy and poetic yet intransigent and smart Simran is exceptional and she looks very hot throughout. Amrish Puri and Farida Jalal as Simran's parents provide great support. Amrish Puri is particularly impressive as the strict but softhearted father and Jalal is touching as the woman who has lived life according to terms and does not want the same to happen to her daughter. Anupam Kher is funny and entertaining as Raj's father. The film's soundtrack is outstanding and is clearly one of the main reasons this film works so well and is unforgettable today. The music is very well identified with the film and its story. Just try to imagine you would be given to watch the movie with the songs edited out. You wouldn't want to right? That's because every song is a gem and is as important as every other scene. Every song comes in the right place and is sung and pictured exceptionally well. The one closest to my heart is Ho Gaya Hai Tujhko for its beautiful melody and very melancholic feel which is aided by its blend of fantasy and reality onscreen. It is performed to perfection by Lata Mangeshkar and Udit Narayan. DDLJ is a film that should not be missed by anyone. It is one of the great gifts of Yash Chopra and his banner. It is a milestone of Indian cinema for its ability to inject fresh and magical energies into a banal love story and for making it classically memorable.".

It is even ordinary. But it becomes special for many reasons. First and foremost for its fresh naive spirit. Secondly the many paradoxes it contains it is powerful yet subtle largerthanlife yet simple funny yet sad magical yet realistic and so on. Thirdly it is one of the first films portraying Indians who live outside their country in this case London. It also shows the yearning of the firstgeneration NRIs who live far away from their homeland and for many reasons find it difficult to come back. Yet the film remains mainly a poignant melancholic romance. Raj and Simran the characters played by Shahrukh Khan and Kajol represent the last generation of youngsters who were innocent and naive. They were much more simple respectful and full of life. Such people almost no longer exist nowadays. The film relates their love story in a rather mesmerising way. Every scene is important. There are many great moments in the film. Raj and Simran's entire acquaintance and interaction in the first half is charming. Their separation at the end of the first half when both make each other understand of their true feelings without explicitly admitting it is moving. The traditional wedding preparations in the second half are wellmade the values they show Raj's attempts to conquer Simran's father and the couple's deepening relationship are interesting. The only thing I regretted was the typical fight scene towards the end.Shahrukh Khan and Kajol who undoubtedly form a great film couple are both excellent in their roles. They act from the heart and ably bring their characters to life. Shahrukh Khan is incredible as Raj a modern guy who understands the value of family and marriage and yet he has the look of a careless fool who does not take anything seriously. Khan acts with great ease wit and humour and his inner fear of losing his beloved is always understood. Kajol as the dreamy and poetic yet intransigent and smart Simran is exceptional and she looks very hot throughout. Amrish Puri and Farida Jalal as Simran's parents provide great support. Amrish Puri is particularly impressive as the strict but softhearted father and Jalal is touching as the woman who has lived life according to terms and does not want the same to happen to her daughter. Anupam Kher is funny and entertaining as Raj's father. The film's soundtrack is outstanding and is clearly one of the main reasons this film works so well and is unforgettable today. The music is very well identified with the film and its story. Just try to imagine you would be given to watch the movie with the songs edited out. You wouldn't want to right? That's because every song is a gem and is as important as every other scene. Every song comes in the right place and is sung and pictured exceptionally well. The one closest to my heart is Ho Gaya Hai Tujhko for its beautiful melody and very melancholic feel which is aided by its blend of fantasy and reality onscreen. It is performed to perfection by Lata Mangeshkar and Udit Narayan. DDLJ is a film that should not be missed by anyone. It is one of the great gifts of Yash Chopra and his banner. It is a milestone of Indian cinema for its ability to inject fresh and magical energies into a banal love story and for making it classically memorable.";

First of all Shahrukh Khan and Kajol are the perfect couple. They interact so well everything fits. Second The music is so great I played the DVD a week or so until I got the CD. Third we first see the cultural environment of London and Europe which is contrasted very nice against India with all the fantastic colourful clothing. Fourth nice story components and Dialugues. The only reason for me not to give full 10 stars is because off the dreadful late 80ies clothes obviously the 80ties in India lastet deep into the nineties and because I want to spare a star for Khabi Khushi Khabi Gham which is in my opinion still the best Hindi movie ever.".

	schema:headline " First mainstream Bollywood film";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm not going to get too much into reviewing the story of this movie most of the other reviews are covering that for you. Honestly I don't remember too much the story that well anyways beyond the basics. Besides this is a Bollywood film you know the melodramatic story of a boy and girl who fall in love against their parents wishes. I'll stick to a more cultural commentary. I remember 1995's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge being a good movie that dealt with second generation Indians living in England. This was a funny film that struck a chord with younger Indians living in Western countries around the world and it was an obvious smash hit in India as well. Let me say that every country in the world has something cool or bad ass about it. But India has often had the most uncool nerdy stereotypes about it. When I was growing up in the 80s and 90s most of the representation of Indians in Western culture was limited to Apu from The Simpsons. Taxi drivers convenience store clerks curry cow worshipers more curry thick English accents effeminate men and hairy women... nothing here was ever cool these stereotypes are still here yet are finally changing albeit slowly. What kind of crazy kid wanted to be Indian? If I could have gotten away with passing myself off as a Mexican I probably would have tried it. But then there was Bollywood showcasing the beautiful people of India that could dance and sing just as good as anyone on MTV. This was the cool side to India. It made India look beautiful exotic young hip and cultured. One of the biggest audiences for Bollywood flicks outside of India had traditionally been Indian girls. Older audiences obviously watched too but young Indian women growing up in America have always been keen to Bollywood many years before the arrival of DDLJ. Bollywood models gharba dances since as long as I can remember Indian girls immediately zeroed in on knowing that Bollywood was a cool piece of Indian pop culture that nonIndians didn't have access too or couldn't immediately claim as theirs. Instead of being impenetrably foreign this industry made India look much more exotic. I suppose it's the better balance to all those National Geographic specials that showed nomads in India eating the most disgusting things imaginable. Like all Indian movies Bollywood flicks are overacted with dumb plots and idiotic fight scenes but it involves outrageously beautiful people dancing and singing and that's always going to be cool. Beautiful people can make almost anything look cool. If Apu from The Simpsons has an arranged marriage then from the Western point of view it may look backward cruel and dorky. If Aishwarya Rai or Hrithik Roshan has an arranged marriage then it seems much more exotic and cultured...hey maybe there's something to the concept. Beautiful or well accomplished people can turn previously weirdo things about a country into something cooler then it used to be perceived as. People are damn superficial aren't they? Bollywood stars all being so fair skinned is a topic for another time But DDLJ had a cross over appeal that didn't just include Indian girls. It was the first film that I remember being big amongst Indians. When I say it was mainstream I don't really mean that it fully crossed over into nonIndian audiences though I know it did but rather this is was the first Bollywood movie that I remember that was widely talked about and had immense appeal among many different types of Indian American audiences. Before the release of this film Bollywood movies seemed to exist in their own little niche of loyal cult followers usually young Indian women. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge broke some of the rules and didn't just appeal to Indian girls who wished they could be in a Bollywood movie and marry some hunky fair skinned North Indian guy. No this film had an exposure to a broader audience that seemed to really put Bollywood on the map for Indians that grew up outside of India. Indian guys were into this film yeah probably because Indian girls were into it but it was big change from what was going on before. A movie about second generation Indians was automatically going to appeal to every Indian growing up in Europe Canada Australia and of course the U.S. This was newer territory and since then Bollywood films have increasingly become more youth targeted in their marketing campaigns. Despite plenty of moments of stupidity I remember a ridiculous Yeeeeeeaahhhhhhhh!! yell by Raj during a game of rugby this movie was the beginning of a small change in Indian culture. Indian exposure to nonIndians and the dispelling of stereotypes is still very much a work in progress and people are unlikely to mention DDLJ on history papers in the future but it had a milestone effect in my opinion within the community. The overtly glitzy Hrithik Roshan stuff today in 2006 seems a bit more aimed at preteen girls so it's gone even younger but DDLJ was the most talked about film in the 90s. 11 years have gone by Shahrukh Khan is nearly 41 years old he's basically an Uncle today a status a lot of GenX Indian Americans are creeping towards. Of course Bollywood is a silly representation of India it's like someone in Mumbai watching Rambo and thinking that's America. But for a brief moment in the mid 90s people were united in talking about this Hindi movie regardless if they spoke Hindi Tamil or Malayalam. The movie had a great cast and awesome dance numbers along with a more humorous angle then previous flicks I had seen. Recommended.".

As you may have guessed it is a 3 way story. Raj Shahrukh Khan is a modern Indian guy living in London with his father played by Anupam Kher. He decides to go on a Eurorail holiday with a couple of his friends and easily gets his rich father's approval. Simran Kajol also lives in London but is of much more traditional upbringing in part due to her strict father Amrish Puri. Her father starts to reckon that it is time for her to get married. She has no option but to agree. However she asks her father for the chance to see Europe once with her friends and Amrish Puri is not keen on this at all. Much persuasion follows and reluctantly he agrees.As luck would have it Raj and Simran and both of their sets of friends end up on the same train and visiting the same places in Europe. At first she detests him. However she eventually becomes stranded in a remote part of Switzerland with him. All their friends are in the next location. Time passes songs are sung and lo and behold the two begin to fall in love.The first part of the film ends as the two characters are back in London with their respective families. Amrish Puri overhears Simran talking about the events of the holiday and hits the roof. He packs the bags and takes his family back to the small village in Punjab where they come from. Raj is spurred on by Anupam Kher who says if something is worth having he must chase after it.The second part of the film consists of Raj trying to win the trust and confidence of Simran's Punjabi family. It consists of several excellent comedy and song scenes. I will leave you to guess what happens in the end.This film does not really warrant superlatives. It is better than excellent. It is as near perfect as we are likely to ever see. Like I say if you have not seen this film where have you been? The soundtrack is classic. Everyone knows the words to Tujhe dekha to yeh jaana sanam and Mehndi laga ke rakhna.The performance of the actors is first class. This really is the film that took Shahrukh to superstardom. Kajol also gives an incredible performance. This is the role that really made her name and deservedly so. Anupam Kher does a top comedy role and all the other actors have put in a magnificent performance.This really is a feelgood movie. If you have not seen it yet make it your next priority to see the film. If you have watch it again! This film along with Hum Aapke Hain Kaun and more recently Kuch Kuch Hota Hai are the quintessential 1990's definition of excellent Hindi cinema.

It was hilarious and felt heart warming! I think everyone in the film did a great job. It made Shah rukh Khan rise to more fame as well as Kajol because people wanted to see them act together more because of the chemistry between them. this movie and Devdas is a great credit to shahrukh khan because you can see how Shah rukh khan has matured through acting. the best part of the film is the fact that you see in other films where the lovers both want to runaway because the parents wont let them be together whereas this film suggests that running away doesn't solve the problem. the other factor makes the film better is the fact that shahrukh khan himself went through the similar situation in 1994.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is for anyone who has forgotten the meaning of life. It clearly demonstrates the power of love and its ability to move heaven and earth. This is much more than a movie. It is a gift for those whose hearts have been hurt abused and misused. It is one of those rare occurrences where you can witness the real heart of Mother India in all her unobstructed glory. Shahrukh Kahn who plays Raj is not merely an actor. He is the incarnation of one of those great Indian souls or teachers who is the embodiment of love. It is an incomparable privilege here to see him in his element. Amrish Puri is the quintessential Indian patriarch who is immovable in his dignity and beliefs. Beliefs that for him mean no less than the continuation of his Hindu ancestry. Kajol who plays Simran is a true Indian princess. She will not disobey her father but she cannot ignore her heart or her love with Raj. I cannot praise Aditya Chopra enough for bringing this masterpiece to life. The direction is romantic sweeping you up with every scene. You do not feel you are watching a film as much as experiencing a whirlwind. I must also mention that the music is true joy and inspiration and is essential to the whole package. The title song is magnificent. Thank you JatinLalit. This film will make you feel like you have not felt in a long time. See this movie and live again.".

So if you are feeling like to watch some musical drama go for it again and again. One can also watch maine pyar kiya jab we met socha na tha etc for similar entertainment.

The songs and dances are truly amazing and unlike some people believe the characterisation has depth. I should know because I had to discuss the different distinctive traits that make up all the characters in DDLJ in my exam and people would be surprised at just how layered and complex they are if they took the time to pay attention if you don't believe me read the BFI book on the movie.Also the picture has no pretentiousness unlike Devdas which was so melodramatic I'm surprised the whole cast didn't die from the agony of having to act in such an overrated and over the top Romeo and Juliet ripoff people scream all the time especially Aishwarya Rai who is the most hysterical of them all DDLJ succeeds exactly because it's happy just giving us a magical young love story which we could all relate to anyway but which is made even better because of the 1st rate performances given by everyone involved.Kudos to Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol my two favourite Bollywood actors for creating such an intense believable yet innocent and pure chemistry that made their love scenes just so sweet beautiful and really heartfelt to watch.I'm not saying that just because we are capable of enjoying this movie we aren't capable of enjoying something more intellectual and political like Battleship Potemkin.But it's nice to watch a movie once in a while that is not depressing nor always giving us extreme scenes of violence and sex with which Hollywood seems to be obsessed with.Nowadays movies just seem to feature people who think life is not worth living are always suicidal and spend their time doing sex and drugs. Maybe these sort of characters should be pitied or something but frankly they're beginning to bore me. I've seen enough movies featuring these sort of personages to last me a lifetime. Give me a character who's happy with life and not afraid to have fun anytime!Much like the celebrated Singin' In The Rain DDLJ is fun leaves you feeling elated has funny dialogue and you can feel the love that everybody involved felt about the production which increases the quality of the picture!".

Then she asks him what happened last night and off course he makes a joke that something happened. But just then you see his magic when he tries to comfort Kajol by saying I know what you think of me you think I'm a wastrel.

Anyways where the movie is concerned there can't be anything so sweet and simple as the love shown between the two leads.When this movie completed 500 weeks i actually went and saw it all over again in the hall just to relive the charisma and magic of the movie and the feeling of the true love and romance that this movie generates and one on which i have grown up.The caption 'Come.....fall in love' seems to be made for this movie as as many times as u watch it you will fall in love again and again not just with the movie or shahrukh or the chemistry of the lead pair but also with the very emotion called LOVE!!!!!!!Now about the movie....well i won't be doing justice if i name anyone mindblowing scene as all of them are just too good.But still one scene does no matter what remain my fave is the one towards the end of the Europe trip where Shahrukh and Kajol are standing on the bridge where he questions her what if you would have fallen in love with someone on this tripsay for example methen also will you still go and get married.On this kajol just stares and him and when he just laughs and says i was joking.She just gives him an exasperated look and walks away.He just stands there and chants...PalatPalatwilling her to turn around and look at him if she loves him.The moment she looks back at him as she is boarding the train he just jumps up with true unadulterated joy of a man truly in love.The thing that pulls at my heart string is the very innocence of the feelings portrayed by the two of them.Well i can keep raving about this movie all day so closing on the note that its a must watch for all those who are in love.believe in it or have ever loved anyone.You will find a part of your love story shown in some or the other scene of the movie......COME.......FALL IN LOVE!!!!!!!!".

However I would take a point out for not doing a great job on cinematography  but the movie is truly a superb from every other aspect so felt bad taking a point off. The Switzerland alps look great as backdrops however a true cinematographer can create the magic in its absence too!Direction  script superb! Kudos to Aditya Chopra on an awesome job. Many Hindi movies focus so much on lead characters sometimes they forget the supporting cast. This movie shows the supporting cast are not just a prop for the story they have characters too! You cannot ignore a single character  apart from major characters like the Father of bride Amrish Puri mother Farida Jalal even the characters of Kuljit  his father Satish Shah too are well taken care of! Very few movies like Sholay are so strong on giving importance to each and every characters.The movie truly deserves all the 11 awards it got! The movie is surely the best for the SRK  Kajol duo. It touches every sense beautifully so you never feel tired of watching it over and over again.Music It may not be the best Jatin Lalit has every produced but it perfectly suits the movie. And of course all the songs have been very well choreographed so the music video is imprinted on everyone's mind.This movie was a milestone in opening up Bollywood's business abroad! It's got all the elements that appeals to an NRI audience. Bollywood has never looked back after this movie got so many accolades all over the world.Thanks to Aditya Chopra for crafting such a gem hard to believe its his debut movie!This is the best movie of 90's and surely enough it will remain in top 10 Bollywood has ever produced!".

	schema:reviewBody "I am not familiar with Indian cinema  Bollywood movies and I think this is the first movie I ever saw of this kind. It took me over three hours to watch it entirely3h10m but there was not even one moment I was bored! Basically it's a lovestory about a boy Raj who meets a girl Simran. They start to like eachother and this even goes further they both feel they're destined to eachother and their friendship grows to love. Simran though is about to be given in marriage by her parents to a guy who lives back in India. What happens next is being told in a beautiful and exciting lovestory which I can really recommend to see for anyone! The traditional costumes in the movie and the Indian music and dance make clear what's so different about these kind of movies this one's one of a kind though I am sure! compared to Hollywoodproductions. I very much liked it anyway! Only positive comments are not to be taken seriously so I should think of any negative things. Lemme think... it'll probably be on the technical part of the movie. Fighting scenes are obviously all 'fake' missed kicks and punches the singing parts especially Simran's are obviously lipsynched. Some editing might have been done better maybe in part two?? Don't pay too much attention to these last lines because I as a white European guy still recommend this movie very much!! GO SEE IT!! and judge it yourselfMenno".

	schema:reviewBody "SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON is arguably the most enduring and appealing of John Ford's 'Cavalry' trilogy. While lacking the dramatic core of a fatally flawed central character FORT APACHE or an estranged couple reunited by a headstrong son RIO GRANDE the film offers a richly sentimental tale of a crusty yet endearing career soldier John Wayne  facing retirement in a romanticized West where the cavalry stands as the only defense against the combined might of the Indian nations. The combination of Wayne and the cavalry in SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON is simply unbeatable!Wayne at 42 portrays the sixtyish Capt. Nathan Brittles and under Ford's sure hand is magnificent in the role. Whether chastising young lieutenants Never apologize mister it's a sign of weakness complimenting an enlisted man Keep it up and you'll make a fine corporal in three or four years or kneeling at the grave of his longdead wife to share the news of the day Wayne's performance shows a subtlety and sensitivity that his critics often claimed he lacked. When his commander Major Allshard George O'Brien refuses his request to rescue Lt. Cohill John Agar and two squads who had performed rear guard duty the anguish Wayne shows is heartbreaking. This is an Oscarcaliber performance from a vastly underrated actor.The rest of the cast measures up equally well. Victor McLaglen as irascible as ever plays Irish Top Sergeant Quincannon full of blarney and a bit of whiskey. His morning scenes with Wayne denying he'd been drinking are comic gems. As the young suitors of Joanne Dru who plays a more traditional role than in Howard Hawks' RED RIVER Agar and Harry Carey Jr. are also quite good. The real 'find' of the film however is Ben Johnson in only his second major role. As Sgt. Tyree exConfederate captain and Brittles' best scout Johnson shows an easygoing charm a feigned lack of respect when asked his opinion he'd always begin with That's not my department... then make a deadon assessment and astonishing riding skills not surprising as Johnson had been a champion rodeo rider. A future Oscar winner he displays a charisma oncamera that would quickly earn him a place in the 'Ford Family' of actors. The visuals of SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON have been frequently compared to Fredric Remington's classic paintings of cavalrymen and Indians and the comparison is justified the film would win an Oscar for it's rich Technicolor photography and images of 'dirty blue' riders on horseback against the stark blue sky and golden hues of Monument Valley are very reminiscent of the artist's work.SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON is the kind of film you can watch again and again and still find rewarding. It is on my 'short list' of favorite westerns and if you haven't seen it yet you're in for a treat!".

The Monument Valley goes from bright sunlight to hail and sleet...There is a melancholy mixed together in those incredible vistas with a certain sense of dreamlike contemplation... A backdrop so complex but so significant as the human characters...Ford has superbly achieved a huge and composite demonstration of all the legends of the frontier cavalryman... Never have the legendary troops been through the silent 'Indian country' and across the magnificent Western plains so brilliant vivid exciting and romantic... Ford has surely done better himself unquestionably with 'My Darling Clementine' and 'The Searchers' yet one has to admit the undisputed merits of 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.' Even the usual criticism launched against itthat it is a Western influenced by feeling rather by reasoncan be dismissed at the start... Certainly Ford can be sentimental but only when the springs of honest feeling run dry and lose their inspiration and this never really happens in 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.'The story is that of an older cavalry officer John Wayne who is six days from retirement at Fort Stark when he's sent out in a last mission to escort the Major's wife Mildred Natwick and her niece an attractive single lady Joanne Dru out of the danger area... Wayne tries to fulfill his military role protecting his female charges against the uprising of the Sioux Cheyenne Kiowa Comanche and Apaches...Wayne possibly more than any other Western star has recreated and heightened the mythology of the Westone has only to watch again his absolute and ideal image in 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon' or his avenging Ethan in 'The Searchers' to be reminded of how irresistible the Duke has been on the cinema screen...'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon' is above all a sentimental movie with irresistible scenes full of Ford's best touchesThe cavalry engaged in its everyday work... Wayne simply can't picture himself in a world far from the army...The comic interaction between Wayne and Victor McLaglen two hardcore professional officers...The bravery of Sgt. Tyree Ben Johnson chased by hostile Indians who must finish his mission by reporting to the captain what he saw...The rivalry of two young cavalry lieutenants John Agar and Harry Carey Jr. in love with the same woman each competing to have her wear a yellow ribbon as a token of his love...The 'beloved brute' the toughsoft cavalry sergeant sharing his saddle with a little orphan rescued from a devastated stage station...Ford celebrating McLaglen's lachrymose in selfindulgent fisticuffs in an epic saloon fight... The last inspection of the C. troops almost bringing tears to Wayne's and the audience's eyes as he reads the inscription that means so much to him... Wayne riding into the war camp of the Indians to stop a war...The U. S. cavalry at full gallop descending upon the encampment firing wildly and stampeding hundred of Indian ponies...

	schema:reviewBody "There is an ironic point about the production of SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON immediately after FORT APACHE. Most critics agree that Col. Owen Thursday the martinet commander is based on General George Armstrong Custer and that the massacre of his command due to his own pig headedness is the battle of the Little Bighorn. But SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON begins with that moment in the summer of 1876 when the entire frontier was nervous after word came of the destruction of Custer forces. The historic continuity which is amazingly consistent despite minor anachronisms is shown early when Captain Brittles visiting his wife's grave mentions to her the death of Captain Miles Keogh at the Little Bighorn. Historically this is correct. Keogh a hero of the American Civil War served with Custer's Seventh Cavalry and died with his commander and fellows. In fact the only survivor of Custer's forces at that disaster was Keogh's horse Commanche.Captain Brittles has served in the American cavalry for thirty years. He was one of those soldiers who held higher rank in the Civil War with a Brevet but in the cutbacks in the army following the war Custer went from brevet major general to Lt. Col. in the regular armyBrittles had to be satisfied with the rank of Captain. His wife and children died presumably of some epidemic illness at the post  they are buried nearby. His old orderly from the war Quincannon Victor McLaglen is still serving him. But he is facing a crisis. His thirty years means retirement unless the army decides to promote him to Colonel. Despite the debacle in Montana it is not too likely that the politically unconnected Brittles will get the promotion his fine abilities deserve.So we are watching an old soldier slowly fade away in this film. Brittles is aware he has days before he is to leave unless a promotion turns up and he has to try to keep the hot blooded Indian braves impressed at what they just saw Crazy Horse and the Lakota forces accomplish go on the warpath. He also has to keep his two most promising young officers John Agar and Harry Carey Jr. concentrating on their careers rather than fighting over Joanne Dru. He is worried too for Sgt. Quincannon who is likewise going to be leaving the army a few days after Brittles. Will Quincannon's drunken roistering ways ruin his chances to maintain his pension? And he has to keep an eye on the suspicious behavior of the local fort sutler Paul Fix is up to  can he be running guns? Whatever he faces he faces unflinchingly and his motto is never to apologize  it's a sign of weakness.For all the anachronisms listed on this thread such as the 48 star flag in 1876? Ford got the time and place perfect in what counts. Note the fascinating relationship of Brittles and Sgt. Tyree Ben Johnson. 1876 was a crossroad year for the U.S. regarding the results of the Civil War. In the negative a questionable Presidential election result was solidified when three southern states agreed to support the Republican Rutherford Hayes over the Democrat Samuel Tilden in return for the Federal troops being pulled out of the south and the official end of Reconstruction policies benefiting southern AfricanAmericans. One can't deny that is still a stain in American history despite Hayes excellent handling of the Presidency afterwords. But the former foes were finding less and less reason to dislike each other and more and more to admire the grit both sides had shown. During the Civil War Tyree was a Confederate Captain  he was Brittles' equal in rank. Once the war ended after a few years he joins the American Army and rises to the rank of Sergeant. Technically he is not as high a Sergeant as Quincannon who is Brittles' aide. But Brittles constantly treats Tyree as a full equal consulting him again and again on how to move next when going out of the fort to confront the Indian threat. The highpoint of this respect is when one of Tyree's soldiers Trooper Smith turns out to be a former Confederate cavalry leader named Rome Clay and dies of wounds in an action against the Indians. Brittles and his men watch silently while Tyree and his fellow southern soldiers bury Clay properly with his flag the Confederate one.In terms of relations between the whites of the North and South SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON is miles away from the confrontations of say THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND. There John Carridine's northern officer has nothing but fanatical contempt for Dr. Mudd whom he considers evil for helping John Wilkes Booth. Until the end of that film Carridine takes a sadistic interest in making Warner Baxter regret his every move. The events of THE PRISONER was from 1865  1869 when Mudd finally returned to Maryland. This is seven years afterwords.There are other little historical pointers. The rivalry of immigrant groups is shown when Quincannon is facing rival Sergeant Hochbauer who openly dislikes the former as an overbearing Irishman Hochbauer being a German. There is the civilian clothes that are meant for Brittles complete with Muller cutdown hat that Quincannon ends sampling which leads to his hysterically funny fight with Hochbauer and the other soldiers meant to take him to the guardhouse. Quincannon insists he is not out of uniform technically he is but is simply dressed as a retired gentleman should be. Yes in 1876 that would be the dress of a retired gentleman.I like this film. The characterizations of the all the actors are strong and Ford had great set pieces in it. Perhaps not as great a film as THE SEARCHERS which is more meaty and dark but a top notch Western all the same.".

Watch his eyes the sign of a great actor.  It's a wonder he wasn't even nominated for the Academy Award for this role which few in Hollywood could pull off convincingly.It's also a John Wayne western the woman in your life will probably like. Wayne talks tenderly at the grave of his wife and even has a moment of sucking back weeping when his men show their fondness for him.This bittersweet elegaic film about a retiring officer on his last mission doesn't have lots of action in it Ford seems to have thrown in a fistfight with McLaglin just because that actor had little to do and though it's corny it has a wonderful beginning.  Apart from Wayne the reason to watch this is the cinematography.  Monument valley host to myriad westerns never looked better.  They even captured a marvelous thunderstorm in the background in these days before special effects the cinematographer who did snatch an Oscar originally protested the work but Ford made him film the scene and they ended up with one of the most striking natural scenes ever.For years people didn't think Wayne could act.  Some like me grew up on his later postTrue Grit movies when he did tend to walk through his parts more icon than actor.  He didn't have great finesse with his lines neither does a fine actor of today Harrison Ford but his roles rarely called for the nicety of a Jeremy Irons.  In his better movies Wayne proves he's more than just a movie star.  This is his finest hour and may be John Ford's.".

Lucky are we the cinema fans two generations away.She Wore A Yellow Ribbon has John Wayne the embodiment of the thirty year army man. The year of the action of the film which is 1876 has Wayne mentioning in passing that he was at the Battle of Chapultepec in the Mexican War which started in 1846. Wayne's Nathan Brittles was by his account a dirty shirt tailed runaway from his father's Ohio farm when he joined the army. And now he's reached mandatory retirement. He's married and has had a family who he's lost for reasons John Ford doesn't explain in the film. But Wayne dutifully makes his report at their gravesides every night he's at the post.Wayne's seen a lot of military history and a lot of tragedy. With no family left the United States Cavalry is his home and family. He doesn't like the idea of retiring at all. In a later Ford film The Long Gray Line Martin Maher says that all he knows and holds dear is at West Point. Wayne could have said that line himself here.Even though George O'Brien is the commanding officer at Fort Stark Wayne is the father figure for the whole post. And not like some of the others don't behave like children. The whole romantic rivalry between John Agar and Harry Carey Jr. over Joanne Dru seems pretty childish. Cute while in the safety of the post but when out on a mission downright dangerous and Wayne like the good father scolds his kiddies.With some makeup to grey his hair and wrinkle him a might Wayne turns in one of his finest performances on the screen. Harry Carey Jr. wrote what is probably the most evenly balanced portrayal of the Duke in his memoirs In the Company of Heroes. They didn't always get along but Carey says Wayne was an inspiration to him and the other younger cast members. In fact during the scene with the gunrunners Paul Fix and Grant Withers being killed in the Indian camp while Wayne Carey and Agar watch on the ridge the whole idea for the chaw of tobacco bit came from Carey himself but that Wayne encouraged the improvisation as he was wont to do. Other than the Duke my favorite portrayal in the film is that of Ben Johnson as Sergeant Tyree. Wayne recognizes in him a younger version of himself. In fact Tyree is a former Confederate Army captain a fact brought out in the death scene of Trooper Smith another former Confederate who in fact was a general in that army. Ben Johnson was a real cowboy a horse wrangler who John Ford gave a chance to act. He graced many a film with his presence and won himself an Oscar to cap his career in The Last Picture Show.Like in Fort Apache and Rio Grande She Wore a Yellow Ribbon is the story of the professional soldier and the sacrifices he makes when he gives up his civilian status to serve his country. It's a universal theme not just confined to the USA. No one embodied that theme better than did John Wayne as Nathan Brittles in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.".

And it seems likely we won't be seeing them making them like this ever again. This is John Ford at the height of his career at his best doing what he did best. On location in the Monument Valley it is more than fair to say the scenery the colors even the weather along with Ford's cinematography particularly the patient framing of his shots and making full use of the setting and environment in which he filmed are every bit as much stars of this film as are the featured human stars.None of which is to say the human stars weren't good. John Wayne in the lead turned in a remarkable performance. Wayne was 42years old when he made this but he was playing a character much older than that perhaps as much as 20 years older and Wayne pulls it off. He looks and seems like a 60year old man. He showed his acting chops here.Ben Johnson had been around awhile at this point mainly as a stuntman but here he makes one of his first forays into real acting and he does well which no doubt boosted his career.Perennial John Wayne sidekick Harry Carey Jr. is here too at the ripe young age of 28. It occurs to me as I write this in November 2008 that he seems to be the last surviving cast member of this movie.Joanne Dru. What can be said? While this movie was made before I was born Joanne Dru plays the fetching young woman wearing the yellow ribbon and stirring the male ashes deep inside as well as anybody ever could and she was quite fetching indeed. Her performance still striking that chord precisely that way almost 60 years later.Ostensibly this is a western but this movie is actually much more a military movie than just a western. John Ford was a military man himself who ultimately retired as a Navy Reserve Rear Admiral. He knew what the military was all about he understood and enjoyed military life military ways military customs and military culture and he clearly relished making military depictions. So that's what we see here. All that military stuff. Oddly though it all seems out of time in a way. This movie was made in 1949 just a few years after WWII. While making a movie about the cavalry fighting the Indian wars in 1876 the military culture Ford depicted seems more apropos of the 1940s than of the 1870s. For instance I'm just not sold on this version of history where US cavalry men were burdened with and hauled around family members in the wild wild west. Maybe they did but I'm not so sure. It seems much more likely this was a device added to appeal to 1949 audiences. There are other examples of this. This is the only flaw in an otherwise very good movie. And who knows maybe it isn't a flaw at all true or not. It's a good movie. Ford made a movie in which he talked to all those recently mustered out veterans he knew were out there populating his audiences. On that level he succeeds.".

His ageing Captain Nathan Brittles requires him to put in a very fallible human type performance something that he achieves in spades. He's a believable leader who is ruing the calling of time on his career in the service. Yet even Wayne's affecting turn is trumped by some of the the most gorgeous cinematography you could wish to see from the 1940s. Winton Hoch clashed with Ford on the shoot about various perfections both parties equally to blame of course but the final result is incredible. Witness a scene as Brittles visits his dead wife's grave the backdrop is all purple and red a storm is imminent metaphorically and in reality. Has shooting in the desert ever been so colourfully lush?The film leaves an indelible mark on the conscious for its art and performances Joanne Dru Ben Johnson Victor McLaglen  Harry Carey Jr bring their A Game but as a story it just about gets by because John Ford knows his onions and structures it with precision and a genuine love of the genre and material to hand. 810".

This is a film where he pays tribute and his undying admiration to the spirit of adventure of those who dared and had a vision of the majesty of what awaited them as the traveled west.She Wore a Yellow Ribbon is a beautiful film to look at. The glorious Technicolor utilized for the movie stands on its own as the legacy of the director and his cinematographer Winton Hoch whose photography of Monument Valley will remain the yard stick for which other films will be judged. The atmospheric music of Richard Hagerman adds another layer to the texture of this film. John Wayne an actor bigger than life is at the center of the story. He embodies all that meant justice and fairness when things weren't so orderly in the country. Victor McLaglen makes an excellent appearance as Sgt. Quincannon. John Agar and Ben Johnson did good work as the two cavalry officers in love with the same woman. Mildred Natwick was good as Abby Alshard a no nonsense woman who has seen a lot. Ultimately Joanne Dru projects such a beautiful image as the young Olivia Dandridge the woman who wore the yellow ribbon in her hair and conquered the hearts of the men around her.This is a classic film that serves to remind us about those people that came before us and in the case of Nathan Brittles Mr. Ford gives us a decent man who wanted peace above all with the Indians that the white man was displacing from their natural habitat.".

Not so this one and that's what I take away from the film. That Ford felt life was to be treasured that it was rare and not to be wasted. Perhaps this comes from his wartime service?

And the touch of a classic director not to mention the larger than life figure of John Wayne.In and of itself sentiment is as good an emotion as any to carry a story forward as long as it steers clear of sentimentality.  The former is authentic while the latter is mere pretense.  This film centers itself largely on more or less authentic sentiment within an historical context that has become mythic.  As such it cannot be judged fairly on the basis of historical accuracy where  truth be told  it fails miserably.Even if such a mass uprising in the wake of Little Big Horn in 1876 had been successful rather than the episodic skirmishes that actually happened and even if the story portrayed here were even remotely rooted in historically accurate data the location and the Indians of the film are wildly all wrong.  It was filmed on the Navajo reservation using local extras who look only silly wearing Sioux warbonnets.  The chief was played by an Indian from New York State.  And the ease with which the cavalrymen ran circles around the Indians and even penetrated their war camp was ludicrous.  In short this is an otherwise excellent movie enveloped by a ridiculous and largely mythic rendering born of the writer's imagination.  For that kind of fanciful and purely vicarious fictionalizing you can read Karl May without ever setting foot in the real U.S. West.I could go on but it would serve no purpose.  The clichs about the real West that began to sustain Hollywood with Emerson Hough's The Covered Wagon in 1923 are so legion by 1949 that not even a later generation of revisionist filmmaking sentimentalizing the plight of the Indians creating new clichs of its own can penetrate the smog of wishful thinking.So lean back and enjoy this touching tale of love honor duty and compassion without being too critical of its faults.

	schema:headline " Very Effective Entertainment Artistic Masterwork John Wayne Earns Stardom";
	schema:reviewBody "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon is perhaps the most copied western in the history of Hollywood. Director John Ford repeated his own successes with this story based on two stories by James Warner Bellah War Party and The Big Hunt with screenplay by Frank Nugent and a rewrite by playwright Laurence Stallings. He reused Monument Valley cavalry settings John Wayne as his star and several story devices others learned from him several tricks including imposing music epic shots and the use of ironic comedy to offset a wellcrafted adventure relegation of women to historic second place as a sex and the intelligent development of minor characters dogs weather and careful presentation of the Indian point of view plus authentic costumes and objects to create authenticity. Production values thanks to John Ford's artisticallycomposed shots and use of actors entering or leaving shots of a static or slowdeveloping nature add to the success of much outdoor shooting here. Richard Hageman's original music is a bit overdone but occasionally most effective blended as it is with troop songs being delivered along with bugle calls Indian war drums and sound effects. Winton C. Hoch's cinematography is gorgeous throughout and Art Director James Basevi has matched I suggest Hoch's high quality of image in every case. Ann Peck did the female costumes Michael Meyers the men's garb with uncommon skill. Also Joseph Kish's set decorations are extremely effective. The film's action takes place just after Custer's 7th Cavalary has been defeated and wiped out at the Little Bighorn. The plot of the film tries manfully to work in a general uprising of many tribes named in the film within an Amerind revolt that would have preceded the real Ghost Dancer wars of a few years later. Narration and events place one man Captain Nathan Cutting Brittles in the position of having to try to avert such a general war. The Captain has to wrestle with many problemsa suspicious Indian agent two women he is ordered to escort to catch a stage out of harm's way his own impending forced retirement two young lieutenants in love with the same woman and the very size of the forces of hostiles he faces. To flesh out the cast of a largescale fastmoving adventure producers Merion C. Cooper and Lowell Farrell used a very large number of actors with speaking parts dozens of whom went uncredited but not unnoted. One caveat about the film I have is that many of the names chosen for characters sound very oddBrittles Quayne Allshard Hochbauer Rynders Rome Clay Krumrein etc. Among the actors four do stellar work. besides John Wayne's powerful Brittles Joanne Dru as Olivia Dandridge the young woman torn between two men and learning western values is superb nearly matching her in a youthful role is John Agar the Fort's Doctor is played by Arthur Shields who does all he can with a smaller part Victor McGlaglen is wonderfully consistent in his role as a harddrinking sergeant that borders on being unplayable parody as written. Mention also needs to be made of young Ben Johnson as a drawling effective and Harry Carey Jr. as Ross Pennell who grows up during the events. Others seen to advantage in the piece include Chief John Big Tree as Pony That Walks who has one wonderful scene as a chief too old to stop the uprising and Mildred Natwick as the commandant's doughty wife. George O'Brien as Major Allshard her husband is modestly effective at best.

	onyx:emotionText "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon is perhaps the most copied western in the history of Hollywood. Director John Ford repeated his own successes with this story based on two stories by James Warner Bellah War Party and The Big Hunt with screenplay by Frank Nugent and a rewrite by playwright Laurence Stallings. He reused Monument Valley cavalry settings John Wayne as his star and several story devices others learned from him several tricks including imposing music epic shots and the use of ironic comedy to offset a wellcrafted adventure relegation of women to historic second place as a sex and the intelligent development of minor characters dogs weather and careful presentation of the Indian point of view plus authentic costumes and objects to create authenticity. Production values thanks to John Ford's artisticallycomposed shots and use of actors entering or leaving shots of a static or slowdeveloping nature add to the success of much outdoor shooting here. Richard Hageman's original music is a bit overdone but occasionally most effective blended as it is with troop songs being delivered along with bugle calls Indian war drums and sound effects. Winton C. Hoch's cinematography is gorgeous throughout and Art Director James Basevi has matched I suggest Hoch's high quality of image in every case. Ann Peck did the female costumes Michael Meyers the men's garb with uncommon skill. Also Joseph Kish's set decorations are extremely effective. The film's action takes place just after Custer's 7th Cavalary has been defeated and wiped out at the Little Bighorn. The plot of the film tries manfully to work in a general uprising of many tribes named in the film within an Amerind revolt that would have preceded the real Ghost Dancer wars of a few years later. Narration and events place one man Captain Nathan Cutting Brittles in the position of having to try to avert such a general war. The Captain has to wrestle with many problemsa suspicious Indian agent two women he is ordered to escort to catch a stage out of harm's way his own impending forced retirement two young lieutenants in love with the same woman and the very size of the forces of hostiles he faces. To flesh out the cast of a largescale fastmoving adventure producers Merion C. Cooper and Lowell Farrell used a very large number of actors with speaking parts dozens of whom went uncredited but not unnoted. One caveat about the film I have is that many of the names chosen for characters sound very oddBrittles Quayne Allshard Hochbauer Rynders Rome Clay Krumrein etc. Among the actors four do stellar work. besides John Wayne's powerful Brittles Joanne Dru as Olivia Dandridge the young woman torn between two men and learning western values is superb nearly matching her in a youthful role is John Agar the Fort's Doctor is played by Arthur Shields who does all he can with a smaller part Victor McGlaglen is wonderfully consistent in his role as a harddrinking sergeant that borders on being unplayable parody as written. Mention also needs to be made of young Ben Johnson as a drawling effective and Harry Carey Jr. as Ross Pennell who grows up during the events. Others seen to advantage in the piece include Chief John Big Tree as Pony That Walks who has one wonderful scene as a chief too old to stop the uprising and Mildred Natwick as the commandant's doughty wife. George O'Brien as Major Allshard her husband is modestly effective at best. No one else is given much to do and Ford appears to be doing what was later often copied in allowing natural types rather than actors to add to the film's verisimilitude. The idea works no better here than it ever did anywhere else frankly speaking. Also it needs to be noted some of the bits are realistic and some overdone but both allow the director to milk the business at handa bullet's removal a dying report and commendation of another by a trooper etc. The Monument Valley exteriorsaside from the fort's being placed under a cliffadd to the beauty of every scene.

Like all Ford films there are colorful Irish characters and here Victor McLaglen fills the bill as a harddrinking but lovable sergeant. This wasn't just Ford's sentimentality at work  there were many Irish immigrants in the U.S. cavalry about half of the ranks were foreign born so the film has an element of historical accuracy. The depiction of the Indians in the picture is mixed in one scene Wayne's character calls them devils in another he shows respect when meeting with an old chief who no longer has authority over his young braves. One unexpected highlight of the film for me is Joanne Dru who portrays the love interest of two of the young cavalry officers. What a knockout.

Ben Johnson has possibly his best role as Sgt. Tyree.At times moving and eloquent but never slow or unexciting. It's an engrossing western made by a master director and a cast that never misses a beat. It is my second favorite Ford western behind only his and Wayne's masterpiece The Searchers.".

	schema:reviewBody "SoYoung is a seasoned female detective who is investigated a series of brutal and unexplainable deaths. Assigned a new partner to take on the case SoYoung unleashes terrifying secrets from the past which involve a mysterious salt house and a stereotypical longhaired ghost which looks as if it might have just walked off the set of The Shutter. Anyway the deeper SoYoung digs for the truth the more she realizes everyone involved might be a lot more connected that they think.Arang is one of a long line of Asian horror films that borrow from past successes in terms of the scares it's nothing you haven't seen already. This isn't to say the film isn't suspenseful but it is indicative of most KHorror in that it utilizes atmospherics and scary sounds to build tension. There are a few genuinely scary parts under the desk but for the most part it's your standard Khorror fare.But where Arang differs from past Asian horror is the way the film focuses more on the Detectives working the case than on lives of the actual murder victims. In fact the victims receive very little screen time and because of this the film resembles a detective story more than a horror story. Asian Horror hounds may find this a little disappointing but this is the main reason why I liked Arang so much. Because while the horror elements are retreads of familiar territory the detective element is engaging and fun.Another reason to like Arang would be the amazing score featuring mournful sounding piano creepy atmospheric synths and the creepiest ringtone since One Missed Call Jung Dong In's score was a highlight of the film Someone seriously needs to start producing these soundtracks and makes the film a much more enjoyable watch.The cinematography was also excellent and I was blown away by some of the shots in the film especially those including the beach and a lighthouse. There is also a shot done with CGI towards the end of the film that is outright beautiful. In my book the film deserves a viewing for that scene alone.All in all Arang is a very entertaining piece while it is bogged down in the typical KHorror clichs it's detective story score and creative plot twist Not contrived helps raise the film above the level of other Khorror copycats and makes it a fun film. Also considering that it's Ahn Sang Hoon's debut film I will definitely keep an eye out for his work in the future.My Rating 7 out of 10 While Arang is a copycat it's different enough to be entertaining.".

	onyx:emotionText "SoYoung is a seasoned female detective who is investigated a series of brutal and unexplainable deaths. Assigned a new partner to take on the case SoYoung unleashes terrifying secrets from the past which involve a mysterious salt house and a stereotypical longhaired ghost which looks as if it might have just walked off the set of The Shutter. Anyway the deeper SoYoung digs for the truth the more she realizes everyone involved might be a lot more connected that they think.Arang is one of a long line of Asian horror films that borrow from past successes in terms of the scares it's nothing you haven't seen already. This isn't to say the film isn't suspenseful but it is indicative of most KHorror in that it utilizes atmospherics and scary sounds to build tension. There are a few genuinely scary parts under the desk but for the most part it's your standard Khorror fare.But where Arang differs from past Asian horror is the way the film focuses more on the Detectives working the case than on lives of the actual murder victims. In fact the victims receive very little screen time and because of this the film resembles a detective story more than a horror story. Asian Horror hounds may find this a little disappointing but this is the main reason why I liked Arang so much. Because while the horror elements are retreads of familiar territory the detective element is engaging and fun.Another reason to like Arang would be the amazing score featuring mournful sounding piano creepy atmospheric synths and the creepiest ringtone since One Missed Call Jung Dong In's score was a highlight of the film Someone seriously needs to start producing these soundtracks and makes the film a much more enjoyable watch.The cinematography was also excellent and I was blown away by some of the shots in the film especially those including the beach and a lighthouse.

The long black hairthe scary eyesthe pale face. Can you honestly say that such a sight doesn't get to you. As long as all the other elements of the movie go into another direction thus creating a different kind of experience I don't see the harm in using this ghost. Most of the movie is quite fast paced and very slick. The thing I liked about this movie was the fact that they play around with the different genres. At one hand it seems to be a horror movie and on the other hand the supernatural elements easily can be dismissed when some evidence is given to explain the audience that what we have seen did not happen. It does require some imagination and you have to be forgiving in order to accept all of this. Not being sure if the ghost is real or not is part of the fun. The twists and turns make sure of it that we keep guessing until the end. Quite a lot of scares and tricks may have been borrowed from other movies.

However i would have liked to see more of the investigation side of the drama rather than the horror side. There is far too many graphic images of the same ghosts that just keep coming back again and again and i feel it doesn't add anything to the story but to scare the audience. The movie is very ambiguous as to how the victims did actually die whether it's supernatural or cases of poisoning. I find myself baffled many times how different things relate to each other and i feel that again the director tries to confuse the audience deliberately to add to the suspense or scariness of the movie. It kind of put me off because the story seems less convincing because of all the unexplained elements. In summary if you like horror it's a movie that's worth having a watch if you've got the time. Nothing groundbreaking and for me it's plainly too much blood and gore without the necessity for it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film contains a pleiade of good actors and is fairly lighthearted but the plot is weak to the point of making it quite forgettable once viewed. Louis de Funs incarnates a parisian taxi driver who takes his family off on holiday to southern Spain with a caravan roulotte in French  towed behind them hence the film's title. At the Spanish border there is a customs check  this was before the EEC was born !!  and another female traveller slips unbeknowingly a priceless diamond into de Funes' jacket to avoid being caught at customs. Once they are all in Spain the lady who is working with some gangsters obviously tries to get the diamond back from de de Funs family. This turns out to be not as easy as she first thought and all attempts fail ! In the end de Funs is stopped by the police for speeding and THEY discover the diamond and charge de Funs with trafficking. Of course de Funs denies everything but noone will believe him. Six months later released from Prison he goes back to taxi driving in Paris and one of his first clients is none other than the head of the gang who were pursuing him in Spain ..........I found the film very artificial as although most of it takes place in Southern Spain you hardly ever hear any Spanish spoken only French and this sounds completely ridiculous ! But my main beef is with the plot which is vastly inferior to later de Funs films and leaves one feeling pretty indifferent. Still there are a few amusing moments ....".

Saloons brothels and even wilderness settings are used with great success.And make no mistake the fight sequences are what make or break a Jackie Chan movie.  Fight sequence of course means something different in a Chan movie as opposed to normal action fare.  Rather than true violence Jackie's fight scenes are more Vaudeville than Pulp Fiction.  More Chaplin than Jet Li.  Each fight is painstakingly choreographed to interact with the set surrounding it.  Tables chairs vases antlers shrubbery... the list goes on.  A successful Jackie Chan movie seems to contain a comedyoriented story a lightly delivered moral message and lots of action.  Shanghai Noon certainly delivers here.I spent the entire movie either chuckling to myself or laughing out loud and had a very satisfied smile when the credits rolled.

Good action scenes some solid humor fun characters and nice cinematography are all the pluses. Chan speaks English so there is no need for dubbing either.

Wilson is as impressive an actor as he is a writerhe shares writing credits on such films as Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums.Chan on the other hand is a better martial arts master than Jet Li and a more likable character actor than Chow Yun Fat whose disastrous film Bulletproof Monk made me want to split his head open to prevent him from ever making another American mainstream motion picture ever again.In Shanghai Noon Chan plays Chon Wang a 19th century Chinese martial arts master who ventures out to Nevada in order to rescue the kidnapped Princess Pei Pei Lucy Liu whose name is misused by Roy O'Bannon Wilson on at last one occasion.After Chon Wang mistakenly pronounced John Wayne meets up with Roy the two decide to form an alliance and rescue the princess  one for honor the other for loads of money awaiting them upon her safe arrival back home in Imperial China's Forbidden City.Roy is a lousy wannabe cowboy who used to stage clumsy train robberies along with his band of thieves who betrayed him and left him for dead. He offers his help to Wang and tries to play it cool but he can't  after all he's not a very convincing cowboy. But as the smarmy wisecracking sidekicks always are O'Bannon just wants money. But as his friendship with Chan grows stronger he realizes that money isn't everything.Sounds routine doesn't it? Well it is to a certain extent. But it succeeds due to a fine cast  Chan and Wilson are extraordinarily good together so good in fact that Chris Tucker is just a forgotten memory by the time that the film is over.It's a classic spin on the Old West formula what The Princess Bride or Shrek did for fairy tales Shanghai Noon does for Westerns. All the old cliches are poked fun at in a light way. And as great as Chan is and as much as he carries most films he's in with his sweet charms and likable personas Wilson comes across as equally likable as Chan.Chan's martial arts are usually the highlights of these films but in this he proves he can do more than just kick  he can be funny. Well okay he proved that in Rush Hour 1998 but I like this better.The jokes in Shanghai Noon aren't great but I laughed a lot at this film. It's smarter than one might think and is certainly one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had in quite some time. Probably years. I wasn't expecting much especially because I wasn't an enormous fan of the sequelsee below but if fun could be rated on a scale of 1  10 this would be an 11.I give this film nothing more than four out of five stars because it's not a great film on all critical levels. But it's certainly funlikely more fun than any film you'll see for quite some timeand for that it will soon be earning a place in my sacred DVD collection.I must say that I wasn't a huge fan of Shanghai Knights the sequel to Shanghai Noon which involved Chon Wang and Roy O'Bannon venturing to England in order to save Wang's sister. But after seeing this film I'm thinking I might just have to pay a small revisit the sequel again.45 stars.John Ulmer".

Chon Wang Jackie Chan accompanies the guards on their journey and finds himself entangled with Indians cowboys and the greedy attentions of train robber Roy O'Brannon Owen Wilson.This is essentially a mismatched buddy movie transferred to the American West and in that respect it is not exact an original plot there aren't any great twists to grab you and a lot of the plot drivers are forced or predictable. However let's be honest  we're not hear for the plot! As with the Rush Hour movies the plot is secondary to the comedy and the fight scenes. Here Owen Wilson provides the comedy as the laid back train robber while Jackie Chan provides the action and the comedy. The strength here is that this is a little unassuming film that will take you by surprise. The chemistry between Wilson and Chan is effortless and is as comfortable as the ChanTucker combo. Wilson's character is hilarious in a very easy way  he is clearly so out of place in the West and partially accepts it but also wants to be more than he is as one of the bad guys put it you're terrible. How have it made it this long?Chan again shows that he is the closest we have to a modern day Chaplin he is as good at interacting with Wilson as he is with the physical comedy that is his trademark. One complaint is that as with Rush Hour we could probably have done with a few more fight scenes. However the comedy more than fills any voids that are between fights.Other cast members are little more than excuses for the action. Roger Yuan and Xander Berkeley provide good baddies Berkeley especially but Lucy Liu is almost in her own little 'serious' movie and doesn't have much to do except be rescued although she does show some of her Charlie's Angels potential in a fight scene towards the end.Overall a gentle enjoyable comedy that is made all the more enjoyable by the ease by which it succeeds at making you laugh. Chan's fights are a little less impressive than other films but he excels in the comedy stakes. One very good thing is the customary outtakes at the end  unlike Rush Hour 2 they are NOT funnier than the rest of the film.".

Wang is in the USA because he has to save a princess played by Lucy Liu. He and O'Bannon have to work together why and how is not important at all.What is important is the fun they have together and therefore the fun we have while watching that. We have the usual Jackie Chan martial art and this time it is combined with the very funny Owen Wilson talking. For some reason I like him in almost every movie and here he gets at least one laugh in every scene. Try not to think too much and you must be able to enjoy this movie as much as I did.".

Wang is in the USA because he has to save a princess played by Lucy Liu. He and O'Bannon have to work together why and how is not important at all.What is important is the fun they have together and therefore the fun we have while watching that. We have the usual Jackie Chan martial art and this time it is combined with the very funny Owen Wilson talking. For some reason I like him in almost every movie and here he gets at least one laugh in every scene. Try not to think too much and you must be able to enjoy this movie as much as I did.";

It is his best since Rush Hour and is among one of the best allaction movies that I've seen with an actual plot behind it. After watching previous Jackie Chan movies such as Rush Hour and Rumble In The Bronx I was expecting to be dazzled with his comedic talent as well as action filled sequences. I was pleasantly surprised to learn it had every one of the components and requirements that I require for a good movie.Owen Wilson was comedic treat to this film as he added spark to an already great movie. Other than the clich plot Shanghai Noon brings a lot of excellent comedy dialogue action thrills and even a little romance. I was expecting Owen Wilson to be similar to Chris Tucker but in Shanghai Noon Wilson proved himself to be much better than other Jackie Chan sidekicks I've seen him teamed with. I was glad I rented this movie so I would be able to recommend it to everyone.".

He brings an honesty to his otherwise shifty personae in everything he does. Frankly I'm surprised at some of the places he has succeeded in making this work for him. He is a true comedic force on the big screen. This work is a rival to other comedyaction teams and bears a serious viewing as I feel it is comparable to my second favorite comedy western Cat Ballou.

Jackie Chan was always a comedian but in China his comedy was in the actual fights. That won't work here so he has been forced to search for a comedy form. And boy he's tried a lot of them and failed.I think this is his most successful. That's because of Owen Wilson. Owen is not the type of old fashioned actor who tries to adapt to each role. He's the John Wayne Harrison Ford type who markets a personae that people can exploit if they wish. When Bruce Willis does this his commodity is a smirk he is winking at the audience in a layered conspiracy as if to say I'm acting this stupid role so chuckle along with me at how stupid it is.' He didn't pioneer this attitude but inherited it from Cary Grant who adapted it from some of Clark Gable's winks. Willis has spawned a bunch of copies some of whom Chan has tried on.Now along comes Owen Wilson. What Owen sells is a whole next generation of audiencewinking. With him the attitude is You and I know this role is bogus so lets trash it.' Its the attitude we all know from some guy in school who made trouble by going along. TeeVee opened a niche for this attitude in acting and now Wilson is making a career of it. Stiller does this too and that's why Zoolander' was such a gas it exploited just this sort of posing.I'm amazed at how many places Wilson has made this work. His ironic comedy of course. But Minus Man' was made more chilling with him doing his thing trashing his own locker. Garofalo is the queen to his king of selfdeprecation and made Minus' work. Now consider this film. What works is the completely goofy space Wilson creates. As an example that speech to himself at the showdown with the sheriff I'm going to die! No be the bullet be the wind you can do this. No I'm going to die!' Interspersed with Chan crushing the posse with a horseshoe. Its rather clever engineering of mood and the creative force behind this film needs to be congratulated. This is Wilson's best comedy I think because we aren't asked to laugh at him. He sets the tone for Chan to step into so we can laugh at him. Its more comfortable and less risky than laughing at ourselves.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 4 Has some interesting elements.".

From the first collision with these two illfated men with separate missions Wilson's cowboy is thinking that he is in control because the simple little China man does not understand the predicament. Only to the Cowboy's surprise that the little visitor is very much a knowledgeable one if Wilson's character will stop 'jawwing' so much. One of the funnest parts to the story was those two trading shots of liquor in the bathtubs at the 'Cathouse' then after going for quite a long time with their drinking game the woman opens the door to see how they are doing and they look up covered in bubbles drunk as skunks and with two tubs ...they are sharing the same one laughing like crazy!

The tone is bright and happy and it makes for perfect mindless entertainment. But nothing else. Seriously there is no need to watch this more than once as it is the most forgetable pile of utter silliness in a long time.Owen Wilson is so charming as the hapless but innocent crook Roy O'Bannon who teams up Jackie Chan's Chong WangJohn Wayne to put an evil Sheriff out of business rescue a Princess and defeat some stock Chinese Bad Guy. It's all harmless stuff with some neat fight scenes that never get too violent and a gleefully lighthearted sense of humor.Randy Edelman's generic Western score is terrible as usual and sounds like everything else he's ever done only with a few notes changed. But it's the only weak part of a thoroughly indifferent inoffensive and passive movie.The DVD is in 2.351 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound.".

	schema:reviewBody " 12 out of Shanghai Noon appears to have its fans but I'm certainly not one of them tired as I am of these buddy pictures that deliver weak jokes uninspired action scenes and draggy getting to know you material. Noon follows the formula without a hitch which will be a godsend to some but total boredom for others. Perhaps a better way of determining your enjoyment of the movie is asking yourself whether or not you find Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan funny guys.  Wilson can be very funny if given the right material and Chan has also had his moments even if most of them were back in Hong Kong. Their pairing leads to maybe two decent laughs both during that jailbreak scene which is another example of good setup that ends with a botched gag.The story is nothing to write about really just something about a kidnapped princess and the mismatched partners who have to save her. There are a few obligatory things to point out. Lucy Lui's Princess Pei Pei in spite of all her strong moments as a caring ruler is little more than a damsel in distress. Just when she gets the opportunity to kick ass at the end by all her lonesome she needs to be saved yet again. And does anyone else find it annoying it's her impetuousness that starts this whole mess in the first place? Then there's the Indian girl played by Brandon Merrill who serves no other purpose than to help out our heroes simply because the screenwriters can't think of any other way to resolve a cliffhanger.The finale gets dragged in syrupy sentimentality with that whole do the right thing angle that can be touching when delivered well but not here. As much as I like lawabiding citizens it seems rather odd and not entirely believable Wilson's rowdy cowboy character would simply turn into a man of honor so abruptly. And when you think about it the ChanWilson pairing doesn't add up to much when you realize the former doesn't even trust the latter until the last five minutes. Their arguments over greed and honor are numerous repetitive taken way too seriously and weigh the whole movie down. On a semibright side Chan's moves are still impressive so you can expect a few somewhat enjoyable fight scenes. Unfortunately Chan's elaborate costumes tend to obscure his moves which sort of defeats the whole purpose of these action sequences the Blade series suffered from a similar flaw as Snipes' character rarely fought without his huge overflowing coat on. Shanghai Noon is pretty much secondrate on all counts as a buddy picture though was followed up by a more enjoyable sequel.".

Forget the haters this movie is one that I will watch again and again. The story is fun as well in 1880's China the Princess Pei Pei has been kidnapped and Chon Wang volunteers to rescue her and bring her back home. As he travels to America and to The Old West and Nevada he meets Roy O' Bannon a low down not so good BanditCowboy. The two eventually come to terms and they form this hilarious unlikely duo of best friends. They eventually succeed in rescuing the princess and the two become heroes.Shanghai Noon is very fun Jackie Chan and his fighting style is very cool and the fight scene with the Indian's is my favorite fighting scene. I like his name Chon Wang John Wayne anyone? Jackie's humor is hilarious. Owen Wilson on the other hand completes the duo with his humor and character Owen brings his humor in with his sarcasm and saying's No you said wet shirt don't break not piss shirt bend bar that line made me laugh so much. I liked how they brought in the Old West it gives it it's own style.I also like the friendship between Chon and Roy the two act well together. The story itself seems normal to me Hero or Heroes rescue princess and saves the day. But Shanghai Noon makes the rescue story even better and more exciting. I have seen the second one Shanghai Knights and I heard that they are making a third one called Shanghai Dawn but it's been production for years...it's probably not going to happen a shame really because I would have loved to see this duo again in a third adventure. 1010 for Shanghai Noon".

	schema:reviewBody "When Princess Pei Pei is lured out of China's Forbidden City and taken to America and held for ransom three top Imperial Guards are sent to retrieve her. Chon Wang a less than top guard also asks to go as he blames himself for her kidnapping. Once in America their train is ambushed by gangsters led by Roy O'Bannon. As a result of this Chon ends up off the train and Roy separates from his gang. Inevitably Chon and Roy soon meet again and end up forming an unlikely alliance even if Chon is motivated by trying to rescue the princess and Roy is keener to get his hands on the gold intended to pay her ransom. If they are to save her they will have to deal with her kidnapper a former Imperial Guard and a corrupt sheriff who is determined to kill them both.This East meets West comedy western is a lot of fun as it plays with classic Western and kungfu tropes in an amusing way. Jackie Chan is a great lead as he is naturally funny and more than has the skills required for the action scenes. Owen Wilson offers fine support he too is funny and makes his character likable. While not on screen anywhere near as much Lucy Liu impresses as the spirited princess. A film like this needs good villains and it has two in the form of Roger Yuan and Xander Berkeley. There is plenty of exciting action none of it too strong though it is usually more slapstick than violent. There are lots of laughs to be had these are a good mix of visual gags as well as witty dialogue. Overall I'd say if you enjoy Westerns and want a good laugh you could do a lot worse than this.".

I only have two major problems with this movie and that is that it takes itself too seriously at times it gets fairly deep for something that should have only wanted to be a comedy particularly the scenes with the princess and her capturers are quite dark and grim and I also felt like it needed much more moments between Chan and Wilson's characters that conveyed a friendship is beginning I would have liked to see a lot more scenes with the two of them together simply having fun and not worrying about the problem they must overcome. The highlight of the movie and the thing that certainly holds it all together would have to be Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson they are an unlikely duo but this works out perfectly the chemistry between the two is outstanding and the drinking game is definitely my favourite scene in the whole movie. Funny action packed and entertaining I would recommend Shanghai Noon to anyone looking for a good adventure film. A Chinese imperial guard teams up with a train robber in order to rescue a kidnapped princess. Best Performance Owen Wilson".

That being said this movie right here seems to think that it's enough to shove a funny stereotype in our faces and then expect us to laugh at it uproariously.I liked this film as an actionadventure film. Jackie Chan is a great martial art lead actor and his talents are showcased well in this film. It's not one of the best he has ever done but the fight scenes are fun to follow they're imaginative enough to keep up my interest and the settings have some promise and allow for some cool sequences. Furthermore the West is filmed with care and all the various locations while hardly original look nice and feel genuine.Unfortunately the script is nonsensical from oneshot characters that make no sense to plot motives and twists that come straight out of nowhere and steal all thunder out of the film. The plot itself is thin to begin with but when every major conflict is resolved through either a deus ex machina or a copout you get the idea that they really didn't give a damn as long as they could fill the screen with cheap gimmicks and laughs.The humour doesn't help either. There are some scenes that are honestly funny or at least amusing most of the between Chan and Wilson who have surprisingly good chemistry together but most of the jokes are either mindless slapstick or racial stereotypes. Sure a Chinaman can be funny if done correctly but a Chinaman alone is not funny by default. Neither is a coward a Mexican or an Indian. You need actual effort which this film is unwilling to spend.If you're able to laugh at cheap jokes and clichs this is not a bad action comedy. Chan and Wilson are talented comedic leads who would have made this movie work had the script been any better. As it is it's not to my liking but I don't regret seeing it either.".

The film also feels 5 or so minutes too long one or two scenes in the middle felt like they could have been shortened. Lucy Liu isn't given much to do either.However the film is beautifully shot and the scenery and sets are equally ravishing. There is also a rousing score from Randy Eldemann a smart script with some amusing if not hilarious jokes and sharply choreographed fight scenes. Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson are both very good and are a well matched double act.Overall not perfect but fun and enjoyable. 710 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Truth be told I was expecting an incredibly dumb gay western film. But once I saw it I was surprised at its good story structure and theme.Though I'm not a regular Jackie Chan fan I actually enjoyed watching the guy in the film. Honestly I don't know one bit about him just that he's famous for doing martial arts films and this is actually just the second film I've ever seen with him in it. And I've gotta say  not bad.And Owen Wilson was the perfect actor for his part. I mean seriously nobody else could fit the role. He's not the best actor in the whole world but he certainly took the right turn. He's got the looks the attitude the moves the voice and even the right hair. His character Roy O'Bannon a.k.a. Wyatt Earp is a cool cowboy robber and gunman who's all wild west but still a bit wimpy for his taste. He is shown as ambitious and talented in being a cowboy but not hard or serious and thoroughly a slight disappointment to his land like Chon Wang Chan. Wilson was able to put both the toughy and the whiny in him in all the right parts and situations. He was even able to show the dynamic change O'Bannon went through at the end. He went from coward to hero without a flaw and still managed to be humorous. What I didn't like most of all was that they put background rock music in an 1881 setting. Sure it didn't change the film much and the audience needed at least some connection with the modern world but Wilson was already taking care of that. They at least could have taken out that Cowboy song which is now stuck in my head by the way!This sounds like a great movie but as my title suggests it's missing something. I don't know what it is. Perhaps it was the script which was actually OK. The film somehow lacks that awe and wow that makes a movie memorable. Maybe it's just me but that's the best I can verify it. Something's missing.Overall it's an enjoyable film with great structure and form with a great theme. I hope you enjoy it. I sure did. I'm gonna try watching Shanghai Knights now it's really got me wondering what happens to our characters.".

He is a wanted outlaw and in an odd chain of events they become a duo. This is the funniest western this movie surpasses Blazing Saddles by far. Blazing Saddles is funny but the oneliners that Owen Wilson drop are just so hilarious. I don't know Karate but I do know crazy and I will use it. Lucy Lui also stars as the Princess This movie is definitely worth seeing but you kinda wanna steer clear of the sequel Shanghai Knights It does not do the first film justice. I have never been able to complete the second one mainly because it is boring. But salutes to Shanghai Noon the funniest western to date. 9 out of 10".

However where the likes of Commando had him portraying invincible supermen with a neat array of guns and one liners to hand End of Days is considerably darker.Set in New York on the eve of Millennium the film shows a version of the Austrian Oak previously never witnessed. He plays Jericho Cane an alcoholic exCop in charge of a security squad who finds himself embroiled in a battle to save a young girl Robin Tunney from being raped by the devil a sadly rather ineffective Gabriel Byrne and bringing about Armageddon. As you do.Cane himself is not the best sort of man for saving all creation either. He is mired in deep depression has abandoned any faith in God he may have once had and when we first see him is contemplating suicide. However saving the girl gives him a drive and determination even when faced with some conflicting views from the Catholic Church about how best to go about this. All of this takes place in a very grim and gritty vision of New York where the rain never stops falling urban decay is rife and pillars of steam rise from manhole covers. It is a fitting location for the end of all creation to begin and cast a dark veil over the flick.Of course that isn't to say the film is all doom and gloom as there are a few glimpses of just how seriously the makers weren't taking their project the argument between Arnold and Kevin Pollack in the former's apartment is hilarious. Plus while the story and characters are all developed to match the atmosphere of impending dread during the first hour and a half the last twenty minutes are made up of the kind of explosive action that strangely doesn't jar against the grimmer nature of the rest of the film though the CGI devil at the climax is pushing it a little.All in all an enjoyable romp for fans of the Governator before his attention was diverted by a political career. It compares well to his classic eighties work by trying to do something different and while it may not gel properly in places for a good 80 of the running time it does a very entertaining job.".

	schema:reviewBody "End of Days gets a bad rap but I think a great deal of this is due to its initial premise. It's extremely 'cool' to be antireligion these days so bigbudget movies with a core religious theme tend to get unnecessarily slammed. I'm not religious myself but I do often enjoy supernatural and religiously themed stories due to the themes and issues they frequently explore. So its success all hinges on whether you can accept a plot guided by supernatural religious elements or not. If you can and you enjoy action movies occasionally you'll probably enjoy End of Days.Arnold plays a depressed excop turned highlevel body guard with a suitably tragic backstory. Some people will enjoy his performance others won't. Again it depends on how you come to this. If you are expecting a versatile actor who changes personality with every performance then you won't enjoy it. If you like Arnold because he is exactly what he is Arnold then you'll probably have a ball. After all who ever hired Charlton Heston or Humphrey Bogart or Christopher Walken to play a part in any way other than the specific way they do? You don't hire such actors because of their chameleonlike acting abilities you hire them because their sheer screen presence is such that they stand out from the crowd and you enjoy seeing THEM in the role. As such you either relish those actors in their parts or you you dismiss them as wooden or bland. It depends on the viewer.The director Peter Hyams 2010 Outland Timecop The Relic has a tendency to enjoy very dark cinematography and in this case it suits things perfectly. There are lots of scenes lit primarily by flames or torchlight that set the tone. Meanwhile John Debney's Cutthroat Island Passion of the Christ score is also one of his best and probably one the most effective 'demonic' soundtracks since Goldsmith's Omen trilogy. I would be remiss not to mention the effects work as well. Having watched the DVD special features I was extremely impressed with how much oldstyle artistry and craftsmanship went into many of the effects. There was a great deal of miniature work involved which is too often sidelined for less effective CGI these days. End of Days used a careful blend only really using CGI where necessary.End of Days is a great rollercoaster ride of a movie entirely suited to the date it was made for and has a surprising amount of depth. Under the action and excitement it's really a story about the main character's redemption finding himself again and discovering a meaning to his life after all he thought he had lost. It's also a classic good versus evil tale. To top it all off we get a surprisingly touching and moving finale which perhaps left a lot of people on too much of a downer yet I found it the perfect conclusion to the story.All in all End of Days is either a loveit or hateit movie. It's not perfect but I thought it was an excellent film and one of Arnold's most interesting characters. If you don't mind religious themes enjoy largerthanlife characters and adrenaline pounding action then chances are you'll probably have a fantastic ride.".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly effective horror action";
	schema:reviewBody "Peter Hyams' End of Days stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as a fired and alcoholic police officer who is on the edge of sanity and tries to commit suicide very often. He is now private security guard and traps a mysterious sniper who tried to kill one of his clients. Soon he learns that there are some very bad things going on in the city and the new millennium is very close..It is the last days of December 1999.I really liked the scare department in this demonic little horror thriller from this talented director and director of photography Peter Hyams. This film is full of effective and very ominous images and scenery and the film is very dark. I appreciate perhaps most the shots above the city and the twisted use of camera up there. That really creates a feeling of evil and that something very powerful and wicked is above the city and is about to get power. Hyams once again shows his talent as he has been the director of photography many times earlier in his own films. End of Days reminded me occasionally of Alex de la Iglesia's great horror film El Dia de la Bestia Day of the Beast a brilliant mix of black comedy and VERY dark imagery and atmosphere. As incredible as it sounds this mainstream produced film is that effective thanks to the talented men behind the camera.There are some flaws too and the most irritating things is perhaps the cliche ending which I definitely won't spoil here but is without a doubt there only to satisfy the audience and create the safe and familiar Happy Ending. If this was made 20 years ago the ending would definitely have been different it would've been how the director wanted to not hot the audience wanted to. That tones the otherwise great and exciting finale a little bit down but fortunately it is not as syrupy as possible. Another negative thing that I can tell is the editing which is very fast unstylishly and ineffectively fast and restless. Fast edits can be great elements if used right and with skill but in this film they are in my opinion gratuitously fast and too plenty. Just watch the action scenes and count how many edits there are in one minute. The editors should have realized that sometimes  and in this case  less is more. These flaws are still tolerable especially when I keep in mind how many positive points there are in this film.End of Days is also very exciting and fast paced. The train segment is great and especially the clock ticking finale when the millennium is about to change is very skillfully created and hold my full attention. The finale is pretty similar to the finale in Kathryn Bigelow's own millennium related film a paranoid and effective thriller Strange Days 1995. In End of Days there are also couple of genuinely frightening scary sudden and loud shocks that require a movie theatre to fully work. The nightmare sequences are also chillingly original and brought to my mind the great horror classics that even Hollywood sometimes produced. The demon which Christine sees in her dreams is very scary and almost as frightening as the similar character in David Lynch's masterwork Lost Highway.As a horror film End of Days works fine and creates an atmosphere that is so rare in mainstream films nowadays. I didn't have any expectations when I placed the VHS in my VCR and so I was pleasantly surprised of what I saw and experienced. If we stay in the 90's I could say that End of Days is kind of tamer version of Day of the Beast and without its comic elements. There are comic elements in End of Days too but those are not fortunately the usual Hollywood oneliners and stupid bits of dialogue. Gabriel Byrne overacts occasionally little but many guys who play devils seem to have this problem! He is almost as cool and modern devil as Al Pacino in Taylor Hackford's Devil's Advocate a film which also has great atmosphere but is more restrained and drama oriented.End of Days gets 710 from me. Great work again Peter!".

That really creates a feeling of evil and that something very powerful and wicked is above the city and is about to get power. Hyams once again shows his talent as he has been the director of photography many times earlier in his own films. End of Days reminded me occasionally of Alex de la Iglesia's great horror film El Dia de la Bestia Day of the Beast a brilliant mix of black comedy and VERY dark imagery and atmosphere. As incredible as it sounds this mainstream produced film is that effective thanks to the talented men behind the camera.There are some flaws too and the most irritating things is perhaps the cliche ending which I definitely won't spoil here but is without a doubt there only to satisfy the audience and create the safe and familiar Happy Ending. If this was made 20 years ago the ending would definitely have been different it would've been how the director wanted to not hot the audience wanted to. That tones the otherwise great and exciting finale a little bit down but fortunately it is not as syrupy as possible. Another negative thing that I can tell is the editing which is very fast unstylishly and ineffectively fast and restless. Fast edits can be great elements if used right and with skill but in this film they are in my opinion gratuitously fast and too plenty. Just watch the action scenes and count how many edits there are in one minute. The editors should have realized that sometimes  and in this case  less is more. These flaws are still tolerable especially when I keep in mind how many positive points there are in this film.End of Days is also very exciting and fast paced. The train segment is great and especially the clock ticking finale when the millennium is about to change is very skillfully created and hold my full attention. The finale is pretty similar to the finale in Kathryn Bigelow's own millennium related film a paranoid and effective thriller Strange Days 1995. In End of Days there are also couple of genuinely frightening scary sudden and loud shocks that require a movie theatre to fully work. The nightmare sequences are also chillingly original and brought to my mind the great horror classics that even Hollywood sometimes produced. The demon which Christine sees in her dreams is very scary and almost as frightening as the similar character in David Lynch's masterwork Lost Highway.As a horror film End of Days works fine and creates an atmosphere that is so rare in mainstream films nowadays. I didn't have any expectations when I placed the VHS in my VCR and so I was pleasantly surprised of what I saw and experienced. If we stay in the 90's I could say that End of Days is kind of tamer version of Day of the Beast and without its comic elements. There are comic elements in End of Days too but those are not fortunately the usual Hollywood oneliners and stupid bits of dialogue. Gabriel Byrne overacts occasionally little but many guys who play devils seem to have this problem! He is almost as cool and modern devil as Al Pacino in Taylor Hackford's Devil's Advocate a film which also has great atmosphere but is more restrained and drama oriented.End of Days gets 710 from me. Great work again Peter!";

The only choice left is of course Satan. So they put together a movie about Satan and gave Arnie the lead.I think everyone working on this thought it would be much better than it actually is. The script was in development for years and Arnie fought to get it made. It's kind of unfortunate because Arnold gives a fairly decent performance in a film muddled with clichs. Of course it's hard enough to buy a guy with a body like Arnold being a slob who drinks beer and pizza smoothees for breakfast. Getting someone like Jim Belushi might have seemed more realistic.Apart from the physicality Arnold's performance is fine. He cries. He does the emotion scenes well enough  at least well enough to find bearable.It's the direction that ruins this movie. Peter Hyams is a terrible director and has ruined some very unique films in the past his most notorious butchering in my opinion was of a 1983 Michael Douglas film called The Star Chamber  great premise awful directing.End of Days is like Exorcist meets every supernatural thriller ever made. On top of that Gabriel Byrne should be more menacing. Robin Tunney should be less butchlooking. The direction shouldn't feel like some lowgrade TV commercial  all style no substance.Is the movie terrible? No. It's not as bad as everyone made it out to be. But it's pretty much the definition of mediocre. Do I own it on DVD? Hell yeah. It's an Arnold movie  it's an automatic mustbuy. But if you're not a fan of Arnie I wouldn't recommend it  at all. It pretty much feels like any average madeforTV scaryflick  with even worse direction.The only other good aspect of this film was that it brought Axl Rose out of seclusion to record his first original song in seven years with a new incarnation of Guns N' Roses. The song Oh My God didn't do too well with the critics. A bit of a shame really. I dug it. It also fits the industrial edgy tone of the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "END OF DAYS  1999 12 out of fourBy Blake FrenchEnd of Days is the first movie to seriously argue that 666 the numerical sign of the devil is actually a 999 upsidedown. Since the film was first released in 1999 the movie could not resist to throw in that little contrivance. What can you expect from a movie when its premise is based on the concept that once every thousand years if Satan impregnates a woman during the hour from 11 p.m. to 12 a.m. on the last day of the millennium she will give birth to the antiChrist who will bring the world to an end? I am already thinking that the movie is vulnerable to logic is the time given in Eastern Standard? and it will make its own limitations at the convenience of plot. End of Days is particularly graphic in its use of violence but never really scares us even with such a horrifying premise like the end of humanity. Arnold Schwarzenegger has not made a good movie in a long time. First Jingle all the Way then Batman  Robin now we have a movie that bounces back and forth between action and concept. There are the standard action movie scenes where a person sways from a helicopter in mid air where a chase scene takes place at incredible heights where someone grasps to a high window ledge where a subway train crashes where a massive fire erupts in Manhattan and so on. There are also the false shocko moments followed with a sudden burst of loud startling music the its just a cat scene its just another cop scene its just a dream scene its just your imagination scene he's not really dead scene and its just maggots suddenly growing out of an apple scene. The movie is also bound by philosophy. The action is focused towards Schwarzenegger saving the world but he cannot do that all by himself can he? Sure he can if he can stop Satan Gabriel Bryne from impregnating Christine Robin Tunney who was born under the religious sign of a passing comet  and based on her birth twenty years earlier during the sighting of that comet  is the chosen mother of Satan's child. End of Days begins with an intriguing although plausible premise. The bizarre events that transpire a few days before the end of the millennium immediately inspire our curiosity. The action sequences are also fine intensified by thrilling music and a fast paced style. The movie opens on a good note and the remainder of the action sequences are also quite exciting. The scenes also inspire a few questions. Satan kills many people in this movie people just like the hero so why doesn't he just finish Arnold Schwarzenegger off like he does with so many other characters. On the other side Schwarzenegger shoots the devil who pulls his shirt up so we can see the bullet holes immediately healing. When using a machinegun the ammunition flings the Prince of Darkness backward and puts him down before he attacks again. There are simply no rules to abide by here. End of Days does not have a whole lot of explanation it plays sort of like your run of the mill action picture with the gimmick of the week. There just is not a lot of true involvement or engagement after the premise. We do care about Arnold Swarzzenegger's character and Gabrial Bryne is an especially convincing Satan. He is devilish with fiendish appeal proving that tranquillity is the most terrifying evil. Al Pachino did an equally diabolical job in The Devils Advocate but Bryne is even more terrifying. Robin Tunney has nothing to do but exchange shameless subtext with Schwarzenegger's character. You're better than everyone else just remember that. I don't want to be better or worse I just want to be normal. She is more of a plot device than an actual character.Excellent convincing set designs appear frequently especially near the end where the characters wander through dark chambers and dim hallways. Cinematography also adds a nice touch to the suspenseful mysterious atmosphere all done by the movie's director Peter Hyams The Relic. It is too bad such good filmmaking does not have a story fit enough to back it up. One more thing I just have to mention Why do the cops always show up at the end of the movie after the action is over. I am getting very tired of that.".

But if he can see so deeply into Jericho's mind in recreating his family with enough nuance to inspire nostalgia why can't he see where Jericho hid Christine not ten minutes ago? Satan can make an assassin talk without a tongue yet he can't make that assassin unjam a semiautomatic weapon. And when Jericho shoots Satan at point blank range Satan is courteous enough to open his shirt to reveal the wounds closing so Jericho won't worry unduly about Satan's health  not sanitary to go about with open bullet wounds Matter of fact instead of simply possessing Jericho himself to get close to Christine and rape her Satan expends so much unnecessary energy on sideprojects crucifying the tongueless guy blowing up Jericho's partner Kevin Pollak and then saving him and then blowing him up again ridiculously battling Jericho when he could snuff him out with the effort of thought that we wonder whether a more efficient assassinlover shouldn't be put on the case  say Antonio Banderas.What I find most precious about End of Days is Arnold's valiant attempts at The Method sad means scrunching up his eyes and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent depressed means raising a bottle to his lips and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent deathly scared means widening his eyes and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent. There's definitely a pattern here if we could only decipher it.In the end the devil is dispatched not by the holy men whom Catholics pray to for deliverance from apocalypses such as these but from the atheist Jericho.

Which clearly says something that Catholics blindly refuse to hear that even if the Devil were to exist those who have been indoctrinated to unconditionally and irrationally fear him would be unable to conjure a belief in his downfall let alone act towards it. Further they might not truly WANT him defeated for only through his contrary polarity does their god's existence become tenable.For it is written in the Book of Revelations And the Prince of Darkness shall descendeth upon the Earth without any solid game plan and impregnate a virgin on a date which won't have any significance until the Gregorian Calendar of the 1500s adopts the day numbering which will put it in sync with the equinoxes and the Anno Domine syntax which will annoy sensible people for millennia by which time Christians will have forgotten Christ's actual birth date and appropriated the pagan Saturnalia festival in its stead.

Directed by Peter Hyams with a script by Andrew W.

It's a quite grim film which puts the audience in suspense from the very beginning. The dark picture helps to amplify these feeling with the most scenes taking place at night or on foggy or rainy days in New York depicted like a real and decadent sin city. The darkest character is undoubtedly the Devil but the police fighting against him played by Schwarzenegger also has to face his own demons alcohol deep depression lack of faith and lack of selfconfidence in a double combat physical and psychological.The film has great action scenes which strangely cohabit with several heavier scenes almost terror. In fact this is the major flaw of the film it lives in a permanent dilemma between terror and action thriller and suspense. We cannot say it's a horror movie or a thriller or action. It's a mixture of all which ends up easily displeasing the public looking for just one particularly the terror lovers as the film never gets to scare us truly. The climax is very interesting makes good use of special visual and sound effects manages to surprise and not be predictable but some of the effects the monster are so clich and farfetched that destroy what was good.The work of the actors is fairly good. This film marks the end of a comedy decade in Schwarzenegger's career and he seems convincing in his role and doesn't make mistakes giving another proof of versatility. He wanted truly show that it's not only a lot of muscles and he succeeded. Robin Tunney looks a bit bland and hysterical in the role of Christine. Byrne made an interesting devil very calm and cold able to boot chills through the simple look. The soundtrack doesn't stand out particularly with the exception of Agnus Dei it's main music combining incidental chords with small arrangements of Gregorian chant.".

	schema:reviewBody "After the relative quiet patch of the mid '90s Arnie is finally back on form in this apocalyptic thriller. Aside from all the comedies he made which I'm frankly not interested in and have no wish to see the three recent films he has made have been rather disappointing TRUE LIES and ERASER had fine action and special effects but both films were shallow and not serious enough. And the less said about BATMAN AND ROBIN the better. Still END OF DAYS is a wonderfully fun film in which the horror and action genres are skilfully combined by veteran Peter Hyams OUTLAND.Sure the critics might have hated it but they hate all of Arnie's films anyway and never give him any scope for success. I expected a lot from this film and I got it fine acting good special effects exciting action sequences and there was even more besides as the film raises some interesting questions on the likes of God and the Devil. Thankfully these ideas never get in the way of the frenetic action and the second half of this film becomes a cat and mouse thriller one of my very favourite types of film.Having been away for over two years due to his heart operation Arnie is finally back on our screens and shows us once again how he has matured as an actor. From simply being an expressionless musclebound hulk in stuff like THE TERMINATOR he gradually developed a likable persona who delivered some trademark quips and oneliners and now finally he accepts his most challenging role to date a complex downtrodden character on the verge of suicide and grieving the death of his wife and child. Yes folks Arnie cries. Aside from his welldrawn character Arnie also shows us that he is still more than capable of carrying the action scenes too old? No way.The actor is well supported by comic sidekick Kevin Pollack who is not bad in a relief role and also Gabriel Byrne as Satan himself. Byrne injects just the right amount of charisma impish charm and evil into his character so Satan is a memorable guy in this film. Robin Tunney THE CRAFT is thankfully given little screen time as the film's heroine so she comes off well as a girl who both knows what's going on and yet refuses to accept it. There is a totally gratuitous nude scene of her character though so be warned. Further down in the cast is exploitation favourite Udo Kier one again playing a bad guy and meeting a sticky end Rod Steiger who makes a believable and amusing priest and Miriam Margoyles who surprisingly beats up Arnie's character in one scene before being thrown through a coffee table.Aside from the many horror elements a stigmata victim a man who is nailed to a ceiling Latin writings which foretell of death and destruction there is a plentiful helping of gore as many Satanist thugs are dispatched by Arnie's character Satan burns rips out the heart of and kills people who stand in his way. The special effects are mainly of the pyrotechnic variety although we do get a few sequences of Satan regenerating himself after being harmed. Stan Winston's CGI winged demon at the end of the film is impressive too especially as it is only shown briefly which makes more impact on the viewer.The action sequences are well staged and very exciting from a huge fight in a house where Tunney is besieged by homicidal Vatican priests to the climatic fight on a train which culminates in a huge explosion. The best moment comes when Arnie fends off a huge gang of street thugs breaking and hitting them until he finally succumbs. Yes Arnie does take a huge beating in this film he even needs stitches and comes across much more vulnerable than the typical action persona he plays immune to bullets and other weapons. END OF DAYS is a great if generic slice of entertainment and should be shown to Arnie fans horror movie buffs and action aficionados alike.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching END OF DAYS I got the distinct impression this movie had problems in the early production stage . The story as revealed at the start of the film involves two sets of the clergy  one of which is trying to protect a young virgin from the clutches of Satan while the other set is trying to murder her so he wont mate with her . So far so good  so why include the character of Jerico Cane  a burned out suicidal cop ? After all the story could have worked without his inclusion even though it may have been too similar to  THE FINAL CONFLICT in feel and execution  but I still feel Cane didnt have to be included while the role of the hero could easily have gone to a good guy priest . Worse still Jerico Cane is played by big Arnie which means through box office necessity  ie box office bucks  instead of END OF DAYS being a haunting supernatural drama it ends up being a supernatural actionadventure movie that doesnt work . It should also be pointed out that Arnie doesnt have the acting range to play a burned out sucidal cop . How about this as a casting premise Anthony Hopkins plays a disillusioned priest trying to save Christine York from Satan . Doesnt that sound a whole lot better ? Not to be too negative the story is interesting in places  and Im sure the first draft of the script was very moody and atmospheric until the screenplay was rewritten to death . Gabriel Byrne plays Satan with the exact right mixture of charm and menace which leads me to believe hed be the perfect choice as The Master if Hollywood ever make a big budget screen version of DOCTOR WHO . Peter Hyams direction while not perfect is far better than much of his work in recent years and does manage to inject a fair amount of mood into his work . But at the end of the day  Pun intended  this movie would have worked a lot better if we had an acting star instead of an action star as the hero".

	schema:reviewBody "Bizarreo. Here is a truly deeply differing role for Mr.Schwarzenegger. Darkness encompasses this story. Troubles are on all of the sides for Det. Jericho Arnold Schwarzenegger Peter Hyams Directoris a brilliant director first off. He is supreme in vision and delivery bringing his characters and the story to proper fruition. The set up is deeper than practically everything else he has been a character in. Finding the evil prefix seeing the signs the coming End of Days. As the good father Rod Steiger was absolutely believable as sort of a counseling apocalyptic informant with the Catholic church. He was intense and wholeheartedly right there laying it out giving the warning that would need much heeding. The casting for that Monsignor was perfect. I also truly enjoyed A.S.'s performance in this film. What a departure from other characters he has played in many years say since the 'Original' Terminator in 84'. A vast city a specific evil presence. Stalking encompassing the two investigators. A heavy menacing power that is relentless and Hellbent on destruction at any price.Finding his way around and sort of being a die hard stumbling copinvestigator. He is on the case make no mistake but his own personal life is Titanic proportions. He is going down if he isn't utterly careful in every step that he takes. He is on the trail tracking evil and he is just starting to figure out the clues that are being left behind. The Devil is on his trail as much as Jericho is on it's. His partner Bobby is 'on' and little more stabling I think but soon trouble has come like waves on a stormy ocean overtaking. I was really set back by this one with Schwarzenegger showing his other acting side he makes good on this investigation. Gabriel Byrne is excellent again of course. I think he has a master since of his rolls from a solid standpoint.I recommend this one for the discriminating thriller movie fan. ".

	onyx:emotionText "Bizarreo. Here is a truly deeply differing role for Mr.Schwarzenegger. Darkness encompasses this story. Troubles are on all of the sides for Det. Jericho Arnold Schwarzenegger Peter Hyams Directoris a brilliant director first off. He is supreme in vision and delivery bringing his characters and the story to proper fruition. The set up is deeper than practically everything else he has been a character in. Finding the evil prefix seeing the signs the coming End of Days. As the good father Rod Steiger was absolutely believable as sort of a counseling apocalyptic informant with the Catholic church. He was intense and wholeheartedly right there laying it out giving the warning that would need much heeding. The casting for that Monsignor was perfect. I also truly enjoyed A.S.'s performance in this film. What a departure from other characters he has played in many years say since the 'Original' Terminator in 84'. A vast city a specific evil presence. Stalking encompassing the two investigators. A heavy menacing power that is relentless and Hellbent on destruction at any price.Finding his way around and sort of being a die hard stumbling copinvestigator. He is on the case make no mistake but his own personal life is Titanic proportions. He is going down if he isn't utterly careful in every step that he takes. He is on the trail tracking evil and he is just starting to figure out the clues that are being left behind. The Devil is on his trail as much as Jericho is on it's. His partner Bobby is 'on' and little more stabling I think but soon trouble has come like waves on a stormy ocean overtaking. I was really set back by this one with Schwarzenegger showing his other acting side he makes good on this investigation. Gabriel Byrne is excellent again of course. I think he has a master since of his rolls from a solid standpoint.I recommend this one for the discriminating thriller movie fan. ";

You may have heard rumors that the big man tries acting this time out but not to worry his moments of soul searching and introspection are kept to a minimum. He does get crucified however which requires a bit of a stretch. Lots of firepower violence special effects and action deliver just what fans of the star want from a movie. As such it is a relatively painless watch and delivers some goods. A few days before the millennium earthquakes and subterranean fires hit New York. Relax...it's just the Devil arriving.

Jericho Cane an alcoholic excop now working in security seems to be the only person in the tristate area capable of saving mankind. Where is Mayor Giuliani when you need him? With Arnold on the case who needs elected officials? Robin Tunney plays the spunky virgin in question who has been destined for this unholy union since birth. Kevin Pollack as Jericho's mouthy sidekick gets most of the funny lines. Gabriel Byrne adds a touch of class playing The Man who has devilishly taken over the body of a Wall Street banker. Great disguise Lucifer! My favorite scene was the knockdown dragout fight Arnie has with rotund little Miriam Margolyes who plays one of the Devil's minions. Oh yea and that awesome dinner scene when Lucifer grabs that womans..umwell you'll see.  Director Peter Hyams gets the big action setpieces right and does his darndest to pass Los Angeles off as New York.

	schema:headline " Arnie's Horror Story";
	schema:reviewBody "Arnold Schwarzenegger's career path changed in the 90's. He began branching out into comedies as the era of macho action faded. His success in that endeavor is a matter of opinion I think Jingle All the Way was the best comedy he did. But in his filmography of the time is a standout an actionhorror movie that was less Predator and more Exorcist. End of Days was the End of Days for Arnie's acting career for about a decade as he focused more on politics and the movie itself was so critically panned that you can see why Arnold may have disappeared from Hollywood for a while. Perhaps he saw that his time was up and he should move on to trying new things. After all one of the reasons we love Arnold so much is that he will try anything and isn't afraid to fail.And End of Days is a testament to that I mishmash of genres and ideas that for all intents and purposes shouldn't work. There's a bit of The Exorcist mixed with Y2K conspiracies with a touch of The Mummy's brand of actionhorror. There's a bizarre dynamic of typical cop films Vatican drama and overthetop action. Arnold plays a sympathetic characteralbeit a two dimensional one who also happens to be a bad ass killing machine with little care for property damage or manslaughter charges. It's a film that is constantly morphing into something else providing what turns out to be a good popcorn flick despite all the flaws.Arnold plays Jericho the typical washed up cop whose family was killed by robbers. During a routine job he is pulled into a world of demons and holy men a war between good and evil to prevent the end of days. Satan walks the Earth to have a child with a young woman and herald in the apocalypse on Y2K. The Vatican wants to kill the girl to prevent this Jericho decides he wants to defeat Satan and save her. Thus he faces off with Satanists members of the Vatican and eventually takes on Satan himself.The movie is grungy and ugly in a way that compliments the plot. It reminded me a lot of the horroraction comic books of the time. The direction is pretty standard and to tell the truth the majority of the film is pretty runofthemill. The action is nonstop but none of it is original. The acting is typically pretty bad though Arnie gives a decent performance by his standards and Gabriel Byrne is a ham as Satan. The only really bad performance was Robin Tunney as Christine the woman meant to have the devil's child. She was a Godawful choice for a female costar and even if Arnie isn't giving his charismatic best he looks positively stellar beside Tunney.What I liked about the movie pretty much comes down to subject matter. I'm a sucker for this kind of religious horror film especially if done in a more urban fantasy type way. I liked all the ideas presented even if they weren't cohesive enough to make the movie anything less than awkward. But as the definition of a turn off your brain film it works.Another thing I want to point out is that the ending doesn't copout. With an ending like the one in the film most movies would go for some sort of hamfisted plot device to present a happy ending. But instead End of Days sticks to what happens and feels so much more refreshing for it.End of Days isn't a memorable movie it arguably isn't even good. But it's a ton of fun and propelled by some silly performances and a script that moves at a breakneck pace. It's formulaic and does nothing new it's not even scary to tell the truth. But there's a lot of entertainment to be found in it and even if Jericho is twodimensional it's nice to see an Arnold Schwarzenegger character with a modicum of backstory emotion and motivation.".

The hope of humanity falls on an atheist excop Jericho Cane Arnold Schwarzeneggar and his partner Kevin Pollak. Rod Steiger is also on hand as a nononsense Catholic priest.End of Days is a comic book action flick with horrorfantasy elements. It's not meant to be an accurate depiction of biblical eschatology. As such it's useless to pick it apart on these grounds just go with it and enjoy the ride. That said there are some reallife subtexts and accurate biblical aspects. For instance disillusionment due to the unjust death of a loved one or any number of other tragedies happens all the time.The movie is Rrated not just for the violence and cussing but because the filmmakers try to convey the devil's filthy lawlessness like a threesome with a mother  daughter in a brief dream sequence which may be reality but it's hard to tell. Byrne has fun with the role of Satan.As a holiday action blockbuster with Schwarzenegger End of Days delivers the requisite thrills where there's a massive explosion about every 12 minutes. These types of movies only work if the story and the characters pull you into their world and the film accomplishes this just enough. It's no where near as good as the first two Terminator flicks but it's close to being on par with the third one. Of course End of Days is its own animal due to the dark religious subject matter. On that note the palette the filmmakers use is fittingly dark. The entire film takes place at night mostly in the urban labyrinths of New York City with additional sequences in Gothic churches shadowy subterranean rooms and eerie woods.The film runs 121 minutes and was shot in New York City and the Los Angeles area.GRADE B".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know about other people but I rather enjoyed End of Days just because of the ridiculous concept.End of Days did impress me with its dark and ominous atmosphere. The mood was decidedly creepy and on occasion gets rather disturbing. Hyams conjures up some pretty evil and demented scenes although not as disturbing if you've seen the recent pictures with similar undertones. The action is orchestrated with style and vigor especially the whole subwaybit and the scene with Arnold dangling from a police helicopter. Byrne's performance as Ole Nick himself is very understated but one gaze conveys as much evil as Pacino did with a whole monologue. Who said less is more? Kudos to Stan The Man Winston for the icky demon at the end although it could have done with some more screen time.End of Days does however suffer because of the premise of merging action with heavy religious themes. The broody atmosphere suffers when the action kicks in and Arnold starts blasting away with his machine gun. This was kind of distracting and at some times seemed rather ludicrous as well. Also poor Arnold has to do away with evil all by himself actionhero style which somehow conveys the wrong message to me. End of Days is also pretty derivative and the whole Satan takes a bridepremise has been done much better before even when it was delivered as a comedy aka The Witches of Eastwick Jack is still to date the best Devil.... But since End of Days is such a dramatic departure for Arnold the movie shouldn't be compared to classics like The Omen and The Ninth gate at all. Instead enjoy it for what it is wellproduced escapism. Lots of action gore and some shiversupyourspine imagery. Thanks Arnold you did it again!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Takashi Miike has a knack at Yakuza thrillers. Some might not be very good some might be some odd sorts of deranged masterpieces. But with Graveyard of Honor I can only imagine how fantastic the original Kinji Fukasaku film from the 70s was if this might possibly be Miike's best serious Yakuza movie. This is to say that Miike turns down a somewhat typical level of madcap gore and humor for an approach that is kind of staggering as though Cassavetes had some input on the screenplay or Abel Ferrara ala Bad Lieutenant for that matter. It's a solid piece of drama of a man Rikuo Ishimatsu in a performance that within the range is one of a lifetime from Gor Kishitani ala young Mifune who unwittingly becomes apart of a crime family after saving its boss while working as a dishwasher. He serves some time for attempting to kill another gangster he gets out the years pass and he gets bitter and in a fit of panic he bites the hand that feeds him  he shoots his own boss.From here on it's a path right to hell that Ishimatsu takes. Already one has seen him as a character with some demons he has trouble quelling. He's tough maybe too tough and doesn't have much of a sense of humor which includes around his woman a timid creature who soon gets into the dank mess that Ishimatsu puts himself into. He also turns into a fullfledged junkie and burns more bridges than one could ever fathom. What Miike crafts here is something that might not be his most inventive work but it displays him as someone who has the range to plunge into real bloodshed and tragedy. It's almost the reversal of the cartoonish mayhem of Ichi the Killer  where that you almost were given permission to chuckle at the carnage and excess of violence in Graveyard of Honor it's grim ugly the blood flowing hard and with bodies writhing in total agony. It's a rare instance for the director to present things about as realistic as he'll get in edgy handheld and compositions.But there is some style that Miike puts appropriately and with an creative sensibility on the material. The music crooning on and off is like that of New York jazz from the late 50s and early 60s and I'm almost reminded of some lucid nightmare of a beatnik on junk ala William S. Burroughs and pulp fiction. As the downward spiral continues for this character even if it starts to seem unlikely that it would go this far the escape from prison alone intense for the selfinflicted horror done to himself is just enough to swallow we go right down with this character in his oblivion. It's hard to turn away and there are moments that are gruesome not so much for what's shown which can be a lot but the emotional impact. Not to sound pretentious but I'm almost reminded of some damned Shakespearan king or something only here it's a sensibility of total unadulterated nihilism that propels Ishimatsu to his horror of an end.On the surface it doesn't feel a whole lot different from other Miike Yakuza fare. Yet it's a little maturer a little more tightly crafted and developed with the characters and it has the mood of a filmmaker working outside of his reputation as a showman or provocateur. It's a real movie one of the best in the Yakuza realm.".

	schema:headline " Impressive remake by Miike.";
	schema:reviewBody "Takashi Miike's remake of Kinji Fukasaku's 1975 film of the same name is a rather straightforward Japanese Yakuza thriller with a hefty dose of violence. However this violence is less comicstyle than in Miikes best work Fudoh Dead or Alive or Ichi the Killer. The violence comes across as raw and real. This gives the film a gritty edge that reminded me more of the classic Yakuza flicks than of a Miike film. There are occasional outbursts of overthetopMiikeisms the final fall of the hero a throatslicing etc. but they are limited to a few scenes.Another Miiketrademark in the film will be as problematic as ever The harsh treatment of women. The hero's first contact with his future wife and the beating of said wife later in the film did strike me as particularly unappealing. However I felt that in Graveyard of Honor men and women get treated the same way  badly that is. No one gets away clean in this film and to label Miike a chauvinist or whatever names circulate the web would be more appropriate with some of his other films.Taking all into account Graveyard of Honor is a surprisingly mannered Miikeouting. Definitely not my favorite because it lacks the overthetopappeal I came to love but a strong motion picture never the less. A gritty gangster flick with raw violence and unsympathetic characters. Of course a must see for Miike fans.My rating 710".

	onyx:emotionText "Takashi Miike's remake of Kinji Fukasaku's 1975 film of the same name is a rather straightforward Japanese Yakuza thriller with a hefty dose of violence. However this violence is less comicstyle than in Miikes best work Fudoh Dead or Alive or Ichi the Killer. The violence comes across as raw and real. This gives the film a gritty edge that reminded me more of the classic Yakuza flicks than of a Miike film. There are occasional outbursts of overthetopMiikeisms the final fall of the hero a throatslicing etc. but they are limited to a few scenes.Another Miiketrademark in the film will be as problematic as ever The harsh treatment of women. The hero's first contact with his future wife and the beating of said wife later in the film did strike me as particularly unappealing.

Ishimatsu is let into the family at a high rank and but he isn't what was expected. He starts ping people off in the family by starting a little gangwar and after theres a settlment between the two gangs they are all trying to get rid of Ishimatsu. He also gets pretty wound up with heroin.Alot of character develoupment in this movie. The movie has a low tone but glossy color that sets and really good atmosphere with a slow jazz soundtrack.The blood in this movie isnt very abundent but the violence is strong a realistic. Not very many bloodsprays like in most of Miike's movies but you dont really look for that because IMHO this movie is so stylish without the need of strong blood or gore.It doesnt seem like to many people like this movie but when I got done watching this movie I felt really good like I have never felt after a movie.".

And on that level this film works... but peer beneath the surface and you'll find that Graveyard of Honor is actually a very intricate study of a man's unhealthy obsession with selfdestruction.Rikuo Ishimatsu Goro Kishitani is a bartender who while working one day inadvertently saves the life of Yakuza Boss Sawada. Out of appreciation for Rikuo's heroism Boss Sawada inducts him into the gang and gives him uncle status. This leads to resentment for Rikuo among the other underlings in the gang. All is fine though until one day when Boss Sawada decides to go to the dentist. Rikuo shows up looking for the Boss but is taunted by Yukawa who refuses to tell him where the boss is. Angered Rikuo nearly kills Yukawa with a harsh blow to the head. This and other events I don't want to give too much away lead to Rikuo's exile and eventually end up driving him into a cycle of selfdestruction.Graveyard of Honor is a hard film to watch. There are no good guys in this film. There are no lighthearted scenes heart warming moments or any black humor to lighten up the film. Just a lot of mean people making bad choices and paying for their mistakes in horrible ways. For example Rikuo the film's protagonist antagonist?? rapes women does heroin and shoot's and stabs people... and this is not fun violence but disturbing horrific violence. Amazingly Director Takashi Miike and actor Goro Kishitani somehow finds a way to make his character somewhat sympathetic.OK let's cut to the chase. If your not put off by extremely bleak unsettling negative and depressing films than Graveyard of Honor should be in your DVD player... right now. Filmed stylishly scored masterfully the jazz score for this film is incredible and featuring the brilliant and hypnotic performance of Goro Kishitani as the amoral Rikuo. This film is arguably Miike's greatest Masterpiece.Bottom LineIf you haven't seen this and aren't easily upset by graphic depictions of the ugly side of life find this and watch it as soon as possible.

	schema:reviewBody "Takeshi Miike is one of my favorite filmmakers almost for no better reason than that he's the only filmmaker I've ever seen that can set off my gag reflex. Although he shows versatility as a director with dramas like Sabu and children friendly fare like Zebraman he is much more well known as the hyperviolent hypergory and hyperkinetic director of Ichi the Killer. Graveyard of Honor is another one of his extreme movies. It's not as fastpaced or even as weird as Ichi but boy does it deliver.The basic plot is that a dishwasher ends up saving the life of a Yakuza boss when he knocks out an assassin that is shooting up his restaurant. The Yakuza boss thanks him by making him his righthand man but the dishwasher turns out to be pretty much a sociopath showing no fear regret or capability for patience thus resulting in a violent film full of miscommunication and misunderstandings. The best part is that none of the other characters really seem that willing to take him down so his blunt approach to killing whoever he feels goes pretty much unchecked.However the movie is pretty slight on the plot. Really it's more like a continuing cycle of prisonviolenceheroin prisonviolenceheroin. If that description gives some pause especially considering that this movie is over two hours long have no fearit's the most interesting cycle of prisonviolenceheroin ever filmed because one of Miike's primary strengths lies in his use of hyperbole. When a character jumps to his death he doesn't just splatter a wave of blood washes over a wall. The fascination of the character himself is matched by the deranged trust that most of the other Yakuza place in him. We're almost as attached to him as his wife who it seems he purposefully got addicted to heroin so that she would depend on him.It's also like many of Miike's works darkly comedic in a very sick way. Just don't expect to be laughing all that often as it's more likely you'll be running to the bathroom trying not to vomit. It also sticks with you for a while unless you're actually as desensitized as the main character is. If that's the case I recommend finding a nice asylum to live in for a while.PolarisDiB".

A reinterpetation faithful in spirit and gritty hardboiled realism to the original yet still as much a Miike film as anything else he's done this reflected in the Japanese title of the movie 'New' Graveyard of Honor in itself perhaps a tribute to Fukasaku's sequel series 'New' Battles Without Honor and Humanity and the numerous gonzo stylistic flashes that fully complement the handheld hyperkinetic style Fukasaku pioneered and which Miike here reintroduces not in an attempt to ape the original film and not to the extent that Fukasaku used that style nor with the same deftness but as a visual technique Miike makes his own for the duration of the film.As with the original film the emphasis here is not on a Scarfacelike ragstoriches arch but on downfall one long unbroken fall from grace an ode to selfdestruction and alienation as only the Japanese know how to do them. The brooding yakuza protagonist finds himself in a vicious endless cycle of violence as meaningless as the catalyst that kicked it into motion a twohour visit at the dentist by his boss and there's no bottom or depth low enough for him to sink to.Miike follows all this in a sombre distanced way allowing the brutal stabbings and shootings to take place without either glorifying or shying away from them this helped to a good degree by a languid jazzy score and a lack of depth or dimension to the supporting characters or indeed the protagonist. We don't know these people. We don't know any more about the protagonist after two hours than we did after he first stops a yakuza hitman by breaking a chair on his head. He goes about killing people and shooting dope stopping only long enough to rape his girlfriend or signal to the cops that he's out of bullets.Miike being Miike the movie is still crazy and OTT as though he doesn't want us to take it anymore serious than we need to. I'm a big fan of yakuza pictures and Miike's Graveyard remake ranks highly among them quite possibly the best of the several he's done. More than two hours long the movie feels epic without ever calling attention to itself as such. Miike is not doing THE GODFATHER any more than he's doing SCARFACE. Curiously for a remake and especially compared to slick Hollywood gangster movies or quirky crimedies Graveyard is original above all else. If I have a problem with it is only in the hard edge of the video look on which Miike probably for reasons of budget insists on shooting and that 15 minutes could've been trimmed for tightness.".

It's too violent to be believable there are too many guns there are waaay too many deaths to be even close to making me suspend my disbelief but the violence is handled so realistically as to not make much sense.If this movie went over the top into a demented fever dream cool but it doesn't. The presentation is so nuts and bolts and kitchen sink the constant ultra violence just doesn't seem at all plausible. It's one of those movies where you wonder where the police are when a guy strung out on heroin shoots up his apartment in the middle of the day with at least eight handguns in Japan!. Apparently nobody ever calls the everpresent and everwatching police in Japan. It's just not believable. Sorry.The tiresome unpleasantness of the main character is also past belief. I suspect any effective crime organization would have taken him down or had him incarcerated at the first stray bullet. Dumb. I'm not saying crazy Yakuza thrillers aren't good I'm saying this one isn't. Not worth it.".

	schema:headline " Okay movie bad Miike movie";
	schema:reviewBody "BATTLE ROYALE was the movie that brought the name Kinji Fukasaku to the lips of most people in the west for the first time but he'd made his name in Japan many years earlier with a series of gritty and violent gangster movies that changed the face of the genre. In 1975 he made one such movie called GRAVEYARD OF HONOR. In 2002 Takashi Miike decided to make a movie called GRAVEYARD OF HONOR too.I haven't seen Fukasaku's original movie so I have no idea how Miike's version compares. Normally you would expect a Miike movie to bear little resemblance to its source material but in this case I'm not so sure.GRAVEYARD OF HONOR tells the story of a man called Ishimatsu Goro Kishitani who is propelled into a relatively high ranking position in the Yakuza after saving the family head's life. His violent personality makes him feared and perhaps respected but eventually gets him into trouble. He pes off the family and to such a degree that no little finger is going to get him off the hook. The stage is set for a small scale gang war.GRAVEYARD OF HONOR is a much more conventional yakuza movie than any of his others e.g. DEAD OR ALIVE. It's played pretty much straight missing the wit and manic invention that characterises Miike at his most playful. Unfortunately it's also missing the complex 3dimensional characters that make Miike's more dramatic movies so good. It's a fairly straight genre movie that doesn't scratch particularly deep below the surface in other words. This may be because Miike wished to stay faithful to the source material but it is rather a surprise from the director whose work is normally amongst the most inventive in the world. Rather a disappointment too.Miike can definitely do straight drama but in movies like RAINY DOG and BLUES HARP it is the fascinating believable and sympathetic characters that make the films stand out from the crowd. Characters in GRAVEYARD OF HONOR are much harder to relate to and their intentions and motivations are often unclear or seemingly thin. In particular it's hard to understand Ishimatsu's actions beyond the facts that he's very violent and not very smart. It's very hard to empathasize or even sympathize with him and very difficult to actually like or care for him too. Even an antihero needs some humanity we can relate to or at least a shed load of charisma. Goro Kishitani injects his character with neither.I'd been led to expect GRAVEYARD OF HONOR to be somewhat action packed and there are a few scenes of fairly brutal violence but nothing like the cool stylised action of DEAD OR ALIVE FINAL. In fact most of the movie is very slow  rather boring even. I actually took a break for an hour and a half in the middle to go and do some work which isn't a great signGRAVEYARD OF HONOR is probably not a bad gangster movie but it is very disappointing as a Takashi Miike movie. Pretty much any director could have handled the job and only a couple of scenes show any of Miike's characteristic style wit or perverse genius. Basically I'd hoped for something more.Not recommended much.The ebay DVD has a decent anamorphic transfer presumably ripped from the Japanese release and reencoded to fit on a DVD5. Sound is functional stereo and subtitles are optional and very well translated. If you want to see the movie this is your best option for now.".

This in itself is the problem because it is impossible for the audience to have any sympathy for such a degraded and demonic personality. There is most certainly a violence about the leading character that is effortlessly translated. You never know when he will explode into violence and every character that comes into his trajectory has a good probability of being harmed. The film is shot on a cheap format digital presumably and while Takashi's talent for setting framing and action is on display there is a disposable quality to the film.There are many of Takashi's obsessions on display in Graveyard of Honor such as extreme violence needles and bodily fluids. Takashi does have a disturbing tendency to denigrate woman. A young female character is introduced and promptly raped....If it is understood that great film directors often bear their soul in their work and this is very true of Takashi Miike it must be said that his treatment of woman as opposed to his adulation of the male suggests possible homosexual obsession. In his film 46okunen no koiBig Bang Love Juvenile A 2006 homosexuality is explored and the beauty of the male juvenile physique is lovingly shot yet the only female character is a frightening contorted monster shot in black and white with distorted focus that literally drags her vagina across the floor.A casual admirer of Takashi's films must admit that women are often the helpless victims of male brutality and while the men often suffer male on male torture and death the more vile circumstances are reserved for the women such as drowning in faeces sex with animals violent rape and extreme beatings. Takashi's most detailed female character from his classic dishonAudition 1999 is a brutalised and psychotic nightmare yet for the male she is also frightening and at the same time erotic as shown by the sadomasochisticdominatrix wardrobe. What is clear is that Takashi has a deep fear possibly a revulsion for women.The action in Graveyard of Honor is brilliantly done particularly the quick and bloody ashtray attack. The final shooting is superbly done and shows the power of a single bullet much like the movie Shane did back in 1952. There are also some brilliant moments such as a sequence of drug induced madness and an almost love scene while injecting drugs both moments are done in single setups without cuts.Takashi cannot hide his enormous talent even when directing trash or kiddy nonsense. He is a pure filmmaker and arguably one of the greatest film directors alive today but I sometimes wish he would take more time between movies or be more selective about choosing material because unlike Koroshiya 1Ichi the Killer 2001 which is beautifully lit and shot Graveyard of Honor is an ugly florescent looking movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just came back from cinema i was totally surprise and awed by this movie. Honestly i didn't have much expectation at first because there is not much martial artistactors to backup the cast list so i thought this gonna be a flop like Legend of Yip man. But it turn out it was much of a biography of the famous star than we know of so well but we haven't really seen or heard upon the story telling regarding his life hood growing up in a large family at a nostalgic times of Hong Kong. The narrations pacing was remarkable while the story unfolds at a very decent pace for a movie running over of 2hour 15min.I have to be honest i was really surprise and somewhat skeptic it was an actual Hong Kong production in the first place where actors script and visual art has surpass anything i seen so far in Hong Kong movie standards. Well i was literary awe by the visual art  style of the camera works. Props and scenery brings such nostalgic memories to the viewers they manage to brings the audiences back to the age of innocent and wonders or yesteryears. Camera works is top notch Lomo filter works superb at moments of romance and brings so much emotions and story to the scenes. I felt like i was watching an MTV from a tasteful Taiwanese love song.To conclude my experience if u seek action most will be disappointed as the fight scene its done visually stylish using steady cam and action pan but never really shows the techniques of the famous wing chun system. That being said this movie never pretends to be an action flick to begin with its a stylish romantic and touching story about the world reknown actor martial artist philosopher  friend and finally a inspiring 2Nd elder brothers of a family which we all love so much and yet known so little about. Bravo! i'm booking my second viewing now.".

Honestly i didn't have much expectation at first because there is not much martial artistactors to backup the cast list so i thought this gonna be a flop like Legend of Yip man. But it turn out it was much of a biography of the famous star than we know of so well but we haven't really seen or heard upon the story telling regarding his life hood growing up in a large family at a nostalgic times of Hong Kong. The narrations pacing was remarkable while the story unfolds at a very decent pace for a movie running over of 2hour 15min.I have to be honest i was really surprise and somewhat skeptic it was an actual Hong Kong production in the first place where actors script and visual art has surpass anything i seen so far in Hong Kong movie standards. Well i was literary awe by the visual art  style of the camera works. Props and scenery brings such nostalgic memories to the viewers they manage to brings the audiences back to the age of innocent and wonders or yesteryears.

It's definitely worth watching and if you're a Bruce Lee fan then you really should watch this. A lot of people don't know the life before he moved to America and here you learn a lot about his life that you never see. This movie is not really an action film. There's not a lot of fight scenes but the ones that are there play significant roles to the film. So I'd suggest you watch this with the mindset of watching a great story as opposed to waiting for action to happen.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Bruce Lee My Brother";
	schema:reviewBody "Based upon the book Bruce Lee My Brother by Robert Lee Bruce's youngest brother directors Raymond Yip and Manfred Wong take us on a journey that's begging to be made about the life and times of the formative growing up years of Lee Jun Fan  Lee Sai Feng Phoenix. It doesn't need to encroach into the territory that Rob Cohen's Dragon had already touched on the Hollywood film done some 17 years back with Jason Scott Lee of no relations in the leading role that begins from his teenage and adult years in the USA Jeet Kune Do Kato Fist of Fury and all. Instead this film takes a more nostalgic look back from the 40s to 60s Hong Kong focusing on the somewhat wayward youth and teen actor prior to being exiled by his dad to the US for his own protection and the rest as they say is history.In what would be something like a calling as an actor when his father the opera megastar Tony Leung Kar Fai assisted a director friend in need by volunteering his infant son in Golden Gate Girl Bruce Lee's film forays was way before the kung fu movies launched him into superstardom starring in The Orphan and many others and through this narrative angle allowed the filmmakers to pay tribute and homage to famous screen actors who once were and the films they were in the filmmaking mover and shakers behind them and a commentary on the state of the industry at that time with unions and hectic film schedules actors often handling simultaneous projects that require flitting from one sound stage to another. No effort was spared in the attention to detail in sets and costumes and I thoroughly enjoyed everything the filmmakers had in pulling out all the stops in recreating the mood look and feel plus the wonderful actors taking great pains to bring back the memories of acting veterans.Acting career aside Bruce Lee My Brother also touches upon his family members as well with scenes involving his siblings and parents their upbringing and the value system instilled upon them. It shows the affluence of a traditional extended Chinese family living together and not just under the same roof with kin but that including the servants and their children too. Glimpses of stepping out of traditional boundaries are shown through his mom played by Christy Chung in a comeback role as deliberate attention was paid to her wearing the pants of the household when her husband's away taking charge of delicate situations including cursory mention of her fine family background. It is little nuggets of information like these that make this film a wonderful gem to sit through for trivia.And of course no story will be complete without friendship and romance thrown into the mix especially when dealing with the pains of growing up. A tempestuous youth almost always never shying away from a fight nevermind his semistardom Bruce Lee is part of a group nicknamed the Kowloon Tigers and it is this allegiance with his buddies that take centerstage with a subplot running to the finale involving loving the same girl as his best friend and how he puts his loyalty with friends and family above everything else. They hang out mostly at dance parlours and the hours he puts in explains his nimbleness and gracefulness that we'll see infused into his fighting prowess not to mention being crowed a Chacha dance champion at one point as well.The fights are widely touted in the trailer and here's where chief credit must go to the filmmakers for conscientiously steering clear of too much Wing Chun and avoiding the temptation to stage clichd big battles with the Japanese soldiers or British corrupt police. These have been touched upon too frequently of late with the two Ip Man films as well as the Andrew Lau's tribute to Bruce Lee with his Legend of Chen Zhen. Meeting up with Ip Man himself is probably requisite for this film but it placed it in proper context that Bruce was most of the time being trained by one of the pupils instead and we do see some hints of Jeet Kune Do in his fights which are never deadly but friendlier in nature meant as a comparison of skills and fighting philosophies.Bruce Lee My Brother is a fitting tribute about the early life of Bruce Lee hitting the mark on famous milestones in his life and showing his character not as the superstar to be but the down to earth and fiercely loyal friend brother and son he was known to all those close to him. Dramatic license is of course heavily used especially when putting in subtle hints throughout the film that references the famous movies that he will make in the future loved that makeshift nunchak using preserved sausages as well as the banter with a certain Shek Kin. A definite must watch especially for fans who must stay put during the end credit roll for a photographic comparison of pictures taken in the film with the real thing. A film I enjoyed tremendously and goes into my books as a firm contender for the best this year has to offer!".

So I will say i like this movie.However if i was to analyze this movie I would say the makers are confused into what genre of movie to make. It is definitely NOT a documentary as I am pretty sure artistic license is taken. But how do you make a Bruce Lee movie without the action? So action scenes are thrown in this however makes the movie go into the realms of fantasy. I am pretty sure pre Hollywood Bruce got into fights but..running through rooftops and scaling scaffolding? the fight in the warehouse?.I guess thats the problem with making a Bruce Lee story for the cinemas. It has to be interesting enough to attract investors and movie goers so the rather long and probably fictionalized action scenes are thrown in.Good movie but I think the book would be better.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie without reading any reviews and I have not seen any of the movies or TV series made about Bruce Lee. I trust this movie because it's based on the book written by his own brother who is still living and judged from the title I thought I will get to see his whole life story and curious how they will show his last 4 movies that made him a superstar and legend. More curious is who will play Lo Wei Raymond Chow Nora Miow Linda and Ting Pei ? Will his rejection to Shaw Brothers' offer be shown ? I must admit I am quite disappointed that I will not get to see them but instead it's mainly focused on his family background upbringing his childhood movie days friends some romance and finally the 3 major events that brought the movie to a satisfying end a dance competition a boxing competition and a climatic event that caused him to leave HK to the States at around the age of 19. Overall I am happy with the movie although there is no big names in the cast but a lot of actors and actresses characters from HK black and white movies of the 50s are shown obviously to please the elderly fans. It's a pity they did not show the role of Pak Yin HK's most popular actress of that time who acted and danced with Bruce in his last movie before he leaves HK in The Orphan. They only showed he was offered that movie. You will enjoy it better if you are familiar with those 50s HK celebrities. They tried to cast them as close as possible to the original people in look and behaviour that's why at times we find these acting a little poor or weird with the exception of the actor playing Bruce. I think we will not get a better one. We don't know if the last event that caused his father to send him away is true or not but as a movie it's simply good although not perfect. If this movie do well in the box officeI think it will I am sure the producers will make at least 2 sequels Bruce Lee in U.S. and Bruce Lee the superstar which will certainly be more interesting to watch than his childhood days. I look forward to them. So Bruce Lee fans just go and watch it. I am sure you wish to know about his earlier life.".

From this influence much of the story revolves around Bruce's family life. Along with it we also get to see a glimpse of what life in Hong Kong might have looked like back in the mid '50s.It's a good movie about life of Bruce Lee. The only negative might be that the actor and the actress who played Bruce and his girlfriend lacked the flare that Bruce had and what was shown of the girl in the picture of Bruce at the Cha Cha competition. But this might be as close to possible of depicting Bruce by another person. Bruce Lee had very special star quality that made him stand out in every situation.I remember seeing Bruce Lee in TV commercial of the Green Hornet. His line was Hi this is Bruce Lee please join me in the next episode of the Green Hornet.. He stood out despite the fact that he was little known and he was an Asian showing up in American television. He was so good looking and had a star quality like no other.I really liked this movie as it shed lights on to the life of Bruce Lee in Hong Kong that we knew little about and wished we knew more about. With the input of Robert Lee this is as close to coming authentic as it can be and is a good addition to the legend we know as Bruce Lee.".

He was so good looking and had a star quality like no other.I really liked this movie as it shed lights on to the life of Bruce Lee in Hong Kong that we knew little about and wished we knew more about. With the input of Robert Lee this is as close to coming authentic as it can be and is a good addition to the legend we know as Bruce Lee.";

We witness the early years of Bruce Lee as his personality and persona are shaped by early events in his life. Tony Leung and the luminously radiant and very underrated actingwise Christy Chung play Lee's parents as we chart his birth and early life up until the age of around 19.Somehave voiced disapproval and frustration at the lack of action scenes but this film is very much a drama following the life events that shape a person rather than an allout kung fu movie. That said the two fight scenes we do get in the second half of the movie are especially well handled i very much enjoyed the warehouse showdown with its shades of the Colosseum duel from Way of the Dragon replete with said film's unmistakable soundtrack.If the viewer is in the right frame of mind to watch a dramatic recreation of Bruce Lee's life rather than straining at the leash for fullon action scenes then there is much to recommend in this movie not least the wellrounded performances excellent recreations of postwar Hong Kong and  my favourite part aside from the fights  recreations of period Hong Kong movies in authentic black and white. Great stuff lovingly rendered.In all a satisfying and nicely nuanced telling of a star's early beginnings. And far superior to Rob Cohen's overly histrionic Dragon the Bruce Lee Story. Here's hoping it did well enough to merit a followup that can cover the time period of that excreble film much better.".

At times it is over sentimental and at other times just silly. Having read much about Bruce Lee I was disappointed that he was portrayed as an emotional wimp. Also in his early fights as a boy in Hong Kong he is shown he using the famous Bruce Lee scream yet from what I read he only used this for films. I had also previously read that he was regularly in street fights some quite dangerous ones and it was for this reason that his Father sent him off to the U.S.A but in this film it was to do with him destroying some drugs when trying to rescue a friend from the pushers grasp. Is any of that true? There are some really good acting performances in this film especially the actress playing Bruce's mother.".

Cine Asia marketed it as an allaction fightingflick with a fightpacked trailer and explosive advertising. In actual fact the makers of this film aren't interested in the action at all instead focusing on human drama throughout. This is a film that explores Bruce's love life and the lives of his friends and associates in 1950s Hong Kong.Unfortunately it's also extraordinarily dull and the distinct lack of action makes it a real chore to watch. It soon becomes apparent that Bruce's early life just wasn't very interesting and certainly not worthy of a film the interest lies in what happens when he went to America which is conveniently where this film ends. In addition the filmmakers strive to portray him as a pacifist and he sustains at least two beatings during the course of the movie hardly the champion and kung fu star of later years.This is a tough film to like because the action that takes place is just so dull. Bruce comes across as arrogant and unlikeable and the decision to cast an unknown Arabiclooking actor in the part was a bad one. Okay so he sometimes looks a bit like the star at the right angle but it becomes painfully obvious that he has no fighting ability and he has little acting ability either. Tony Leung is brought in for heavyweight support as Bruce's father but his role is a completely extraneous one.The film does pick up towards the climax but the fights are still disappointing and in the highrise finish Bruce has little to do. I mean who wants to watch a film about Bruce Lee for the romance? The whole setup was misjudged from the very beginning leaving this a crushing bore and huge disappointment.".

There is some fighting but this movie really focused on the relationships that Bruce Lee had with family and friends. It's based on the book which was written by Bruce's younger brother Robert. That is pleasing by itself considering that every film ever made about Bruce was just a fictional tale of his character. I can't say for sure because I did not know the man but I would be willing to bet that this is the most accurate representation of Lee Jun Fan as a young man in Hong Kong. Now I say that with full knowledge that this IS a movie and there are obviously some fabrications and exaggerations mixed into it. But what I mean is this movie does not portray Bruce as some magical fighting machine going around fighting everyone he comes into contact with. A large portion of the movie is focused on his relationships with friends and family and that is something we have never seen unless you count Dragon the movie with Jason Scott Lee which I enjoyed but it was not like this one. I enjoyed it much more because of that. I feel like I know a little more about where Bruce came from and how things may have been for him as a young man. Definitely worth watching especially if you are a fan of Bruce Lee the man rather than Bruce Lee the movie star.".

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed the movie. I am a fan of Bruce Lee and had read his books and of course saw his movies. I also read numerous articles and other biographies from his wife and friends.This movie is about Bruce when he was living in Hong Kong from his sibling's viewpoint. The biggest reason why I enjoyed this movie was that it filled in some information gaps that I had about Bruce Lee.I knew that he was born in San Francisco because his father was a performer in the Chinese Opera and was performing here when his wife gave birth to Bruce. What I always wondered was why did the parents pick the name Bruce? It seems the mother said push when the American nurse asked what name they wanted for the baby. The father's English was not so good so he garbled push and it sounded like Bruce to the nurse. Unfortunately another question has popped up that I hope the book will answer when I read it is why did the mother say push. According to the movie during the labor the American nurse kept saying push and maybe the mother liked that word and stated this when the American nurse asked for the name. I'm wondering whether Bruce's mother even knew the meaning of the word push and whether the father even knew what the wife was saying? Again I hope the book will answer these questions.I knew his family was in entertainment area but I did not know how connected they were in the Hong Kong entertainment scene. It seems the Lee family knew most of the performers in Hong Kong.I knew that the family lived under the same house but I did not know they had several servants and the servants' family living under the same house. This signifies that they were pretty well off.Bruce was a natural leader and it showed when early on he became the leader of his newly formed friends. He was also a born entertainer. He began acting at an early age when one his father's friend put Bruce in one of his movies.Bruce did not like studying but loved hanging out with friends and getting into fights. The movie fills in on how and why he learned Wing Chun Kung Fu. The major basis of his subsequent fighting style.He loved dancing. I knew he was a Cha Cha Cha champion in Hong Kong but I did not know he did not win that without a female partner. In fact he won that with his younger brother Robert Lee as his dancing partner. The movie told the story why his younger brother became his dancing partner and that was due to a love triangle.One of the biggest question that I had about Bruce was why did he have to leave for America so quickly? From various articles I knew he was in trouble but there was no real elaboration. According to the movie one of his close friends was a drug addict. Bruce went to save him but the friend was in a drug den. There was a confrontation with a drug boss. In the ensuing struggle some of the boss' men were injured and some of the drug was lost.As stated in the movie the father told him that if he stayed in Hong Kong he will either be killed by the drug gang or be put in jail by the authorities. Therefore he had to leave immediately for the U.S.A. By the way there was a minor mistake in the movie in that the 100 bill was the modern bill with the giant portrait of Benjamin Franklin.This also filled in some gaps in that I always wondered why some people in Hong Kong thought that he was killed by the Triads or some Chinese gang. Thus the conspiracy theory.I am sure like any movie based on a real person the movie company took some liberty with the facts but I hope it was not much. Overall a good movie that emphasized his family friends and career while growing up in Hong Kong.".

Maybe there will be a part two but at any rate they could have maybe given it a few minute montage or something to kind of wrap it up better.Now I'm not really what you can call a Bruce Lee expert but I am an actual 3rd generation student Dan Inosanto BL protg to late Ted Lucaylucay. So through Ted and my readings from Bruce's source materials etc. I do know something of Bruce Lee.Pretty much all of the Bruce Lee biography movies you have ever seen are more bruceploitation then anything. Too much over the top way inaccurate clich out of context just plain wrong. This one felt at least genuine and fairly real.Obviously some parts were pretty dramatized. I won't spoil it but a small example from what I understand the young Bruce Lee wouldn't have done the Whooowaaaa howling thing until much later that he developed in his own films.And then a few more clich things like Bruce doing a jumping flying kick. Those who know Bruce Lee know that there is a pretty slim chance that he would use a flying anything in a real fight for obvious and documented reasons. He did those in his movies of course because they are very flashy and visually appealing.At any rate great movie. If you are a Bruce Lee fan you won't want to miss this one.

The genre of this film is biographydrama and that is precisely what it is and a fairly good one at that. This film was made to give people an insight to who Bruce Lee actually was aside from his fame as an action hero superstar. It shows the utter loyalty love and respect he showed for his friends and family and the pride he took in doing so. The way Lee is presented as a somewhat naive teen and the innocence and likability his character shows is a nice contrast to the wing chun warrior in which we previously knew him. This film brings out Bruce Lee's human qualities and presents him as a common man.The direction and cinematography of this film can be admired. The recurring glare of sunlight throughout the film present a nostalgic feel and remind us of the softer side of Lee the side that this film portrays. However at times the narrative can stray off topic and leave the audience wondering where the story is going. Also some may argue that some of the narrative is not factual and hence not true however not knowing a whole lot about Bruce Lee apart from his Hollywood legend status I found this film incredibly fascinating and a few false recounts here and there didn't detract from a pleasant viewing experience. I recommend giving this film a go. It is worth diving a little deeper into a life which otherwise seemed fairly emotionless.".

We get back stories about every single person who even had a moments contact with him. After the first hour the viewer realises that the film is half over and there is simply not enough time to spend on the adult Bruce. 129 minutes later the film ends with no ending... There is not one fight in the entire film no scenes of Bruce learning kung fu nothing at all. And the most frustrating thing of all after spending 45 minutes on the life of...Bruce lee's aunt who had cancer we are shown the great Yip Man well we are shown THE BACK OF YIP MAN'S HEAD for about 8 seconds!! Then a teenage Bruce and some school friends are walking in front of a school and the film ABRUPTLY ends. I still can't believe what i have watched. Is this the same film that people gave a rating of 7 here? Was my DVD defective? I don't think so because the film did run 129 minutes. In short action fans will absolutely DESPISE this inane film about Bruce Lee's aunt as there is not one scene featuring Kung Fu technique. And fans of drama will hate it because there is no ending the thing just stops with no resolution. I am assuming this was part of a very long mini series and some dishonest distributor put the first episode on DVD to make a quick buck. And by the way I was not aware that Bruce Lee had a brother. Of all the Bruce ripoffcashin films bruce Lee My Brother is the absolute worst. I returned the DVD to the shop and let them know it was defective. I mean it HAD to be defective right?

	schema:reviewBody "Probably Buster Keaton's best film and oddly enough it's not even a straightforward comedy  it's actually an action film with clever doses of romance and comedy tossed in for good measure.  The General' which is set during the Civil War is about a train engineer named Johnny Gray Buster Keaton of course who tries to enlist in the Confederate Army . . . and is turned down because the army feels he'd be much more valuable for the war effort as an engineer instead of a soldier.  However through a series of misunderstandings both Johnny's family and his girl think he's a coward and they refuse to speak to him until he becomes a soldier.  Months pass and Johnny sad and alone is piloting his train  the General  when it is stolen from him by the North.  Johnny's efforts to recover the General  and to win back his girl's love  become an unbelievably funny and actionpacked series of events as Johnny tries to go from being a sadsack buffoon to being a hero.If you haven't watched many silent films they demand a greater amount of attention than normal' film  there are no audio cues and volumes can be spoken with a simple facial expression.  Buster Keaton is amazingly expressive as he's fully capable of going from wildly happy to downtrodden and sad in the blink of an eye.  While funny Keaton is much more than just a clownish figure  he manages to evoke a lot of sympathy as well and he genuinely becomes what can only be described as an action hero as well.  His timing whether for a joke or for a tender moment is absolutely impeccable.What's also great about The General' is the sheer amount of stunts and physical humor  a movie like this couldn't be made today.  No amount of insurance would cover it.  Keaton does all his own stunts and manages to perform a number of feats that are simultaneously hilarious and dangerous  he chases down The General' with a bike he sits on a moving cattlecatcher knocking away railroad ties with a tie of his own.  All these stunts are fantastic but it's scary to think that any one of these probably could've killed Keaton if something even went slightly wrong.  The General' is a lot more than slapstick.  Personally I think it's one of the first films to push the envelope of movies  it goes for action romance and humor and it pulls all of those elements together into a terrific movie. If you've never seen Buster Keaton  or for that matter a silent film  go find this one and watch it.  It's a classic. A".

	schema:headline " Understated Perfection";
	schema:reviewBody "Buster Keaton once said that if he hadn't been a comedian he might have been a civil engineer. He was not only a mechanical whiz but a spatial genius who devised stunts and gags with the grace of pure physics. It's no wonder he adored trains the most elegant of machines and brought them into his movies whenever he could. When one of Keaton's former gagwriters loaned him a book recounting the theft of a locomotive from Georgia by Union raiders during the Civil War he was immediately fired with enthusiasm to bring this page of history to life. His first certainty was that the production had to be so authentic it hurts. He even insisted on using historically accurate narrowgauge railroad tracks which he found along with appropriate landscapes near the sleepy town of Cottage Grove Oregon.Most importantly the area had stretches of parallel tracks which allowed scenes of Buster on his trainagilely scrambling over the cars balancing on the roof to scan the horizon chopping wood for the engine while armies pass unnoticed behind himto be filmed from another train running alongside. Buster his train and the camera are all in motion the wind whips through Buster's hair while smoky pinecovered hills rise and fall around him. These scenes are not only the highlight of the movie but a peak in the history of moving pictures and they put to shame all later backprojection and process shots models and computergenerated effects. The quality of Keaton's filmmaking is simplypun intendedunparalleled. Every shot in The General is clean fresh and efficiently composed the action is captured honestly and legibly at all times. The film never tries to be beautiful its beauty is functional just like the grave masculine beauty of the locomotives and railroad bridges and Civil War uniforms.The General's narrative structure is as strong and uncluttered as its look. Like a train it stays on track never meandering for the sake of a laugh or a stunt. All of the gags rise organically from the coherent and straightforward storyline. Adapting the historical incident Keaton made himself the engineer of the stolen train Johnnie Gray rather than one of the raiders. As he saw immediately The General is one long chase or rather two chases structured like the flight of a boomerang. First Johnnie on a borrowed train the Texas chases his own stolen train the General. He manages to steal it back and races it towards his own lines pursued by the raiders in the Texas who try to prevent him from carrying their battle plans to his own high command.The General is not Keaton's funniest film but here he was going for quality over quantity in laughs.

There is a shot in The General of Buster's eye isolated on screen framed by a hole in a white tablecloth that has always reminded me of Dziga Vertov's kinoglaz the cameraeye. Keaton melds with his camera there's no distinction between his qualities as a performer and the qualities of his movies. They have the same silence the same strictness the same strange blend of gravity and humor.The General might be the most serious comedy every made but it's not a tragicomedy. That as in Chaplin's blending of pathos and low humor was something people took to immediately. But no one knew what to make of The General. Original reviews accused the film of being dull pretentious unoriginal and unfunny. Even today people who have heard it acclaimed as one of the greatest movies of all time are sometimes puzzled or disappointed by it on first viewing. The General is challenging because it doesn't flaunt its virtues like Keaton's concise and economical performance it holds a great deal in reserve. Take the movie's most famous shot of a train crashing through a burning bridge for which Keaton built a real bridge and destroyed a real train. The shot lasts a few seconds in the finished film he doesn't dwell on it or hype it. Who else in Hollywood would sink money in a spectacular effect and then downplay it? Keaton never forces a response from the audience never manipulates never overplays. He doesn't show off his acrobatic skills or his enormous repertoire of comic talents nor does he play for sympathy. Anything so subtle will always leave some people cold. But for those who can see the expressiveness of Buster's socalled stone face who get his peculiar dry humor who appreciate the rigorous purity and taste he displayed these virtues are all the more stunning because they are understated. Buster Keaton always has more than he's showing you can see it in his eyes.".

	onyx:emotionText "Buster Keaton once said that if he hadn't been a comedian he might have been a civil engineer. He was not only a mechanical whiz but a spatial genius who devised stunts and gags with the grace of pure physics. It's no wonder he adored trains the most elegant of machines and brought them into his movies whenever he could. When one of Keaton's former gagwriters loaned him a book recounting the theft of a locomotive from Georgia by Union raiders during the Civil War he was immediately fired with enthusiasm to bring this page of history to life. His first certainty was that the production had to be so authentic it hurts. He even insisted on using historically accurate narrowgauge railroad tracks which he found along with appropriate landscapes near the sleepy town of Cottage Grove Oregon.Most importantly the area had stretches of parallel tracks which allowed scenes of Buster on his trainagilely scrambling over the cars balancing on the roof to scan the horizon chopping wood for the engine while armies pass unnoticed behind himto be filmed from another train running alongside. Buster his train and the camera are all in motion the wind whips through Buster's hair while smoky pinecovered hills rise and fall around him. These scenes are not only the highlight of the movie but a peak in the history of moving pictures and they put to shame all later backprojection and process shots models and computergenerated effects. The quality of Keaton's filmmaking is simplypun intendedunparalleled. Every shot in The General is clean fresh and efficiently composed the action is captured honestly and legibly at all times. The film never tries to be beautiful its beauty is functional just like the grave masculine beauty of the locomotives and railroad bridges and Civil War uniforms.The General's narrative structure is as strong and uncluttered as its look. Like a train it stays on track never meandering for the sake of a laugh or a stunt. All of the gags rise organically from the coherent and straightforward storyline. Adapting the historical incident Keaton made himself the engineer of the stolen train Johnnie Gray rather than one of the raiders. As he saw immediately The General is one long chase or rather two chases structured like the flight of a boomerang. First Johnnie on a borrowed train the Texas chases his own stolen train the General. He manages to steal it back and races it towards his own lines pursued by the raiders in the Texas who try to prevent him from carrying their battle plans to his own high command.The General is not Keaton's funniest film but here he was going for quality over quantity in laughs. A number of the gags like the boxcar that keeps appearing and disappearing as it switches tracks have a long buildup for a relatively modest payoff. But the laughter is mingled with a gasp of awe and the best moments never get stale on repeated viewings.

	schema:headline " The Greatest War Comedy ?";
	schema:reviewBody "It is generally or should I pun and say General Lee? said that the best comedy of the silent film career of Buster Keaton's career was his Civil War epic THE GENERAL. Apparently planned with more care than any of his other film projects it involved not only researching a period of history some sixty years in the past but getting the correct rolling stock costumes weapons and props to make it look correct. And it worked so well that Keaton never really could despite some great moments in STEAMBOAT BILL JR. outdo it. In fact the closest thing to his best sound film or film that he influenced that was a sound film was his work with Red Skelton in the comedy A SOUTHERN YANKEE where he returned to a Civil War theme.THE GENERAL as I mentioned in discussing the Disney film THE GREAT LOCOMOTIVE CHASE is based on the Andrews Raiders stealing of the Confederate locomotive The General and an attached train which was used to damage tracks and bridges. The raid in February 1862 was from northern Georgia into Tennesee. It only lasted 20 miles as the coal for the train was used up and not replaced. Andrews and several raiders were hanged after a trial. Others went to southern prisoner of war camps. The effect of the incident far outstripped it's military success. The damage after all could be repaired. But like Jimmy Doolittle's Raid over Tokyo in April 1942 it had a tremendous effect hurting Confederate morale. The area attacked was hundreds of miles from the battlefronts of Virginia or KentuckyNorthern Tennessee that were in the current events of the War at the time and so was considered safe by the Confederate government and public. Instead it had been shown quite easy for Northern raiders to hit and run for awhile.Despite it being a brief incident of the war the locomotive chase would remain famous after more important events were forgotten. The actual locomotive is still in existence in a museum in the south. When Lesney did it famous series of Models of Yesteryear the first locomotive that was included in that series of collectible toys was The General.The story however was ultimately a downer. But Keaton took the basic tale and made it a comedy of the period. First he changes the viewer's perspective  it is not concentrating on Andrews and his men but on the Confederates. Secondly he builds up the story of Johnny Gray a railroad engineer who tries to enlist but is rejected the twist of logic failure in the script is that the Confederate draft board head does not bother to explain to Johnny that he is more useful as an engineer to the cause than as a soldier. Because Keaton's family and girl friend Marion Mack see he is not enlisted they believe he turned coward.Johnny eventually is the only person who tries to retake the General from the raiders and the film has actually two chases in it  first Andrews and his men stealing the train and then Keaton sneaking into Northern lines with Mack and retaking it.Along the way are many comic classic moments such as Keaton carefully standing on the cowcatcher and carefully using physics to knock off broken wooden ties that might derail the train or when at a moment of dejection Keaton sits on the connecting rod that links the trains wheels and finds himself pulled into the locomotive barn while in a sitting positions. The situation of fighting the Yankees during the second chase and finding Marion Mack there helping him are wonderful  especially when she judges which lumps of coal are pretty enough to be used to keep the engine fired she throws away the ugly little ones. Keaton's reaction to her stupidity is a wonderful moment.The classic conclusion of the comedy is the battle of the two sides at the river and the burning of the railroad bridge with it's destruction of a second locomotive. It has been called the most expensive sight gag in history. By the way the Northern General who ordered the locomotive across the bridge is of some special interest. He was Mike Turkey Strut Donlin a frequent member and starring player of the old New York Giants under John McGraw and Christy Matthewson in the first two decades of the 20th Century. Donlin who got his funny nickname from the way he ran the bases left baseball to become a film actor he had worked a bit in vaudeville. Keaton was a sports fan and showed this in his film COLLEGE where he shows his abilities in several sports and hired Donlin. This was the latter's most famous performance  look at his reaction to the collapse.It must be regarded as Keaton's finest film and certainly the best war comedy to come out in the silent period. It may also be the best war comedy to come out of any period of motion pictures.".

	schema:reviewBody "I would have eventually gotten around to watching this film but my curiosity was piqued when I saw that it had miraculously jumped to Number 17 on the 2007 version of AFI's Top 100 Movies of all time list. It didn't make the cut at all for the original compilation in 1997 so even before seeing the picture I had to wonder what might have affected movie critics in the intervening decade to reach this conclusion. I usually line up with the majority in most cases but I have to admit I don't quite get it with this picture. I found it entertaining enough on occasion but I never got the sense that it was one of the great comedy classics of all time the way it's heralded on the DVD sleeve. I don't think the Civil War lends itself much to comedy so right there my expectations were greatly reduced. Keaton's somber demeanor and generally stone faced disposition don't help. On the flip side I wouldn't have expected slapstick to move the story along either so at least I wasn't disappointed in that regard.What I DID enjoy were some rather offbeat moments that showed genuine creativity. When Johnnie Gray Keaton dejectedly considered his rejection by the Confederate Army and pondered his situation while sitting on the train's connecting rod the resulting visual was pure genius. The up and down motion lent a truly surreal juxtaposition to Johnnie's thoughtful reverie and was one of the highlights of the picture for me.The other significant scene that gave me pause was when The Texas collapsed on the burning Rock River Bridge. For starters I found it unbelievable that a wooden bridge could possibly be constructed strong enough to support a locomotive. Then I came to learn that the scene was the most expensive ever made for a silent film and I have to give Keaton credit for going out on that kind of a limb  unbelievable.Oh yes and I can't forget the sequence where Keaton's marksmanship is dead on when he makes contact with the rail tie blocking the train tracks flipping it out of the way with a well timed throw of his own. Could that have possibly been done in one take? In a preCGI world it's difficult to imagine how stunts like these could have been performed particularly by an actor who had no recourse but to do his own. For that Keaton deserves accolades.In between all this clever film making however I just wasn't inspired. The central plot element doesn't hold up for me  if Johnnie Gray was rejected as a volunteer why wasn't he simply told the reason why. One could argue that then you wouldn't have a picture but for me it left the story on a shaky footing. If Johnnie was more valuable as a train engineer than a soldier the picture might have taken a different approach but the rest of the elements could have remained the same and he still would have come out a hero. Maybe I'm second guessing a master but that's what I come away with.Conclusion  if this movie didn't make AFI's Top 100 Film List in 1997 I don't understand what might have occurred in the intervening years to suddenly have film critics vault it into the Top 20. At the same time Chaplin's City Lights in my estimation a superior silent film fell OFF the list while The Gold Rush moved up a few notches. I may not be a professional but I know what I like and this one just didn't do it for me.".

	schema:headline " Richly inventive comedy with a logically impeccable plot that makes the hyperbolic slapstick seem plausible and inevitable this is a work of art and a work of genius";
	schema:reviewBody "Buster Keaton's The General about a man and his engine puts you in a world where the most comically inventive situation that could happen will happen. From major comic situations to throwaway gags The General always knows what to do.The story begins in leisurely fashion. A title card tells us that Johnnie Gray Keaton has two loves in his life his engine and his girlrespectively The General and Annabelle Lee Marion Mack. Johnnie goes to visit Annabelle followed by two engineerworshipping boys and unknown to him Annabelle Lee herself. He and his entourage arrive at the door Johnnie polishes his shoes on the back of his pants legs slicks back his hair and gently taps the door with the door knocker. Then he turns to notice Annabelle. Keaton's understated reaction is a testament to his uniqueness. Any other comedian would have done an explosive doubletake.Now Johnnie and Annabelle are together in her parlor but the boys are there too. Johnnie stands up puts on his hat and opens the door as if to leave. The heroworshippers are ready to follow but Johnnie lets them out first then closes the door on them. This is a gentle ruse in the world of silent comedy. At Keystone both boys would have gotten kicked in the pants.Now the two are alone. Annabelle's father sees them from another room and is about to break things up when her brother enters and announces that Fort Sumter has been fired upon the War Between the States has begun. Annabelle kisses her father and brother as they go to enlist then turns expectantly to Johnnie who cocks his head like a confused puppy. She asks Aren't you going to enlist? Realization hits him and he leaps off the seat. Before he can run out the door Annabelle kisses him. This so overwhelms Johnnie that he flings out his arm in a farewell gesture and falls off the porch.Johnnie races to the general store which is now a makeshift recruitment office. Taking a shortcut he manages to be the first in line. The door to the office is opened and Johnnie comes marching inonly he and the rest of the line go in two different directions and he has to jump over several tables to get in front again. He gives the enlistment officer his name and occupation but the man rejects him. Johnnie is more valuable to the South as an engineer. Later Annabelle believes that Johnnie didn't even try to enlist. She refuses to speak to him again until he's in uniform. What follows is a classic moment Johnnie sits on the connecting rod of his engine. He's so miserable that he doesn't notice when he starts moving up and down until just before the train enters a tunnel.Time passes and we learn that a group of Unionists are secretly passengers on The General. When nearly everyone is off the train having dinner the Unionists climb back aboard and take the engine. Annabelle a passenger herself was still on board. She is now their prisoner.But Johnnie only knows his beloved General has been stolen possibly by deserters. He pursues the engine by taking another The Texas. Through a mishap he becomes the sole person aboard The Texas but the Unionists think they're outnumbered and continue to run. What follows is the true joy of the movie two long chases separated by an important plot twist. Now the movie changes its quiet pace for almost nonstop action.I love it when the Unionists break off the rail car to hinder The Texas. At one point the car which Johnnie thought he had switched to another track reappears in front of the baffled engineer only to disappear later just as mysteriously. We see the logical circumstances that lead to the car's seeming magic act and the equally logical situations that keep Keaton occupied preventing him from seeing what we see.Comic logic is important to The General. In no other movie do hyperbolic slapstick gags seem so plausible and inevitable. In a throwaway gag Johnnie empties a burlap sack full of shoes because he urgently needs the sack. Of courseof course!he loses his own shoe in the pile and must stop to hunt for it.We move to the second chase where Johnnie has The General and the Unionists are the ones pursuing him.

	onyx:emotionText "Buster Keaton's The General about a man and his engine puts you in a world where the most comically inventive situation that could happen will happen. From major comic situations to throwaway gags The General always knows what to do.The story begins in leisurely fashion. A title card tells us that Johnnie Gray Keaton has two loves in his life his engine and his girlrespectively The General and Annabelle Lee Marion Mack. Johnnie goes to visit Annabelle followed by two engineerworshipping boys and unknown to him Annabelle Lee herself. He and his entourage arrive at the door Johnnie polishes his shoes on the back of his pants legs slicks back his hair and gently taps the door with the door knocker. Then he turns to notice Annabelle. Keaton's understated reaction is a testament to his uniqueness. Any other comedian would have done an explosive doubletake.Now Johnnie and Annabelle are together in her parlor but the boys are there too. Johnnie stands up puts on his hat and opens the door as if to leave. The heroworshippers are ready to follow but Johnnie lets them out first then closes the door on them. This is a gentle ruse in the world of silent comedy. At Keystone both boys would have gotten kicked in the pants.Now the two are alone. Annabelle's father sees them from another room and is about to break things up when her brother enters and announces that Fort Sumter has been fired upon the War Between the States has begun. Annabelle kisses her father and brother as they go to enlist then turns expectantly to Johnnie who cocks his head like a confused puppy. She asks Aren't you going to enlist? Realization hits him and he leaps off the seat. Before he can run out the door Annabelle kisses him. This so overwhelms Johnnie that he flings out his arm in a farewell gesture and falls off the porch.Johnnie races to the general store which is now a makeshift recruitment office. Taking a shortcut he manages to be the first in line. The door to the office is opened and Johnnie comes marching inonly he and the rest of the line go in two different directions and he has to jump over several tables to get in front again. He gives the enlistment officer his name and occupation but the man rejects him. Johnnie is more valuable to the South as an engineer. Later Annabelle believes that Johnnie didn't even try to enlist. She refuses to speak to him again until he's in uniform. What follows is a classic moment Johnnie sits on the connecting rod of his engine. He's so miserable that he doesn't notice when he starts moving up and down until just before the train enters a tunnel.Time passes and we learn that a group of Unionists are secretly passengers on The General. When nearly everyone is off the train having dinner the Unionists climb back aboard and take the engine. Annabelle a passenger herself was still on board. She is now their prisoner.But Johnnie only knows his beloved General has been stolen possibly by deserters. He pursues the engine by taking another The Texas. Through a mishap he becomes the sole person aboard The Texas but the Unionists think they're outnumbered and continue to run. What follows is the true joy of the movie two long chases separated by an important plot twist. Now the movie changes its quiet pace for almost nonstop action.I love it when the Unionists break off the rail car to hinder The Texas. At one point the car which Johnnie thought he had switched to another track reappears in front of the baffled engineer only to disappear later just as mysteriously. We see the logical circumstances that lead to the car's seeming magic act and the equally logical situations that keep Keaton occupied preventing him from seeing what we see.Comic logic is important to The General. In no other movie do hyperbolic slapstick gags seem so plausible and inevitable. In a throwaway gag Johnnie empties a burlap sack full of shoes because he urgently needs the sack. Of courseof course!he loses his own shoe in the pile and must stop to hunt for it.We move to the second chase where Johnnie has The General and the Unionists are the ones pursuing him. Now Johnnie must contend with Annabelle Lee.Marion Mack leaves no mark of her personality on the screen. She deserves credit mainly for being willing and able to take it. Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn were never thrown around trod upon or knocked about the way Marion Mack was. She has hilarious moments. The excitement of the chase does not prevent her from taking out a broom to sweep the dusty floor of the engine. An exasperated Johnnie tells her to keep throwing wood into the fire.

Second people came to the movies to see Buster Keaton the comedian not Buster the filmmaker and director which is more of the role he played here. The film was funny but it was not gag after gag like so many of Keaton's other films. Keaton plays a railroad engineer living in the South.

Buster starts out in hot pursuit of the thieves to retrieve his train still without the knowledge of his girl's captivity by the Union army.Forgotten with the arrival of sound the film revived  often cut up from its original length  in the 1950's because Buster didn't preserve his rights to the film and it fell into the public domain. That is the reason there are so many versions of The General out there today often with poor video and hideous musical accompaniment.Today The General is considered one of the best silent feature length films and one of the few silent films to not only be on DVD but to get the Blu Ray treatment too. SHERLOCK JR. is clever. OUR HOSPITALITY is hilarious. The General is both of these things. It's story driven races to a climax and is fueled by cute clever inventive gags.Buster recycled these gags when he was a writer for MGM years later in A Southern Yankee.".

The General is a silent comedy mostly slapstick about Johnny Gray a train engineer with two loves his engine and Annabelle Lee. Annabelle soon dumps him because of his failure to enlist into the Civil War they would not take him because he was too valuable as an engineer. Things are then sped up a year where we see some Union commanders planning to hijack a train to unleash a highly sophisticated master plan. As it so happens they steal Johnny's engine a big mistake.Buster Keaton does a phenomenal performance as Johnny. His face and character is ideal for this type of comedy. He reminds me a lot of Leslie Nielsen from the Naked Gun movies but of course less old. He is often ignorant of what is going on around him leading to plenty of laughs. This also makes him a very charismatic character.There are countless train related jokes. The first one comes right at the beginning when we see Johnny being followed by two kids and a woman in a line much like a train. The bulk of the movie is made up of Johnny running a train either chasing or fleeing from the Union soldiers. The movement and maneuvering of the trains is beautiful. The stunt work is an incredible accomplishment. The finale is explosive.The General was a lot of fun to watch. It gave me more laughs than most modern comedies and had plenty of substance on top of that. This is enough for me to label it as one of the greatest comedies ever. After my first viewing it instantly became one of my favorites. It is timeless gem that should be watched at least once by anyone interested in movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen one other silent movie in my life but it was Mel Brooks's The Silent Movie so I don't know if it really counts. I really enjoyed The General overall more than I thought I would as someone who was born after The Godfather.The main thing that surprised me was the fact that I couldn't look down to write very many notes any time I took my eyes off the screen I ran a serious risk of missing something. It seems to me that the film even though it was long or seemed so it was very dense in terms of action. I imagine that since the movie has no dialogue the filmmakers must make up for it by making it as visually interesting and entertaining as possible. I am accustomed to more modern movies with snappy dialogue and special effects and suchmovies in which you can look down at your popcorn or kiss your date and not miss too much because you can hear pretty much what's happening. This was a nice change for me.Obviously I've never seen a Buster Keaton film and I'm not even sure if I'd heard of him before this class. But I can see why he is so appealing in his films. I loved his facial expressions particularly the stoicbutcrestfallen look in his eyes on the train when something else goes wrong. He also has great control of his body as we discussed in class and a fine sense of comic timing.I found the film surprisingly funny. Many modern films that I think are funny e.g. Austin Powers Toy Story American Beauty rely largely on witty or outrageous dialogue for their humor. As a silent film The General must rely mainly on images for its humorthe slapstick images of Johnnie falling over constantly the unusual image of Johnnie riding up and down on the crossbar between the train wheels the stereotype exploitation in the scene when the girl sweeps out the locomotive. I'm sure that some of the things that I considered amusing might not have been considered funny by the original audience such as the recordscratch lightning bolts.I really liked some of the cinematic techniques and blocking that Keaton used. One of my favorite scenes in the entire film is when Johnnie is chopping wood on the train while the Southern army retreats in the opposite direction in the background. Even though the real' army is pulling back the one they didn't want is rushing into enemy territory. It's a nice integration of plot and character commentary. I also liked the way he kept cutting back and forth between the Yankees on their trains and Johnnie on his at first the pursuer then the pursuee. By continually showing us what both sides are doing Keaton builds the tension between them adds to the comic effect and keeps the audience interested by always giving them something different to look at. This montage technique is used in nearly all action films and many comedy films today.I did not realize that the rain and fire sound effects were added in later. I think they are interesting and I can see why someone put them in but I think I would prefer that the film be left the way it was originally shown. Or at least they should take out the chirping birds. Some people complained about the repetitiveness of the music but I found the music quaint and very much in the character of the movie. It was as if each person or group had its own theme music perhaps to make up for the lack of dialogue. The use of the Beautiful Dreamer' love theme reminds me of the Dreamweaver' love theme in Wayne's World that plays when Garth sees the blonde woman.Although the battle scene was interesting I agreed with much of the class that the movie could have ended earlier. The movie seemed to change a bit once the entire army got involved and the focus left Johnnie for a time. Perhaps they could have ended the battle scene with the Southern army lying in wait for the enemy and then cut to a later scene in which Johnnie receives an honorary enlistment so he can get the girl. But hey then Keaton wouldn't have gotten to play with the bridge fire and the dam maybe audiences then weren't so different from us and would prefer an exciting ending for a movie like this over a more subdued one. But I still think it changed the character of the movie and should have been changed somehow.Overall I give it a 910. If you've never seen a silent movie this is a great one to start with.".

Moreover Annabelle is on board. Johnnie sets off after the two loves of his life.Great comedy from the silent era directed and starring one of the greatest comedy directors and actors of that era Buster Keaton. This is a rollicking adventure complete with wonderfully thoughtout and performed physical comedy and other sight gags. Some very clever use of the plot to generate the comedy.The plot itself isn't overly profound but crams in a lot of action and adventure plus some romance.Very entertaining.".

Johnnie sets off after the two loves of his life.Great comedy from the silent era directed and starring one of the greatest comedy directors and actors of that era Buster Keaton. This is a rollicking adventure complete with wonderfully thoughtout and performed physical comedy and other sight gags. Some very clever use of the plot to generate the comedy.The plot itself isn't overly profound but crams in a lot of action and adventure plus some romance.Very entertaining.";

When the Civil War breaks out he tries to enlist and thus please his girl Annabelle Lee Marion Mack but the authorities deem him more useful running trains. When Union spies seize the General with an idea of using it to burn bridges and disrupt the Confederate supply line it's up to Gray to save the day.New York Times reviewer Mordaunt Hall reviewed The General back in 1926 and expressed disappointment. This is by no means so good as Mr. Keaton's previous efforts he wrote. People cite Hall's review as a classic example of whatdocriticsknow but the more I read the more I agreed with him. The fun is not exactly plentiful he wrote noting Keaton here was too much the acrobat too little the clown.When I watched The General I felt disappointment too. Like Hall's it wasn't total it's exciting and inventive and boasts some of the finest screen compositions I've ever seen. The technical expertise on display is astounding. It's just that the overall experience left me a bit flat.First you have what Roger Ebert liked to call the idiot plot. Gray tries to enlist and is rejected by the army because he's too valuable as a train engineer. Annabelle apparently never learns this for she rejects him as a coward. I don't want you to speak to me again until you're in uniform she huffs.Either he's an idiot for not explaining the truth of the matter or she's an idiot for preferring her lover be cannon fodder than a real asset to their cause. Anyway Buster does manage to make this play later on When he finally speaks to her he is in uniform an enemy uniform.The other main issue involves what Lincoln called the slows. A lot of the story is literally trainwatching. Buster does some brave amazing stuntwork and throws in some clever gags later joined by Mack who's no Sibil Seely but still quite game but it's basically a lot of watching trains go by. The craft here is in the precision of the camerawork and the splitsecond timing not so much the comedy. In fact except for Buster himself everyone plays it completely straight probably because this is real history being presented. Compared to other Keaton comedies it feels a bit straitjacketed by that.The General is still a solid thrill comedy with some amusing one liners If you lose this war don't blame me Johnny yells after being rejected and brilliant sight gags like the fussy Annabelle's rejection of unattractive firewood while Buster struggles to stoke the engine.To me that's enough for The General to be another good reason for loving Buster Keaton. I just can't understand it being the preeminent reason. Maybe critics can't really love a comedy for just making you laugh and laugh. I'm just glad Keaton made other movies at least as brilliant as The General and funnier too.".

He is too good for her. I thought the stunt where the bridge gives out and the train falls was very well done and must have cost a fortune. There were scenes where I found myself laughing out loud and scenes where I was bored.

	schema:reviewBody "Buster Keaton always amazes me. He was truly one of the most hilarious deadpan screen clowns of early cinema. And The General even clocking in at around three hours is surprisingly watchable based on his physical performance alone.Granted I still admit that I prefer the silent clowns in shorts because it can be a bit exhausting to watch them in an entire feature especially since they are often strings of vignettes thrown together and my modern brain prefers to edit out everything that's unnecessary but some of the joy in these films is found in those very moments. There are multiple points in the General a story about a Southern engineer that has to rescue his beloved from the clutches of the North in the Civil War where Keaton's character Johnnie Gray has to stop his train jump out and remove something from the tracks which in itself can be quite boring but the way that Keaton injects physical comedy into those moments keeps me entertained.And it's a marvel how so many realistic yet comedic stunts that Keaton could come up with. It's nothing fantastic like some of his other films but it's still funny. And I think the strongest point of his comedy is his completely stonefaced response to all adversitybut he lets you see just a little his plight in his eyes and it's just enough to know that he is frightened but that the rest of him doesn't react similarly creates such an amusing dissociation that it goes from bizarre to funny. Whether he's pratfalling due to surprise or erroneously succeeding at something he's unskilled in and being shocked by it that response of his is winning.But the General does show its age a little. It exists in a time when people were still getting quite used to movies and so there is a lot of space that doesn't get edited out to help people get a better sense of the context. I wouldn't dare cut those moments out of this film even if I could reedit it because the space always had something going on but at the same time this film if made today would be cut to oneandahalf or two hours and pack in the comedy more tightly. The plot and story are simple but exist more than to just help the comedy move alongexcept at the end when the first story was accomplished. Then we move into a second extraneous but still amusing story regarding a battle between the North and the South that could've been excised and still having a decent though simple story.I didn't really love the score that the DVD company attached to it which is a number of classical pieces end on end. I think a new commissioned soundtrack would've better matched the piece but I guess we get what we get. And on the plus side you can always mute the movie and play whatever on top of it.Is it perfect? No. But despite the age it shows it still holds up as an enjoyable work from one of cinema's greatest physical comedians. If you want to spend three hours with a silent clown this is not a bad way to go. 810.".

Buster Keaton is an amazingly versatile performer able to go from clownish jokester to a saddened victim of war and poor circumstances in a heartbeat. The film is also really ambitious in scope.

Plus very little money is spared and the film famously has some of the most expensive set pieces and stunts of the silent era.The plot of the film is also a lot more cohesive than say in the films made by Charlie Chaplin in the same decade. Chaplin's films usually contain segments that have little to do with anything except the need for funny situations. The General is also a comedy but with a clear clean story arc.On the other hand I didn't find the humour or the characters as captivating. They're okay but in this regard the decades of cultural development between the film and yours truly work against the film.

Keaton risked life and limb performing many amazing and dangerous practical stunts on and around the moving train that provided for a great spectacle but without a strong story and strong characters the film becomes little more than a series of spectacular but meaningless stunts. The real love affair of the picture is between Johnny Gray and his beloved locomotive The General. The Annabelle character is so shallow and empty that it becomes impossible to believe that Johnny would care at all about winning back her affections. Indeed Johnny cares far more about getting his train back from the Union Army than he does about winning back Annabelle but the human love story just left this reviewer feeling cold. It was rather surprising to see the film portray the Confederate Army as noble and righteous while portraying the Union Army as bumbling and clueless but the point of view lacked gravity and meaning as the grave circumstances behind the US Civil War were totally ignored. The simplistic us vs. them view of this momentous and tragic chapter of American History does a great disservice to the men women and children on all sides who lost their homes and lives in the war. There is certainly a place for comedy in the horrors of war as Chaplin brilliantly demonstrated in The Great Dictator1940 but Keaton's failure to show any of the depth of the historic events of the time left me unsatisfied and a bit annoyed by the treatment of the US Civil War. I have a hard time understanding the near universal praise for The General1926 to me the picture is akin to a modern film that has incredible action scenes but zero story.".

	schema:headline " Keaton shows why he was king of comedy stunts";
	schema:reviewBody "The General is one of the great films and treasures of the silent era. It's among the best movies of the talented comedy actor Buster Keaton. In this film Keaton shows the athletic ability and courage that made him one of the best of the early comedians who performed their own stunts. His physical antics on and off his train The General support his title as king of comedy stunts. All the silent era comedy actors seemed to have lots of energy. And many had daring courage and even madness at times. Those were the actors who did all or most of their own stunts. While there were some stunt men around in the early 1900s it wasn't until the last of the silent years and dawn of sound pictures that stuntmen were a regular part of the cast of films that required any amount of derringdo. And while a small number of actors today will still do some of their own stunts nothing can compare to the actors of old who performed their own highrisk and dangerous stunts  and sometimes those for other actors. The five best early actors at doing stunts were Buster Keaton Douglas Fairbanks Sr. Harold Lloyd Tom Mix and Yakima Canutt. The latter two specialized in Westerns and besides acting and doing stunt work Mix and Canutt regularly rode and performed in the rodeo circuit. Lloyd was versatile in his venues but excelled at high stunts on buildings and sometimes with wild animals. Fairbanks excelled in swashbuckler stunts sliding down the sails of ships swinging from anything hanging aloft and jumping with the help of trampolines into windows. Keaton was even more versatile. As a child actor in vaudeville Keaton learned how to fall to avoid injury. He called his technique soft falls or landings. But even with his training and practice his film roles with derringdo often left him bruised at the least. At other times he had suffered injuries from slight to serious. Still he had become known for his physical resiliency During the filming of The General in 1926 Keaton was knocked unconscious by canon fire. He suffered a broken ankle while filming the 1922 short The Electric House. And he broke his neck during the 1924 shooting of Sherlock Jr. but didn't know it until years later. This movie has an interesting plot set during the U.S. Civil War. It opens with a scene and script that reads The Western and Atlantic Flyer speeding into Marietta Georgia in the spring of 1861. The train seems to be traveling about 30 miles per hour. But the film is almost entirely about action and the comedy in the action involving the train. There is an element of romance. The cast all are very good. The photography is superb. Much of the action with trains is filmed in Westcentral Oregon from Eugene to Cottage Grove. There's no information about sound at all so I assume the music we hear with the film is soundtrack that was added for modern viewing. It probably is meant to replicate the piano accompaniment that was usual with silent films in theaters of the day. This is one instance when I think the piano playing would have been better. The music seems to go overboard at times. This is one of the early great films from the silent era that showcase the talent and early mastery of moviemaking skills. It's a fun movie with strong visuals that even a modern family of all ages should enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "The nineties didn't start under auspicious skies for Claude Chabrol. Jours Tranquilles  Clichy 1990 was a big bore Dr.M 1990 constituted one more fiasco and one could have easily done without a new version of Madame Bovary 1991 which strictly brought nothing to Gustave Flaubert's novel.So after three failures on the trot Chabrol turned to one of his favorite novelists Georges Simenon hoping to find some help to boost his career again and he found it with the novel Betty. He was so much taken with this novel that he decided to transfer it to the screen. It wasn't one of Simenon's most wellknown novels but a commendable one all the same and it's easy to understand why Chabrol liked this novel so much. It assesses the portrait of an immoral woman who got a raw deal. She's like a driftwood in the throes of a river full of undertows and unbalanced by unfortunate events. A heartless mother who sent her to live with her aunt when she was young. The day she discovered her uncle having sex with a teenage girl a loveless marriage in a bourgeois milieu whose members especially considered her as an object pregnancy so that the Etamble descendants could be assured a scandal which obliged her to break with her upperclass family and her children. In Chabrol's work all these events are related as flashbacks and at the outset of the film Betty is a complete drifter wanders from caf to caf is often on booze and fags she spends a good half of the film with cigarettes and alcohol near her. In a rather sleazy bar she's rescued by a rich widow Laure Stphane Audran who befriends with her. She also seems to be a woman with a heavy past behind her and searching for human warmth...As Marie Trintignant once put it Chabrol likes these monstrous women who do terrible things with a total innocence. With this noteworthy opinion and the contents of the film Betty is easy to locate in Chabrol's bushy filmography. One could regard it as the female cousin of Violette Nozires 1978 une Affaire De Femmes 1988 and la Crmonie 1995. Without losing the thread of the plot Chabrol unveils to the audience keyelements in Betty's life which might have been watershed ones in the construction and the solidification of her numb and a little unfathomable persona. Chabrol was right not to give us available direct solutions or weak possibilities to explain her actions and so his enigmatic heroine keeps all her mystery. To better emphasize her elusive character the filmmaker bestowed his directing with deft shrewd ideas. For instance when Laure begins to speak about Mario her lover or herself Betty doesn't appear to listen to her she's completely immersed in her bitter memories and so during Laure's words the camera takes us in another time another place like a dinner in her former bourgeois family. This kind of brainy idea tells a lot about the type of character that is Betty and also gives an inkling to the audience about her mind in disarray. And I particularly relish the very last shot which showcases her behind an aquarium whose water is unclear. It's selfexplanatory...Betty also provided to Chabrol another godsent opportunity to deliver one more scathing attack on the upperclass milieu given that Betty's bourgeois family has a part of responsibility in her fall.The two central performances command admiration and respect. Marie Trintignant and Stphane Audran completely mesh together with easiness. For the latter it would be the very last time she acted in a film made by her ex husband.A compelling writing of the characters a painstaking construction and the big efforts Chabrol put in this story of an ambiguous woman make Betty a real winner amid his uneven filmography. Unfortunately his adaptations from Simenon didn't put the critics and the public on the same wavelength since the film had a fleeting life in the French theaters in spite of glowing reviews. The same mishap happened ten years ago with les Fantmes Du Chapelier 1982 another Simenon adaptation inferior to Betty. But never mind in 1992 Chabrol found again his high artistic potential and the level will maintain itself with his two following works the divine l'Enfer 1994 and la Crmonie 1995.".

Unfortunately his adaptations from Simenon didn't put the critics and the public on the same wavelength since the film had a fleeting life in the French theaters in spite of glowing reviews. The same mishap happened ten years ago with les Fantmes Du Chapelier 1982 another Simenon adaptation inferior to Betty. But never mind in 1992 Chabrol found again his high artistic potential and the level will maintain itself with his two following works the divine l'Enfer 1994 and la Crmonie 1995.";

There aren't that many comments on this and some of them seem to let the violent death of Marie Trintignant influence their critical faculties. Whilst it's undeniable that Trintignant does appear as a slightly ethereal creature with eyes freighted heavily with sadness in this film it's probably better to see this as coincidence rather than forecast. Apart from ethereal there's also something UNreal about the entire situation. We're asked to accept the premise that a very attractive if not actually beautiful young woman would allow herself to drift through life letting life happen to HER rather than attempting to impose any order on it. Having married well and then taken a lover would she really invite him into her husband's family home for a quickie aware that the husband and his mother  who had gone to the theatre  could return at any moment as indeed they doand within the hour have a lawyer on the scene drafting an agreement whereby Betty forfeits all rights to see her children in return for a healthy check with further installments to come. Would she then with several thousand francs in her handbag and the promise of regular monthly payments become a hooker in all but name being picked up indiscriminately by men in which she has little interest either fiscal or physical. While we're talking farfetched why would an elderly man pick up women in Paris and drive them out to a seedy club in Versailles apart from providing an opportunity for Betty to encounter Laure Stephane Audran yet another wealthy person with a taste for the sleazy who decides to befriend Betty. Though you are aware of these inconsistencies it does not prevent you watching a highly watchable film and admiring the two central performances but it's not necessarily a film to which you would want to return.".

Thankfully she is picked up from the gutter by an enigmatic middleaged woman with a much younger companion who installs her into her own lavish apartment and gradually helps her pick up the pieces of her brokendown life. But the innately sensuous qualities of the waiflike Betty soon catch the attention of her benefactor's boyfriend and perhaps inevitably tragic circumstances ensue.The lowkey qualities of BETTY are countered by Chabrol's decision to structure his film as a complex maze of flashbacks which depict and contrast the stuffy ordered aristocratic lifestyle the protagonist suffered through in her married past versus her new chaotic but freespirited present state.

	schema:reviewBody "Betty is hard to understand. Not a victim yet not a manipulator. She suffers yet she destroys what's around her for petty motives or not even that.Cinematography is part of the story. Like at Berri's Tchao pantin 1983 Bernard Zitzermann's work enhances the story at the right time and then releases its grip on us. When it pours rain and Betty is carried like merchandise from one tramp to another you feel wet and desolate. The song Je voulais te dire que je t'attends is very effective too I felt bad just by comparing the moving lyrics with what we were seeing the road to nowhere.Simenon is a love hate affair I find it hard to be objective with him. I can't speak about his novels but I can't say I like watching his cinema adaptations they make me feel bad about everything in life after having watched them. And yet I though they well made atmospheric immersing in a sort of descent to hell way. I mean it's like reading Dostoievsky but less melodramatic and with way more sex  the facade of love as subjects.This is a film about women. Marie Trintignat of course IS this movie. Frail elegant beautiful but enigmatic always following her own ways in her private world where no one reaches her it's hard to love her if one sees her objectively but is nevertheless an alluring character. Reading her bio on IMDb is heavily interesting it's like Claude C understood her personality almost her destiny encapsulated it and gave it to us on celluloid thus making it last sort of forever.Laure on the contrary while no angel maybe sees in Betty some sort of projection of herself some lost soul to be saved or in any case she mothers Betty in a non dominating way firm when she has to almost too perfect to be real.Mario and Guy Etamble are characters devoid of soul will or personality. Guy of course is dominated by the family even when they made her sign the legal contract it's them not him. Even the sister in law is there ! So when they have to decide what to do with her it's a family affair in which Guy is only one of the voices. And of course there Madame Etamble seems to be the only dominating force.

	onyx:emotionText "Betty is hard to understand. Not a victim yet not a manipulator. She suffers yet she destroys what's around her for petty motives or not even that.Cinematography is part of the story. Like at Berri's Tchao pantin 1983 Bernard Zitzermann's work enhances the story at the right time and then releases its grip on us. When it pours rain and Betty is carried like merchandise from one tramp to another you feel wet and desolate. The song Je voulais te dire que je t'attends is very effective too I felt bad just by comparing the moving lyrics with what we were seeing the road to nowhere.Simenon is a love hate affair I find it hard to be objective with him. I can't speak about his novels but I can't say I like watching his cinema adaptations they make me feel bad about everything in life after having watched them. And yet I though they well made atmospheric immersing in a sort of descent to hell way. I mean it's like reading Dostoievsky but less melodramatic and with way more sex  the facade of love as subjects.This is a film about women. Marie Trintignat of course IS this movie. Frail elegant beautiful but enigmatic always following her own ways in her private world where no one reaches her it's hard to love her if one sees her objectively but is nevertheless an alluring character. Reading her bio on IMDb is heavily interesting it's like Claude C understood her personality almost her destiny encapsulated it and gave it to us on celluloid thus making it last sort of forever.Laure on the contrary while no angel maybe sees in Betty some sort of projection of herself some lost soul to be saved or in any case she mothers Betty in a non dominating way firm when she has to almost too perfect to be real.Mario and Guy Etamble are characters devoid of soul will or personality. Guy of course is dominated by the family even when they made her sign the legal contract it's them not him. Even the sister in law is there ! So when they have to decide what to do with her it's a family affair in which Guy is only one of the voices. And of course there Madame Etamble seems to be the only dominating force. Again women are the only source of plot in this story.A very French film in the use of a convoluted plot frequent flashbacks originary scenes all the time torrid sex scenes unintended to be seen but of course finally obvious unless you think there is always a motif for everything so ... .

Betty Anne Hilary Swank puts herself through law school for the sole effort of freeing her innocent brother Kenny Sam Rockwell from a lifesentence in prison for murder. Swank and Rockwell both carry this emotional film on their very strong shoulders.There are very few courtroom scenes very few law school scenes but it is filled with emotional connections between brother and sister as she visits him in prison and as she tries living her own life. The characters dominate the beginning of the film and the steps Swank has to take to free Rockwell keeps the film going towards the end.It is shot well as this is clearly Massachusetts and it set the right feelings for the film without overpowering it. The highlights are Swank and Rockwell as they both play characters with elements that we have seen before that have given Swank Oscar wins and have given Rockwell popularity. Here he has toned down his comic antics just enough for his performance to remain popular but should also give him his first Oscar nomination.The story may be missing a few elements that would have given it more substance to make it more interesting but it seems to me that's because the filmmakers had a few restrictions in keeping to the true story.

I Love You and historical biopic in 2009's Amelia Hilary Swank is back in her element as Betty Ann Waters a workingclass single mother of two whose fierce loyalty to her troublemaking brother Kenny knows no bounds in actordirector Tony Goldwyn's timespanning factbased 2010 drama. Written by Pamela Gray she and Goldwyn also collaborated on 1999's affecting A Walk on the Moon the inspiring potentially melodramatic plot line often borders on incredulity but Swank's trademark ironjawed tenacity is on full display here. At the same time it's a primarily economic performance teetering on lunacy as her character is tightly bound to Kenny since they shared a painful childhood due to the neglect of a horrifying mother.In 1983 Kenny is convicted of the bloody murder of an elderly neighbor largely on the basis of testimony from two former girlfriends both of whom claimed he confessed his actions to them. Neither Kenny nor Betty Anne can afford a good attorney so she decides to become a lawyer even though she's a high school dropout. Also serving as one of the film's executive producers Swank come back securely to the againstallodds territory of Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby 2004 by following Betty Ann's sixteenyear journey from her GED through college then law school and finally passing the bar  all while she was raising two boys and working parttime at a local pub. The ending is predictable from a mile away but the journey is not. The introduction of DNA evidence provides a linchpin that spins the story close to Lifetimelevel dramatics especially when Betty Ann solicits the assistance of the Innocence Project a nonprofit organization devoted to overturning wrongful convictions. Gray's screenplay is solid enough and Goldwyn's direction is assured within the backandforth treatment of the timeline.However it's really the acting that is aces here. Beyond Swank's sterling work Sam Rockwell brings an unpredictable furor and a surprising vulnerability to the showier role of Kenny. His rapport with Swank never feels forced and the devotion of their sibling relationship is what really grounds the threat of hysterics in the film. The periphery is populated by a powerful squad of actresses turning in sharply etched work  Minnie Driver as Betty Ann's lawschool friend Abra whose comic spark highlights how pivotal her character is in representing the audience viewpoint Melissa Leo Frozen River as the malevolent arresting cop whose secretive hostility provides the impetus for Kenny's conviction Juliette Lewis as Kenny's dentallychallenged exgirlfriend with a drunken confession scene that reveals the actress's longforgotten raw talent below her usual giddiness Karen Young in a brief scene as the unforgivable Mrs. Waters and Ari Graynor Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist as Kenny's embittered grown daughter. It's the cast's cumulative work that makes this movie intensely watchable.".

How loyal would our families be if we were convicted of a crime we were innocent of and sent to prison for the rest of lives? Would they put all their worldly desires away to do everything in their power to see to our injustice? I dare say that I know that it takes a special few that have such perseverance or such conviction.Hilary Swank stars in the film so aptly titled Conviction. Here again Swank portrays the reallife Betty Ann Waters. Betty Ann's brother Kenny was convicted of a violent murder in their home town in Massachusetts and sent to prison in 1983. Betty Ann and Kenny grew up in a dysfunctional home and were tossed around to a plethora of foster homes during their childhood and adolescence. The only family they had was each other. Their relationship was so close and intimate that there was no doubt in her mind that her brother was incapable of murder. Kenny was a selfadmitted bad boy. He had been arrested so many times in their small community that when Kenny's neighbor turned up murdered it seemed to be an easy assumption that Kenny was the perpetrator of the crime.Betty Ann had no money for highpaid lawyers and when Kenny tries to kill himself in prison she came up with a solution to their problem. She will go to college then law school and then become a lawyer and find the evidence to set her brother free. This sound like a plot madeup in a studio office but it is the true story of this amazing woman. And there would be no movie if Betty Ann's astounding story didn't have a happy ending.Telling this story is difficult. But the even script by Pamela Gray provides a good point of departure for Tony Goldwyn's direction and the moving performances by the actors. Without hesitation Hilary Swank is definitely back her disappointing performance as Amelia Earhart last year could have ended her trip down the red carpet to win Oscar gold forever. Her performance playing Betty Ann is subtle and convincing. But it's not just Hilary Swank's performance that should be noted. Sam Rockwell's portrayal of Kenny Waters is amazing and heartwrenching. His scenes in prison are remarkable as he so effortlessly depicts the wide range of emotions from complete hopelessness when years of imprisonment wear on him to utter joy when he learns that his sister has done the impossible. And lastly Minnie Driver makes a great impression playing Betty Ann's law school friend. It's a role that could garner attention at award time and hopefully will lead to more roles in the future.Conviction is one of the best films of the year. Its story of neverending loyalty and love of a sister. It is inspirational and uplifting. This film will make you believe again that with desire perseverance and the conviction to never stop trying almost anything is possible.For more reviews and news written by Kay Shackleton see here www.examiner.commovieawardsinnational".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow conviction is definitely a deeply moving film and very well acted by Hilary Swank Minnie Driver and Juliette Lewis. However Sam Rockwell is the one who really shines in Conviction. He plays his role as this man who got wrongfully convicted of murder really raw and powerful. His character had many different emotions in this film. He had to express many different emotional feelings in the role. He had to be angry sad and happy and he portrayed it very well. If he doesn't get an Oscar nomination for this film I'd be truly surprised if he doesn't get his recognition he is severely underrated so much so that it actually angers me that the Academy doesn't recognize Sam Rockwell because he is definitely overdue for an Oscar nomination or win.1010".

However Sam Rockwell is the one who really shines in Conviction. He plays his role as this man who got wrongfully convicted of murder really raw and powerful. His character had many different emotions in this film. He had to express many different emotional feelings in the role. He had to be angry sad and happy and he portrayed it very well. If he doesn't get an Oscar nomination for this film I'd be truly surprised if he doesn't get his recognition he is severely underrated so much so that it actually angers me that the Academy doesn't recognize Sam Rockwell because he is definitely overdue for an Oscar nomination or win.1010";

	schema:reviewBody "Synopsis Conviction is based on an inspiring true story of Betty Anne Waters Hilary Swank a high school dropout who over 18years put herself through law school to represent and hopefully overturn her innocent brother's Kenny Waters Sam Rockwell murder conviction. Betty Anne is a working mother of two boys who believes that her brother was wrongfully convicted and sentenced to life in prison for a 1980 bloody murder of a woman living in a trailer next door to him in Ayer Massachusetts. Kenny's ability to appeal his conviction using public defenders has been exhausted and without a lawyer he will die in prison. That is when Betty Anne decides to dedicate her life to save her brother. With a newly earned law degree in hand she hopes to exonerate her brother with new evidence and the new science of DNA.My Comment This is a story of what a devoted and inseparable loving sister can do for her brother when he needs her most. Their family bond for each other while growing up on a farm is stronger than any prison can break. The movie shows Betty Anne Waters' commitment in freeing her brother as the only thing that will make her life complete. The struggles she endures to become a lawyer and her willpower to save her brother from any further pain is inspirational. The bond between Hilary Swank and Sam Rockwell seems very real including the steps that she takes as an obsessed lawyer to set him free. Their performances were brilliant and I believe that both of them will be nominated for an Oscar. This is a movie to see. Footnote The Innocence Project using DNA matching since 1989 has freed over 254 innocent people from prison in the United States. Fox Searchlight Pictures Run Time 146 Rated R 810".

I must say more than movie the story in itself is simply heart wrenching so I really applaud for the director producers for choosing such an incredible true story to be told on screen. The only flaw in the movie was its length and sometimes I found the editing of flashbacks little irritating. The performances in the movie are truly incredible and every time I saw Hilary Swank and Sam Rockwell it brought tears in my eyes. The chemistry between these two actors is amazingly genuine and real. Even the young Brother and Sister played by Bailee Madison and Tobias Campbell had an awesome chemistry and it made the whole movie very relatable. Melissa Leo Minnie Driver and Elle Bardha did a respectable job. One of the shocking performances in the movie is indeed from Juliet Lewis who was outstanding in her 10mintutes role. My jaws were literally dropped to see her in middle aged role. You have to see to believe how good she was I won't be shock if she gets an Oscar Nod for that. Overall it's an inspiring tale of how far a Sister can go for her Brother to get Justice. Truly Inspiring.".

While there is the story of 'guilty until proved innocent' but what makes this one stand out is the authenticity with which the brothersister relationship is portrayed. One doesn't see many Hollywood movies explore sibling relationships unless it's in the form of mockery like 'Stepbrothers'. There are but a very few exceptions like Kenneth Lonergan's beautiful 'You Can Count On Me'.Swank and Rockwell are very convincing as sister and brother. Their on screen interlude appears very natural and this only makes Betty Anne's determination to prove her brother's innocence all the more believable. Needless to say both actors are at their best and they are supported wonderfully by Melissa Leo who plays a bent copper Juliette Lewis she seems to have mastered playing trailertrash characters Clea Duvall the lying wife Minnie Driver the charming friend and Peter Gallagher.One can easily relate to Swank's Betty Anne struggling with the bureaucratic legal system and her drive to free her brother. Unless one has money or the right contacts one can recognize the situations where Betty Anne is passed over from one administration to another.'Conviction' is a compelling watch. It involves the viewer right from the very beginning and even though you can predict the ending it's Betty Anne and Kenny's faith in each other that keeps you hooked.".

The true story is unquestionably compelling Betty Anne Waters Hilary Swank goes to law school to become her brother Kenny's Sam Rockwell lawyer for the purpose of proving him innocent of a murder for which he is spending his life.The translation to the screen is formulaic and documentarylike in its series of predictable scenes leading to Kenny's release. Granted life is not as exciting as drama but the artists on this film especially writer Pamela Gray and director Tony Goldwyn craft a serviceable plot with little inspirational dialogue or action that could reveal depths of sister and brother and even close friend Abra Rice Minnie Driver who attends law school with Betty Anne and helps with the defense.Because we all know the result before seeing the film the burden is on keeping the momentum going with interesting characters and events. Unfortunately Swank's perpetual crying and her authentic regional accent and Rockwell's goofy antics are not enough to give heft to an interesting premise. Juliette Lewis as Roseanna Perry a key witness is so much the trailer trash Lewis has always done well that the film's biographical integrity could be questioned.The last third of the film saves it from the abyss because unforeseen complications keep Kenny from leaving prison and the ensuing investigation is more dynamic than the circumstances of his conviction. As for that Betty Anne's conviction on behalf of her brother is daunting a testimony to love that surpasses any romantic notions our fairy tales can conjure.Compromising the authenticity once again are the ending titles which tell about Betty Anne's subsequent life as a waitress and public advocate but do not mention that Kenny 6 months later in 2001 fell and died in a freak accident. Not to mine those ironic implications is dramatically unforgivable unless the filmmakers don't want Betty Anne's beatification to be compromised by something as messy as fate.In the end Conviction is the real deal of sibling fidelity and an embarrassment to any of us who might not step up if one of our siblings were so convincingly convicted.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are major problems with this film both regarding accuracy and dramatic tension among which are 1for the film to work we must believe that the accused is not guilty and 2 we must understand why his sister felt a need to become a lawyer to save him. The film does not develop either point successfully and thus fails totally. first of all the accused is presented as a loser and a violent one at that with little in the way of redeeming features with an inferred motive and no showing of alibi. There is no coherent reason given on why his two wivesgirlfriends would both accuse him. Even more important why did his sister believe him to be not guilty other than because he was her brother. As it turns out from the facts of the case there was more evidence not presented in the movie that would have convicted the guy not the least of which he had in his possession a piece of jewelry belonging to the murdered woman and had vowed to kill her. He was also shown to be even more violent than presented having recently committed and been convicted of other violent crime. The brutality of the murder strongly suggests someone with a motive and no showing of anyone else with such motive other than the accused. The film shows recantations by his partners but the record does not support that this occurred. Even if it did such recantations are problematic from people close to the accused years after the fact. As to his sister's commitment to becoming a lawyer this status did not really affect the case. Anyone could have pushed for the DNA evidence and located it and I question if the dramatic presentation really occurred. Even if it did it might have been cheaper to hire a lawyer than to spend 3 years at law school. Finally the DNA did not i repeat did not mean he was innocent. It merely meant that the DNA found was not his according to the test. Even if we assume the test was correct it might have been that of an accomplice. The DA was willing to retry but politics got in the way. I doubt that the vicious portrayal of the attorney general was accurate either. Finally since this guy killed himself six months after he was released which the movie also conveniently fails to mention this is suggestive that maybe he knew who the killer was and he decided to do away with him. Also any portrayal of Barry Scheck as a hero is disquieting since I remember quite well his disgusting performance defending OJ Simpson and trying to convince the dimwits on the jury that the blood evidence and DNA was contaminated or that the police framed OJ. Oh sure!".

Even if it did it might have been cheaper to hire a lawyer than to spend 3 years at law school. Finally the DNA did not i repeat did not mean he was innocent. It merely meant that the DNA found was not his according to the test. Even if we assume the test was correct it might have been that of an accomplice. The DA was willing to retry but politics got in the way. I doubt that the vicious portrayal of the attorney general was accurate either. Finally since this guy killed himself six months after he was released which the movie also conveniently fails to mention this is suggestive that maybe he knew who the killer was and he decided to do away with him. Also any portrayal of Barry Scheck as a hero is disquieting since I remember quite well his disgusting performance defending OJ Simpson and trying to convince the dimwits on the jury that the blood evidence and DNA was contaminated or that the police framed OJ. Oh sure!";

The crime occurred in 1980 when there was no DNA testing and Kenny had the same blood type as the perpetrator. Several witnesses including Kenny's wife and exgirlfriend testify against him.Betty Anne a mother with two children makes the decision to go to law school in order to free her brother. At that time she doesn't even have her GED. She comes up against wall after wall gets divorced and her children probably more to help her than anything else finally go to live with their father. She moonlights running a bar.Betty Anne contacts Barry Scheck Gallagher of the Innocence Project to enlist his group's help. Scheck needs evidence  by then it's been about 15 years since Kenny's conviction.This is a powerful story because it shows again what the determination of one person can achieve and how his or her passion can inspire others to help.Hillary Swank is a gifted actress and it's a shame that she hasn't gotten more roles like she had in Boys Don't Cry and Million Dollar Baby. She's natural but intense as Betty Anne and she can really pull at the heartstrings. Sam Rockwell as Kenny does a wonderful job and the two have great chemistry together. You could feel his hopelessness and his fear of being let down.Everyone is good in this film with Juliette Lewis as an exgirlfriend and Melissa Leo as policewoman Nancy Taylor standouts.The problem I have with this film is that strip the movie of Hillary Swank and you've got a Lifetime movie. It just doesn't come off like a feature film in the way the story is told or in its focus. It's just a little bit left of cloying. Also note to writers  Kenny wasn't in jail he was in prison. There's a difference.Despite this it's a wonderful story all the more dramatic because it's true. And you can't get enough of its message One person can make a difference.".

There are witnesses who say that he told him he did it and there is blood typing evidence this is before DNA analysis which strongly suggests it was him. The only thing going for him is his sister who is sure that he didn't do it. You have seen this relatively simple plot play out many times on television on Dateline 2020 or on similar programs. The only difference here is that you have another magnificent performance by Hillary Swank playing Betty Anne Waters who is going to take the next 18 years of her life completing High School going to college and then law school in order to see if there is way to get her brother his freedom. You also have Sam Rockwell playing the brother Kenny in a performance that should earn him an Academy Award nomination. The screen play by Pamela Gray and the direction by Tony Goldwyn gives us pieces of their childhood which clarifies their great devotion to each other. The struggle of Betty Ann to become a lawyer and her determination to find the evidence that would be the key to saving her brother allows us to understand this person. Her interaction with Kenny similarly provides insight into his pain and bravado. The difficult lives of the people in the community where this happened and the very questionable actions of the police and district attorney Martha Coakley who subsequently was defeated in the recent US Senate race in Massachusetts to replace Kennedy was brought out by a stunning performance of Juliette Lewis who played one of the witnesses who recounts what really happened to make her testify against Kenny. We had the good fortune to meet at our preview screening Swank Rockwell Lewis the real life Betty Anne Waters and her good friend and fellow law student Abra Rice who was well played in the movie by Minnie Driver. They confirmed that truth is stranger and at times more unbelievable than fiction. I recall reading about the well known lawyer Barry Scheck who was depicted in this movie and wondering about his decision to devote his career to the Innocence Project where the new science of DNA matching is applied to old crimes. It turns out that over 250 innocent people have been freed from prison due to his efforts. There is one particular line in this film stands out in this regard as Swank as Betty Ann remarks that if Massachusetts had the death penalty her brother would have been killed before she had chance to make a case for his innocence. Swank speaking for herself at our screening told how making this movie allowed her to understand the unique life affirming experience that these people went through. Watching this film also gave the audience the opportunity to share this journey. Filmrap.net".

Then Kenny  played by Rockwell  graduates into big crime allegedly murdering and robbing a neighbor. It is never clear whether he committed the crime even if it seemed quite likely.Despite evidence against him his sister Betty played by Swank embarks in a crazy crusade to prove his innocence. Based on nothing else than her belief in his innocent. She studies to become a lawyer while at the same time destroying her own marriage and personal life. Very stubbornly and rather selfishly Betty pursues her only goal tramping over the lives of her husband and children.Finally Kenny is acquitted mainly because DNA tests of the evidence cast doubt on his conviction. But it is a far cry from stating he was innocent. His acquittal belongs to the dubious realm of guilt or innocence which cannot be proved or disproved.Anyway guilty or innocent he is portrayed as an utterly unpleasant character and not much more pleasant is his sister Betty. Stubborn unreasonable narrowminded selfrighteous she is made of weird stuff for a heroines. In the end it is very hard to feel much sympathy either for her or her brother despite the fact she made it through college for such a narrow goal.".

	schema:reviewBody "CONVICTION 2  stars out of 4. Starring Hilary Swank Sam Rockwell  Minnie Driver and Melissa Leo. Directed by Tony Goldwyn. Rated R  strong language violent images  In Conviction performances overcome the weaknesses and flaws in a  story that is more gripping in real life than it is on the screen.  The movie centers on the strong bond between Betty Anne Waters Hilary  Swank and her brother Kenny Sam Rockwell and the extraordinary  efforts she undertakes to exonerate him from a gross miscarriage of  justice.  The movie scores in showing Waters' tenacity and determination to prove  her brother who is serving a life sentence innocent of the murder for  which he was convicted.  To do so this high school dropout decides to return to school gets  her GED then goes on to college and law school.  This should be the most compelling part of the movie because Waters  paid a hefty price to achieve her goal costing her not only her  marriage but also her children.  Yet director Tony Goldwyn rushes through this part of the movie.  Instead he concentrates on the efforts of Betty Anne her friend and  fellow lawyer Abra Rice Minnie Driver and the head of The Innocence  Project to overturn Kenny's conviction.  And while this makes for interesting viewing it also is rather  formulaic as we have seen this scenario many times before.  The heart of the movie though is the unwavering devotion between  Betty Anne and Kenny who were raised in the most harrowing of  circumstances and yet survived by clinging to each other and watching  each other's backs.  Their fierce relationship and unconditional love are what keeps you  riveted to the screen.  At times Conviction is superficial especially when dealing with  Betty Anne's personal life and manipulative  Goldwyn does everything  but paint a black mustache on the wonderful Melissa Leo as the  smalltown police officer whose investigation helped convict Kenny   but the sincerity of the cast is what draws you in.  Swank is bulldogtenacious albeit a bit too selfsacrificing as Betty  Anne. Driver brings a sense of humor and street smarts to her role as  Rice while Juliette Lewis steals her one big scene as a trashy  exgirlfriend of Kenny whose perjured testimony helped convict him.  But the movie belongs to Rockwell as the swaggering irresponsible  Kenny. He is someone aimlessly drifting through life. He is tough and  cocky but underneath his rough exterior beats a good heart.  Rockwell's ability to display the many facets of Kenny should earn him  a best supporting actor Oscar nomination.  Conviction is flawed yet still will draw an audience into its story.  But because it shrugs off many intriguing aspects about Betty Anne's  struggles it fails to reach its potential as great cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hilary Swank Sam Rockwell Minnie Driver Melissa Leo and Juliette Lewis. That is the list of experienced actors and actresses heading up the true story of Conviction. The 20year story line exposes a corrupt legal system. With an outstanding cast and a poignant subject matter it is destined to deliver an emotional power house of a story. Right? It just has to. So why do I feel like I have seen yet another innocentmaniswronglyaccused movie? I am confused on why the director Tony Goldwyn chose the opening shots that he did. The first scenes do stick in my memory. A lone camera walks through a seemingly empty trailer home in Ayer Massachusetts in 1980 quietly showing us a gruesome murder scene.Then we are shuffled ahead in time to see Kenny Waters played by Rockwell meeting with his sister Betty Anne played by Swank in prison. Then we are sent back in time to when Betty Anne is in her first year of law school. Maybe audiences who like to be confused will enjoy the opening. It didn't set any tone for the movie since it takes a straight shot to tell the rest of the story with a few wisely placed flashbacks. We are taken back roughly to the 1960s showing the bond being developed between Kenny and Betty Anne as children. They come from a broken home and we learn that they only have each other in this twisted world. Goldwyn tosses us into a bar where we see Kenny's violent friendly and class clown traits all within five minutes. As an actor Rockwell is a likable guy. He has a playful confidence about him that seems to win audiences over for the most part i.e. his role as Chuck Barris in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. The man that Rockwell portrays here also seems to be liked  not only by his sister but also by the police department in Ayer. Well all except Nancy Taylor played by Leo an officer on the Ayer Police Department. We don't know why Nancy has it in for him. It would have helped if Nancy had a background telling us why she wanted to arrest Kenny so bad. After a couple of years Kenny is arrested and tried for the murder in 1980. He is hauled off to prison because of the testimonies of his girlfriends one of whom was supposedly assaulted by Kenny and Taylor. After Kenny's suicide attempt in prison Betty Anne dedicates the next 20 years of her life to obtain her GED go to college to earn a law degree and to work on this one case to prove her brother's innocence. Aside from the story line the cast was a joy to watch. Where has Juliette Lewis been? It was good to see her for a brief time on screen. She does give a brilliant and humorous performance. Swank and Rockwell could possibly each earn an Oscar nod. Personally I think Swank should earn an Oscar nod simply for rising out of bed in the morning. I am still torn on why I don't have anything more than a middle ground feeling for Kenny or Betty Anne considering the actual court case or the performances. Maybe it's because I didn't connect with Kenny's plight. Innocent or not it seemed as if he was headed for trouble. Not murder trouble but trouble nonetheless. Maybe it's because there was a woman who was murdered in 1980 and I don't know anything about the actual victim. I am sure her life was just as important as Kenny's life. Should you see this movie? Your Honor I would like to cite precedent of The Hurricane or even ahem An Innocent Man. We have seen most of this film before in one way or another. Your Honor if you haven't seen those legalese movies or a similar aninnocentmanisjailedandthelegalsystemiscorrupt movie then please make a motion to see Conviction.".

	schema:reviewBody "Seeing this film you stop to wonder how many innocent cases there are where the sibling does not become a lawyer to put things right.The American legal system so this film tells us is so complicated that you need to be a lawyer to operate it. In that it does not differ much from other legal systems operating today however so it seems the American system is more dependent on money or personal sacrifice in order to get to some sort of justice.This is a depressing tale in spite of its good outcome where some justice is indeed done. However in the closing text I did see no mention of a multimillion settlement against the state and only a mention that the police officer who was most responsible for the injustice fabricating evidence etc did not get convicted on account of some technicality of law.What makes this film excellent though is that it hints on a fact to often neglected the fact that the victim reproaches itself for the wrongdoings committed against it. This is done in order to survive injustice which can otherwise not be survived. The victim must see itself as guilty somehow otherwise its life becomes unbearable.If therefore somebody appears to be guilty like when you get a gut feeling there is something wrong or the like  then be very careful! That gut feeling can be totally wrong and just stemming from the victim's survival instinct of victimizing itself to make its world livable.That is also the chief reason why we have to fight for justice. People go around thinking that it is quite OK that there exists poor people and rich people and not as it should be where everybody has the same.Every child born to this earth knows that total material equality is the only thing that can be accepted but as it grows up and is faced with seeing some people having a thousand times more than other people it tells itself that this is OK because if it was not it could not survive. It's definitely time that we flushed that garbage down the toilet!!!".

	schema:headline " Shallow Slasher Sequel Lacks Any Surprises";
	schema:reviewBody "The sequel to John Carpenter's Halloween doesn't surpass the original. Freshman director Rick Rosenthal creates only a handful of suspenseful moments but Halloween 2 suffers from a weak script that was unfortunately penned by Carpenter and coproducer Hill. Michael Myers gets up and walks away after Dr. Loomis bangs off six shots into him. We never learn what makes Michael such an unstoppable demon. In Halloween Michael embodied a supernatural evil but in Halloween 2 doesn't develop his character. No matter how many times people pump bullets into the guy he just doesn't stay down for the count. The problem is Rosenthal's comatose direction. This chiller generates a body count but it doesn't generate horror. Instead it becomes monotonous with Michael trudging into and out of scenes like a wraith. The action picks up where it left off in Halloween. Michael plunges into the yard hard enough to leave an impression of his body after Loomis opens fire on him. When Loomis goes to confirm his kill he realizes to his horror that Michael has gotten up and vanished. Meanwhile the paramedics haul Laurie off to the hospital. Futilely she pleads with them not to give her anything that will put her to sleep. Of course the doctor ignores her request and administers an injection designed to knock her out. Although Laurie is deadly afraid of Michael and what he is capable of doing to her Halloween 2 doesn't develop a strong sense of fear. The best scene finds a hospital guard investigating noises. When he opens a cabinet an avalanche of items topples onto him. When he turns around Michael is there waiting for him. Earlier the guard had spotted blood in a trash dumpster and a shrieking black cat flew out at him. Everything else unfolds in a matter of fact fashion. Of course Halloween 2 is just a mindless horror movie but the idiocy gets out of hand. The movie lacks a sense of humor much less a sense of irony. Michael himself doesn't speak but he seems to know exactly what to do in every given situation and where to go. You cannot fool this bogyman. Sometimes like in the hydrotherapy you have to wonder if Carpenter and Hill aren't going a bit off the deep end. I mean Michael holds the poor nurse's head under the scalding water but the scorching water exerts no visible effect on him. When he casts the nurse aside her face looks hideous. If this is supposed to show that Michael is invulnerable himself then you have to wonder why Carpenter and Hill behave so inconsistently. Later in the final confrontation in the hospital Loomis blasts Michael multiple times again but the guy gets back up. Finally when Lauriewho shouldn't even be able to climb out of bedblows Michael's eyeballs out the guy begins to behave like he is mortal. Clearly Loomis should have shot Michael's feet to ribbons so that he couldn't walk. Imagine how much blood that this guy has lost after being shottwelve timesbut he displays virtually no signs of slowing down.Michael Myers is the equivalent of a Steven Seagal hero. He is indestructible until Loomis sacrifices his own life in the hospital and incinerates him. The end credits show us Michael burning to a crisp. The other thing that bothered me about this mute murderer who escaped from the asylum is his innovative ways of killing people. He stabs a surgeon in the eyeball with a pair of scissors. He buries a claw hammer into the guard's head. He drains the blood from a nurse. He guts another nurse on a scalpel and then hoists her so high in the air that her shoes fall out. Michael acts like he is a scenarist's puppet killing people in imaginative ways rather than with his brute strength and knife. Another problem with Halloween 2 is the way that Rosenthal force feeds us exposition. The entire scene in the back of the sheriff's cruiser when the nurse informs Loomis that Laurie Strode Jamie Lee Curtis is really Michael's baby sister and all the stuff about the sealed records struck me as too contrived and obvious. Mind you I know that this is supposed to be a different kind of horror movie with an impervious killer but there is just no excitement. It looks slick when the nurse's boyfriend is killed behind the marbled glass in the hydrotherapy and it is neat when the nurse believes that Michael is her boyfriend but afterward things go flat with Michael drowning her. The idea that Michael can stroll around unnoticed and people can bump into him without recognizing him seems contradictory. We are never told why Michael decides to kill who he does and then ignores everybody else. Halloween 2 does something different in that there are no teenagers getting naked and then dying at Michael's hands. The idea that a hospital would be as deserted as the hospital in the movie seems farfetched. Neither Carpenter  Hill nor Rosenthal make any of the victims look sympathetic. Michael seems far too clever to be doing what he gets away with. Halloween 2 is predictable because we know Michael cannot be killed in an ordinary way but it is also predictable because we know that his victims will die horribly but pose little threat to him. Altogether Halloween 2 has all the dramatic impact of a flatline on a heart monitor. The dialogue is strictly expository with nothing in the way of memorable or quotable lines. Indeed Michael here is such an inexorable source of evil that he is neither interesting nor intimidating. He emerges as a onedimensional character that you don't care about any more than you sympathizes his cardboard victims. Halloween 2 qualifies as an exercise in nihilism.".

	onyx:emotionText "The sequel to John Carpenter's Halloween doesn't surpass the original. Freshman director Rick Rosenthal creates only a handful of suspenseful moments but Halloween 2 suffers from a weak script that was unfortunately penned by Carpenter and coproducer Hill. Michael Myers gets up and walks away after Dr. Loomis bangs off six shots into him. We never learn what makes Michael such an unstoppable demon. In Halloween Michael embodied a supernatural evil but in Halloween 2 doesn't develop his character. No matter how many times people pump bullets into the guy he just doesn't stay down for the count. The problem is Rosenthal's comatose direction. This chiller generates a body count but it doesn't generate horror. Instead it becomes monotonous with Michael trudging into and out of scenes like a wraith. The action picks up where it left off in Halloween. Michael plunges into the yard hard enough to leave an impression of his body after Loomis opens fire on him. When Loomis goes to confirm his kill he realizes to his horror that Michael has gotten up and vanished. Meanwhile the paramedics haul Laurie off to the hospital. Futilely she pleads with them not to give her anything that will put her to sleep. Of course the doctor ignores her request and administers an injection designed to knock her out. Although Laurie is deadly afraid of Michael and what he is capable of doing to her Halloween 2 doesn't develop a strong sense of fear. The best scene finds a hospital guard investigating noises. When he opens a cabinet an avalanche of items topples onto him. When he turns around Michael is there waiting for him. Earlier the guard had spotted blood in a trash dumpster and a shrieking black cat flew out at him. Everything else unfolds in a matter of fact fashion. Of course Halloween 2 is just a mindless horror movie but the idiocy gets out of hand. The movie lacks a sense of humor much less a sense of irony. Michael himself doesn't speak but he seems to know exactly what to do in every given situation and where to go. You cannot fool this bogyman. Sometimes like in the hydrotherapy you have to wonder if Carpenter and Hill aren't going a bit off the deep end. I mean Michael holds the poor nurse's head under the scalding water but the scorching water exerts no visible effect on him. When he casts the nurse aside her face looks hideous. If this is supposed to show that Michael is invulnerable himself then you have to wonder why Carpenter and Hill behave so inconsistently. Later in the final confrontation in the hospital Loomis blasts Michael multiple times again but the guy gets back up. Finally when Lauriewho shouldn't even be able to climb out of bedblows Michael's eyeballs out the guy begins to behave like he is mortal. Clearly Loomis should have shot Michael's feet to ribbons so that he couldn't walk. Imagine how much blood that this guy has lost after being shottwelve timesbut he displays virtually no signs of slowing down.Michael Myers is the equivalent of a Steven Seagal hero. He is indestructible until Loomis sacrifices his own life in the hospital and incinerates him. The end credits show us Michael burning to a crisp. The other thing that bothered me about this mute murderer who escaped from the asylum is his innovative ways of killing people. He stabs a surgeon in the eyeball with a pair of scissors. He buries a claw hammer into the guard's head. He drains the blood from a nurse. He guts another nurse on a scalpel and then hoists her so high in the air that her shoes fall out. Michael acts like he is a scenarist's puppet killing people in imaginative ways rather than with his brute strength and knife. Another problem with Halloween 2 is the way that Rosenthal force feeds us exposition. The entire scene in the back of the sheriff's cruiser when the nurse informs Loomis that Laurie Strode Jamie Lee Curtis is really Michael's baby sister and all the stuff about the sealed records struck me as too contrived and obvious.

I have to say right away here that I was scared in this movie.  There are some truly ingenious and horrific shots in this film.  There are times when you really aren't expecting what's about to transpire and when it does it sends chills through you.I first saw this film in my  horror  days in the mid 80's.  I was 12 years old then.  So I just recently watched it again to see if it would have the same affect on me now.  I sat in my basement and turned off all the lights and you know what I was spooked.  Right from the opening number of Carpenter's ominous music and the pumpkin slowly transforming into Michael's angry face I knew right there that I was in for a night of fear.  And I was.The story starts the same night as Halloween ended on.  Laurie is being taken to the hospital and there is a massive manhunt to find Myers. Laurie eventually gets settled into the hospital and it becomes only a matter of time until Michael can find out where she is.  He finally comes to get her and then all hell breaks loose.One of the major players in this film is the locale.  The hospital is dark and quiet and rather empty.  And that adds to the atmosphere of the film. It gives us lots of long hallways so we can have a few shots of Michael hunting his prey.  What we also get is an array of rooms to 86 his victims in and a slew of weapons to do it with.Rick Rosenthal directed this film and I am amazed that he really didn't go on to do much because he almost copies Carpenter's style to the tee here. Brilliant in particular are two shots.  One is where Michael appears out of the darkness in one room to attack his victim.  The lighting is solely responsible for the affectiveness of this shot and it works so well that it still gives me the shivers when I watch it.  The second is when Micael attacks one of the nurses while Laurie watched helplessly from a distance.Not only is this a good horror movie it is a good film and if the first rates a 1010 this is certainly of a 9.  It is that good.  And if you don't agree with me watch it againby yourself and then answer that question.".

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Myers he's a household name in my opinion he's the ultimate boogeyman no matter what you do or how many times you try to kill him he just comes back. Hence the Halloween series. We do have quite a bit of horror movie sequels the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise Friday the 13th Hellraiser Scream and so on. Most sequels are extremely cheesy and don't deliver the same scares as the original movie does but the Halloween franchise is a different story I think these sequels were always a ton of fun and delivered just as many scares. Nothing will ever compare to the original Halloween but it was cool to see the story continue on Michael Myers. In this story we follow Laurie Strode to the hospital and Michael doesn't just give up that easily he's on a mission.After the film replays the last scene of Halloween it moves on to Dr. Sam Loomis warning Sheriff Leigh Brackett that although he has shot Myers six times in the heart Myers still lives. Meanwhile Laurie Strode is taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital and Myers wanders around Haddonfield in search of her. Laurie is informed that the man who attacked her was Michael Myers infamous for murdering his older sister fifteen years earlier on Halloween night. After this Laurie drifts in and out of consciousness having strange flashbacks about her adoption by the Strodes and visiting a boy in an institution. Myers learns that she is at the hospital. He goes there and murders the hospital's staff one by one. Laurie manages to elude him but she is limping badly and sedated and is thus unable to move very quickly. Dr. Loomis and the Haddonfield police continue to search the town for Myers. Nurse Marion Chambers Loomis' assistant arrives and tells Loomis that she has discovered a secret file on Myers to which he was not privy. The file reveals that Laurie is actually Myers's sister adopted by the Strodes after Myers killed his older sister Judith. Chambers also informs Loomis that he has strict orders to return to Smith's Grove. So they have to get back to the hospital to save Laurie before Michael can get to her.Halloween 2 is probably my second favorite sequel in the Halloween franchise next to H20. I can't tell you how creepy this movie was I know that these sequels are a bit much but for any horror movie fan they are a ton of fun to get into. The whole hospital setting was really scary I love Laurie Strode she's the strongest female in a horror movie she's in a weakened state but just keeps going. You have to love the return of Dr. Loomis him helping Laurie and making sure that Michael goes away for good well we clearly know that it's not going to happen but you have to give him credit for his optimism. If you are going to watch a Halloween sequel I do recommend Halloween 2 it's very creepy and a great addition to the story.710".

	schema:reviewBody "Following straight on from where the original finished is where Halloween 2 starts off Laurie Strode injured Micheal Myers I'll be calling him MM from now on escaped even though he was badly injured and Dr Loomis still in pursuit.In case you'd forgotten the ending of Halloween there is a brief reprise here from when Laurie sends the 2 kids to call the police onwards. MM should have been caught as he was watching Loomis talk to the cop there were a load of children walking down the alley and in the amount of time he was watching Loomis they would have reached where he was standing. I've debunked the film in the opening 10 minutes.The 2nd pretty HUGE goof is the guy they've got playing The Shape AKA MM he is nowhere near as big as the guy in the previous movie he's too short and way too slim built to be Myers. If he's going to be lifting anyone up and throwing them around like the original it won't be believable at all.The story of the murders and the killers escape makes the TV  Radio news FAR TOO QUICKLY! This type of story back then would have taken days to be released for fear of causing a local panic. The fake scare with the cat was very predictable outside the hospital. It is amazing that none of the mob outside the Myers house tried to burn the place down you'd think at least 1 person would try!.Now we only find out Laurie  Micheal are related in Laurie's dream sequence so that could have been a whole red herring. It's also obvious that both the nurse and orderly are going to die as they've had sex.Would anyone like to explain how Laurie went from unconscious and catatonic to escaping down a corridor in mere minutes? And MM would NOT be able to lift that nurse up on a tiny scalpel the way he does the blade or handle would snap!Loomis put 5 rounds into Myers in the foyer so he's now been shot 11 times I assume the empty 9mm he points at MM before he gets stabbed was a gun he took off the Marshal in the car. Laurie manages to fire 2 shots from a revolver that only had 1 round left in it hitting MM in both eyes a shot that even a marksman would struggle to make at close range in the dark and she was firing with a bad shoulder!.Our final look at Myers sees him face down on fire having somehow survived a gas explosion but he was already blind anyway and almost certainly dead and Laurie Strode being taken to an unknown destination.Weak ending and awful sequel especially the idea of Laurie being MM's sister.".

	onyx:emotionText "Following straight on from where the original finished is where Halloween 2 starts off Laurie Strode injured Micheal Myers I'll be calling him MM from now on escaped even though he was badly injured and Dr Loomis still in pursuit.In case you'd forgotten the ending of Halloween there is a brief reprise here from when Laurie sends the 2 kids to call the police onwards. MM should have been caught as he was watching Loomis talk to the cop there were a load of children walking down the alley and in the amount of time he was watching Loomis they would have reached where he was standing. I've debunked the film in the opening 10 minutes.The 2nd pretty HUGE goof is the guy they've got playing The Shape AKA MM he is nowhere near as big as the guy in the previous movie he's too short and way too slim built to be Myers.

If you remember the post I made many months ago I promised to review many older horror films and their contemporary versions. I always planned to include Halloween II as part of this series. This entry would have appeared anyway but the psychological aspect of posting on October 31 would have been worthwhile. Oh well I'll also review Halloween III Season of the Witch since a sequel to the new film will be released next year.In the surprisingly long three years between Halloween and its sequel the horror film market underwent a drastic change. The last remnants of literaturebased horror films gave way to crazy people with weapons films. People rediscovered Black Christmas and ate up Halloween. The expected sequel to the original film is a genre film in this tradition. Is it a worthy followup? No it isn't.The story takes place directly after the first film. Michael Myers survives six shots at pointblank range and has to find more young people to kill. His eternal and hitherto inexplicable nemesis Laurie Strode has been taken to Haddonfield Hospital to recover from her wounds. Michael goes there and kills nearly everyone until Dr. Loomis realizes where he is and kills him and himself in a fiery explosion.Everyone in Haddonfield who isn't Laurie Strode is a complete idiot. It takes them nearly the entire movie to determine where Myers could be. They even conduct a thorough investigation of Haddonfield sans hospital before they figure it out. The hospital staff is even worse. If you're someone involved in the medical field don't watch this film. It equally insults everyone in your community. Doctors have nothing better to do than flirt with horny nurses who ignore infants to bathe with their suitors. Teenagers at least have the excuse of youth when they act stupid but not medical staff.By the way since when have hospitals been so poorly lighted and serving so few patients? Rick Rosenthal attempts to recreate the sensation of Michael walking in Laurie's house from the first film without considering context. An empty house at night is much more frightening than an empty hospital at night. I'm aware that these films aren't intended to be fully realistic but Halloween II is so stylized that I couldn't avoid feeling like I was watching a cartoon. The production feels more like a parody of the original than an actual continuation of story. In the first film Michael Myers was a presence something that wouldn't go away like the monster under your bed. Laurie was the heroine. In Halloween II he is transformed into a protagonist who we have no reason to like. He's just there.The movie isn't scary either. Instead of suspenseful chases Michael Myers disposes of victims violently and shows us lots of blood. Rick Rosenthal claims that it was John Carpenter's idea to add gore. Wikipedia has a link to a quote Carpenter made claiming it wasn't scary enough. Shame on you John Carpenter for not believing in the technique you used in the first film. Indeed there are moments when Halloween II actually works like its predecessor. How nice it would be to see the film as Rosenthal intended. Maybe he will finally release his preferred version of the film sometime in 2010.Many people say critics didn't originally understand that slasher antagonists like Myers are actually the main characters. The whole first person perspective seems to support this idea. It's especially true in this entry. We see too much from Myers' view. Laurie therefore loses her hardiness and becomes a generic victim who should die but doesn't. How does she elude the Shape? Not like she does in the first film by actively refusing to die but by dumb luck. Only Dr. Loomis is able to maintain his composure as a complete character. These types of movies really are sexist but not just in how they portray women. For their intended male audience they subtly support male domination over women. The man could be a husband or a killer in a mask. If this is one of the better sequels to the classic I'm going to have many bad horror movie filled Friday nights.".

Basically the film picks up where it left off Dr. Sam Loomis Donald Pleasence shooting Michael Myers six times he falls out the window and managed to survive and disappear while Laurie Strode Jamie Lee Curtis is taken to hospital. If you remember the first film really well you would know that the suburban area was sleepy it must have been like 2 or 3 in the morning and now all of the sudden there are many people out and about and that's away from the hospital. Anyway Michael is obviously trying to find Laurie and in the process kills some more people oh and you find out Laurie is Michael's biological sister which gives you I suppose a good demented reason to kill her you know because he killed his other sister as a kid. Also starring Charles Cyphers as Sheriff Leigh Brackett Jeffrey Kramer as Graham Lance Guest as Jimmy Lloyd Pamela Susan Shoop as Karen Bailey Hunter Von Leer as Deputy Gary Hunt Dick Warlock as The Shape Michael Leo Rossi as Budd Ana Alicia as Janet Marshall Ford Rainey as Dr. Frederick Mixter and Wayne's World star Dana Carvey as WWAR Assistant. I can agree that perhaps besides H20 20 Years Later all the sequels are rubbish but what makes them even more ridiculous is that Pleasance clearly dies in this one blowing himself and Michael up with gas and a lighter Michael I can understand surviving seeing how many hits he took in the first film but Pleasance I can't understand surviving. As for the film itself the remade music is completely rubbish with the added keyboard the deaths are okay but you just can't really be shocked or surprised by them a rubbish horror sequel and many more follow.

	schema:reviewBody "The first Halloween is one of the best Horror films of all time and easily the best film centered around the holiday of Halloween. Halloween II taking place on the same night attempts to essentially recreate the magic of the original but without the focus or sharp execution.Picking up directly after Michael Myers falls out of the window and to his death the divisive sequel is in large part the same plot as the 1978 original. Myers is on the loose seemingly won't die and is on a killing rampage for no good reason. Interestingly enough there's even less method to his madness this time around which is typically where the film fails. There was something about watching Myers go around killing sexobsessed teenagers and specifically Laurie Strode's friends that made the first film so intense and more personal. But with Laurie spending most of the film in a hospital bed there's a lack of emotional connection.That's not to say Myers doesn't have his frightening moments. In fact the new ways Myers chooses to kill his victims was pretty creative and luckily just gruesome enough to send chills up and down your spine but not too gruesome where you feel like turning the movie off. We still have the first person camera movement and well edited cuts to legitimize the kills and keep a sense of reality to the situation. It's in these moments that I feel the film solidifies itself even if it doesn't nearly have the impact the first did.There is one particular third act twistreveal that I'm sure ticked off fans of the franchise at the time and I found it to be quite a reach as well. There's always a way to build mythology without overdoing the reasoning behind Myers' crimes and exploiting them. To me Halloween II is a worthy horror film but not nearly satisfying enough as a sequel to feature the main two characters from the original. Why not use Jamie Lee Curtis a little more?6.810".

	schema:reviewBody "Halloween II is a great example of why bigger doesn't always equal better. It has a bigger budget a bigger cast a wider set of locations a higher body count and a more complicated plot but it just isn't as good as the original. Even though the first movie wasn't without its cheese it still felt grounded in reality making the existence of a seemingly unstoppable killing machine like Michael feel more threatening. When your sequel features a scene in which a man who just so happens to be wearing the exact same getup as Myers boiler suit and all get briefly mistaken for him before immediately getting hit by a police car and dying in an explosion your movie ceases to feel believable. I can buy the fact that Michael shrugged off six bullets but this feels maybe a little too silly. The fact that the movie isn't patient enough and has the first presentday onscreen killing take place within the first ten minutes as opposed to forty or so minutes in means that there isn't enough time for suspense to be built up making Halloween II feel more like a runofthemill slasher movie where you're just waiting for another body to be added to the pile. It's predictable and it's not scary. That's not to say the movie is without its merits. Many of the shots are pretty spooky the lighting is dark the acting is still pretty good and the hospital setting is interesting. The music actually works in favor of the bigger scale too as tracks from the first movie are remade with synth instruments that lend themselves well to the bigger scenes. The final chase in the hospital is almost onpar with the one in the first movie even if its marred by the fact that the sidecharacters have godawful peripheral vision. Overall a very uneven and lesser sequel. Ignoring my gripes this is where I think the story of The Shape should've ended with the following movies being anthology stories instead of the same Michael Myers stuff every time. But no. Now we have a bunch of terrible sequels with Halloween 3 the only one that tried to be different being unfairly hated for doing something new. I SHOT HIM SIX TIMES! out of ten.".

In the process of everything we learn some things about the characters like a little something about Laurie that would play a part in the later movies. Of course in the process Michael himself goes around killing people. A particularly interesting scene is how he kills a woman in the hospital. Oh and by the way this is Dana Carvey's film debut interestingly he later costarred with Mike Myers whose name sounds like the killer here. A worthy sequel it is. Numbers 4 5 and 6 were pathetic and 8 apparently was 7 was really cool while 3 wasn't even really part of the series.".

In the process of everything we learn some things about the characters like a little something about Laurie that would play a part in the later movies. Of course in the process Michael himself goes around killing people. A particularly interesting scene is how he kills a woman in the hospital. Oh and by the way this is Dana Carvey's film debut interestingly he later costarred with Mike Myers whose name sounds like the killer here. A worthy sequel it is. Numbers 4 5 and 6 were pathetic and 8 apparently was 7 was really cool while 3 wasn't even really part of the series.";

While although the first one was by far the superior installment of this franchise the sequels are just plain stupid. I'll give you a few good reasons why in the review as I had to look up the definition of a spoiler before I could go onto write anymore reviews on here.One of the biggest turn offs in a film is inconsistency of logic or a lack of realism at least. Therefore most movies regardless of genre are turn offs as a rule for that reason. I mean it would be one thing if Myers was a resurrected psycho like Jason who couldn't stop but he's clearly not. He's human like you and I though apparently on PCP or something that makes him almost superhuman. I guess I could forgive the latter sequels more easily because that's exactly what he's supposed to be in those.Kudos I think that this is the only slasher I've seen that's based in a hospital. No other slasher that I've seen since has had such a propbase.Complaint Michael Myers gets shot right between the eyes and then gets back up and starts stalking again. I don't know if anyone else caught this but I did and I have found that to be the BIGGEST INSULT to my intelligence. Even a crackhead on PCP would think twice about stalking when shot between the eyes! In contrast to the first film I found this to be equal to getting stabbed in the jugular w a knife. OUCH! Then they blow themselves up kill Myers and leave in an ambulance. Wtf?  Laughs Whoever wrote that script ought to have been fired for stupidity! And unlike in the last film Michael Myers as someone else mentioned has been reduced to nothing more than a human shark swimming after his prey in the sea of terrorstruckHaddonfield. And this is well portrayed in even Michael Myers' mannerisms as he seems somewhat stiff in contrast to the original. I guess he hadn't gotten used to having about six slugs plugged into his major organs already. There are one pair of tits at least whom are ravaged in one of the meanest scenes that I've seen in a slasher. And there is a lot of blood though it's not excessive as some other slashers I've seen. And how Myers escapes getting his hands burnt off during this is a mystery to me? As for me the audience being that this was cable TV I was bored thru this while wondering what kind of crank that Carpenter and crew were on when they wrote this? But anyways I gave it a 3 because I could finish it and I even fell in love w some of the characters so the acting wasn't bad at all.".

As a result horror films began to pirate one another left and right while the franchises themselves seemed to be mostly bereft of ideas. There are some franchises such as Friday The 13th that recycle so much that one could be forgiven for forgetting which episode they are watching. Halloween II has more in common with Friday The 13th than it does the original Halloween.In spite of the massive continuity error early on in the film it picks up more or less exactly where the original left off. Michael Myers has survived his encounter with slugs from Doctor Loomis' pistol and is wandering around the suburbs of Haddonfield killing people almost entirely at random. This in essence is the problem with the entire film. Whereas the first film took the time to properly set up a cast of victims and make the audience care about them Halloween II's entire cast can be summed up as anonymous boring girlguy.Another problem is that the entire film has Michael walking along at a sluggish almost retarded pace. I've seen people who have more Thorazine than blood in their veins move faster than Michael does here. As a result the critical audience is tempted to yell hey anonymous boring girl try jogging he'll never catch up with you. It's one thing to have a slowmoving monster who eventually catches his victim through sheer persistence or stupidity on the victim's part but when rooms have multiple exits or the monster casually strolls in one someone in the sauna credulity just doesn't apply.This marks the first time that the anonymous longlost relative plot device was used in the Halloween series. In the original we had no idea why Michael was tracking down Laurie. The plot synopsis on the video box simply tells us that he wants to relive his crime. Halloween II simply tells us without any establishing shots that Laurie is Michael's other sister who was adopted shortly before or after the original murder shown in the first film's prologue. Footage of Loomis examining official files or even a walkon cameo appearing for the sole reason of explaining this plot element would have been nice.Another idiotic moment comes when we discover the name Samhain written in blood upon a wall. For hours after that point we get minutes of dialogue about old pagan gods and the unconscious mind that is so stilted one cannot help but laugh at it. One has to wonder if Donald Pleasance was under contractual obligation to appear in this sequel because it is hard to imagine a respectable actor appearing in a film like this out of a desire to work with the new cast and crew or to revist the story.I gave Halloween II a one out of ten. I think I am being extremely fair given that the film is boring overlong and contains some of the worst padding yet to appear in a horror sequel.".

	schema:reviewBody "What is interesting about this movie from an originality point of view is that the movie starts from the ending point of the original. We now have continuous story flow which is indicative of the strength of the original concept. Audiences did not have to put up with some ill  conceived spruced up story which gave an excuse to bring Michael Myers back to the big screen. From an unoriginal perspective we do have the predictably higher body count. Fortunately it did not reach the levels attained by other sequels within the genre. The other predictable element of this horror sequel is that the death sequences are far more gruesome. Notwithstanding these obligatory elements the sequel is relatively strong and although not as good as the original this sequel did much to build on the ominous reputation of Michael Myers.Looking at a sequel is surprisingly interesting. We have the original to compare to and we can access how the characters have developed. In this one character development was not an issue since we are dealing with a story that follows events directly after the original. This in itself is interesting as we do not see this very often.There are elements that contribute well but also those that contribute poorly. The ones that contribute well is the soundtrack the Shape and Donald Pleasance. Elements that did not work well here is unbelievable character decisions and poor special effects.The music is for me the outstanding element here. The opening theme track seems to be updated with more bass giving a far more in your face effect'. This is exactly what Michael is. He is no longer an unknown force. Haddonfield knows he is there somewhere in the shadows  lurking waiting to strike. Therefore the theme does not emphasise the suspense indicative of the original  rather the gruesome intent of the villain. This seems to be more in line with the Halloween festival around the world where the costumes are loud. The movie had become more indicative of it's title.It has been mentioned by other users here that the Sandman' track is out of place. Although this may seem so on the face of it I feel that it offers a contrast to the Halloween theme track as a feel good' track is played and then we are led into the ominous theme track  muck like what would be done at Halloween parties. This sequence of track probably not intentionally highlights the way that this story has become synonymous with the festival as previously touched upon. It not only takes the name of Halloween. It takes the character of Halloween. Myers is the evil that never dies  the bogeyman. John Carpenter has created a story that identifies strongly with makes no small contribution. October 31st and has stolen into the ceremony. His music is a prime example of this. The Shape is now played by Dave Warlock. The suspense lacking from the script itself becomes evident in his body language. His movements accentuated his evil presence and dehumanised him. It also shows us that he is not a normal human being  rather a cold soulless entity that exists only to kill his sister.  This was also evident in the first but was more noticeable in this movie since we saw more of Myers. The Shape was given more screen time but his basic character remained true to the original. A necessary keep  over since the sequel deals with the same night the attack started.Donald Pleasance is as much affiliated with Halloween' as Jamie Lee Curtis is. His major contribution is creating a sense of plausibility for the audience. He recites his lines with such authenticity that the audience will be drawn into the story. We think of the mad scientists' of an era gone by only this is not his creation but a shell born onto the world to carry out evil deeds. He is what Alec Guinness was to Star Wars' and what Vincent Price was to horror movies. Pleasance adds to the aura of Myers and was a vital part of the Halloween' franchise. Even with Jamie Lee Curtis on board in the most recent Halloween' movies the impact of the first two Halloween' movies was never rekindled which is due in part to the loss of Pleasance. He was a great opponent for Myers.The believability added by the abovementioned members of the cast was undermined by unbelievable character decision making. Curtis is always hiding not far away from Myers. Not rational for somebody who was previously attacked and knows what she is up against. There would have been more plausible solutions to making Curtis more of a helpless victim. She could have injured herself while she was trying to escape and the perfect opportunity for this was in the hospital when she narrowly escaped Myers. What she did did not assist the story but weakened it. It is these areas within which audiences drawn in may be lost.The effects were weak in places. The blood drained on the floor was way too red. It served to weaken the movie since this is another element which may jolt audiences from their imagination. Special effects serve to add believability to the story and when attention is drawn to them in a negative sense the story can only be adversely affected. It was also too much blood for a Myers kill. He strikes a lethal blow rather than causing too much gore. It is unfortunate that this seemingly obligatory element became a part of this movie.I had seen this movie before the original and for some time favoured this one mostly due to the haunting soundtrack. But I grew to prefer the original because of its suspense. The music in my opinion is still better in this sequel since it adds ominous intent to Myers and more truly reflects his character. But this was not enough to improve it over the original and if the weaknesses mentioned above were ironed out we would have had a much stronger comparison.  What separates Halloween' from other slasher movies is that Myers has real purpose although there is no evident motive. He exists solely to kill his sister. Myers does not kill all that are within his territory but those that may stand in the way of his objective. This is the essence of the story and gives reason for his continued existence. This has now been stopped in the most recent Halloween' movie  Halloween Resurrection' and although it is said that this gives way to a new story it seems to lead it to older stories where the villain kills senselessly. It is true that it had to change in some way but if Myers is not stalking a relative his core purpose is lost. I am sure that there will be another sequel and I am hoping that they bring back Laurie. The original concept was very good and if the story is going to continue the foundation should be kept.".

	onyx:emotionText "What is interesting about this movie from an originality point of view is that the movie starts from the ending point of the original. We now have continuous story flow which is indicative of the strength of the original concept. Audiences did not have to put up with some ill  conceived spruced up story which gave an excuse to bring Michael Myers back to the big screen. From an unoriginal perspective we do have the predictably higher body count. Fortunately it did not reach the levels attained by other sequels within the genre. The other predictable element of this horror sequel is that the death sequences are far more gruesome. Notwithstanding these obligatory elements the sequel is relatively strong and although not as good as the original this sequel did much to build on the ominous reputation of Michael Myers.Looking at a sequel is surprisingly interesting. We have the original to compare to and we can access how the characters have developed. In this one character development was not an issue since we are dealing with a story that follows events directly after the original. This in itself is interesting as we do not see this very often.There are elements that contribute well but also those that contribute poorly. The ones that contribute well is the soundtrack the Shape and Donald Pleasance. Elements that did not work well here is unbelievable character decisions and poor special effects.The music is for me the outstanding element here.

It picks up right where the other one left off with Loomis chasing after Myers and Laurie being taken to the hospital. Michael finds her soon after and stalks her through the hospital. My favorite part was when Michael was walking through the parking lot and the trademark music is playing. The end was fabulous with Loomis blowing up the anesthetic room and severely wounding Michael. This film is definitely worth seeing and I recommend it to anyone who wants a good scare.".

	schema:reviewBody "A happygolucky odd job man JeanHugues Anglade as Zorg falls in to a relationship with a slightly unhinged  but very sexysexual  French teenager named Betty Batrice Dalle in her debut role. There are very few films that are totally different from anything you have seen before. While sexually explicit  it is far from objectionable because the two parties are in love and passionate about one another.Betty Blue372 le matin doesn't really fall in to any one category  going from farce to tragedy stopping off at oddball. The two leads are amazing in their chemistry  they really do look and act like they are in love. Also what an amazing debut by the Dalle although her later life has shown that she has plenty of the Betty Blue in her for real.Was this script written with her in mind?  my search for the truth goes on. Starting the film with a sex scene sets the film off on the totally the wrong foot. While the film is about sex  and at times sexual repression  there are times when it looks like it was set in a nudist camp. Even JeanHugues Anglade strolls around with it all on show  thankfully he looks like he has kept up his gym membership.The scene in which Betty throws the whole of the fixtures and fittings of the beach apartment out of the window was stolen by a famous car advert in the UK and it really is a stretch of the imagination in that Zorg doesn't respond to it. He just paints on and lets her get on with it  like he doesn't care.I think we all know how we would react in a similar situation and it wouldn't be like Zorg!This has great cinematography with every scene framed to perfection. The dour insides of the French household and the generally dirty oven and sink usually with two weeks worth of dishes in them. Very true if you know that part of the world!The repeating irregular piano theme tune is what cinema is about  when in the hands of people that know how to marry both mediums. Images and music fitting together to form a perfect marriage. Fantastic and moving.The famous Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gives this low marks  citing too much flesh being on display among other faults  and this is sad given that he gave Kill Bill Part One top marks. A woman making love to a man she is in passionately in love with is tasteless  a homicidal woman slicing the arms of a whole room of gangsters is OK?Roger  I respect you a great deal but you are as wrong as Leslie Halliwell author of the world's most famous film guide book when he gave Close Encounters no stars at all.You should come over here Europe a bit more. Walk about the beaches of France and Spain and look at the amount of flesh on display and the way people show affection for one another without glancing 'round to see who is looking. True it has one or two sex scenes too many  as I hinted before  but it is sex that means something and is about something.Betty Blue is one of my top 200 films of all time and while it has its limits and its faults it does sag a little in middle it remains a powerful piece of work about living with crazy people and how easily good times can slip in to bad. I think if the sex was toned down and there was a bit more of the comedyromance in the centre than this could easily be part of the IMDb top 200. Not that this really matters all that much.A product that only the French could make and one gets under your skin and stays there. This review is a reference to the original cinema cut.".

At that time original foreign films shown in subtitles aren't usually tops on the list of young movie watchers at the time. So I had the opportunity to watch the 3 hour movie recently again older wiser and much more interested and I'm glad I did. I remembered it. This is...a good film. Better impacted in the 80's before we all knew what we know now but it still does holds up.This is a film of a man who fell in love with the most unpredictable woman he'd ever met. Her unpredictability attracted him made him fall in love her and that unpredictability was daring and unique. Going back to that time in the 80's who knew that she was more than just an unpredictable free spirit she was on the brink of insanity and was losing her grip on what she thought she could control. He did too. And what you have here is a stunning film of love and acceptance of a strong life force entering a dull life and making that life realize that there WAS more to life than what he was living.There is no doubting how the palate of the colors of this film is also central in telling the story so as you watch do pay attention for I think its deliberate. And I did love watching Betty as she was not flawless but as natural and beautiful as one could be with the nudity involved in the film. That's why in my reviews I keep using the word real. There's some nudity but due to the pacing of the film it just didn't bother me as nudity for nudity's sake but just a part of the life these two lovers led.Some will feel that 3 hours is a long time to look at a film and it can be. But I've sat through 3 hour plus films such as Fanny  Alexander Heaven's Gate and Das Boot back in the heyday of the Z Channel  and because I found interest in them the time flew by. Same with this one. It will grab your attention until the end.".

The care Zorg gives her it is how relations are or should be. Including all the quarrels and arguments.I have no idea where this film works on my emotional state of being. But the first half I always laugh my head off and the second part always ends with me crying uncontrollable. This is sometimes my reason for watching this film clears my emotional systems.I have worked and spent many a holiday in France. This film to me shows the intensity of French people with life and relations. If you want to learn about the French and their ways watching this film is a very intense start.";

They're never in a hurry to please you they're vain and they want you dead once they've licked their bowl clean. It's all predictable behavior. You know what to expect. 99 of the time. But the unpredictable 1 will come as no shock to a cat person. For some crazy reason usually at night cats suddenly go nuts and dash around the house like they're chasing invisible flying rodents. They're totally out of control. They'll scratch you if you get in their way and they'll snarl at you like they're ready to rip your throat out. Then just as suddenly they'll regress to their former personalities and settle by the fire. Why they go nuts why that crazy cat gene suddenly flares up is unknown. Even they don't know one suspects. They don't even remember going nuts once it's over. They behave like nothing ever happened as they slink sheepishly back into the dining room and return to to their former mildmannered selves.Women have the crazy cat gene too and only a fella who's never lived with one would wonder what the hell I'm talking about. Women might deny it too but that's expected. JeanJacques Beineix's Betty Blue is about such a woman only her cat gene is starting to ruin her life and the lives of those around her. It''s horrible to watch the gorgeous lusciouslipped Beatrice Dalle come apart at the seams and plunge into madness but it's the stuff of a great movie and it's why the film is so engaging.As with all gorgeous women there's a guy out there who's sick and tired of her sht. That guy in Betty Blue is Zorg JeanHugues Anglade a magnificent actor who also had a pivotal role in Roger Avery's puerile Killing Zoe. Anglade loves Betty so much that he's willing to put up with her mood swings but ultimately he loses her just before she totally loses her own mind.The film is beautiful. The first fortyfive minutes where Zorg and Betty hook up and paint beach houses is very French very cinematic and very erotic. The photography is stunning and the emotions are real. Once Betty's madness begins to impact on the relationship we experience every tragic step in her decline.Director Beineix never made a better film than Betty Blue. Rosaline and the Lions had an energy to it but Moon in the Gutter caved in under the weight of its own melancholy and hyperstylization. The reason Betty Blue works is because it is about a fascinating character we care about. It doesn't help us to understand women any better but it reminds every guy who's confronted the cat that he is not alone.".

I remember being shocked and a little annoyed that I had to read the whole movie I almost walked out typical idiot!.. When it was over I could barely get up and leave. When I did I saw that it was going to play again in another 20 minutes so I went back and saw it again. I didn't want to read it that time I just wanted to soak up the colors and the music. I had ever seen anything like it before. I saw Betty Blue many years and many European movies later and thought it was disjointed seemingly jumping around I never got really got their 'love'  his love especially. You sort of wondered why he was so nuts for her. The ending didn't really make sense to me either. I just rented it from Netflix and didn't know it was the director's cut. 3 hours 5 minutes later I was sitting in a puddle of tears  I'm no pusy so incredibly fulfilled and satisfied was I. Yes it's a bit long and it could use a couple of little cuts here and there.. but it's something to savor. Like a novel  which is perfect of course as Zorg is a writer and you imagine that he could have easily written it  no doubt the whole point.This movie is spectacular and I can't think of a movie that moves likes this. The nudity is delicious and natural the lovemaking is breathless and makes you squirm a little from the intimacy of it. The photography is straightforward the sets and settings are very unforced parisian. The car is a bit precious perhaps.. scene with Bob and the liquid coming out of the truck is forced comedy.. but the rest is natural. There's a reason there is so much chemistry between these two.. they made a massive film together full of a complex love and it's wonderful to watch the way the director intended.. It would be better if they offered both versions for discussion. I would love to see a very talented editor get his hands on this film just for fun. It's a complete love story. It fills you up. Worth every minute.".

From the steamy beginning of their relationship to the bitter end we share in their heartache. This story has tragedy written all over it.Betty Blue fails to captivate though. In fact it only succeeds in repulsing due to the ugliness of the central character. Betty is such a crazy wench that you never know whom she might attack next. It is thus very hard to sympathise with her or any other of the rather uninspiring characters.Having said this Beatrice Dalle is superb as the severely disturbed Betty and Jean HughesAnglade lends strong support as writer boyfriend Zorg. Additional cast add extra weight to the acting credentials. Cinematography from JeanFrancois Robin is top notch as is the original music from Gabriel Yared which is just that fresh and different. Beineix presents the production well but is unable to win us over. Phillippe Djian's novel could be intriguing.Sunday February 22 1998  Video".

In fact it only succeeds in repulsing due to the ugliness of the central character. Betty is such a crazy wench that you never know whom she might attack next. It is thus very hard to sympathise with her or any other of the rather uninspiring characters.Having said this Beatrice Dalle is superb as the severely disturbed Betty and Jean HughesAnglade lends strong support as writer boyfriend Zorg. Additional cast add extra weight to the acting credentials. Cinematography from JeanFrancois Robin is top notch as is the original music from Gabriel Yared which is just that fresh and different. Beineix presents the production well but is unable to win us over. Phillippe Djian's novel could be intriguing.Sunday February 22 1998  Video";

Well...it's amusing at times erotic at others but overall the story it tells is so insubstantial that you wonder what exactly compelled Beineix to tell it. The shorter 120 minutes version also has some huge narrative gaps  but I won't be searching for the threehour version anytime soon the movie is already too long as it is. The actors however are perfectly cast Anglade is engaging as the constantly befuddled by Betty's personality hero and Dalle while not beautiful in a conventional sense has a luscious body and sure isn't timid about showing it off neither is Anglade for that matter.

So it's enthralling to discover small gems like this when in the West we were praising Scorsese for his grittiness.It helps to know a bit about this type the yakuza film. Fukasaku's The Yakuza Papers series offer all the introduction you're going to need. If you are acquainted this will come as a pleasant surprise. The plot is nowhere near as convoluted the barrage of constant namedropping that made the former occasionally hard to follow is absent. Instead we get the distilled energy with handheld cameras peering from the most improbable angles filming the numerous fights not from a distance but in the middle of the swirl. We get stills narration clever use of sepia fast forwards and so on years before Tarantino made it cool. Yet what sets Graveyard of Honour apart from other yakuza movies is the protagonist. He's not the typical rags to riches and back figure seen in gangster movies. He doesn't hit the good time before falling down he's not Tony Montana. No it's all downhill for him a selfdestructive yakuza without a care in the world who brings about his own misery and challenges his bad karma at every corner. His nihilistic stare reminded me of Ryonosuke Tsukue from Sword of Doom.Strongly recommended for crime drama fans.".

However more so than many of its counterparts it is an excellent Brechtian character study. Filmed in a mockumentary style Graveyard of Honor breaks up its action and storytelling relatively often with bits of narration setting the events of the film in their period context and transitioning over long gaps in time.A reviewer once equated this film to the blacksploitation films of the same period this betrayed the reviewer's ignorance to the genre. The Japanese gangster film is far more presentational than its western counterparts. From the bright red paintlike blood to the strict characterizations and operatic emotions Graveyard of Honor and other films like it are a sort of midway point between Kabuki theater and French nihilism. It is an intriguing genre and one that internationally acclaimed director Kinji Fukasaku uses brilliantly to pose intriguing questions and point out crucial problems in the Japanese mindset of the time.To truly appreciate his 1970s yakuza films it helps to have knowledge of the history leading up o that time from the end of World War II. Watching Graveyard of Honor on its own will certainly be an entertaining experience but anyone perplexed or intrigued by the film should do research on other films of the period their cultural context and their societal implications. Fukasaku was a groundbreaking director and it's a shame that his brilliance could be lost in the cultural gap.".

	schema:headline " Truly Uncompromising Yakuza Tale";
	schema:reviewBody "The late Kninji Fukasaku is arguably most widely known for the more recent Battle Royale 2000 but the films that have earned him the deserved status as a true master of uncompromising cinema are arguably his gritty Yakuza films from the 70s. Such as the famous Battles Without Honor And Humanity films or this disturbing gem called Jingi No Hakaba aka. Graveyard of Honor 1975. Produced by the great Toei company Graveyard of Honor must be one of the most uncompromising and depressing Gangster portraits ever brought to screen and it is also easily one of the most memorable Yakuza films I've seen. Unlike many other gangster films which somewhat glorify the Mafia this is a a brutal uncompromising utterly grim portrayal of organized crime and one criminal in particular. Set in Japan of the late 1940s Graveyard of Honor tells the story of reallife Yakuza Rikio Ishikawa I don't know how accurate it is though in a disturbing and highly memorable manner.Tokyo 1946 thug Rikio Ishikawa Tetsuya Watari outshines all of the fellow members of his Shinjuku Yakuza family  in madness brutality and irascibility. His spontaneous outbursts of violence are dreaded by both enemies and associates. When he increasingly begins to attack associates and even superiors he becomes an outcast... Unlike many Gangster characters Ishikawa isn't really likable in any way. He is portrayed as a violent madman who rapes brutalizes and murders apparently for no reason. However in a way one does feel sorry for him. Overall this tough and seemingly soulless beast of a man who is feared by even his criminal peers is also a pitiable creature unable to find any joy in life. Tetsuya Watari is brilliant in his role of the uncontrollably violent yet pitiable maniac criminal. The only truly likable character in the film is Ishikawa's girlfriend played by the beautiful Yumi Takigawa who sticks with Rikio the man who has raped her and made her a prostitute. Her story is the doubtlessly most heartbreaking part of the film. The supporting cast includes many familiar faces for fans of Japanese cinema including Eiji Go Tokyo Drifter The Executioner etc. and the beautiful ExploitationPrincess Reiko Ike Sex And Fury Female Yakuza Tale Criminal Woman Killing Melody... of whom I'm a big fan. The film is brilliantly shot in a very unique style and seems very realistic and authentic. The violence is brutal blood and uncompromising as the film itself. Overall Graveyard of Honor is a truly remarkable film that must not be missed. Takashi Miike made a remake in 2002 but although I am a moderate Miikefan I doubt that it's anywhere near as good as this one. This brutal disturbing sad and often depressing portrait of a violent madman must be one of the most uncompromising crime films ever made and no lover of Japanese cinema can afford to miss it.".

Fukasaku seems to suggest that US occupying forces were in some ways complicit in the corruption of post WWII Japan. As the US attempted to bolster Japanese self rule it allowed the Yakuza's fortunes to prosper in phony democratic elections. However in no way does this allow the viewer to empathize with the sadistically violent outbursts of Rikio Ishikawa.

	schema:reviewBody "Kinji Fukasaku's mid70s fauxbiopic of a sociopath Yakuza gangster in late40s Japan is certainly an absorbing experience even if it never quite manages to immerse the viewer entirely in the nihilism of the world in which Tetsuya Watari's Rikio Ishikawa exists. It's difficult really to determine whether Fukasaku is trying to attract or repulse us here and for me this is the film's main weakness. Ishikawa has no redeeming features he's simply a crude boorish rapist and murderer who invokes unexplainable loyalty in those around him. There is some amusement to be found in the bewilderment of Ishikawa's Yakuza superiors who don't seem to know quite what to do with the loose cannon in their midst presumably something in the Yakuza code prevents them from simply taking him into a back alley and shooting him like a dog but for all its kinetic energy and undeniable style Graveyard of Honour mostly fails to fascinate and fascinate it must  the way a caterpillar squirming on the end of a pin fascinates  if it is to hold an audience who can feel little or no connection with its main character.Despite these criticisms the film is never dull. Fukasaku is an unsurpassable director completely confident of his skills totally focused and unafraid to adopt subjects and styles that must have seemed out of the ordinary at the time. It's to his credit that most of the techniques he uses in this film are still widely used today  especially by US gangster flicks. Fukasaku fills the screen with people in this one countless people hundreds of them conveying the raucous and claustrophobic overcrowding of a country recovering from a bruising war. And while attention to period detail is perhaps not this film's strong point this shortcoming is overcome by good use of sepia tones to reinforce the sense of history.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a glorified downbeat  grim biopic of a Yakuza madman named IshikawaTetsuya Watari who plays him as a quiet calm before the tornadic releasewho has this mentally unstable nasty streak that comes out in a fiendish explosion when others stand in his way. He almost causes a clan war when he attacks a rival Yakuza lord from another city. This causes a downward spiral for him as his seemingly uncontrollable path of violence and death leads to a vicious attack on his own Kawada Yakuza Godfather and a banishment from all clans for ten years which is part of the code. After a brief stint in prison he's ordered to stay in Osaka for the remaining ten and would be allowed back once he served his time. After only a year Ishikawa returns to cause havoc once again. While in Osaka he developed a drug habit which would lead him down an even more violent path for he would find those in possession of what he needed and threaten their very lives if they wouldn't fork over product to stick in his arm. His only real ally is a tragic geisha ChiekoYumi Takigawa who is slowly dying..but even she suffered rape from Ishikawa showing that he has no real respect for anyone when it comes to getting his own degree of satisfaction by any means necessary. When he attacks the godfather of the Imai clan no real avenue of escape will ever be available again. He often seems unkillable as attempts on his life are frequent though he is often cunning through his hiding..and also not so cunning when he appears in public at gambling houses. When he kills the Imai Godfather his life expectancy shrinks considerably.The film is told in a documentary form with narration depicting a specific tumultuous time in the late forties when clans operated almost like little governments dictating business within the city of Shinjuku. Each has their turf and tries to remain loyal to each other hoping to escape any means of war. All Japanese loathe a specific group of foreigners nicknamed the thirds making up mostly Korean Taiwanese  Chinese who seem to try to live within the city but are treated as the plague of the country. We also see how the loss to America in the World War seems to have created a child without it's parents as this massive collective of people frequent the streets in droves. The Yakuza clans do seem to be the only means of parentship available to those without a home or identity. The film is ultimately a blitzkrieg of gang wars prostituting whores blackmarket elections gambling drugs and Ishikawa is immersed within the frenzied structure..he's certainly a doomed creature because how can such a crazed heathen as he ever survive? The film has wildly imaginative camerawork which seems to show an unbalanced world through the gaze of Ishikawa. It has visual verve and is certainly loaded with bloody carnage.".

This movie follows the story of Ishikawa the archetypical postwar gangster as it's defined in the film. The character development is great and very surprising. However you may loose the plot in some points if you don't have an overall knowledge of the Yakuza organization.In conclusion a very entertaining gangster movie the Japanese way.

The startling moments of savage violence pack a ferocious punch. However it's the stark and unwavering way this film presents the main character as a real nasty and irredeemable bastard whose raging temper and fierce nature make him a constant threat to everyone around him including and especially himself that gives the plot its an extra potent nihilistic edge Rikio is the sort of horrible person who just couldn't get out of his own way and thus was doomed to meet a harsh untimely end. Hanjiro Nakazawa's wild widescreen cinematography boasts loads of insane tilted camera angles and funky occasional use of sepia and freeze frames.

It follows the lives of the four March sisters from the turbulence of youth the turmoil and romance of adolescence the joy of love and the pain of loss. The quality of this movie depends entirely upon the chemistry between the actors and it accomplished this with success. The film is a vignette of scenes throughout the sisters' lives showing their relationships with one another and with the people around them.Winona Ryder is the quintessential Jo the tomboyish spirited sister who dreams of becoming an accomplished writer. She brings a refreshingly sweet human touch to the character who is as impulsive and headstrong as she is ambitious and loving. Ryder carried the film beautifully and much of its success is due to her.Trini Alvarado made a very pretty and convincing Meg the dependable older sister although she is not so set on marrying for money as she is in the book. Claire Danes as sweet selfless Beth really shone in one heartbreaking scene that is impossible not to cry through. For her performance as the spoiled youngest sister Amy the very young Kirsten Dunst showed remarkable potential and brought humor to the character.Christian Bale as Laurie was everything the boy next door should be handsome kind and charming. His chemistry with Winona Ryder was considerable and made their friendship very believable. Susan Sarandon played a wonderful Marmee supportive and loving towards her girls.Another thing I would recommend is the soundtrack to this movie composed by Thomas Newman which has some gorgeous music on it.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "I hear it's really hard to turn a book into a movie and even as a viewer I notice this. You can keep the book and lose a movie or you make a movie and lose a book.  But this balances and keeps the essence of the book and creates a miraculous movie that works on every single level.It's depth it's warmth it's beauty from aesthetics to costumes to storyline it all works. I saw this movie before I read the book and my mom a big fan of the book loved it so did my dad who had never read it.Unlike a lot of period classics that are turned into films this one has no rigidity or  boring spots and it doesn't feel like the dime a dozen period films out there that reuse the same costumes and replay the same stories. It flows and invites you into the world of these girls making the 1860s and the March family intensely real.Fabulous acting by an ensemble cast completes this film. Winona Ryder was inspired casting and in my opinion makes the best screen Jo ever. She's feisty strong tomboyish but has a warmth and grace about her that I feel Katharine Hepburn and June Allyson the most famous Jo's didn't have and suits the character wonderfully. the best thing about these characters is that they endear themselves to you something many movies lack. Great ensemble as well Susan Sarandon Christian Bale Claire Danes at 14 believe it or not Eric Stoltz Kirsten Dunst Trini Alvarado Susan Wickes Gabriel Byrne all of them are incredible and fit perfectly.And if you can get through Beth's death scene without crying you're pretty tough. It's a scene that doesn't pull sentimental melodrama but plays honestly and goes to that heartbreaking sadness of losing someone. And the geranium petals and dolls and Thomas Newman's brilliant score finish off the scene and I think makes it one of the greatest scenes in any film of the last 10 years and they didn't even include it in the 75th Oscars montage tsk tsk. The ending is incredibly lovely and as James Lipton of the Actors Studio says only needs those three words to coney everything that needs to be said.This is a beautiful film. It's inviting but not overly sweet and though nothing too exciting happens still very fulfilling and entertaining it can be very bittersweet but it is a joyful film and says a lot about people and our emotions and our lives and yet is not confrontational in the least. It pulled out themes and messages which are often looked over out of one of the world's most famous books and made a lasting work of art that touches your heart.".

I saw this movie before I read the book and my mom a big fan of the book loved it so did my dad who had never read it.Unlike a lot of period classics that are turned into films this one has no rigidity or  boring spots and it doesn't feel like the dime a dozen period films out there that reuse the same costumes and replay the same stories. It flows and invites you into the world of these girls making the 1860s and the March family intensely real.Fabulous acting by an ensemble cast completes this film. Winona Ryder was inspired casting and in my opinion makes the best screen Jo ever. She's feisty strong tomboyish but has a warmth and grace about her that I feel Katharine Hepburn and June Allyson the most famous Jo's didn't have and suits the character wonderfully. the best thing about these characters is that they endear themselves to you something many movies lack. Great ensemble as well Susan Sarandon Christian Bale Claire Danes at 14 believe it or not Eric Stoltz Kirsten Dunst Trini Alvarado Susan Wickes Gabriel Byrne all of them are incredible and fit perfectly.And if you can get through Beth's death scene without crying you're pretty tough. It's a scene that doesn't pull sentimental melodrama but plays honestly and goes to that heartbreaking sadness of losing someone. And the geranium petals and dolls and Thomas Newman's brilliant score finish off the scene and I think makes it one of the greatest scenes in any film of the last 10 years and they didn't even include it in the 75th Oscars montage tsk tsk. The ending is incredibly lovely and as James Lipton of the Actors Studio says only needs those three words to coney everything that needs to be said.This is a beautiful film. It's inviting but not overly sweet and though nothing too exciting happens still very fulfilling and entertaining it can be very bittersweet but it is a joyful film and says a lot about people and our emotions and our lives and yet is not confrontational in the least. It pulled out themes and messages which are often looked over out of one of the world's most famous books and made a lasting work of art that touches your heart.";

Christian Bale is an excellent Laurie and Gabriel Byrne is wonderful as our Professor Bhaer. Kirsten Dunst and Claire Danes showed acting ability beyond their years. Trini Alvarado was a very pretty and sweet Meg. Samantha Mathis was a very pretty older Amy but she could have been more lively. Eric Stoltz was a great John Brooke. I had never pictured Brooke with red hair but it was nice. The rest of the cast was terrific especially Mary Wickes as Aunt March. For once Mary wasn't playing somebody's nurse or maid. The music and cinematography were beautifully done. It was absolutely wonderful and I highly recommend it and the book of the same name. ".

Gilliam Armstrongs adaptation is the best Ive seenthe performances were incredible specially Winona Ryder and Christian Bale. But all of them where great it also has a wonderful score one of the most beautiful soundtracks Ive ever heard Thomas Newman did an excellent job the script made by Robin Swicordis very loyable to the book by Louisa May Alcott.This film is beautiful in all its aspects it was excellent the friendship and collaboration between all the actors and for the first time most of them were played by actors of the same age as their fictional characters. The character of Jo has influenced me a lot and I adore her Winona Ryder did the best performance of his career Christian Bale is the best Laurie Ive ever seen he did it great he was so credible it is difficult to understand why Jo refuses his marriage proposals he was her perfect husband. Kirsten Dunst was quite OK like the young Amy not so well done by  the older Amy played by Samantha Mathis who loses the joy and the energy of the young one. Eric Stoltz was incredible although his role is a very supporting one. Gabriel Byrne was the perfect professor Baerh he was great he does perfectly a German accent. Susan Sarandon was brilliant like Marmee and I think Claire Danes does an inolvidable performance a bit ignored after the movie was realised. Trini Alvarado  is excellent like Meg. Not only the performances but all the team that worked in the movie did a great job the costumes were beautifully designed the cinematography was brilliant. at least what I have to say is that this movie has influenced me a lot all the characters were lovely  the strength of Jo her dreams of being a writterI want to be a writer too her way of think her beautyher power. I feel like if I was Laurie lots of times Laurie is one of the most lovely male characters in the history of literature. And I think this is possible mostly because of Winona Ryder and Christian Bale. I couldnt imagine a better couple of actors. An incredible and unforgettable movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rich is the word I would best use to describe this movie. It's rich  in cinematography with gorgeous scenery and interiors rich in  characters with all goodhearted men and women of character rich in  love for each whether its for family or for suitors and rich in  storytelling.  Yes it's definitely more of a woman's movie than a man's and not the  sort of thing I would normally enjoy but this movie was so welldone  that I cannot say anything negative about it. In the modernera of  filmmaking late '60s to today it is always a pleasure to see a  totally clean and nice movie.  The cast is excellent. It's nice to see Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon  play wholesome roles something they don't always do but they do it  well here. Ryder is the star of this story although everyone gets  decent screen time. Ryder's character  the more independent  feministtype thinker  will always get preference anyway in a  Hollywood film. My favorite of the Little Women was Beth the most  kind and compassionate one. Claire Danes' innocent face won me over.  The real beauty was the grownup Amy played by Samantha Mathis. Most  of her role however is seen as a young girl and played by Kirsten  Dunst who has gone on to become a pretty famous actress. The other  sister is Meg who is a solid conservative woman and is played by  Trini Alvarado. Her role is the smallest of the four girls.  Sarandon's Mrs. Abagail 'Marmee' March holds everyone together as  the mother and head of the household while her husband is off fighting  at War. She looks more like an older sister.  I liked the March daughters' suitors in here too. First there was  Laurie or Teddy as he also was called by the girls. A young  Christian Bale played him. Then there was Gabriel Byrne as Friedrich  Bhaer. It was a bit strange hearing this Irishman play a part that  required a German accent. Eric Stoltz plays Meg's future husband John  Brooke. He starts off as someone with a very stiff personality but  soon changes into a warm and good husband.  If this film appears slow in the first 2030 minutes hang in there  because it gets better and better as it goes along. This is just a  beautiful film with fantastic visuals and memorable story that should  bring a tear or two to your eyes by the end. Great storytelling usually  wins out and that's the case with this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are many many reasons why I love this version of Little Women. The main one  or at least the most immediate  is the way the film looks. I love the soft lighting the hair and costumes I was astounded this year when I bought the DVD to hear on the commentary that Winona Ryder's hair was not her own but a wig! I never would have guessed it at all. The male characters as much as the females I do love the period costumes and I'm impressed by the efforts the wardrobe department made to get everything so accurate. The girls were in impoverished circumstances so the clothes they wear aren't new and look just as though they've been handed down from one sister to another. There are a few subtle touches in this film that I sometimes find a bit jarring such as when Marmee is talking with John Brooke in front of Meg and mentions her disagreement with the idea of women wearing restrictive corsets but that is really the only bit that I don't feel is quite right and it is there to demonstrate Marmee's liberal attitude. I love the way the characters interact although there perhaps isn't enough demonstration of why Laurie and old Mr. Laurence disagree. Jo and Amy act just like real sisters  they fight and provoke each other into arguments and disputes and generally have a chance to make little digs at the other. Meg is the pretty  but yet also virtuous  one and clearly the most socially at ease with the upper classes of the time for instance reminding Jo Don't shake hands with people. It isn't the thing any more and in the end  although she has to wait for a period of time that would seem endless today before marrying the man she loves  she opts for a poorer but obviously happier life. It would be very easy to simply say that Beth is not given anything dramatic or interesting to do but that is the whole point of her character. She watches those around her do great and exciting things and there is a sense that she herself is happy with that. Susan Sarandon's Marmee clearly holds this family together  the ideal mother figure she is comforting incredibly wise I wonder if anyone has ever met anyone with all the wisdom she seems to have and always on hand to encourage her girls in their quest to do as they please. The male characters are also interesting. John Brooke is stable and compassionate and sensible. Laurie also known as Teddy just occasionally can be quite an intense figure and I was amazed to find that Christian Bale was only about twenty when this film was released. It is as interesting to see the changes his personality goes through as it is to see those the girls go through. The Professor is a slightly unorthodox character and yet he complements Jo perfectly.I have watched this film many many times now so many in fact that I have sometimes been known to say the lines along with the characters as they say them and I know I will watch it many more times in the future. It might perhaps be a bit of a holiday film but it's certainly worth watching for the feelgood factor it generates.".

The acting was spectacular and the story which came from the original novel by Louisa May Alcott was enjoyable.Probably one of the things I liked best in this film was watching all the girls grow up getting married and one eventually having children. There are some happy moments then there are some that are quite sad but either way this is a very good film that I would recommend for just about anyone who is looking for a great family movie or just something to watch on your own.".

Susan Sarandon plays the saintly matriarch and keeps together the kind of family that you would gladly die for. Trini Alvarado Claire Danes and Kirsten Dunst are admirable as MegBeth and Amy  Alvarado in particular giving grace and elegance to the responsible Meg. The score alone should be praised to high heaven because it's as beautiful and heartwarming as the film itself Thomas Newman's 'Orchard House' is like listening to a brass band in a shopping mall at Christmas! A wonderful treat for the ears! Christian Bale was a good choice as the loyal but secretly lovesick Laurie. Gabriel Byrne is dignity personified as Professor Bhaer who proves the suitable match for Jo who is forever searching for something extraordinary  helpful to hopeless romantics when she eventually finds it in the very last scene. One which every upcoming writer including myself would almost sell their souls to experience! A marvellous film....WATCH IT!!".

It infuriated me to no end that she was bigger than Jo but as I got older and watched it with fresh eyes I got over it. I actually think Danes is the best cast Beth so far.  What I really love about this movie is the musical score and the costumes.  The hair is perfect as well as the frizzies were allowed to be free.  I am offended by period movies where everyone's hair is perfect since they did not have hair spray back then.  I am glad Gillian Armstrong let the frizzies come out naturally! One flaw of this movie is when Jo yells at Amy using today's terminology.  I don't think the real Jo would say I'm going to kill you!  I hate you! That seems very 1990's to me.  But other than that this is the best Little Women you can see and it is destined to become a classic if it isn't considered one already.".

Then they sit around the piano and play Christmas' songs. Outside is snowing as a beautiful music plays Thomas Newman. And there's a lot of snow in Little Women but it is not a film about Christmas or snowy weathers it is about five women and how each of them face that exhilarating journey called life.The letter mentioned above comes from the girls' father who is in War. At that time daughters weren't used to say dad father they called him. They gathered in a big room and shared their illusions It's not the same without the presents Meg Trini Alvarado explained. I'm desperate for drawing pencils the little Amy Kirsten Dust said. I wish I didn't have to work for great aunt March Jo Winona Ryder complained.Beth Claire Danes talented quiet and always uninspiring is asked What is your wish for Christmas?. I would like the War to end so father could come home she replies and all of the daughters want that too. They do have a nice piano Beth adds looking over the window where Laurie Christian Bale is playing. Laurie the captive according to the girls will be a dear friend of the family and the girls.They will all play together in a secret society that writes articles and carries on plays they will all listen to Jo's stories waiting for the newest chapter they will all have a constant smile on their faces because they are nice persons. The girls for example know that they're not classy but it doesn't bother them. However they need to be presented in society and find a man that wants them.A friend of Mrs. March comes one day and they're talking about the girls Meg needs to find a good man she could she has to attend to the events. Instantly Jo runs down the stairs enthusiastically and tells something to her mom. Her friend interrupts And this one is getting wasted with so much reading. In fact Jo is very intelligent and wise destined for big things and knows it and is proud of it.One day she and Meg go to an event and Jo tries to hide from classy boys and finds Laurie. They laugh they dance and years later when Laurie goes to college Jo tells him I wish you didn't have to go. They look at each other and you could swear they are in love but they haven't even kissed. Again years later he asks her to marry him and she rejects him generating misunderstanding in the family. Life doesn't always go as it is supposed to.So Jo seeks for independence going to New York where she meets Friedrich Gabriel Byrne an old humble German teacher. They both share the same interests and he wishes to protect her. He advises her grandly about her story writing Write from life from the deepness of your soul. When they first kiss you can tell that Jo wants it and you instantly feel bad for Laurie because you think he is Jo's fate but many of the girls' fate is betrayed and things don't always turn out right at the end of the road.Tragedies and moments of great happiness follow in the life of the Marches uncertainties and twists. Mrs. March tries to be the core she always was and keep the family together and it is Susan Sarandon's task fulfilled in this great portrayal of hers. With very little words spoken and a bunch of understanding looks we know her character is a woman we should admire and look up to.Personally I would also admire all of the girls that fought for the life they wanted restlessly. Trini Alvarado's Meg is determinedly confident in her decisions and not a quitter at all. Now look at 12yearold Kirsten Dunst's Amy and 15yearold Claire Danes' Beth two performances that clearly show the gifted actresses they are now and what they will be. Same to be said of Christian Bale's Laurie.But it is without question Jo's life that was a little more detailed in Luisa May Alcott's novel. However screenwriter Robin Swicord adapted the story so it could look general and Gillian Armstrong directed it with no focus on any specified character in this wonderful marvelous movie.Nevertheless it was Winona Ryder's name the only one before the film's title in the credits and it was her performance the one that shocked everyone the most. The beautiful 23yearold she's still beautiful now takes the responsibility of an adult and delivers an Oscarcaliber portrayal that will stay in my head for the rest of my life. Brilliant acting for an actress that still deserves an award she never got.The Marches' life is not the happiest of all. They make mistakes they fall short they suffer but don't we all?".

What is so refreshing about this film is the truth and realism of the book. The actresses don't wear makeup they don't speak in melodramatic tones the men aren't playboys or Rhett Butlers. The writing and acting feels natural and true to Alcott's novel  which makes the sisters' victories and losses all the more authentic to the viewer.

	schema:reviewBody "I guess topics which are taboo or films that have their bans lifted will more than likely have its audience base automatically built from the curiosity arising from its background wondering on what grounds and rationale that such a film got made or banned in the first place. The Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo had its fair share of publicity coming from ex Japanese prime minister Koizumi's high profile visits to the shrine for worship much to the disgust of neighbours China and Korea because enshrined within those grounds are some of the tried war criminals of WWII whom to most in Asia are not deemed to be martyrs having started a campaign on aggression in the region.Depending on which camp you're standing in there are two sides of the coin even from within a homogeneous society like Japan itself  those who find it no big deal for their prime minister to visit the shrine at his own personal capacity and those who find it wrong to do so. On a macro level while it is easy to condemn those who partook in the war from personal stories just like that in any society there will always be those who have to do it against their will and even some touching stories coming from the surviving siblings that their brothers get sent away being quite clear that they'll never come back ever again.As a documentary there is no lack of an educational value in it. There were plenty of nuggets of information for the military history buffs and some of the things I learnt was how Yasukuni itself has so much importance and relevance to Imperial Japan. For starters I learnt that swords have an indelible connection to the army and to the shrine given that sword forgers from the shrine made their swords on those very grounds and officers at the frontline are bestowed one each. This equates to quality swords running in the thousands being made. Of course these swords are infamous for being tools used to behead countless of victims and some of these atrocities get publicized as bravery contests amongst officers.And the significance of the sword is so important that within the shrine the object of worship is none other than one Yasukuni sword which is used to represent the more than 2 million souls who were lost in the war fighting for the Emperor which of course amongst that figure things are not all that clear with various groups lobbying for things such as removal of names and enshrining of their ancestors because they were either forced to conscript or some aren't even Japanese to begin with. It's hard to imagine  2 millions souls  captured into one single sword and if this was a martial arts world we live in that would be one heck of a powerful sword.But as a movie there were a lot more to be desired. Granted when dealing with topics of controversy answers during interviews are not bound to be forthcoming given the director's attempt to elicit some candid remarks from the sole remaining Yasukuni sword forger who's already into his 90s. Interviews with his subjects also seem to be more from the man on the street and thus dilutes some of the expected quality in the answers which some might allude to talk that you'll hear from coffeeshops some of which might be entertaining for its point blank accusations such as the British National Museum being a storage space for goods plundered all over the world. I chuckled at this comment because this is not the first time I'm hearing it as I've heard it before from a Brit on a tour telling all tourists that same thing as well he's a tour guide by the way.Most of the time the camera lingers in and around the grounds of the shrine on August 15 since it's the day designated as a remembrance and you have various military groups coming on site to pay their respects as will other civil groups and protesters as well thus making it fertile grounds for opposing members of the groups to come into blows verbally or physically in trying to force their viewpoints on the other. One thing's for sure though that groups are passionate in their beliefs and no words get minced in their shoutouts.However the film doesn't go beyond what's shown on the surface. It seems quite contented in capturing events of the day like a newsreel but without any further input on how and why such events shots and the inclusion of such scenes mattered. There was an extended scene involving an American who was flag waving the stars and stripes on the grounds to mixed reactions from the Japanese people as well as dwelling on incidents such as the Taiwanese indigenous groups wanting to reclaim the souls of their ancestors. But alas further interviews to pick the minds of these folks were not done  maybe the request to interview them was unsuccessful?So while it had some ingredients to make it more than worthwhile to sit through 2 hours of a film revolving around the Yasukuni shrine and movement its presentation could have been a lot stronger. The narrative got quite messy and all over the place never having a primary focus but flitted around as and when it found convenience. I felt the ending was rather week because of its reliance on commonly seen archival stock images and videos but on the whole an impressive effort and courage to explore something controversial and touchy even until today.".

	schema:headline " A riveting documentary for concerned viewers";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a stunning movie. It was put together from footage shot by director Li Ying at the shrine over a period of about ten years beginning around 1997 when he was motivated to make the film after witnessing a Japanese gathering dedicated to denial of the massacre known as the Rape of Nanjing and coming away from it in shock. Taking a cinemaverite approach Li wisely merely points the camera and lets the shrine tell its own story or rather expose itself with the exception of scenes in which he interviews Naoharu Kariya master swordmaker for the shrine. The lack of any substantial narration makes the film only more powerful. I read it as a scathing and startling indictment and I know it struck many Japanese the same way as none who did not make the August 15th pilgrimage to the shrine could have imagined the tumult and yes aliveandkicking fanaticism.Unfortunately due to the lack of narration the full meaning of it all may be lost on viewers who are not knowledgeable of the nature of this shrine which was built by the fledgling Meiji government in 1869 to enshrine the souls of all soldiers who died fighting for the emperor in any wars. It therefore does not enshrine any nonmilitary who died in wars or soldiers who died fighting against the new government shortly after its birth. Unlike Arlington or Kolmeshhe Bitburg it is not a cemetery and contains no graves or ashes. Strictly speaking people go there not to pay their respects to these dead but to worship their heroic souls eirei enshrined as gods kami. It was the veritable basilica of prewar State Shinto and emperor worship it is right across the street from the imperial palace and has retained its essential character even after WWII right up to the present. Time has in effect stopped within its precincts. I would say it stands as a monument to lack of repentance for misdeeds during the war. Any pretense to the contrary was dropped in 1978 when it took the brazen step of officially enshrining 14 Class A war criminals an act which reportedly soured even the late Emperor Hirohito who arguably belonged in their number himself on the idea of resuming his visits there.How anyone can interpret this documentary as being neutralnoncommittal is beyond me for its footage of paramilitary parading and rightwing thuggery is nothing but damning. For me the real heroic soul is Taiwanese legislator Gaojin Sumei who marches into the precincts to protest against the forced enshrinement of Taiwanese nationals and gives the covey of thoroughly cowed Shinto priests an eloquent dressingdown they richly deserved and undoubtedly never forgot. Her criticisms stung so badly that in August 2011 the Public Security Bureau of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department tried to have her arraigned on clearly trumpedup charges in a bid to keep her from coming to Japan for any future protests. Also making an appearance are certain revanchist Japanese politicians most notably Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara who is another Nanjing denier Chinabaiter and dangerous advocate of a return to what he regards as prewar virtues. For the record ex PM Koizumi who also appears is not one of these.To carp at Yasukuni because of its slow pace or illadvised editing in parts is akin to pointing out warts on a unicorn for this film is that rare. I for one was on the edge of my seat most of the time but this may have been partly due to certain apprehension over personal safety given the threats and coercion directed at many theaters that showed or were going to show the film from the aforementioned rightwing thugs. I strongly recommend it to any people who are under the impression that Japan went through a universal and rigorous soulsearching and was born anew purged of its militaristic bent after the war.The film makes deft use of music from the first movement of Henryk Gorecki's Symphony No. 3 the Symphony of Sorrowful Songs whose 1992 recording was released to commemorate victims of the Holocaust. The piece is perfect accompaniment for Yasukuni which struck me as ultimately a meditation on chilling inhumanity with similarly resonating tones of profound grief.".

Also making an appearance are certain revanchist Japanese politicians most notably Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara who is another Nanjing denier Chinabaiter and dangerous advocate of a return to what he regards as prewar virtues. For the record ex PM Koizumi who also appears is not one of these.To carp at Yasukuni because of its slow pace or illadvised editing in parts is akin to pointing out warts on a unicorn for this film is that rare. I for one was on the edge of my seat most of the time but this may have been partly due to certain apprehension over personal safety given the threats and coercion directed at many theaters that showed or were going to show the film from the aforementioned rightwing thugs. I strongly recommend it to any people who are under the impression that Japan went through a universal and rigorous soulsearching and was born anew purged of its militaristic bent after the war.The film makes deft use of music from the first movement of Henryk Gorecki's Symphony No. 3 the Symphony of Sorrowful Songs whose 1992 recording was released to commemorate victims of the Holocaust. The piece is perfect accompaniment for Yasukuni which struck me as ultimately a meditation on chilling inhumanity with similarly resonating tones of profound grief.";

	schema:reviewBody "'Yasukuni' is a documentary about the Yasukuni Shrine where Japanese people may pay their respects to the soldiers and others who died during conflicts over the last century or so of Japan's military past. About two and a half million people are enshrined there the mass majority of whom died during the Second World War 1000 of them were convicted of war crimes just over ten of those being ClassA war criminals responsible for the massacre of millions of civilians of other Asian countries and thousands of prisoners of war from the Allied forces. It remains a deeply controversial issue and is still a key reason for the poor political relationship between China and Japan and also Korea and Japan and the strong feelings of dislike and even hatred which exist amongst these countries' peoples. I saw this documentary with directlytranslated subtitles which means that they have been put through a translation device consequently I could not follow all the subtleties of what was said. Fortunately a documentary's main purpose is to provoke thought and this film certainly satisfies that aim. Director Li Ying has added no voiceover narration and frequently leaves the camera running for extended periods which allows the events and nonevents to unravel in a loose and naturalistic way. We see extensive footage of ceremonies protests against and shows of support for the shrine all filmed by a shaky handheld camera. There are reels of footage of a 90 year old swordmaker whose frequent silences and nonresponses may tell us more about Japanese culture and feelings about Yasukuni than any direct answer could. At one point we see him fiddling with his stereosystem for over 3 minutes whilst muttering that the buttons are too small just to show us what he listens to of an evening. Yes over three minutes of a ninety year old man wrestling with a tapeplayer if you want rapidfire flashy edits and action then don't come near this film if however you are looking for a deeper meditation on a difficult subject then you are in the right place. The swords that he makes are shown to be a vital symbol of Japanese spirit and he is humbly proud of his life's work whilst an underlying sinister feeling grows because we know that those swords were used to behead countless innocents. Several other main issues are acknowledged including FormerPresident Junichiro Koizumi's support for Yasukuni and the visit of a Taiwianese delegation trying to remove their relatives from the shrine. Without accurate subtitles I could not gauge how much the issue of Japanese revisionism was raised which was a little frustrating as this ability or inability to look history fairly and honestly in the face is perhaps the most vital issue of all for the Yasukuni Shrine. Overall those with clear and uncompromising views either for or against paying respects at Yasukuni will probably have little to complain about if they see this film it is wellbalanced and appears to remain as neutral as possible. For those people who wish to explore this important and complex topic then I think this documentary is an excellent place to start although it will require your patience.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Happy Flight";
	schema:reviewBody "Later this week I'll be on my way overseas on a flight but no that's not the chief reason why this film appealed to me. I had chanced upon the film's release when in Tokyo last year and the trailer had caught my attention for its potential to provide some madcap humour. What's more it stars one of my favourite Japanese actresses in Haruka Ayase whose performance in Cyborg She I had enjoyed so it's only logical that I picked this film over others releasing this week.Happy Flight is a delightful surprise surpassing my expectations where it features a myriad of characters and an ensemble cast to bring about an end to end presentation of just about everything that goes on behind the scenes from the operations of the ground crew at the check in counter to the maintenance team from the control tower operations centre and right up into the aircraft with the duties of the pilot and that of the cabin crew. Frequent travellers usually treat everything behind the scenes as a black box which just clicks and works and this film provides that extra awareness and appreciation of the one million things that can and are happening and in the worst case scenario something simple that can go so wrong.Which to All Nippon Airways it's quite gutsy of them to open up and brand this film. I cannot see how a similar film can be done locally without jumping through some major hoops and probably end up with folks being unhappy about how things can get portrayed on screen. But unlike films such as Flightplan this one doesn't belittle any of the departments but smartly fuses comedy without becoming veiled insults. I suppose Shinobu Yaguchi who had helmed films like Water Boys and Swing Girls proved to be the right person to craft a potentially complex tale on what goes on in aviation and what he did was simply put amazing.Cleverly fusing all the different narratives and subplots he had presented the films as a series of quick short stories although each engaging enough to make you want to know more. While some characters can be caricatures he pumped them up with enough engaging incidents to ultimately bring out that smile. It's also key that he had provided some behind the scenes insights from the industry that would make you sit up and take notice with nuggets of trivia coming from every angle and every department featured.And not to forget the office politics within the department themselves and when they interact with each other I chuckled at the taichi attempt everyone depending on one another's professional expertise to ensure a pleasant flight experience for every single passenger the minute he or she steps into the airport ready for their flight out. But of course sometimes things tend to rub off the wrong way and for dramatic sake could be slightly exaggerated especially on what takes place within the cabin which most of us would be aware of or from hearsay support some urban myths.Narratively we follow many viewpoints. We have a first officer Kazuhiro Suzuki Seiichi Tanabe in his final test flight to become a captain and his Flight 1980 is assessed by an unsmiling Captain Noriyoshi Harada Saburo Tokito in the cockpit which puts him under additional pressure given his disastrous attempt at the flight simulator. Then we have the ditzy cabin attendant Etsuko Saito Haruka Ayase who's a Calamity Jane under the supervision of Reiko Yamazaki Shinobu Terajima and a competing peer Mari Tanaka Kazue Fukiishi. On the ground the subplots also extend to Tomoko Tabata's ground crew Natsumi Kimura and Ittoku Kishbe's flight operations controller and the list goes on extending even toward an incident at the maintenance hangar and a trio of comedic aviation geeks. And if all these don't seem enough there's an oncoming typhoon to add to the chaos!But the beauty of it is that you won't be a wee bit confused or at any time does the story seem bloated or sub plots unnecessary. Everything comes together in good time like clockwork almost exactly the same experience you'll feel when boarding a plane for a trip. Working dynamics and office politics also deftly creeps into the film and presents to you the notsoglamorous side to any job although it does take the time to remind you that reputations that precede could also be misconstrued and there's nothing wrong in holding back prejudgements until you experience something yourself first hand.Opening with an inflight safety video I like the film enough to rank it one of my favourites of this year for being that perfect balance between comedy drama and that valuable look into what makes aviation tick. Highly recommended so do flock to the only screen in Singapore that's showing this as an exclusive showcase!".

When the plane takes flight and encounters various problems with natural mechanical and human causes the crew both onboard and on the ground all cooperate to ensure the passengers welfare.These people all have their own little side stories to tell mostly hilarious. But you can also feel an underlying seriousness the overall story the director wants to tell. This becomes more evident when the plane is in flight when every decision made is one of life and death. In the midst of the comedy you cannot help but feel the tension and drama of the situations as well.

Happy Flight is a buoyant entertainment with situations springing from the familiar context of the airport and environs. The cast is uniformly agreeable showing their skills at light breezy material. If anything the comedy is perhaps too light unlike Yaguchi's other blithe offerings there's a certain paucity of fresh gags to keep the whole thing running smooth. The talented Haruka Ayase proved her comic skill with Hotaro no Hikaru the movie Cyborg Girl gave her a platform for a clever funny dual role. Here however the writing doesn't allow Ayase to make much of her character or situation. Other actors have the same problem.The situations were engaging for the most part but never seemed to result in comic payoff. Given the level of talent here one expect a bit more.

Overall it was a very fun and exciting movie but I felt 103 minutes weren't nearly enough to summarize this story.There were simply too many things happening with too many characters. We have the pilots flight attendants mechanics flight control weather control and airport staff. Each with their own situations and problems to handle. I guess it shows that hard work of everyone not only the pilots are required for a smooth flight. However the film ended before I really connected with any of the characters. The lead actor and actress' screen time and presence weren't much more than other supporting cast.Ayase Haruka's acting was disastrous in this movie she's simply not a light comedy material. Although the cast was loaded with bigname actors it felt cheap and rushed like a TV dorama series.The production team did well to summarize the story the best they could in 103 minutes and I thought the story was nice and characters were interesting. A fun watchandforget movie that would've worked much better as a dorama series.".

	schema:headline " Seriously addictive movie  The most balanced movie ever made?";
	schema:reviewBody "The first time I saw this movie I had difficulty in understanding a lot of the dialogue not just because of the weird accent but because the actors spoke so damn fast.  But despite this I became literally addicted to it. To begin with my wife got pretty annoyed because any other movie we rented would be ejected after about 20 minutes of viewing and in would go LS2SB. Now she is hooked as well.I have lost count of the number of times I have seen LS2SB and still cannot put my finger on why I find this movie so good to watch.  I suppose the most obvious feature of this movie is that it is beautifully balanced between being serious and humorous at the same time.  The characters are twodimensional.  The villains are menacing and yet they are made to look like idiots and the good guys think they are so smart yet keep getting the rug pulled from under them.  They are all projected as 'cool' yet the situation is always out of their control.  Maybe it could be called a satire on true life.The style of this movie is unique full stop.  I cannot think of any movie that can be compared to LS2SB.  Quite a few people say that the style is a mix of 'Pulp Fiction' 'Goodfellas' 'Trainspotting' and 'Reservoir Dogs' but I think that you would make that kind of description only if you are really desperate to match LS2SB to something.The best description I can think of is 'MTV does a crime comedy' and I honestly don't think there is anything wrong with that.  Like music videos it is all nonstop movement and sound.  Something is always happening but unlike music videos not without reason.The humor is incredibly sharp yet 'as a matter of fact'.  No one is really trying to be extraordinarily funny but again it is the balance between being menacingly serious and funny that the humor really flies at you. I think that it is for this reason that a few people are really disappointed with LS2SB.  If you are expecting a 'belly laugh Leslie Nielson Jim Carrey Steve Martin typecasted' type all out comedy or a serious 'Al Pacino Andy Garcia DeNiro typecasted crime thriller you will find this movie a big let down.My favorite characters are Rory Breaker Vas Blackwood and Big Chris Vinnie Jones mainly because their two dimensional overthetop characters are the most obvious.  Big Chris takes his son with him debt collecting and while he beats up someone who owes chastises him for swearing in front of his son and Rory Breaker is the most idiotic druglord you could come up with.I haven't even mentioned the excellent and unique camerawork speaker blowing soundtrack beautifully threaded plot perfect ending and the grittiest visuals I've seen.  You wont see any reflective glass laden sky scrapers here or 'over head city shots' or incredible special effects. This movie has actors I have never heard of dialogues that you have to rewind and replay to understand buildings that look as though they have been condemned for demolition cars that wouldn't even be seen in our scrap yards has probably been made with a budget that most movies in Hollywood use for makeup alone has no love scenes or romance or complex relationships no Oscarworthy performances and yet is perfect entertainment.Where our movies normally rely on budgets this movie works on human talent alone.If any movie deserves a 10 out of 10 then this is it.'And there's one more thing...............it's been emotional'".

	schema:headline " The essence of late 90's cinema  hip highly stylized VISUAL";
	schema:reviewBody "Guy Ritchie's hip highly stylized 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is a truly remarkable film not only for its appropriately pyrotechnic camera work but also for its seemingly flawless puzzleperfect scriptscreenplay. While the picture's main focus is on a group of lads who invest money in a highstakes rigged card game and lose the broader story concerns approximately eight different groups of criminals whose paths cross more than once in some cases during various illegal pursuits money guns drugs even revenge. The film is quite violent both on and off screen but it's also uniformly humorous throughout. It's important to note that the four central characters a cook a card sharp and a couple of guys who sell discounted items are interested only in acquiring the money to pay off their enormous debt they kill no one. The same applies to the laidback college boys who grow copious amounts of ganja. The cast is comprised of mostly young veteran male actors. In fact the only female in the film doesn't even speak though she handles a machine gun fairly well. Sting appears briefly in several scenes as a barowning father figure. While his secondary performance is solid as usual it is also unmemorable. The soundtrack is firstrate from the 60's hits of James Brown to the contemporary beats of London's underground. The groovy pulsating music and lyrics are often succinctly synchronized with the action and dialogue in the film creating a theatrical rhythm that is fairly uncommon in cinema from any period. Critics and audiences over the years have often dismissed stylized camera work as pretentious and unnecessary stating that it detracts from the story bogs it down or pads it however the film medium has the luxury of actually displaying a story for its audience unlike the written word alone. It's what the medium is all about  it's VISUAL. Hence one of the reasons a filmmaker chooses such visual displays is to brand his or her work in the same way as writers like Cummings Hemingway or Joyce did with their medium. It's hard to imagine a cinema without Hitchcock Kubrick or Scorsese to represent it. To this end Ritchie has taken his first step in establishing his own brand. His energetic ultracontemporary camera work incorporates through a fresh perspective such devices as slow motion fast motion and freezeframe coupled with narration. It is at times reminiscent of and actually expands upon Martin Scorsese's patented visual stylistics and camera movements like those found in 'Mean Streets' and 'Goodfellas'. But the similarities with Scorsese's work end there. Critics' endless comparisons of Ritchie's film with the works of Quentin Tarantino and Danny Boyle's 'Trainspotting' stand mostly unwarranted as these comparisons take away from the inventiveness and originality of 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. Ritchie's film is a much more involved complex layered work than the aforementioned comparisons. While Tarantino's films are very strong on dialogue screenplay and editing they often lack creative camera work and direction. Boyle's 'Trainspotting' does have a resembling feel to 'LSTSB' but aside from its Great Britain origins there really is no need for comparison. 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is essential viewing.".

What ensues is a set of schemes counterschemes ripoffs and badgood luck that demand you pay attention. On several occasions I had to pause the video just to take stock of which gang was planning what.The final thirty minutes of the film as the plots all collide and overlap turn setpiece shoot outs into comedic punchlines.  The comedy is driven by exploding our expectations of what are otherwise pretty standard scenes from the filmnoir genre.The acting is strong and the script very tight. Although I am not normally a fan of voice overs this one informs without spoiling the action. And I liked the use of the slowmotion to disrupt the action and keep me paying attention.While this film may not be for everyone if you enjoy a darker pallette this may be right up your alley.".

The comedy is driven by exploding our expectations of what are otherwise pretty standard scenes from the filmnoir genre.The acting is strong and the script very tight. Although I am not normally a fan of voice overs this one informs without spoiling the action. And I liked the use of the slowmotion to disrupt the action and keep me paying attention.While this film may not be for everyone if you enjoy a darker pallette this may be right up your alley.";

In this slick piece of film making Guy Ritchie denies hackneyed Hollywood trends by scripting no true goodguys just varying degrees of bad ones.This is a terrific movie. It is violent but not extreme considering the subject matter and cast of cutthroat characters. The language is strong and the humor is black where you'll find yourself belly laughing at the brutal misfortune of others. If this makes you uncomfortable then this film is not for you. It is also not for those who have been trained by television sitcoms to laugh on cue.Broadminds are required to enjoy this fine British film where it will definitely add some zing to your day.

This is pretty much what an action gangster flick should be like. It has all the required ingredients. The action humour drama and suspense balance extremely well. Ritchie's writing and direction are excellent as not only does the film keep one at the edge of hisher seat but the characters including minor ones are rich. They're overthetop but that only works for the film. While the bad guys think they're powerful and all they're actually portrayed as dumb and the good guys think they're clever and have all the answers to their problems when they're actually not so bright. The characters are portrayed as cool yet they end up getting caught in a mess. The film too is somewhat satirical as it reflects a part of life e.g. the closeness between the four friends the son following the father's Big Chris's footsteps. The humour is mostly dark with sharp witty and funny dialogues and hilarious situations. It all seems a 'natural' part of the story. Shot in DV the camerawork and use of music is very effective. The film has a raw and gritty look yet the execution of it makes it very stylish. Richie uses the same style in 'Snatch'. He should become an auteur and make more movies of this kind as it is clearly his fort remember his disastrous attempt at romance with 'Swept Away'?. All the actors whether it's Jason Flemyng Dexter Fletcher Nick Moran Jason Statham or more recognized faces like Vinnie Jones and Sting seem to naturally fit their parts.

Secondly because its British and although I'm from South East London myself and love British television comedies I have rarely found British humour well translated onto the big screen.  Normally it is toned down to plain slapstick goofy uncomplicated Inspector Cleuseau type humour tailored for American audiences.But to find not just British but straightfaced East London cockneyslang and swear filled humour in a really stylish movie was a revelation.I have always believed that British humor especially East London humor is much more sophisicated than American humour.  Maybe the reason why American audiences have been more forthcoming with LS2SB is that despite the accent they finally 'get it' without having to have it remade into an American version ala Faulty Towers and Threes company and other British comedies. Yet I believe Tom Cruise is remaking the movie with an American cast.  I suppose for those who just cannot understand English unless its spoken in an American accent.  That is really a shame as there are so many diverse accents all around the world and LS2SB could not have been done in any accent other than cockney.Still there are bits only the British will get like the scene with the three guys pouncing on the traffic warden in the back of the van.  That scene had me clutching my sides.  Only someone living in London can feel true loathing for a traffic warden the most hated person in Britain.Cinemtography was superb.  I wont go into who's already done the slowmo's and stop action argument.  It is near impossible to do anything in a movie today that has not already been done.  You can either do nothing  or do whatever you can as long as it suits the mood and the flow of the movie and Guy Ritchie just cannot be faulted.  He projects the seedy thin laned miserable weathered London yet with such style that you want to see more. The camera work could not have been better.  Just see the projection of Eddy's unsteady lightheaded wooziness as he gets up from the gambling table having lost everything and owing even more.  Brilliant.The Soundtrack was as diverse and yet brilliant as I have ever heard in a movie.  I dont want to look like waving the Union Jack here but this movie shows that the British have a more diverse taste in music.  From Reggae to Ska to Rock to Mikis Theodorakis every track played just added to the scene showed.In short LS2SB is a movie that just does not stop for a second is full of refreshing humour filmed with style has a lively soundtrack some violence thrown in for good measure and a story with more twists and turns than a bowlfull of spaghetti.Dont let this movie slip you by.  You'll either love it or hate it.If this movie was not British I'd give it an 810 but since it is it gets 910 from me.Favourite dialogue Rory Breaker If you hold back anything I'll kill ya. If you bend the truth or I think your bending the truth I'll kill ya. If you forget anything I'll kill ya. In fact you're gonna have to work very hard to stay alive Nick.

Guy Ritchie lures us deep into an intricate world a world only belonging to streetwise charmers merciless debt collectors dope drug dealers paranoid marijuana growers eccentric Afros and inept burglars. In this criminal subculture they cheat and rob each other. Such a film as it is if shot by a less intelligent would be a disaster. But Guy makes the story full of twists and coincidences and weaves them all into his wellcraft web. Elements like guns knives corpses and claret are indispensable parts for a gang film. In Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels guns are replaced by air rifles and antic shotguns knives by kitchen ones and some kicking. And the bullets fly and corpses aren't that bloody since most are offscreen. And I couldn't help laughing at Soap's theory like  guns for show knives for pro especially when he soapboxes it with a seriousness on his softsoap face. The dialog is recommendable and quotable. The shooting angles especially closeups cannot be more suitable for this films. See a label sticker under the sole of Harry? To crown them all the cliffhanger ending is peerless.".

That's more than I can say about any number of movies in the 1990's that cost ten times as much to make and starred pricey talent.  The editing is clever and cute.  The casting is just short of flawless.  Of the four principles only Bacon seemed consistent to me.  The minor parts were sometimes spectacular esp. Big  Little Chris and Barry the Baptist.There are some legitimate complaints about this movie.  The big one is that it doesn't really go anywhere or mean anything.  It seems like an awful lot of flash and talent to end up saying nothing about anything.  But um it's not like Lock Stock is trying to be anything it isn't so maybe it's not a valid critique after all.  Considering how long Tarrantino's influence has been around it's a little unfair to call Ritchie on imitating him.  There are some similarities  large casts distinct characters clever dialogue rapid shifts in narratives from one string to another and shifting in time and few other things.  I think the problem is that years of dumbing down by Hollywood have almost eliminated all these things.  The influence is there certainly but it would not seem as pronounced if there were any other hugely exposed filmmakers in recent memory that put as much emphasis on dialogue and character besides Tarantino.I haven't watched MTV since the mid1980's so the style of Lock Stock and Snatch didn't seem trite to me.  Some people I talked to said that the film style was too much like the average car commercial or pop video which is getting the influence backwards but I could see how those associations would spoil the experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is set in London where four close friends Eddie Nick Moran Bacon Jason Statham Tom Jason Flemying  Soap Dezter Fletcher all chip in 25000 to make up the 100000 entrance fee to a big high stakes poker game held by hard as nails villain  crime boss 'Hatchet' Harry Lonsdale P.H. Moriarty. Eddie is an expert poker player  figures he can make each of them a clear 10000 profit if they play their cards right ha!. Unfortunately 'Hatchet' Harry doesn't like losing  cheats Eddie not only loses the 100000 but actually ends up owing 'Hatchet' Harry 500000 after borrowing it from him to continue in the game. 'Hatchet' Harry is not the sort of person you owe money to Eddie  his friends must find a way to raise a half a million pounds in the next four days or start losing their fingers...This English production was written  directed by Guy Ritchie  has already deservedly reached pretty much classic status in fact it still resides in the IMDb's top 250 films list over ten years since it was originally released  for me it throughly deserves to be there. It's just a wonderfully entertaining witty funny clever British crime caper with bags of personality  at the time it was made originality although in the ten years since it was released many a British film has ripped it off trying to recreate it's success. There are a few things which make Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels so brilliant. First it's just so funny I have seen Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels several times now  I laugh my head off every time the really funny dialogue the spot on performances the hilarious one liners the use of funny cockney rhyming slang  the things which happen along with the often bizarre situations the character's find themselves in means there isn't a scene that goes by where something funny doesn't happen or there isn't some instantly quotable insult or one liner. Secondly the character's are great they have real depth  the good guy's are very likable so you root for them while the bad guy's are real nasty pieces of work so as a consequence you don't root for them just the way it should be. Then there's the plot which at the time was fresh new original clever witty full of great twists  turns  there's certainly plenty going on which rather improbably all come together at the end in a somewhat far fetched way but when a film is as entertaining clever  downright funny as Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels you just tend to go with it. A brilliantly funny British comedy crime caper one of my favourite films ever  it's as simple  straight forward as that.Director Ritchie really injects some style pace  energy into the film with various tricks which never become gimmicky or intrusive  only help tell a brilliantly story with style originality  panache. Not only did Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels revolutionise the British crime caper genre with it's story telling but it has also influenced plenty of films since with it's slick editing  visual techniques. There's a fantastic soundtrack too I really can't think of one bad thing to say about Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels which is pretty high praise in itself as I am not easily pleased. There's a fair amount of violence but nothing overly graphic  a lot of it is played for laughs as is the bad language  profanity of which there is a lot. In fact I don't there is a single scene which doesn't involve the use of strong language at some point.According to the IMDb Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels had a budget of about 960000 which is simply amazing a film this good  this stylish for less than a million? Shot on location in  around London Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels were the film debuts of both ex footballer Vinnie Jones  Jason Statham who have both done very well off the back of it. During the final credits the film is dedicated to ex bare knuckle fighter Lenny McClean who played Barry the Baptist  who died of cancer shortly before the film premiered. The acting is great from all involved there's boyish charm to downright menacing criminal unpleasantness.Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a brilliantly funny witty clever  entertaining British crime caper that is a true genre great  one of my own personal favourite films ever. Ritchie followed Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels up with the equally brilliant British crime caper Snatch 2000 a couple of years later.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one seriously funny movie. I've probably seen it close to 10 times and it hasn't gotten old yet. Guy Ritchie brings us a hilarious look into the London criminal underground in one of his earliest features. The story revolves around four friends who become indebted to the local crime lord after a card game goes horribly wrong. The humor in this movie is sharp and fastpaced. At times it becomes a little hard to keep up with the thick British accents and the cockney rhyming slang but overall it doesn't detract from the movie. The movie keeps you guessing as to the outcome when the story becomes complex with multiple lies and doublecrosses but the ending satisfies.This film marks the debuts of two of England's coolest new actors Jason Statham who went on to do 'Transporter' among other movies and Vinnie Jones now a familiar cinema tough guy. Jones is especially good as Big Chris debt collectorfamily man. The majority of the cast aren't common faces in America aside from Sting but they all have the charisma to keep the audience interested. Another plus is the film's soundtrack ranging from reggae to 70's soul. It adds to the movie's already laidback feel.Everyone I've seen the movie with enjoys it once they get past the thick accents anyway so I can say with confidence this is a fun movie. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy and I feel this movie's humor hits more often than it misses. I'd recommend giving this movie a chance at least once and I don't think you'd be disappointed.".

The lads resort to illegal ways to get the money like ripping off their potselling nextdoor neighbours.This is a really excellent filmentertaining funny exciting and extremely realistic. The style is gorgeous. In fact I have nothing bad at all to say about it except that it may not be everyone's cup of tea. You also have to be patient with it. That may have been my problem the first time I saw it because I can remember mixing up quite a few people when not paying attention.. Still the realism of the situations make up for its occasionally slow pace and dialoguedriven plot. For instance none of these workingclass guys know how to handle a gun when they need to and the result is hilarious. They're not goofy by any means but they're just normal guys that struggle with the life of crime that they are forced to turn to in order to repay Eddie's debt. Also note the fantastic use of I Wanna Be Your Dog by The Stooges. 810".

Moriarty.Which Eddie through Harry's cheating promptly loses.So begins Eddie and the boys' crooked quest to deliver half a million knickers to Harry before Harry's bulldog Barry The Baptist Lenny McLean starts claiming their digits as vig.That's the short version. In the final telling Lock Stock  filmed with a leached look that makes London look even stinkier and gloomier than it actually is  is a Mobius strip of black comedic robbery and nihilistic bloodletting shot through a revolvingdoor of crisscrossing crosskilling killswitching plots.Concurrent with our desperate hero foursome calling them antiheroes does not even suffice for their level of anti so let's drop the prefix and stop pretending we don't support bad guys there are the dazed and confused marijuana farmers led by the willowy Winston Steven Mackintosh whom we first meet inanely arguing over locking the front gate there are Eddie's neighbors a gang of thieves as ruthless as they are inept led by a chilling sadist Dog Frank Harper whom we first meet as he swipes golf balls off the nose of a victim while macheteing another hanging upside down there is a black gang of giants led by a cockney midget with a fashionchallenged 'fro Rory Breaker Vas Blackwood whose introduction to the story sees him setting a man on fire for insisting he change the pub television channel then there are the two clueless lowrent bandits Jake Abraham and Victor McGuire who burgle the smoking barrels of the title with plottwisting consequences there's Big Chris Vinnie Jones a merciless hitman who is yet intent on raising his son with manners and a hardened bar owner JD who shuns the maelstrom not for want of streetcred but because he is miles beyond mustered played by Sting as hard as the day he formed The Police.With a sourcemusic soundtrack that swivels effortlessly between savage scarring guitars to ska figures and traditional Jewish plucking and slang so rich your ears will gain ten pounds not with Liberia's deficit in ya skyrocket orders an Aristotle of the most ping pong tiddly in the nuclear sub Lock Stock wends its complex way to a furiously satisfying climax twists aplenty and a final shot that will renew your faith in creative storytelling like a date with a drunk Hans Christian Andersen.This movie is a modern classic.No matter the Serious Critics denigrating style over substance this movie  stylistic to a fault  defiantly does not lack for substance. It is no secret that the nature of the medium is reliant on style so it is as silly to say that a movie should lack style as a rock band should lack image  these are the selling points of the products. Style is an integral aspect of a modern director's toolbox and Ritchie has consciously chosen to present his product this stylishly  and his cup overfloweth with substance too.Yet Ritchie's stylistic verve earns him his share of detractors some rationally decrying the new breed of crashcutting shotgun storytellers some just too slowwitted to keep up with the swagger of the Ritchies Tarantinos and Boyles  subsequently there are only two ways to take this movie either not at all or lock stock and two smoking barrelsMovie Maniacs visit www.poffysmoviemania.com".

Guy Ritchie is Danny Boyle Trainspotting 28 Days Later on crank.Along with Statham and Moran Dexter Fletcher as Soap and Jason Flemyng as Tubby Tommy round out the quartet of twentysomething East End street friends who pool their cash to enter Eddie a cardshark natural into a lifeordeath stakes card game with local gangster and porn king Hatchet Harry Lonsdale P.H. Moriarty.Which Eddie through Harry's cheating promptly loses.So begins Eddie and the boys' crooked quest to deliver half a million knickers to Harry before Harry's bulldog Barry The Baptist Lenny McLean starts claiming their digits as vig.That's the short version. In the final telling Lock Stock  filmed with a leached look that makes London look even stinkier and gloomier than it actually is  is a Mobius strip of black comedic robbery and nihilistic bloodletting shot through a revolvingdoor of crisscrossing crosskilling killswitching plots.Concurrent with our desperate hero foursome calling them antiheroes does not even suffice for their level of anti so let's drop the prefix and stop pretending we don't support bad guys there are the dazed and confused marijuana farmers led by the willowy Winston Steven Mackintosh whom we first meet inanely arguing over locking the front gate there are Eddie's neighbors a gang of thieves as ruthless as they are inept led by a chilling sadist Dog Frank Harper whom we first meet as he swipes golf balls off the nose of a victim while macheteing another hanging upside down there is a black gang of giants led by a cockney midget with a fashionchallenged 'fro Rory Breaker Vas Blackwood whose introduction to the story sees him setting a man on fire for insisting he change the pub television channel then there are the two clueless lowrent bandits Jake Abraham and Victor McGuire who burgle the smoking barrels of the title with plottwisting consequences there's Big Chris Vinnie Jones a merciless hitman who is yet intent on raising his son with manners and a hardened bar owner JD who shuns the maelstrom not for want of streetcred but because he is miles beyond mustered played by Sting as hard as the day he formed The Police.With a sourcemusic soundtrack that swivels effortlessly between savage scarring guitars to ska figures and traditional Jewish plucking and slang so rich your ears will gain ten pounds not with Liberia's deficit in ya skyrocket orders an Aristotle of the most ping pong tiddly in the nuclear sub Lock Stock wends its complex way to a furiously satisfying climax twists aplenty and a final shot that will renew your faith in creative storytelling like a date with a drunk Hans Christian Andersen.This movie is a modern classic.No matter the Serious Critics denigrating style over substance this movie  stylistic to a fault  defiantly does not lack for substance. It is no secret that the nature of the medium is reliant on style so it is as silly to say that a movie should lack style as a rock band should lack image  these are the selling points of the products. Style is an integral aspect of a modern director's toolbox and Ritchie has consciously chosen to present his product this stylishly  and his cup overfloweth with substance too.Yet Ritchie's stylistic verve earns him his share of detractors some rationally decrying the new breed of crashcutting shotgun storytellers some just too slowwitted to keep up with the swagger of the Ritchies Tarantinos and Boyles  subsequently there are only two ways to take this movie either not at all or lock stock and two smoking barrelsMovie Maniacs visit www.poffysmoviemania.com";

On the other hand it's British and it may not transfer into my American head very well.  I had heard also that the movie is a ripoff of Pulp.  Well let me tell you what I think.When the movie was over I found myself on the floor laughing like a giddy schoolchild.  I was laughing for two reasons 1 This movie is as funny as they say it is and 2 THE MOVIE IS SO GOOD!  I haven't been this giddy after a movie since well Pulp Fiction which is why people compare the two I guess.  But don't let anyone convince you that Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a British remake of Pulp fiction because anyone who says that is a fool.  The two are completely different.  Okay maybe not completely different but they're different enough.For one thing Lock is no where near as serious as Pulp.  Don't get me wrong Pulp had its funny moments but Lock is 100 comedy.  The movie's laughs come from two places.  The first place is the funny dialog.  Once you get past their accents which are a little on the thick side you will find that these guys are just plain funny.  The second place is where most of the laughs come from the plot.  The plot is so damn funny I can't even begin to talk about it.  Watching these fine British lads get caught up in this mass confusion is good ol' fashion entertainment my friend.The only problem I have with this movie is that the director Guy Richie can get a little on the musicvideodirection side.  With all the twisted camera angles and the pumped up music one could almost mistake this for a music video on TRL.  This really didn't bother me that much.  Just like in Pulp Fiction these guys spent some time compiling the soundtrack.  Great soundtrack people!If you liked Pulp Fiction you'll love Lock Stock etc. so pick this movie up.910".

I was pleasantly surprised upon viewing the film but still could not see how people compare the film to the Pulp Fictions and Trainspottings of this world.Upon reading the comments on 'Snatch' which I am yet to see I noticed someone saying that the performances on both films were excellent across the board. Not having seen 'Snatch' I am unable to judge that but i can certainly say that I was disappointed with the acting in 'Lock Stock'. I felt that while Vinnie Jones made a good debut and there was the odd good performance the main quartet certainly let the film down. At times the focus on reeling off snappy dialogue took precedence over actually acting and to a certain extent this led me to stop actually caring about what happened to the characters. While the thrill of their audacious attempts was great and some of the lines were hilarious most viewers get too swept up to really care at all about the characters. Some will say that this doesn't matter but it certainly does to me.Ritchie's style of direction at times baffled me  at times I saw glimpses of cinematic genius and realised exactly what the 'music video style' could bring to film e.g. Eddie's departure from the poker game but occasionally shots felt amateurish and lazy  for example look at the two Kennys' 'get the guns' argument near the end of the film. This meant i could occasionally see what the plaudits were on about and occasionally jumped right back to my original feelings about the film.There is normally nothing that I hate more than pretentious film critics rubbishing a film because it isn't a a postmodern satire on what it is really like to be a man or b a documentary on Ukrainian househusbands and I did thoroughly enjoy Lock Stock I gave it 710. However it is not in my opinion worthy of top 250 entry and will always remain for me a postpub fun fest.".

	schema:headline " Great music strong cast and Iwai Shunji's name? Count me in.";
	schema:reviewBody "Being an Iwai Shunjiproduced and cowritten film I was quick to pick up BANDAGE hoping for something original and enjoyable. I'm not sure how involved Iwai was with the film I'm guessing not too much though there are undoubtedly Iwai inspirations scattered throughout the film but it mostly delivered on my hopes.Casting Akanishi Jin as one of the leads was a smart move by director Kobayashi Takeshi. He brings massive fan support to the movie not to mention experience in the Japanese music industry. Playing the lead singer of a rock band Akanishi undoubtedly draws from personal experience he's a very popular member of the Johnny's boy band KATTUN actually former member now he decided to go solo using this film as a base as he plays the carefree yet troubled character of Natsu. His band LANDS is quickly gaining mass popularity but encounters problems the band members just don't completely gel. A genius musician Yukiya Kora Kengo and a brilliant composer Arumi Shibamoto Yuki form the heart of the band with Natsu supposedly still remaining just because of his indie fan base. It also helps that he can sing.Asako Kitano Kii is a high school girl who loves LANDS. One day her friend invites her to one of their concerts and they miraculously stumble upon backstage passes. The girls soon find themselves at the band's afterconcert drinking party and Asako strikes up a relationship with Natsu. He's soon bringing her to rehearsals and calling her up to solve band problems. The rest of the band obviously sees this as a hindrance though they can't convince Natsu of that. He really likes her in his own strange and laidback way.Akanishi Jin plays a damn good rocker. Although his character is quite onedimensional Akanishi embodies the rocker spirit entertaining and involving us in the film. Johnny's Entertainment boys are typically unimpressive actors whose roles are often restrained or stiff. It's surprising that Akanishi plays such a dark and adult character yes he really kissed a girla real kiss!. Akanishi's rock star is seemingly drunk throughout the film this is his personality as he rambles and babbles along. It's all very entertaining no doubt. Kitano Kii who also previously starred in the Iwaiproduced Halfway 2009 is a pleasure to watch as well. It's nice to see a young actress so in control of her characters I'm always impressed with her. The casting for each character is very good. I especially liked the inclusion of Ito Ayumi who emerged out of Iwai's Swallowtail Butterfly 1996 as the beautiful and smart manager of LANDS.The cinematography is onandoff employing the Iwaiinspired handheld style which is both effective and annoying. This style of camerawork can either bring extreme originality or make the film appear amateurish. For example in a few scenes the camera is far too unstable mostly noticeable towards the beginning making for an uncomfortable viewing experience thankfully these scenes are low in quantity. In other scenes the camera works well particularly when filming during performances or when the intimacy that the handheld camera can bring is needed. I found myself enjoying the cinematography more as the film progressed. Cinematographer Onomichi Koji seems to be Iwai's new goto cameraman after the death of his friend Shinoda Noboru as he is using him here and in his next directorial feature the Englishlanguage Vampire 2011.Since BANDAGE is a film about music the songs must be goodand they are. Akanishi's voice is wellsuited to the neorockalternative sound and is pleasing overall. The songs are all original compositions by Kobayashi who usually produces soundtracks for Iwai's films unless he does it himself. The tracks are great which helps raise the enjoyment scale of the movie. There is a particular scene in the film that gave me goosebumps Yuichi is playing around with a recording of one of LANDS's songs in darkness hair in his face. He alters the voice to be roboticsounding and plays the guitar with a violin bow. It's a powerful and dark moment in the film in which we discover the extent of Yukiya's talent and his deep loneliness.BANDAGE is ultimately a film about selfdiscovery. It is effective in portraying the life of an indie band in 1990s Japan when the rise and fall of these bands was commonplace due to TV talent shows. With a strong cast great music and effective camerawork for the genre BANDAGE manages to entertain while being an interesting commentary on the music industry at the time. Recommended!".

What follows is a drama about music the music industry the creative process and ultimately relationships. Its not a great film its much more drama than music. However in showcasing the different personalities of the band and wisely letting Ms. Kitano be her usual ingratiating self the film works. Probably best for teens and post teens but the film showcases the dynamics of not only band members and friends but people who are brought together for a common purpose. For its story it is a fairly tame film a good idea. Recommended.".

	schema:headline " Enjoyable and enlightening drama about the Japanese Music Industry...";
	schema:reviewBody "Kobayashi Takeshi's Bandage is a well made and very sobering drama that takes an unglamorous look at the Japanese music scene and shows us the hardships faced by a group of musicians as they struggle with balancing creative independence with the pressures of satisfying business and sales expectations. With its somewhat documentary film style it is an entertaining and engaging movie that surprises audiences with its candor and straightforward approach.Based on the novel Good Dreams by Chika Kan which was later adapted into a radio drama the story revolved around the exploits of a fictional Japanese indie rock band called Lands and their quest for stardom during the fall of Japan's Bubble Keiki during the 90s.Asako gravure idol Kitano Kii is an average Japanese high school student who wonders what to do with her life as her best friend Miharu model Anne daughter of Japanese actor Watanabe Ken tells her that she is dropping out of school to find her own destiny. Miharu tells Asako that she finds the courage to pursue her dreams from the lyrics of a song by an indie band called Lands. She hands Asako one of their CDs to listen to and goes off to work at a local CDDVD shop. A few months later Miharu invites Asako to come with her to go see Lands at one of their live concerts. After their concert the two sneak backstage with the hopes of meeting the band in person. When Asako loses her contact lenses she literally bumps into charismatic lead singer Natsu Takasugi KATTUN's Akanishi Jin who instantly falls for the overly polite and shy girl. Natsu invites Asako to the band's studio to watch them rehearse. There she meets the rest of the band which includes brooding keyboardist Ayumi Shimamoto Yuki daughter of actor Shima Toshio talented guitarist Yukiya Kora Kengo fey bassist Kenji Kasahara Hideyuki and easygoing drummer Ryuji real life musician and former RIZE member Kaneko Nobuaki. This unfortunately doesn't sit well with their stern manager Yukari herself a former rock band drummer the stunning actress and musician Ito Ayumi who threatens to quit after Natsu refuses to focus his complete attention on getting their next single out. Asako voluntarily agrees not to see Natsu again but when Yukari suddenly falls ill due to the stress of trying to meet the recording deadlines Natsu calls on Asako to help Yukari manage their group. Further conflicts arise when professional musicians Ayumi and Yukiya grow discontent with the direction of the band's music and complain about Natsu's narcissistic attitude towards the band's music. When Natsu's increasing disillusionment and selfdoubt about his talents threaten to end Land's career at the height of their successful first No. 1 Oricon single achievement can Asako help him to find his way back? Kobayashi's former background as a Music Producer definitely helps him with keeping the film realistic and grounding the storyline. Iwai Shunji's Hana  Alice All About Lily ChouChou Swallowtail  Butterfly screenplay adapts Chika's story quite well and it feels less like a melodramatic movie and more like a reality show.The title could be seen as a play on words Band Age playing upon the 90s decade in Japan as being a time in which many indie bands dominated the music scene in the hopes of being the Japanese Nirvana. The title could also be literal as Akanishi's Natsu character uses music as a bandage to heal his feelings of worthlessness and failure.The cast is great with Akanishi Jin's performance as a big surprise. I was never a big fan of JPop boyband KATTUN so I wasn't expecting much from him but he definitely has a screen presence that is engaging. Kitano Kii Gegege No Kitar Sennen Noroi Uta the Fuji TV series Life is adorably cute in this film. Her Asako character is somewhat annoyingly polite but she definitely shows a vulnerability and girlish charm. The gorgeous Ito Ayumi Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Swallowtail  Butterfly is wonderful as hardnosed manager Yukari. She makes for a stern controlled and confident manager and is a nice balance to Kitano's meek character. Anne also is very engaging as Asako's friend Miharu and does a pretty good job of singing in the film as well.The music for the film comprising of original songs by Akanishi director Kobayashi are very catchy and add to the atmosphere and feel of the film.There have been several similar films which covered similar ground such as GS Wonderland Linda Linda Linda and especially Nana but Bandage is the most somber of the bunch. This is not to say that the film ends on a depressing or sad note but rather takes a more nonchalant approach to ending the story. The films tells us that it is okay to fail so as long as we are true to ourselves and live life with no regrets.".

The plot revolves around a poprock band that think they are way more cool than they really are and have this idealistic perspective on how rock band should be. There are other movies with similar premise and direction except it's done better. This movie sort of reminded me of Twilight except it revolves around a band and not vampires which isn't necessarily a good thing. Because I was never a fan of the Twilight movies. It's like the director wanted to make a cool movie with a rock band and romance in it but it just didn't get my attention most of the way through. Few minutes of the beginning I thought the movie might have potential but was let down for the most part. I can see the direction it wants to go with a normal Japanese girl getting involved with a band somehow and see them go from underground to mainstream in japan. But it just doesn't really work because it isn't crafted very well the romance part isn't very well done because the connection between all the characters isn't all that believable. Especially between Natsu TakasugiJin Akanishi and Asako SuzukiKie Kitano there just isn't anything really distinguishable about her that leads the audience to believe why the character Natsu would fall for her. He just does and that is about it. This movie just didn't have the elements to get me excited or anything like that. The reason this movie is liked by some is because of the Twilight movie elements that are in this. I personally found this movie to be boring for the most part and disappointed cause it had the premise and style I enjoy in other films. The emotion in this is repetitive and not very believable either.410".

	schema:headline " unique serial killer film";
	schema:reviewBody "Written and directed by Yang Li Blind Shaft provides us with a fascinating twist on the serial killer scenario. In most such films the killer is usually relegated to the role of a shadowy antagonist whose basic function is to allow a brilliant investigator to outwit and outsmart him and bring him to justice in time for the closing credits. Not so in Blind Shaft. For here the killers themselves take center stage and there isn't a single law officer in sight to foil the plan or mitigate our fear about what is going to happen.Song and Yuan are two struggling Chinese laborers who've come upon an ingenious but grizzly scheme to make money. They befriend a stranger who is desperate for employment and convince him to come work with them in a nearby mine. All he has to do is agree to pass himself off as a relative of one of the two men. When they have their unsuspecting victim alone in the mine shaft Song and Yuan coldbloodedly murder him claiming that the death was the result of a mining accident. Eager to avoid a scandal the boss of the mine invariably pays a generous sum of money to the dead man's relatives whereupon Song and Yuan take their illgotten gains lure another man into their trap and head off to another mine to repeat the scenario.What separates Blind Shaft from so many American tales about serial killers is that Song and Yuan are not portrayed as writhing eyerolling handrubbing psychopaths devising elaborate schemes to torture their victims and antagonize the authorities. Rather these two killers approach their business in the most banal matteroffact i.e. businesslike way imaginable making them all that much more chilling and believable. We feel we really could encounter people like these in our own lives. Their acts of murder are no more extraordinary to them than folding their clothes ordering at a restaurant or consorting with local prostitutes. In fact the film spends far more of its time observing the mundane minutiae of their daytoday existence than detailing the mechanics of their crimes. To these two men killing is a means to survival much of the money they earn from their killings they send back to their own relatives and no moral or ethical code or twinge of compassion is allowed to stand in the way of ensuring that survival. And if it does It is their utter disregard for human life their indifference to the intrinsic value of the individual that make them and their story so discomfiting and disturbing. Yet even in this darkest of scenarios Li gives us a glimmer of hope. When the latest intended victim turns out to be a nave 16yearold lad looking for money so that he can resume his studies one of the killers begins to have second thoughts about what they have planned for him primarily because he himself has a son who is also a student. The film thus becomes a gripping and fascinating study of whether or not even the most amoral person has a line beyond which he will not cross. Yet what is most unsettling about the film is the way in which the two killers can treat their victim so humanely  they even insist on paying for a visit to a prostitute so that the boy won't die never having had sex  all the while knowing full well what they intend to do to him. What monster in any horror film could be scarier than that? Blind Shaft is not a thriller in the conventional sense of the term. It relies less on plot and more on observation as we follow this fascinating trio through the brothels and marketplaces of rural China seeing a world and a lifestyle wholly unfamiliar to most of us. Li remains utterly objective and detached as he records the doings  sometimes major sometimes trivial  of Song and Yuan as they go through their day. Stylistically the director brings an almost documentary feel to the story and by dedicating as much screen time to the trivial details as to the murder plot itself he conveys the sense of moral equivalence and bankruptcy that defines the characters' way of thinking. With no melodramatic background music to cheapen the suspense Li allows the horror to develop naturally out of a situation in which conscience and basic human compassion have been essentially drained. As we get to know this kid and as his two intended killers get to know him as well we can do little but watch helplessly as the elements of the plot move inexorably to their foregone conclusion. Through this approach Blind Shaft generates a kind of suspense that the typical slick Hollywood thriller can only dream of achieving.With brilliant performances from the three leads Li forces us to look into the darkness that often lurks in the heart of Man. It is a frightening but unforgettable vision.".

	schema:reviewBody "Song and Tang are two conmen who make their money through murder and deception.  They live among the unemployed drifters of China latch onto lonely young men convince them to pretend to be one of their relatives and then the three get a job together in a mine.  After a few days Song and Tang kill their companion and make it look like a cave in  extorting the bosses for compensation in return for silence.  They have been doing this for a while to good profit and plan to continue when they pick up the sixteen year old Yuan creating a moral crisis for Song.I was not sure what this film was about when I sat to watch it but the fact that it had been made as an underground film literally without the permission of the Government and that was enough reason for me to give it a bit of my time.  As one would expect from such a film the plot is a mix of narrative and comment.  The comment is delivered in the form of us seeing the working conditions and the poverty enjoyed' by the citizens who are outside of what we would consider the proper' economic system.  In this regard the film is interesting if not totally gripping.  The narrative is just as gripping but it is less satisfying as it seems to be secondary to the other aspects of the film.  The characters do just enough to carry the story along in fact they win over the audience well enough for us to care about all the main players  essential in a film that is driven more by them than by action.To that end the cast a mix of professionals and nonprofessionals deliver the goods pretty well.  Yuan's innocence and dedication to the characters is key to the film and Wang carries this off well.  The elder Wang is also good but has a simpler character to deliver  however it is to his credit that his bad' guy never lost my interest.  Li is the best thing in the film even if he goes through an fairly recognisable crisis of confidence.  Yang Li's documentary background shows through with the realistic direction and the great use of locations  all the more impressive as many of them must have been difficult to shoot in.However the lack of events means that the narrative is a little less than satisfying when it comes to the end.  We more or less know where it is going and the film uses the ending as much as a closure to the narrative as it is a further comment of the people's place within the system.  Despite this it is still worth seeing even if it may not match the hype that the awards and reviews on this page would have you believe.  Overall a good film that is worthy with good direction and acting even if the commentary of society and narrative don't sit as well together as one would hope.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although many disasters go unreported by mine operators afraid of prosecution annual deaths in China's coalmines are thought to exceed 10000. Only last week 166 miners were killed in a fire in the Chenjiashan Coal Mine in China's Shaanxi Province a disaster that came shortly after an earlier explosion in Central China in which 148 miners were killed. Local media reports suggest negligence and greed as the causes of the deadly fire at the Chenjiashan mine specifically by management's pursuit of a yearend bonus for extraproduction while failing to take the time to properly ventilate a shaft. Blind Shaft the savagely humorous first feature by Li Yang dramatizes conditions in China's mines making a direct attack on China's headlong dash to capitalism where greed seems more important than human life. Banned in China the film combines gritty realism with uncompromising social commentary.Adapted from a novel by Liu Qingbang itinerant coalminers Song Jinming Li Yixiang and Tang Zhaoyang Wang Shuangbao devise a scheme to extort money from corrupt mine owners by convincing a fellow worker to pose as their relative. When they kill him and fake an industrial accident they collect the compensation owed to a relative from the more than willing owner eager to prevent an investigation into his mine's deteriorating condition. Tang is older and more cynical. Song still has plans to live a good life that includes schooling for his teenage son and both dutifully send part of their blood money home to their family justifying their criminal behavior by saying China has a shortage of everything except people.Short of money Tang recruits a nave sixteenyear old boy Yuan Fengming Wang Baoqiang whom he spots queuing for work in a city square but their carefully laid out plans begin to show cracks. The boy reminds Song of his own son and he develops protective feelings for him. Yuan whose father may have been killed by the same scam artists is anxious to find any kind of work to earn enough money to enroll in school and attaches himself to Song who pretends that he is his uncle. The boy though a runaway out on his own does not have any street smarts and his innocence is a sharp contrast to the wily scam operators. In his spare time he reads History textbooks because they are interesting and spends his wages after wiring some home to buy the two conspirators a chicken completely unsuspecting what their intentions are.When the two find work in a nearby mine Tang is eager to get on with the business but Song keeps putting things off. The two plan to murder the boy but first want to make his last days a bit pleasurable introducing him to wine women and song. In a revealing scene at a bar Song offers to sing a song called Long live socialism but he is reminded that the words have now been changed to The reactionaries were never overcome. They came back with their US dollars liberating China. Suspense increases until the film turns in an unexpected but deeply rewarding direction. Blind Shaft won the Silver Bear at the 2003 Berlin Film Festival and has received almost unanimous critical praise in the West. It is one of the best films I've seen this year.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS   SPOILERS Two sequences hold the key to the Real of what Li Yang's debut is about. One is about the scene in which the prostitute who deflowers Feng pumps into him in a post office ambiguously greeting him by sliding her hand through his shoulder. When she walks away Feng turns his head over and looks at her backside with a bit sweet smile. In a screening session of the film in Beijing University Oct.2003 Li Yang is asked what his intention to incorporate this seemingly irrelevant sequence in the narrative. His answer is that his mode of film making is not Hollywood style  the transparent narrative which strictly follows causeandeffect lineage narrative. The second one is about the end in which Feng sees off Zhang and Wang at the site of a crematorium ambiguously watching their bodies being pushed into the furnace a MC shot of the foot when the body is pushed into the furnace followed by a MC shot of the black smoke.  Li Yang is criticized to make this scene rather redundant and sentimental.To me this end is the key to the Real of the diegetic reality which answers the first sequence in question as above mentioned. In fact there are mutual blind spots in the eyes of these two parties. If one looks at the depiction of Feng purely from the perspectives of Zhang and Wang Feng's pleasant reminiscence of his first sexual encounter with a whore is actually invincible to Zhang and Wang. Similarly one could find another blind spot in the eyes of Feng as well regarding the story of Zhang and Wang. The trust of Feng in Zhang and Wang is sustained until the moment Zhang hit the head of Wang. Although the audience is very clear about the motivation disclosed by the narrative's allknowing pointofview pov it is opaque to Feng. The final scene in the shaft if one follows strictly from the perspective of Feng logically would leave the impression on Feng that these two adults have some conflicts unknown to him and he accidentally witnesses the murder of Wang.Such a mutual misrecognition of course is presupposed by Li Yang from which the director's subjectivity emerges. It is true that the narrative presents a simple moral view of life that the evil will be finally punished. The allknowing pov like a spectre smoothly wondering around and showing every aspect of characters to the spectator plays an important role in leaving such a impression. The benefit of such a allknowing pov is that the director can create an illusion which satisfies the latent desire of the audience  bad guys must be punished. Scrutinizing the narrative closely one could find that the existence of the real law is suspended in the diegetic reality.Li Yang has emphasized Feng's innocence by depicting his love of reading historical books the responsibility for his family his sympathy to a child begging in the street and his respect for the adult. The forced choice to have a sex with a prostitute although is planned by Zhang and Wang is actually a contingent act in Feng's life as he does not know their intention. He most likely would think that they want him to pass a kind of ritual so he can be treated by them as an adult. Retrospectively it is discernible that Feng actually enjoys having a sex with a whore so he smiles later when he is alone in a bathtub.Therein resides the significance of a seemingly irrelevant sequence of Feng's rendezvous with the same prostitute in a postal office. Isn't Feng's ambiguous look at her walking off betrays his desire for her which no longer completely renders him shameful as before?  It is from this sequence that a kind of motion or the transference is set off in which the attitude of life from Zhang and Wang starts to be assimilated into Feng. Only with this implicit transference in mind can the significance of the end be discernible. If Feng's forced choice to have sex with a whore opens his vision of life as a kind of unexpected enlightenment by the reign of Eros then the diminish of Zhang and Wang's body into a black smoke corresponds to the reign of Thanatos God of Death. It is worth emphasizing that the Real of the narrative is that Feng has no idea about two adults' murderous plan yet the diegetic reality is that the moral lesson is still imposed by an accident which in fact is the displacement of the law with the FreudianLacanian notion of the Thing.The evaporation of these two adults' corpses in the end creates a void from which the Thing emerges just like the spectre of the first victim in the beginning returns as the allknowing pov. Therein resides the meaning of Feng's look at the black smoke as a witness of their death. He will be haunted by the spectre of the dead forever because the Real of their death is unknown to him. This blind spot is strictly from the perspective of Feng which is not in coincidence with the illusion created by allknowing pov of the narrative. It is discernible only by looking awry from the perspective of Feng and the gap between the Real and the diegetic reality is caused by what Freud designates as the death drive. Several film directors such as Hitchcock Kieslowski and David Lynch have passionate attachment to this gap  the death drive that resists the overlapping of the Real with the reality and now a Chinese director seems to be a potential one to join this club. More importantly Li Yang's insistence has appeared from acute social awareness of current problems of illegal coal mining in China which becomes the convincing and catchy backdrop of a fictive story.".

Several film directors such as Hitchcock Kieslowski and David Lynch have passionate attachment to this gap  the death drive that resists the overlapping of the Real with the reality and now a Chinese director seems to be a potential one to join this club. More importantly Li Yang's insistence has appeared from acute social awareness of current problems of illegal coal mining in China which becomes the convincing and catchy backdrop of a fictive story.";

	schema:headline " Evokes a stark picture of modern China";
	schema:reviewBody "What happened at the start of this movie down in the mine shaft confused me so much I had to go back to the scene and view it again. That really didn't help because it seemed that three menone very young another older perhaps in his early thirties and the third perhaps in his fortiesgo down into the coal mine and after working for a while take a break in the semidarkness. And then after some talk the two older men bludgeon the youngest to death.That in fact is what happened. Turns out that drifting miners Tang the older and Song have dreamed up a murderous scheme in which they recruit young men to go with them to work in the mines. They make the young man pretend that he is related to them. Then they kill him fake a cavein and demand hush money from the boss of the mine. We see this work one time and then the two men are off to the town to spend their illgotten lucre. And then it's back to recruitment and a new mine.Part of the logic of this premise is the fear of the mine operators that if there is an accident there will be an investigation and the mine will be closed down. So they pay hush money to the families of those killed to keep the authorities away. How realistic this is I have no idea. The scam certainly is a brutal bestial way to make a living that cannot go on for long.In the next part of the movie Tang and Song find a poor 16yearold country boy in the city who is looking for work. Director Li Yang carefully shows us a lot of interaction among the three as the next setup develops at a new coal mine. What makes all this so interesting are the glimpses we get of life in modern China the wretched dangerous coal mines the cities teeming with all their poverty and industry their hustles and indifference. The landscapes are not lush with greenery instead it is cold and bleak and the ground is mostly barren. This is not a travel log for tourists nor is this an ode to the communist state. What we see is a rural and agrarian society perverted by a forced industrialization.We see the housing for the miners. We see them at meal times and at play. We see what they eat and drink how they amuse themselves. We see the great dependence that China has on coal. There is a lot of coal in China and it is used for heating and cooking and for firing kilns and crematoriums. It runs the industrial state. Coal burns dirty and pollutes. Although Li Yang does not dwell on it or show us the poisonous clouds that hang over many Chinese cities we nonetheless get the picture.Perhaps the most evocative shot of all is the last one. A body with a blanket over it is shoved into the crematorium oven. The door is slammed shut the fires incinerate. The camera pans up up to the top of the smokestack and we see puffy tendrils of smoke emitting. That's it. Run the credits.The simplicity of the story starkly told and the lowbudget realism of the cinematography lend to this film a sense of truth and immediacy not found in more carefully contrived productions.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

It seems that 19th century industrialization has hit the post Mao era like a piledriver. It's not difficult to envision the riots and strikes to follow. While it's probably safe to assume the working conditions in Chinese industry have never been ideal adding nouveau capitalist elements of corruption greed and cynicism creates an even bleaker picture of a Chinese worker's future. It's a giant leap backwards for Chinese culture rendering the suffering and death of the prior giant leap forward particularly poignant in its wastefulness and futility. Yang Li is not slow to point this out as his protagonistsvillains sing cynically revised lyrics to old socialist songs. The very fact that these songs are now sung on a karaoke machine in a whorehouse and no longer sung in the village square by smiling schoolgirls waving flags says it all. The optimism and hope of the under class no matter how fragile or illfounded is dead.From the vantage point of a postindustrialist society this picture looks weirdly anachronistic and tragically assbackwards where the social reforms have already occurred Before the abuses of industrialization to no effect. It's too easy to see this as a morality tale from the comfort and security of western complacency. But I hesitate to pass judgment not having to scrabble for survival in a world with no recourse and where most of the checks and balances have been removed. Song and Tang are no better than they should be and certainly no worse than the mine bosses they con. Their tools for survival are no more civilized than dumb luck and 'enterprise' and knowing this they have discovered a clever way to exploit the system that is exploiting them. China has a shortage of everything except people is neither an apology nor a justification. It's a simple fact of life these people are worth more dead than alive. The casual matter of fact brutality of the murders including Tang's attack on Song underscore this. And if you are still not sure that little puff of smoke at the end is there to remind you.".

Seems like a sad story yet its plot progression is as taut a thriller and chilling as its straightforward dauntless depiction of the ugly the callous and the innocent. Amorality and moral strength is at play here  call it political concerns. There is no shyness to the telling of the story like it is. There is no fear that this film may not be for everyone NFE and that doses of entertainmentmerriment may not be enough for Hollywood standard. This is a very good film in spite of all the odds. Script was written with dramatic turns akin to basics of human nature be it circumstantial greed abandoned pleasure filial attachment or unabashed dreams.Lots of respect for all involved in the production of this film  not an easy one at that. Going deep down into the mines and photographing in utter pitch darkness is one tough challenge. Applause to the actors the crew all the assistance in the realization of this no ordinary film effort of a seemingly ordinary life of coal mine workers family members and the management. This film has such strength and poignancy that it felt like the result of a veteran filmmaker rather than a debut effort.Past films with coal mine workers theme John Sayles' Matewan 1987 with Chris Cooper and co. Richard Harris in Martin Ritt's The Molly Maguires 1970 a more modern day story with Pete Postlethwaite Tara Fitzgerald and Ewan McGregor in Mark Herman's Brassed Off 1996. Li Yang's Blind Shaft aka Mang Jing is by far an everyman account of how dark the situation can be or is. The film is in Mandarin with welltranslated English subtitles by Jonathan Noble. The fascinating study of human nature is fully embraced in the storytelling and the convincing performances of the three central characters Qiang Li and Shuangbao Wang as the ugly and callous pair of Song and Tang and Baoqiang Wang as the innocent teenage boy Yuan. It is a worthwhile 92 mins. Thanks to Kino International for distributing this rare film jointly produced by China Germany and Hong Kong. Other distributed foreign gems wd Im KwonTaek's Chihwaseon aka Painted Fire Korean 2002 wd Jeong Jaeeun's Take Care of My Cat Korean 2001 wd Michael Haneke's Code Unknown French 2000 with Juliette Binoche wd Wong KarWai's Happy Together Cantonese 1997 wd Julie Dash's Daughters of the Dust 1991.".

What's standout about this movie is the ACTING  some of the best particularly by the youngster that plays the young boy. He is super.

That's it.It's also marked by the absence of a soundtrack.BLIND SHAFT is a return to filmmaking of a Bressonian order but with actors not models as Bresson called them.

The mines are managed by bosses who do not want problems. So they have some kind of premium or contract for the casualties of accidents 30000 yuans per dead. The two miners who want to be rich as fast as possible kill the third one as soon as they can pocket the premium and run away to the next mine and the next escaping teenager. It is a simple business and yet it is not that simple. It is dark in the mines and you do not see very well. So one day circumstances will reshuffle the pack of cards. One of the two will be impatient and the two will end on the wrong side of some road of some dynamite. And guess who is going to get the money and the two urns with the ashes? The film is not interesting because of that because we more or less know what is going to happen. That kind of undertaker's job cannot last very long. What is interesting is the realistic vision of China's industrial and mining areas today. People have to move away from their families to find work. They have to pay for their schooling or the schooling of their children. They also have the opportunity to work whenever they want. Working conditions are hard. Living conditions are hard too. But It is not that long ago that we had the same situation in Europe and the present situation in China is what we had in Europe at the end of the 1950s or even beginning of the 1960s. It is only in 1968 that the situation really improved in France with a 13 average pay rise in May 1968. It is exactly what is happening in China this year with a minimum 20 hike on the minimum wage all over China and the more developed a province the higher the hike is. It may create some inflation. It may cause the yuan to go up slightly. It may make exports slightly more difficult. But the country is dynamic enough not to recapture in productivity what they lose in labor cost. They are catching up so fast that we may not even see them overtaking us. And that is the interest of this film. It does not show a bleak situation centering on exploitation the hardships and suffering of the working class. It centers on what the desire to catch up with wealth may produce in some minds even may make some become criminals. A society like this one that is growing as for their industry at a 13.9 rate may make some dizzy and envious and impatient to reach the object of their dream faster than honestly possible. An interesting film that shows China is also catching up in that industry too.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne University Paris 8 Saint Denis University Paris 12 Crteil CEGID".

Their downfall is precipitated by the arrival of young innocent Wang Baoqiang with whom the two men form a paternal alliance and whose impending death fills Qiang with dreadful foreboding.Either you like this kind of defiantly 'arthouse' stuff or you don't and this one gets off to an unpromising start by asking us to empathize with a couple of heartless monsters who not only murder a man in cold blood but use his death to line their own pockets before flushing his ashes down the toilet! But the movie picks up with the arrival of virginal Wang a genuinely charming kid whose naivety and innocence stirs feelings of compassion within the two protagonists leading to an ironic twist in the tale. Professionally assembled and shot on location in the heart of China's rural landscape this is much more naturalistic than the clinically beautiful films we're used to seeing from Chinese filmmakers. Not for all tastes but rewarding for those willing to stay the distance.Mandarin dialogue".

	schema:reviewBody "I knew literally nothing about this film going into it and I found its opening sequence  with the gritty cinematography the squalid almost alien setting the inky darkness of the mine and the sudden shock of violence  to be quite engaging and sinister even frightening. Unfortunately it soon became apparent that the film was to be none of those things. Mang jing might have made a great satiric or absurdist horror film  its concept is fascinating and macabre  but Yang Li's treatment of the idea is surprisingly bland. Oh it limps forward with subtlety and reasonably good taste but in the end it's barely memorable for any specific element. Even its politics which the promotional text oddly suggests is to be such a huge factor in the overall mix turns out to be rather tame and unremarkable. Disappointing really. 5.5 out of 10.".

The opening three minutes that leads to the movie title makes clear what kind of movie this is slowly we see a mine camp operation machinery miners with helmets slowly getting out of the shacks and entering the elevator shaft. As the elevator descends deep in the mine the camera is directed upward and the shaft opening with its sky becomes smaller and smaller as the elevator descends. At the same time the portion of the screen that is black becomes bigger and bigger. There is no background music just the noise of the mine elevator descending. Then two Chinese calligraphy characters appear in red. It's the title Blind Shaft.Many scenes of outdoor markets. Many scenes of society. Many scenes of migrant workers traveling looking finding work. Many scenes of workers sending remittances back to their villages now populated only by women grandmothers looking after children. All the men left the village looking for work it is quoted.A boy stands in the market holding a sign Admitted to high school. Need money to attend. People leave money in his can.Negotiations between people are constantly made about money about things wants and desires. Money is traded.

	schema:reviewBody "Tegami is about the struggles of Nao Yamada Takayuki whose brother Tamayama Tetsuji was convicted for murder. In an extremely civilized country like Japan only people with really twisted minds are considered to be capable of murder. This movie follows the obstacles and challenges Nao faces because he shares his blood with a murderer with help of a friend Yumiko Sawajiri Erika in the span of approximately 10 years. The title Tegami The Letters comes from the letters Nao and his brother exchange over these years.Yamada Takayuki and Tamayama Tetsuji's acting were extremely good in this film Tegami is worth watching just for Tamayama's scene in the very end. This movie is beautifully directed with perfect background music.Out of about 80 Japanese films I've seen so far Tegami has the best ending scene of all. I don't expect everyone to cry but your heart is frozen if it doesn't at least touch you especially if you understand Japanese. I personally got goosebumps as soon as Oda Kazumasa's timeless masterpiece Kotoba ni Dekinai started playing. This is a movie that deals with contemporary issues and problems in Japan. Definitely a mustwatch movie of 2006.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tegami is an interesting story about two brothers and their relationship. Naotaka Takeshima is the younger brother of Takashi Takeshima who is convicted of murder. While the murder was accidental Takashi kills an elderly woman and is caught and placed in jail. In this society just being related to a criminal is enough for people to convict you as well. This is exactly what Naotaka has to deal with in the film Tegami. Throughout the film we see how Naotaka gets judged and discriminated against in his work as well as his personal life. Tegami also explores the brotherly relationship between Naotoka and Takashi and the strains that incarceration can cause.Tegami brings up interesting social issues while also telling a captivating story. From start to finish there is always something worthwhile on the screen. The performances throughout are extremely well done. Every character seems to have a story to tell. In this film everything comes together so smoothly. Another interesting part of this movie is that the subtle attributes of the background music that is usually ignored in other films is so well placed that it enhances the mood and adds more depth to scenes. This is especially true in the last scene. The music enhances the mood that is created by the last scene and makes this scene more captivating to watch.While the film is a drama there is comedy placed throughout. While Naotaka is trying to salvage his life despite what might happen to his incarcerated brother Naotaka is also an aspiring standup comedian. The comedy is very subtle but is allows the break from the serious mood that would be overwhelming especially in the final scene.Overall this film is entertaining from start to finish. With enjoyable performances and a captivating story this makes this film a nice entertainment. Tegami allows for all kinds of audiences to enjoy it. The style of Tegami does not depend on the knowledge of Japanese style films instead it can be enjoyed by all audiences.".
