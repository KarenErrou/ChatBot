	schema:reviewBody "I just watched all three of these movies and I couldn't recommend the first two to anyone really. The first one might be enjoyed by some kids but the second was awful.This film was shot a year after part one with the same cast and it was held up in post production and a third film was made but the third film made was actually released second. The kids in this film came back two years later and did some reshoots and additional scenes and the boy who played Rocky actually has braces and is much taller as is the kid playing Colt.This movie isn't flawless by any means it has a very high cheese level to it a lot of over acting and silly gags aimed at kids. The movie got a PG13 rating because it had lots more ninja action and a few somewhat adult language bombs dropped but nothing a kid couldn't watch. I can't imagine older kids enjoying it but young kids would eat it up.As an adult I compared it to a Steven Seagal movie for kids with a touch of old Dukes of Hazard episodes thrown in. It had some great actors doing some not so great roles but it was fun to watch. Donal Logue was funny as one of the bad guys and Charles Napier is great in anything and makes a wonderful bad guy.The plot here was different and actually had a message which is good. It is a movie about bad guys dumping hazardous materials on an Indian reservation and the kids go in and try to put a stop to it.Fun film  I think if you like kids movies you should enjoy this one look over flaws and goofs and cheesiness and just watch it.The worst thing about this movie was the way the kids yelled AYAA every time they kicked or hit someone.".

The characteristic is funnysince in this waytooyoung kids can be introduced to classical martial arts movie plots. One of the first problems is that there is no official final boss unlike in the previous 3 ninjas movies making audiences feeling like something is missing. O once again the plot is not original but that was never meant to be the final goal. And probably this is what makes the film not completely enjoyable by older audiences. Despite the plot however the fight choreographs are the most amazing in the series but sometimes they get unnecessarily acrobaticlike the brawl in the Indian village. The fight with the motor bikers resembles at first the warehouse fight scene with Bruce lee's Lookalike in GAME OF DEATH but then it evolves and amazingly becomes something like a copy of the chase from ALTRIMENTI CI ARRABBIAMOWATCH OUT WE'RE MAD!with Terence Hill and Bud Spencer which is quite enjoyable. Another funny scene is the fight in the abandoned bar in which Rocky and Tum Tum change their fighing styles according to the goofy changes of music coming from a nearby jukebox. Unfortunateley this scene is too similar to the fight scene from PIU FORTE RAGAZZIALL THE WAY BOYS again with Bud Spencer and Terence Hill. The booby traps prepared by the kids are always a trademark of the series but once again the concept is not original. So almost nothing in this movie is original but since is a movie meant for kids it probably could not have been done better. Younger kids would enjoy this movie but older ones would be bored they will probably enjoy themselves more watching a traditional martial arts movie starring Jackie Chan. And in the end this episode was the perfect way to end the series since the final message concerns most of the main character's personality. However somebody decided to make another sequel in 1998...".

He took me to a place I would never go where the Eagles live and fly over beaver ponds through this Stuff even got hit in the face with branches. It was truly a wonderful trip to his special place. He had a fish on the line with in a minute I only got a hardy nibble fell backwards off a stump and laughed my butt off bruised but o.k. Better things are coming for us all. He glides over the ground like you have never seen anyone do and actually knows where he is going like he does not to begin with this man is full of mysteryit's amazing. Yes I finally met this him. He is how he is because that is how he has to be we all should respect who we areand never forget where we come from . We are all different and unique in our own way  we should never want to change but respect ourselves and others because we are all in this world together. There is just not enough Love as it is.

He had a fish on the line with in a minute I only got a hardy nibble fell backwards off a stump and laughed my butt off bruised but o.k. Better things are coming for us all. He glides over the ground like you have never seen anyone do and actually knows where he is going like he does not to begin with this man is full of mysteryit's amazing. Yes I finally met this him. He is how he is because that is how he has to be we all should respect who we areand never forget where we come from . We are all different and unique in our own way  we should never want to change but respect ourselves and others because we are all in this world together. There is just not enough Love as it is. Embrace your brothers and sisters  embrace this movie because there are worse out there too many to mention  but new things are coming. Feel the ground do you feel it shaking? feel your heart do you feel it beating? I am truly pleased he is my friend.";

If you listen to most of these people who have bashed it they loved it as kids. Your kids probably don't care and wouldn't know the difference. All of the 3 Ninjas films are enjoyable! Most of my friends think I'm too old to still like it. I'm 14 and I've watched them since I was five! They give you just the right amount of humor and action it'd be hard not to like it. Most of kids films are depicted as being corny the 3 Ninjas ones are pretty educational this one was about pollution which is an important thing you'd like to learn about. Besides that the movie was made on a low budget. The stunt people were hard to look like actually 12 year olds! I was really happy to see the original three come back.The dancing scene is corny but I bet everyone tried to learn it after they watched it! The grandpa getting bathed by the boys is a little disturbing but at least its only a few minutes long. 3 Ninjas Knuckle Up may be poorly written or REALLY crapply made but if you look past it its really much better than it seems.I lost interest in it when I was about 8 and I started liking barbies but just recently I picked one up from my library and watched it and I really like 3 Ninjas again!".

	schema:reviewBody "Brothers Rocky Colt and Tum Tum are travelling with their grandfather during summer holidays when they come across some sort of protest happening with Native Americans. They are protesting against a local businessman dumping toxic waste on their land but with the protest being violently dispersed by police and thugs the boys head into town to get pizza. However when those same thugs start picking on people in the local pizzeria the boys fight back and with new friend and cutie Jo get drawn into the fight against the battle for right.Despite the fact that I had watched the p1sspoor final film in the 3 Ninjas film series I found myself watching this one to see if there had ever been any merit in the series. Plus to be honest I did have a bit of a childish laugh about the fact that the title seemed to be suggesting that the boys would be entering puberty and perhaps be discovering the weird sensation of selflove for the first time well what else does the verb to knuckle up mean to you?. Anyway this comedy aside there is not a great deal of value within the film other than that which comes unintentionally. The plot is obvious of course but the delivery tries to be in the style of a live action cartoon. This approach at times makes for some amusing moments but mostly it falls flat because the material is not that good and the comedy is obvious and rather lacking invention or wit.One can imagine it working for young children but speaking as someone who used to run a Sunday school class for 34 year olds I have to ask whether or not I would want my kids watching this sort of material the answer is probably no. The action is silly and mostly fits in with the very obvious pratfalls that one would find in very basic silent comedy or children's television. I didn't find it exciting or funny and you can just feel the lack of heart or caring in the delivery. Indeed this is all through the film as it looks very cheap and is delivered with the minimum of effort. The direction is obvious and we get lots of comedy sound effects throughout as if to tell us to laugh.The cast is different from the film I say but they are no better. They can move and there is no doubt that they are agile but that is very different from being able to act which they can't. Treanor Slade and Power cannot deliver a line for toffee and even during the action I found their constant hiyah's to be endlessly annoying. Looking at them on IMDb I note with no surprise that few have viable careers now. Lightening plays the love interest and is no better than them  and IMDb puts a recent credit in her career as Scantily Clad Girl 2 which perhaps suggests that she has gotten no better with time. Napier hams it up but looks like Olivier when compared to the lacklustre Kilpatrick. Wong is badly served and not helped by the most obvious use of a stunt body I've seen since the Family Guy movie spoofed Stewie jumping through a window.Overall then those looking for entertainment will do best to chuckle about the suggested meaning in the rubbish title but not bother to check the movie out itself. The acting direction action and overall delivery is roundly poor and although the odd bit here and there is amusing there is little here that I would want my children to take as their entertainment.".

However comparing this movie to those two classics would be a great injustice to Mr. Lucas and Mr. Coppola.I saw the first one as a nineyear old kid and perhaps seeing this one eight years later detracted from me taking interest in the film but nonetheless  this film is bad.Eightyfive minutes of nonstop ninja action they're not exaggerating when they say that put together to form a weak plot. The Bruce Lee movies which I am not really a fan of at least have a sense of class in the way they show the martial arts as well . . . an art! This is just pure violence. The film is obviously meant to be a flick for teenage girls with overactive hormones to come drool over Treanor and Slade now 16 and 15 in this movie I believe as they kick the living daylights out of everyone they meet.This movie isn't entirely bad. The plot does try to tie in some interesting topics about Native American culture however the inaccuracies and stereotypical portrayal of the culture detracts from admiring this aspect of the movie too. Another good aspect is that I guess the moral of the story is humility but it's hard to pick that up with all the bad motorbike guys flying all over the place getting their butts kicked by some five foot ninja.In the end this is an incoherent trashy unwatchable film that plays at a much lower level than the original. Perhaps now that I'm 17 I should watch the original again and wonder why I liked it in the first place. Perhaps it was learning the lessons of obedience patience and of course getting a good laugh or two out of it. But nonetheless this is not a trilogy worthy of sitting next to the Star Wars Godfather or even the Ninja Turtles Trilogy for that matter!Best of luck to Treanor Slade and Power. I do hope that they may land roles in the future that don't require them to jump up in the air make a 360 and kick a massive biker guy who weighs at least 200 pounds heavier than them in the face and knock him out cold.3 out of 10 . . . The last time I went that low was Starship Troopers it got a 1! Yikes!!".

Every fight scene is so bad it's not even explainable. Is that a word?I've seen some bad films in my day but this is one of the worst ever. I'm not exaggerating. In one fight scene a kid actor  who coincidentally can't act  kicks a guy. He bends over with a comical look on his face as if he's saying Ouch! That hurt! I wonder why! I better think about it and give this kid the opportunity to do it again in the meantime! and then the kid hands him a pizza tray don't ask punches him again then kicks him. The guy pushes himself backwards and does a double flip poor stuntmen  it's obvious they're using their own force to accomplish the task then lands on a table.It's like POWER RANGERS only performed by kids. In very dangerous situations mind you. E.g. at the end a bunch of ruthless crooks with guns are chasing the kids and they keep outrunning and punching them.This is a bad idea to put in kids' minds. You can beat up grownups with guns  just throw a few punches!Let me tell you what really would have happened.Crook No. 1 would have whipped out his Uzi and taken down all three kids as they were running down the street like hyperactive morons.I can't even DESCRIBE the awfulness of this movie. You honestly have to see it for yourself. It's that bad.It's almost as bad as POD PEOPLE.And get this Rated PG13 for nonstop ninja action.Nonstop ninja action. Wow. I guess this movie IS responsible for one thing  proving that the MPAA can even manage to poke fun at movies. For nonstop ninja action. I'm still laughing over that one.15".

Now watching this one the dreaded sequel I find its not aimed at anyone. Yea there's kids jumping and yelling and throwing kicks and punches any 4 year old could master and they were up against idiots and so called ninjas and it was just hilarious.This one didn't even seem to have anything. The first one entertained kids but this sequel was just like a bad episode of the power rangers or something...They replaced Rocky and Tum Tum from the first movie which was fine by me The kid playing Tum Tum was way better. I heard this movie was made long after the 3rd part but released first so I don't know the details.I recommend if you must allow your kids to watch these kind of movies get the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or Karate Kid or even if you must have 3 Ninjas choose the first part over this one because this movie sucks.".

The change took a while to set in since I was still used to seeing the former actors who portrayed the respective roles from the first film. Reprising the role of Colt is Max Elliot Slade.One of the issues seen on the film was letting the kids find themselves. That was interesting to watch since it gave more depth on the kids' parents and their wishes for their sons.Watching this next film gave a little wider field for the brothers. We see them now preoccupied with baseball and Colt's apparent difficulties in throwing the shuriken. But with practice and confidence he can apply what he has learned in ninja trainingin baseball as well. I loved it when they made home run. Max somersaulting to the home base was a nice touch. Fantastic! The brothers also met Miyo Caroline Junko King the winner of the ninja competition where she refined the brothers' ninja skills during their brief stay in Japan and at the same time they in turn help her with her baseball catching technique having failed to enter in the previous tryouts.All in all Colt controls his anger while Miyo perfects in catching the ball at the baseball match and the brothers' team wins.".

They were one of the finest screen teams of the 30s.In a way the plot is like RED DUST on the high seas. Gable is again in charge of a location and the leader of men including a crew of Asians. Harlow is again the woman of easy virtue with a heart of gold. Rosalind Russell in an entertaining turn as Sybil Gable's long ago love is a comedic and decidedly more classy dame who captures Captain Gaskill's attention and who incites China Doll's jealousy. Wallace Beery who worked with both Harlow and Gable in THE SECRET SIX and with Harlow in the 1933 classic DINNER AT EIGHT is enjoyably slick and subtly shady as Jamesy. But it is the chemistry between Harlow and Gable that really holds this movie together. They obviously had great respect and liking for one another and this only cemented their working relationship onscreen. My favorite lines one spoken by China Doll When I want you to sound off Golden Bells I'll pull your rope! The other by Gaskill with that unmistakable Gable grin And as a man said when they were about to hang him 'This will be a lesson to me.'  It's a gem and don't pass it up.".

Lewis Stone sterling character actor only achieved permanent stardom when he inherited the role of Judge Hardy from Lionel Barrymore and he would remain the perfect wise father to Mickey Rooney in a dozen films. As for Barrymore while he had a higher degree of stardom than Stone he fell nicely into a niche as the original Dr. Leonard Gilespie opposite Lew Ayres as Dr. Kildare.In 1932 MGM got the bright idea of making a dramatic film of Vicki Baum's Grand Hotel with an all star cast John and Lionel Barrymore Greta Garbo Joan Crawford Wallace Beery Lewis Stone Jean Hersholt and Tully Marshall. The film won the best picture Oscar so it became a standard for other MGM projects to copy.

This movie is very well acted. I've always said that if you give Gable an affectation to fall back on he does extremely well. Here he's a barking sea captain which almost by accident gives his performance a better range than it otherwise would have. I don't really like Harlow but she's good in her role.The editing is a bit strange  many closeups are too obviously added in later but I guess I can partially forgive this because of the time it was made. It really shows how Harlow was on a roll when she was with the rest of the cast though. Because these individual shots do not fit in with the movie at all.There's some amazing effects during the typhoon sequence with a steam engine running loose on the deck  and you actually see people get run over and flattened. It's disconcerting even though you realize the camera tricks involved. Very inventive for its day.".

This is the last of Jean's true brassy platinum blonde roles. For the short time she had left in her regrettably too brief career she softened her look and her roles were heading to the more ladylike end of the spectrum for instance Wife vs. Secretary. Rosalind Russell is just starting out here too stuck in one of what she referred to as her Lady Mary roles full of good diction and the graaaand manner her great flair for comedy wouldn't be tapped for several years she's fine but knowing what she's capable of she feels constrained. The rest of the cast is terrific with Wally Beery and Robert Benchley standing out in full bodied characterizations. Keep in mind that this was made in the 30's so racism and sexism are on full display in a very casual way.".

Like most chairs this film is no classic like Citizen Kane or Gone With The Wind but it's exciting with charismatic leads like Clark Gable and Jean Harlow. The chemistry between the two is gripping even if a lot of their encounters in this movie are rather repetitious of the I love you but I shouldn't variety. One can see why Gable and Harlow were cast together at every opportunity MGM had from Red Dust onward. The other supporting actors are quite good especially Wallace Beery as a slippery villain. While Robert Benchley is quite amusing his drunk act starts getting really old after a while. Also it's quite sobering to realize that Benchley would die in 1945 from the effects of longterm alcoholism. In sum despite some unhappy reminders of Hollywood's racism of times past this is a fine film that probably served as one source of inspiration for Spielberg's Indiana Jones series of films in the 1980s.".

One can see why Gable and Harlow were cast together at every opportunity MGM had from Red Dust onward. The other supporting actors are quite good especially Wallace Beery as a slippery villain. While Robert Benchley is quite amusing his drunk act starts getting really old after a while. Also it's quite sobering to realize that Benchley would die in 1945 from the effects of longterm alcoholism. In sum despite some unhappy reminders of Hollywood's racism of times past this is a fine film that probably served as one source of inspiration for Spielberg's Indiana Jones series of films in the 1980s.";

What's wild about this film is that both Gable and Harlow are supposed to be English but do not even attempt to adopt an accent. In Gable's case he figured the public accepted him in Mutiny on the Bounty so why not. In any case the part called for a rough and tough adventurer and that certainly did fit Gable.Harlow's a girl who's been around the block a few times and she's crazy about Gable. But Gable takes her for granted and he's now pursuing a cultured widow of a friend in Rosalind Russell. That doesn't sit too well with Harlow so she goes after China trader Wallace Beery who's always had a yen for her. The problem is that Beery is hooked up with Malay pirates a nasty bunch if there ever was. They're looking to steal some gold bullion that Gable's transporting on this voyage. What happens is the rest of the story.This was one of Rosalind Russell's earliest roles and once again there's little trace of the fine comedic actress she became. She worked with Gable again in They Met in Bombay and the results there were excellent. Here she's being a mannered version of Myrna Loy. MGM did that a lot had back up players in case stars became hard to handle. In this case that's what they envisioned Russell as at this time. She does well in a part gets more out of the role than I'm sure was originally intended.Actually my favorite in China Seas is Lewis Stone. He's a former captain himself who was beached for cowardice. Gable signs him on as a third officer and Stone makes himself a human bomb and martyrs himself to save the ship. It's a touching and tragic performance.Russell in her memoirs says that at this time she was not terribly friendly with the MGM star roster while she was an up and coming player in the ranks. One exception she did mention was Jean Harlow who she describes as warm friendly and helpful. Not that the two would have been up for the same kind of parts but I got the feeling Russell felt Harlow was a genuinely nice person.The stars and the supporting cast fill out the roles they are normally type cast in.

Beery is one of the passengers but unknown to everyone he's also the leader of the pirates!! Harlow is Clark's exgirlfriend. Just how close she and Clark were is a bit vague though it is implied they were more than just boyfriendgirlfriend. However an old flame Russell comes aboard and Clark quickly dumps Harlow in favor of her because Russell isn't a loudmouthed skankplus she is pretty sophisticated with her British accent. Here is an odd bit of casting because we then hear that Clark too is British but he made no attempt at an accent and sounded about as British as the Frito Bandito or Yogi Berra!! But despite this the writing is pretty good and the acting topnotch so it can easily be ignored.Unfortunately what cannot be ignored is the end of the film. It just made absolutely no sense at all. While Harlow was a foulmouthed tramp who actually HELPED the pirates Clark unexpectedly dumps Russell at the end even though she's a standup dame great lingo huh?! It seems that the ONLY reason they ended the film that way was because Harlow was by far a bigger star compared to Russell and they just couldn't let Clark end the film without Harlow. Plus in so many many many ways this film is RED DUST PART II. Both feature the pair in Southeast Asia both had a back story where Gable and Harlow were strongly implied to be more than just friends and both had Gable fall for a sophisticated lady yet end up with Harlow in the end of the film!".

	schema:reviewBody "This film has some good things going for it. First a cast of MGM's finest  Clark Gable Jean Harlow Wallace Beery Rosalind Russel Robert Benchley among others. Gable is the skipper of a somewhat battered passenger liner in Asiatic waters. Harlow is the girl he's been associated with so to speak a little tainted as Gable puts it. But who the hell is HE to talk? He comes aboard just before sailing filthy and unshaven hung over. He barks out orders to the crew and to just about everyone else. Rosalind Russel is an old flame from London and her husband has died so she is now available. Wallace Beery is a likable big lug who gambles and drinks but is in cahoots with some pirates who take over the ship just after the big hurricane hits. Benchley is thrown in as a harmless drunk given to wisecracks and non sequiturs only one of which about his being a chess master is truly funny.Second there is the set dressing by Cedric Gibbons. Love it. Everything is painted white. The crummy little ship has a saloon the size of Madison Square Garden. This is one of those films in which all the men dress in white suits and wear pith helmets. The women's garb is more nearly traditional. Rosalind Russell has an English accent and an equally hoitytoity wardrobe. Harlow is dressed in slinky gowns that seem to glow in the dark and she eschews brassieres.There are some slambang special effects during the hurricane. And a great scene in which the Malay pirates take over the ship and torture Gable to get him to squeal about where the gold is hidden. Oh NO! Not the Malay BOOT! Tell them where the gold is. I can't stand to witness this! That's Wallace Beery who hasn't been outed as a traitor yet in mock anguish over the torture Gable is about to undergo. It seems that we're all set up for another rousing funny exotic adventure movie along the lines of Gunga Din except that the script keeps undercutting the lightheartedness with serious sometimes rather insightful dialog. Example Harlow is jealous of Russell and at the captain's dinner table she has a couple of drinks and starts shouting lewd and suggestive remarks. Russell You must be very fond of him. Harlow Whaddaya mean? Russell To humiliate yourself like this. There are a lot of ways Russell's punch line could have been delivered  angrily with bitchiness for instance but Russell's tone and expression convey empathy and sadness. Gable too is given some sober thoughtful exchanges but acts as if he can't quite bring himself to believe what he's saying as if he'd prefer the careless roughhewn character that first appeared on the screen kind of like his character in Red Dust. It's an above average flick for its genre though. All that whiteness is almost blinding.".

Harlow doesn't like it and teams up with a crooked officer Wallace Beery who has cut a deal with some villainous pirates. This role required Harlow to be a semitrashy blond bombshell which fits her platinum blond persona but she could do characters of a higher class when required  see 'Wife and Secretary' with Gable and Myrna Loy Spoilers below Remember though the Hayes production code was now being enforced which meant that Beery and Harlow could not profit from their crime.So the good guys win in the end but Gable says he will stick with his pretty formerconsort Harloweven marry herbut first she must face the justice system for her role in an attempted theft. I doubt the original story ended that way but the Code demanded that villains NOT prosper from their nefarious deeds  so Harlow will face prison for 3 to 5 I guess. If made in 1932 that film would have ended with Gable suppressing the role Harlow played and marrying her the same day in a local church!Contrast this to 'Dinner at 8' made only a few years earlier with Harlow and Wallace Beery. Two at least of the female major players are guilty of indiscretions but escape unscathed.China seas was a pleasant surprise and featured a brutal storm at sea done with tons of water and wind machines no FX in those days..Recommended. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Only shame drives me to write this comment because I otherwise don't feel to be expert enough to completely grasp the whole impact this film had. There is little pride in being the first person to write about this great film in IMDb. No one ever wrote anything about Hans Hass here. I still can't believe it! Adventures in the Red Sea is of course an old film and since it is in black and white too many people don't think much about it. We are so used to perfect closeups of any underwater creature even from the deep sea in glorious color. So who gives a damn about a black and white documentary with unknown people done around 1950 about the underwater world of the Red Sea? Well I do! And for many reasons too. Because this very film marked the beginning of professional underwater photography and studies before JacquesYves Cousteau became a household name. The creator of the film made many inventions to be able to make it. His name is Hans Hass.The son of a Viennese lawyer he was drawn to the sea early on in his life. He shot the very first scenes with sharks and people in the same frame and therefore became quite famous in Germany. He was especially drawn to sharks and to this day tries to change their bad image.Before the war he and two friends went on a trip to Venezuela to explore the underwater wildlife. When he got back the war had already broken out but with his photos and a short film about his diving experiences with sharks he became a hero in NaziGermany. Since he had a certain health condition which made it impossible for him to march for long periods he was not drafted and but free to study and explore. During WWII he even managed to get funding from the NS Government to make an expedition in the Aegean Sea.After the war he wanted to make bigger expeditions and he dreamed of diving with his camera in the Red Sea which was notorious for its amount of sharks but also famous for its variety of any creatures. He tried to get money for an expedition by selling the idea of making a feature length film about the whole trip. Since this was never done before the conservative Austrian film companies were reluctant to invest. When he got the green light to do it he had to fulfill one important wish of the distributor. There had to be a girl in the picture! Hass was not very eager to hire a girl for the film but he had no choice. Secretly he thought he would do a few scenes with someone in safe water and keep the real action reserved for him and his pals. But at that time unknown to him he already had someone waiting to fill in this role just standing behind him.A few months before he had an ad in the newspapers for a secretary. Many girls applied because Hans Hass was a teenage idol with very good looks. His adventures reported and illustrated in a book he wrote had been a hit with boys and girls alike.Lotte Bayerl was one of them and when she read the ad she immediately dreamed of swimming with Hass and the others in the open sea. This was her main reason to apply for the job. When she got it she started to take diving lessons in a public bath without telling Hass.While Hass balked at the outrageous idea of taking a girl with him on such a dangerous adventure the head of distribution looked at Hass' secretary and said Why don't you take her with you? What Hass did not know was the she was made of the same kind of wood as he was and she not only got on the boat but made also sure that the film became such a big success. She was quite a beauty and as daredevil as all the others and Hass tried in vain to restrict her to do only harmless scenes. She wanted to prove the she also could swim with sharks and she did! Afterwards she wrote a very entertaining and touching book on her experiences that became a bestseller. I have read this book while a teenager myself several times.Needless to say that Hans Hass soon fell in love with her and the married after the film came out. They became a very famous couple working together ever since. Hass turned 90 this year and Lotte is still by his side.The film looking at it today has his flaws. I don't want to deny this. The forced upon storyline is sometimes very crude no wonder none of them was a professional filmmaker or an actor or actress. The dialog and the narration too tell how innocent they all were practically in every respect.But on the other hand many scenes are spectacular even today! You could see how daredevil they all have been and after so many years you still want to cry out to them and warn them when they just jump into the water when a giant shark appears. Their words and looks and little acting have such a charm and radiate their excitement so you easily forgive them all the shortcomings.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK. I guess some explanation from native Russian who enjoyed this movie as a kid among millions and still enjoys it a required...  First of all some facts  This movie is a really considered to be CLASSICS believe it or not. And it has a lot of awards. That's why it was rereleased on tape in USA.  There was NO computer effects available back in 1964. Comparing to fairy movies made worldwide at the same era the FX is OK.  The plot may seem pretty strange but hey look at Alice In Wonderland for example White Rabbit Mad Hatter Caterpillar on a mushroom smoking something like pot MockTurtle a kingdom of playing cards constant size changes etc  all in one single tale. Now back to the movie. There's two main lines in the plot. The first one is about a smart handsome guy Ivan who was too egocentric so Mushroom Pixie just punished cursed him turning him in halfbear. After the guy did repent he turned into a human again. The second one is a Cinderellatype story which I guess appears in all ethnic tales worldwide. So the plot is pretty clear  both heroes has to overcome the negative obstacles and then they get the reward and get married.Now about the weird' stuff. It's all common to Russian fairy tales. Jack Frost usually plays to roles in a fairy tale  as an analog of Santa and also as an impersonation of a Winter itself. A kind of a pagan lesser god. Pagan heritage is very strong in a Russian folk tales. The Witch  Baba Yaga also has some dualism in fairy tale. Sometimes she's just typical evil witch sometimes just an unpredictable witch who can help the hero for some reasons.Oh and a House On The Birds' Legs is her certain attribute.Another important note  the entire movie has a grotesque aesthetics. First of all it's in a Russian folk tradition than it's a movie for kids so all the villains just must be ugly and funny at the same time. Sorry but politically correct tale will be just boring.So for an average Russian kid it's just a very impressive funny movie with a lot of action. Where the Evil is punished and all the Good get a reward.".

I think thats also the problem with understanding the people of America simply dont have this part of culture because it comes directly from the medieval age.The story has its roots so far away so deep in the Slav history that if Hollywood would like to make something comparable theyd have to steal the story from some ancient native American tribe.".

Of course it is but check these really old German French or English tales and legends. I wonder what youd say to the original Brothers Grimm collection. I think thats also the problem with understanding the people of America simply dont have this part of culture because it comes directly from the medieval age.The story has its roots so far away so deep in the Slav history that if Hollywood would like to make something comparable theyd have to steal the story from some ancient native American tribe.";

	schema:headline " MST3K mocked Hamlet too you know...";
	schema:reviewBody "First as many of the folks who have reviewed this movie have seen it on Mystery Science Theater I'd like to make an important point about the MST3K version of this film and MST3K itself.Like many other reviewers I too saw this movie on MST3K. MST3K was a brilliant series intelligent and well executed. Most of the movies that were featured on the show were films that would otherwise never have been watched by future generations. The fact that they were chosen for the express purpose of being mocked unfortunately has created a sort of conundrum for fans of the show and the show itself.What a lot of folks don't understand I think is that the people who worked on MST3K were movie fans plain and simple. They were fans of cinema in general bad AND good. Now bad versus good is not a binary system there is a certain quality of film that makes it so bad it's good. Then of course there are the movies that are simply bad. However the fact that a movie is inflicted on the residents of the Satellite of Love does not in and of itself make the movie a bad one of either variety. This is an issue that plagues many of the reviews on this site of movies featured on the show and frankly it bewilders me.It seems that many MST3K fans or casual viewers are completely unable to separate their own perceptions and opinions of the movies featured there from the idea that simply due to the fact that those movies were mocked by MST3K they are bad movies. While a good many reviewers are able to make this distinction and form their own opinions about MST3K featured movies for some reason the brilliance of this remarkable beautifully shot Russian folk tale has completely evaded them too.Quite a few of the movies shown on MST were foreign films where certain cultural elements were sure to go over the heads of most Americans. But I don't think that is the case here. Americans are quite capable of watching movies that aren't CGI laden or realistic I'm glad that some folks made reference to The Wizard of Oz when reviewing this movie because that was the first thing that came to mind while watching it. I just think that many of them have formed blocks in their minds against this particular film for two reasons One as I said above simply due to the fact that it was featured on MST and two to be perfectly frank because it is a Russian production.Americans have a peculiar relationship with Russia many of us who grew up during the Cold War or during the Reagan years a slightly warmer but no less tense version of the Cold War were fed massive amounts of antiRussian propaganda taught using the spectre of nuclear holocaust to fear and hate. However not all Americans have allowed themselves to be brainwashed by such doctrine despite appearances many of us are able to distinguish fact from fiction and look back through American history only to find it full of xenophobic hysteria covering many ethnicities and nationalities. We recognise that Russia was just another victim of this country's strange need to establish a political villain in the form of another country or ethnicity see the Middle East.This mentality is at least part of the reason why I think Jack Frost Morozko has resulted in such oddly scathing reviews. Despite its consistently beautiful photography fascinating characters all of whom as in every single American or Americanized fairyfolk tale are caricaturesthe Handsome Prince the Wicked StepmotherStepsister The Fairy GodmotherGodfather etc. the reviewers of this movie seem unable to do two things separate their own opinions from the fact that the film was featured on MST and overcome their prejudices and recognise that if nothing else this movie proves that every culture has something in common with ours.If this movie doesn't demonstrate that fact to you I don't know what will. Look past the dubbing and the babushkas and you'll find an amalgam of tales that Americans have heard all their lives. Of course the fact of the matter is that American literature has adapted these classic folk tales from other cultures and passed them off as our own. Nonetheless these tales are staples of American culture. Morozko is many of those stories Cinderella Sleeping Beauty among others rolled into one fascinating movie. Personally I found this movie even more interesting than the American tales which ironically have borrowed from it so freely.I've read reviews for almost every movie that MST3K ever featured and see the same thing over and over againso many reviewers refuse to view the movie on its own merits and instead allow the admittedly brilliant and hilarious comments of JoelMike  the bots to form their opinions for them. I've enjoyed many of the movies I've seen on MST on their own merits and this is one of them. I just wish more MST3K fans would do as the very writers and producers of the show themselves did and allow themselves to love the very movies that they mock.".

Sure it seems to be pure weirdsville from a modern Western perspective but that's part of it's charm. This was based on old Russian lore  folktales and retains the odd  sometimes morbid elements of Old World folk  fairy tales.True this was shown on MST3K which usually pokes fun at bad or ridiculous movies. However this is not a bad movie just one that comes off a bit wacky to those not familiar with the conventions of old fantasy folk tales  mythology. It was nonetheless a hilarious episode but the movie itself is very enjoyable on its own.It's a whimsical magical story with lots of bright colors  plenty of humor much of it hilariously slapstick. To outsiders it has elements of Cinderella Sleeping Beauty with a healthy dose of Yuletide in the PreChristian sense.There are some seriously silly moments too...This movie's take on Baba Yaga The folkloric Eastern European cannibalistic old witch...dubbed the 'Hunchback Fairy' in the 'Jack Frost' version which is pretty dorky is a scream! I swear she looks  reminds me so much of Witchiepoo from H.R. Pufnstuf...she's just so wacky! Her army of anthropomorphic trees are just as silly and 'Pufnstuf'like...as is her house with bird legs from the actual Baba Yaga folklore.Of course there's the classic fairytale romance involving an absolutely angelic young gal and an exuberant young man whom must overcome his proud conceited braggart ways. There's Morozko Mr. Jack Frost himself. He is the embodiment of Winter as well as a sort of Santa Claus type figure. You have the nasty stepmother  stepsister and the kindly but diminutive and totally spineless  kowtowed father. There's Baba Yaga  a bunch of goofy gnomelike bandits. Then there's Father Mushroom...whose a class all his own.I think folks are hard on this movie. It's unusual but it's not Gigli or Plan 9 From Outer Space material. It's a strange to modern  western perspective whimsical bit of Old Worldliness. If you dig Old World folk tale stuff with magic whimsy comical cannibal witches evil stepfamily members Old Man Winter bandits a fairytale romance  a funny little mushroom guy this flick is for you! Just enjoy a bit of culture turn off your leftbrain grab some popcorn relax  just enjoy the show.And CHEEZELOUISE...If an American like myself can enjoy  appreciate it on its own merits and not just because MST3K riffed it to hilarious effect so can you. There's more to planet Earth than a certain 236 year old 50 state country. C'mon! THINK BIG!".

	schema:reviewBody "I was quite surprised reading all those comments... I never thought people could be so incredibly ignorant...This movie IS sweet  naive but that's the point! The plot is full of Russian folklore elements which most of people here call surrealism... Every Russian kid knows about this surreal house on legs  Father Frost which is analogical to santa by the way. The plot is very simple  understandable  the only circumstances that one can't understand the plot is when one doesn't know Russian or on the other hand the most complicated plot he's ever seen is legally blonde...which is of course a pity. I've watched this movie many times as a kid  it's a sweet legend recommended in case your kid is smart enough to understand a plot which is a bit more complex then porn movies.I wonder how would those who criticized this film comment on old Grimm's books without seeing Disney's version which is in most of the cases far very very far from the original.Also i would like to reply all those who complained about the lousy special effects what did you expect? Matrix? The film was shot in '64! And for a '64 USSR kids movie it's great! So all of those who weren't smart enough for this movie should find out more about other cultures. The world is not just one big McDonald's. Thank god.I gave it 9 out of 10. just for a better rating.".

And I was shocked to see how western people didn't understand it. I don't know what's wrong with it. First it really uses grotesque. That woman who used a clownlike makeup... Isn't it clear that it's a parody? A parody to the fact of toomanymakeup to attract a man for example. Next Nastenka story is similar to Cinderella and it's worldwide tradition I think. And the Father frost is a mythological person who comes to new year night with gifts for children. Consider him a Santaalike because we all think that this hero is a russian analog of western Santa tales. Consider this to be a christmas story 8 Oh so what's not clear in this movie? It's a tale for children about a girl and a young man who had their mistakes suffered won over willains married and lived long and happy. Remember all worldtradition tales when a hero who was too selfish get turned into an animal or something by a magician or witch or whatever to punish him? And remember all these Cinderellalike stories about a girl treatened by her sisters and evil relatives and who get married with a prince in the end? This story isn't different what's wrong with it? I don't believe the differences in our cultures are so big!... Don't blame it try to understand if you can. And remember it's 1964 movie and it's a TALE and it's for children and thousands and millions of russian children have seen it and didn't get crazy after it 8".

	schema:reviewBody "As a nonSovietBritish in fact who loves fantasy and folktales and is studying Russian as part of her music degree Morozko is a very charming and misunderstood film. Like Sadko Sampo and Ilya Murometsall three from Aleksandr Ptushko it's a beautiful if flawed film that was bastardised by its American version where the sense of wonder in the original version was not as effective and some aspects irritate. In some way it's easy to see why those outside Russia and the Soviet union and who saw the American version would dislike it but for this viewer it is without a doubt one of the better films featured on MST3K. The original version is not without imperfections the special effects are not that great rather rushed and dated in look and some of the acting is overtheatrical and annoyingly unsubtlethough still better than the dubbing in the American version. The photography is nicely done this said and the costumes and sets are colourful and quite wondrous very fairytalefolktalelike in atmosphere. The music score sweeps and enchants with some eerie moments as well in feel and sound it does a great job at sounding very authentic and nationalistic. The story has elements of Baba Yaga Cinderella Snow White Hansel and Gretel and Sleeping Beauty without blatantly ripping them off. Even with the elements of bizarre weirdness though that shouldn't be a deterrent a fair few Russian folktales personally read or seen have that but there is a real sense of charm and wonderment while the humour is splendidly ironic. The characters are archetypes but are mostly engaging Nastenka is pretty and adorable. In conclusion a very nice and misunderstood film. But the Soviet vs. American war seen in the user reviews has got to stop it is really unpleasant to read and a lot of the positive reviews who are bashing Nationalities are potentially offensive. It is very unfair to infer that Americans have bad taste as wellon the most part that's an untruth it's not their fault that they most likely saw Morozko through MST3K and its dub that in no way does justice to the original and sadly a lot of those praising the film and being condescending to those outside of their nationality fail to realise that. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Rome Adventure is the ultimate romance for all of us incurably romantic souls. Beautifully filmed on location it's another fine example of Delmer Daves' sensitivity and craftsmanship as a director. If the dialogue is at times arch it matters little when played out with the conviction that Troy Donahue and Suzanne Pleshette bring to their roles. Watch them during the scene in the horsedrawn carriage as they exchange those small gestures to indicate their attraction to each other  was romance ever better expressed in a film?You either like Troy Donahue or you don't. I happen to think he's very convincing in Rome Adventure as a young man in love. With his warm speaking voice he has a nice way of minimizing the embarrassing aspects of the script and he appears totally committed in his scenes to the act of listening as well as speaking. He exudes an aura of integrity. I believe these are the qualities that made Donahue a heartthrob  quite apart from his good looks.The other actors don't arouse such strong feelings in an audience either for or against so suffice it to say they are all excellent and that Suzanne Pleshette is even better than that!The working title for Rome Adventure was Lovers Must Learn. Watch this movie and you may learn a thing or two about the fine art of love.".

	onyx:emotionText "Rome Adventure is the ultimate romance for all of us incurably romantic souls. Beautifully filmed on location it's another fine example of Delmer Daves' sensitivity and craftsmanship as a director. If the dialogue is at times arch it matters little when played out with the conviction that Troy Donahue and Suzanne Pleshette bring to their roles. Watch them during the scene in the horsedrawn carriage as they exchange those small gestures to indicate their attraction to each other  was romance ever better expressed in a film?You either like Troy Donahue or you don't. I happen to think he's very convincing in Rome Adventure as a young man in love. With his warm speaking voice he has a nice way of minimizing the embarrassing aspects of the script and he appears totally committed in his scenes to the act of listening as well as speaking. He exudes an aura of integrity. I believe these are the qualities that made Donahue a heartthrob  quite apart from his good looks.The other actors don't arouse such strong feelings in an audience either for or against so suffice it to say they are all excellent and that Suzanne Pleshette is even better than that!The working title for Rome Adventure was Lovers Must Learn. Watch this movie and you may learn a thing or two about the fine art of love.";

It was refreshing to see a movie where two people actually attempt to be discreet in front of other people about their possible sexual activity. Not even considering morality it just shows a little taste. That part may be considered oldfashioned by some but the problem Prudence is wrestling with is one relevant today. She does want to be a grown sensual adult but she doesn't want to go down the road that will lead to cynicism. How can you be sure how far to commit yourself because if you make too many wrong choices it really does become like shaking hands and what fun is that?".

	schema:headline " As travelogue glorious as story  eh";
	schema:reviewBody "There is a time for most people when as children they become aware. It's the time when suddenly the world opens up and you see yourself fitting in. Things you took for granted or never noticed over night become worth investigating. You become aware of not only your surroundings but the time in which you find yourself. Just like that things get emblazoned on your brain like never before. For me that happened in 1960. It has always been a special year. It was the year I discovered girls. It was the year art had new meaning for me. It was the year I learned to type and it was the year I realized movies would be a part of my life forever.When I watch films from 1960 they bring back that connection to becoming aware. They aren't all my favorite films but it doesn't matter. When I see pretty much any film from the early 60s I get a jolt. Even if I've never seen the film before movies that were made in the early 1960s somehow trigger a response. It's a combination of the hair styles the fashion automobiles the film stock and lighting use of that time the cast acting and scoring style. Films from 1960 through about 1962 have this in spades including Rome Adventure.Suzanne Pleshette and Troy Donohue just radiate early 60s like nobody's business as does Max Steiner's score the cinemascope cinematography and the dialog. Even watching the credits in combo with Steiner's music swept me back to that era. In this regard the film was a joy to watch. It's very romantic but you know that going in. Having said that essentially Rome Adventure is a travelogue romance and pretty much nothing more. I enjoyed it but I can't say it was very good. Though it has some of the same cast members it doesn't hold a candle to Delmer Daves' previous film Summer Place. It's no where near as well written and quite shallow by comparison. The visual symbolism the candelabra for example representing Donohue's integrity was more than heavyhanded. I wonder what most women today would think of the scene where Donohue tells Pleshette that women's role on Earth is to be the anchor for the man? I can understand the meaning behind the thought but in todays PC environment the way it was handled in the big love scene at the climax is totally chauvinistic. It comes down to script. It could have been written in a way that suggested Donohue was talking about just he and Pleshette themselves but the grand gesture of suggesting that the notion that all women were put on earth as the anchors for men is a cage many people men and women would bristle at. And the use of Al Hirt gives new meaning to the term shoehorned in.I really enjoy Suzanne Pleshette in most things I've seen her in. She ended up being cast often as the world weary but intelligent woman who harbors an old love. This is exactly the character she plays in Hitchock's The Birds losing out to Tippi Hedren for Rod Taylor's love. Pleshette's small role is still one of the most remarkably welldeveloped of any secondary character in all of Hitch's films. When Rod Taylor discovers what has happened to her during a bird attack it's a powerfully emotional moment. Amazing how much sympathy she created for herself with so little screen time. Pleshette in Rome Adventure doesn't start out playing the world weary woman she became in later films but she sort of becomes one as the film progresses. Of course the ending pretty much disregards that concept of her character but it's there nonetheless. Troy Donohue who gave a very good and believable performance in Summer Place is pretty wooden here. He's actually the film's greatest flaw which I find hard to understand. He had the same director and writer as Summer Place yet Donohue just doesn't connect. There is little chemistry between he and Pleshette certainly no fire like he had with Sandra Dee. The real star of Rome Adventure is Italy. It was photographed to look quaint and romantic but the choice of locations the time of day and consideration of lighting were all beautifully realized. The film has many similarities to another film from that same year which also gives me that early 60s jolt Light in the Piazza. Rozzano Brazzi who stars in Rome Adventure was also in Piazza playing a similar character. In the case of Piazza however he's after the mother played by Olivia deHavilland. Piazza also stars ingnue of the day Yvette Mimieux and up and coming heart throb George Hamilton. Hamilton plays an intrinsically happy Italian who falls in love with Mimieux' childlike character. Piazza is much more successful as a Euro romance than Rome Adventure because its plot takes some truly unexpected turns. Rome Adventure unfortunately telegraphs all its surprises along the way.Yet in spite of all this I found there was a lot to enjoy and I think it's even a film worth revisiting on occasion if nothing more than to give me another early 60s jolt but to also reexperience that idyllic world of Rome the filmmakers created.".

It could have been written in a way that suggested Donohue was talking about just he and Pleshette themselves but the grand gesture of suggesting that the notion that all women were put on earth as the anchors for men is a cage many people men and women would bristle at. And the use of Al Hirt gives new meaning to the term shoehorned in.I really enjoy Suzanne Pleshette in most things I've seen her in. She ended up being cast often as the world weary but intelligent woman who harbors an old love. This is exactly the character she plays in Hitchock's The Birds losing out to Tippi Hedren for Rod Taylor's love. Pleshette's small role is still one of the most remarkably welldeveloped of any secondary character in all of Hitch's films. When Rod Taylor discovers what has happened to her during a bird attack it's a powerfully emotional moment. Amazing how much sympathy she created for herself with so little screen time. Pleshette in Rome Adventure doesn't start out playing the world weary woman she became in later films but she sort of becomes one as the film progresses. Of course the ending pretty much disregards that concept of her character but it's there nonetheless. Troy Donohue who gave a very good and believable performance in Summer Place is pretty wooden here. He's actually the film's greatest flaw which I find hard to understand. He had the same director and writer as Summer Place yet Donohue just doesn't connect. There is little chemistry between he and Pleshette certainly no fire like he had with Sandra Dee. The real star of Rome Adventure is Italy. It was photographed to look quaint and romantic but the choice of locations the time of day and consideration of lighting were all beautifully realized. The film has many similarities to another film from that same year which also gives me that early 60s jolt Light in the Piazza. Rozzano Brazzi who stars in Rome Adventure was also in Piazza playing a similar character. In the case of Piazza however he's after the mother played by Olivia deHavilland. Piazza also stars ingnue of the day Yvette Mimieux and up and coming heart throb George Hamilton. Hamilton plays an intrinsically happy Italian who falls in love with Mimieux' childlike character. Piazza is much more successful as a Euro romance than Rome Adventure because its plot takes some truly unexpected turns. Rome Adventure unfortunately telegraphs all its surprises along the way.Yet in spite of all this I found there was a lot to enjoy and I think it's even a film worth revisiting on occasion if nothing more than to give me another early 60s jolt but to also reexperience that idyllic world of Rome the filmmakers created.";

Bombs bullets and babes oh yeah... Yet I turned on the TV one night and this film was just starting so I watched it. I was mesmerized until the end. The scenery is great and although I'm not usually too fond of Max Steiner's musical scores he outdid himself here with a lush hypnotic atmosphere. And oh what I would give to have an experience like this! I mean c'mon guys wouldn't you love to have a thing going with a babe like Suzanne Pleshette especially in such awesome settings? If not you must be a total meathead.To me the only thing that is weak in this movie is the title which they could have made a little more interesting. But still it says it all and I think that this has got to be one of the most romantic movies ever made. It's never syrupy or sappy. It was made before my time but 1962 was a good year for it to be released. People did not yet dress like slobs every day. The old sexual stuffiness was loosening up and the anything goes Sexual Revolution had not yet steamrolled everything. In my opinion the power of life exists when real committed love and uninhibited sexual desire are united in balance. I felt that in this movie.".

Eighty percent of the film is Troy Donahue and Suzanne Pleshette riding around Rome on a motor scooter while the camera pans all the historical sights in Rome. I have never learned so much about Rome all rolled up into one film!!! Troy Donahue who was at the peak of his career in soap operas when this film was made gives another super soaperdoaper heart throb performance. Donahue was riding high with soapers like Imitation of Life Parrish Susan Slade and A Summer Place......the following year he was another hearthrob in the light headed Palm Springs Weekend with Stephanie Powers. In Rome Adventure Donahue is a student mired in Rome in a love mixup with the lovely Angie Dickinson and a young very young Suzanne Pleshette. Who does he like better...sort of hard to figure at points in the film....Donahue runs around the entire film chasing both women. Rosanno Brazzi plays a very suave Italian gentlemen who is of wealth in Rome and tries to fall in love with Pleshette but he appears to be many years older than her.....it just wont work with a 20 year age difference!!! Substance wise this film did not give Brazzi the actor appeal he showed in South Pacific......in that film he was the hearthrob.....the famous Al Di La song rang out throughout the whole film and was a record hit in the US in 1962 from the movie soundtrack. All in all this film is a soaper special......teenage and young girls no doubt flocked to the theaters to see Donahue in 62 at the height of his career. Angie Dickinson had second fiddle in this film and you wonder how she liked playing second fiddle to Pleshette. The venerable Constance Ford who usually plays a mother from hell is top notch as the owner of a book store in Rome where Pleshette gets a job....she was always a Delmer Daves favorite for his soap operas. Check out her voracious aggressive dog..... This is a film that Warren Beatty probably could have played at the time too.....he and Donahue were top Hollywood hearthrobs at this time in the early 60s.....however Beatty usually chose much more complex characters with mixed emotions like in Splendor in the Grass and All Fall Down.......as for Rome Adventure cook up some popcorn and relax to a nice little love story from the early 60s when romance was more on the sweet side.".

The message is clear these two lovebirds will work it out.As a warning to young girls we are shown the downside of experience namely Angie trapped by a Howard Hughes type control freak. Bottom line It's OK they're engaged. Enjoy the midcentury eye candy.";

I thought it was the fluffy counterpart to the other Delmer Daves movies eg Summer Place etc. A romantic travelogue silly movie. I was surprised. Yes it's dated beyond belief with the sole focus of Suzanne Pleshette being a good girl or a bad girl  the same lament as Sandra Dee and the other juvenile leads of the time. And yes surprisingly there's dialogue that sounds like it's written by men ABOUT women and speaking FOR women  such as characters like Angie Dickenson who has claws and feminine wiles and a later thematic scene between Pleshette and Brazzi when we learn that the primary role of woman is to ultimate support and encourage her man. But putting aside the obvious dated content I found a lot of richness and soul in acting and direction that surprised me. Suzanne Pleshette's inner warmth and intelligence infuse her performance beyond the boundaries of this kind of material. She never became a big film star not sure why but this performance her first lead was very impressive in transmitting her aura intact to the audience. Troy Donahue would never win an acting Oscar but he has two redeeming qualities or maybe three he is so beautiful to look at that you soak up his beauty with every shot as a treat in itself he has an innate sincerity that even if he isn't Laurence Olivier still gives his screen presence grounded and appeal and he's just a big ol' movie star with charisma that makes you want to watch him. Constance Ford is always fabulous. And the scenery was a pleasure and the tour of Italy was more substantive and less filler than usual for these movies. I appreciated the narrative of some of the sights. Of course all of us watching this movie really enjoy the debonair longdisappeared dressingup from skirts and heels to daytime suits and nighttime gowns and tuxes. I'm glad we don't have to dress like that  I enjoy wearing shorts and flipflops  but it's wonderful and wistfully nostalgic to see. The one negative for me was Angie Dickinson. I thought her innate intelligence and warmth was also palpable like Suzanne Pleshette so I was impressed in that sense. But her character was written so caricaturishly as a viper and shallow that it diminished the overall quality of the film since it was the single plot device beyond boy meets girl falls in love with girl has a falling out with girl and reteems with girl. Angie's part was the plot device and the weak link in an otherwise pretty enjoyable film.".

So when Warner Brothers 47 years after finally released the DVD set of 4 including Palm Springs Weekend with Donahue and Stevens once again together this year in January it's a wonderful feeling expecting to hear Al Hirt and AlDiLa being sung all over again. One might deduce this is more of a 'girly' favorite movie.The word 'Adventure' in the film title is more of the 'adventure' of the heart or hearts. 'Rome' is the perfect location chosen for Lovers Must Learn indeed. Max Steiner's music undoubtedly gave the movie the lush and elegant touches binding the story segments together most melodically. Director Delmer Daves wrote the screenplay based on Irving Fineman's a Jewish American scholar novel and once again showed his masterful hand at romance classics including dashes of humor and smiles from the dialog exchanges. The inferences to Prudence Bell's 'cultural' hangups upbringing restraints are not entirely confined to American girls. But you are special Don reassured Prue. Don also needed lessons on his frustrating heartaches over Lyda glamorously portrayed by Angie Dickinson.

Besides the famous musical South Pacific watch Brazzi also in director Jean Negulesco's 1954 Three Coins in the Fountain and David Lean's 1955 Summertime romancing Katharine Hepburn in Venice. Interwoven are conversational pieces around capillary attraction physics of raindrops Etruscan archeology Rosetta stone even a brief recital from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.Rome Adventure is very much a travelogue in itself you get to see many famous spots of Rome. Could very well be a good one to familiarize the city of Rome before Ron Howard's Angels and Demons with Tom Hanks opening in May 2009. For the ultimate soap drama see Delmer Daves' 1961 Parrish. Noticed Hampton Fancher played Albert Stillwell rather well quite a departure from seeing him as the irresponsible spoiled brat Edgar Raike in Parrish also opposite Troy Donahue. Constance Ford as Daisy Porter of the book shop with Mr. McGinnis the shaggy dog also played the mother to Sandra Dee's character in Dave's 1959 A Summer Place. The song AlDiLa sung by Emilio Pericolli in the film can be heard at 003611 mark thirtysix minutes into the movie at the dinner restaurant with Prue and Don. He explained 'AlDiLa' as Far far away. Beyond the beyond. Beyond this world. That's how much he loves her in the song. ROME ADVENTURE is a rich not at all fluffy romance drama worth enjoying and to reminisce.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some of my fondest of memories as a child was sitting in the library and immersing myself into the Ligne Claire reality of George Remi's The Adventures Of Tintin. They had such a timeless quality and vision about them just like the period in which they were set. The colors were so vibrant and illustrations were clearly defined. Herge's Illustrations themselves defined a new standard of a comic 'universal language' that spoke more words than any bubble text that was added on. You knew who the bad guys the good guys and the stereotypes were. You knew when characters were nervous angry happy confident stupid clumsy and surprised. You even knew when they were sweating! The attention to emotion and narration was brilliant. While reading his albums 24 in total I felt like I was in a movie. The characters were all strange mysterious suspicious and one dimensional except for the protagonist Tintin and the world was as simple as black and whitegood and evil. The stories were always bizarre but world weary and highly adventurous at the same time. I couldn't stop reading them. Not once was I aware I was reading a comic book. The pace builds momentum and doesn't stop. Herge's greatest gift was his ability to effortlessly make a transition in mood and tone. His illustrations evoke shades of FilmNoir when they're serious 'Charlie Chaplin' absurdity when they're comical and a 'Sherlock HolmesArsene Lupin' mystery inspired approach in their narrative. It is the combination of these three key genres that made Tintin and all the films books and comics it inspired so special. One of the earliest of these was perhaps the greatest of these L'Homme de Rio That Man From Rio a Jean Paul Belmondo vehicle hugely influenced by Herge's The Broken Ear with subtle footnotes to The Calculus Affair The Seven Crystal Balls and The Secret Of The Unicorn.When I came upon That Man From Rio I was searching the world over for adventure films. Actually my obsession all began with Indiana Jones. I wanted to find films that inspired the trilogy. I knew that Indy was a homage  a kudos to all the adventure serials filmnoirs pulp fiction novels and adventure comics of the 1930s 40s and 50s one of them was obviously Tintin. I came upon many. It is said that The Secret Of The Incas starring Charlton Heston was Indy's blueprint but although the film did possess all that which inspired the look and character of Indy it didn't quite inspire the feel and ambiance of it. Indiana Jones had that vintage high adventure atmosphere to it that I instantly recognized in Herge's bibliography  the same charm comedy mystery suspense pace and thirst for adventure. These were all qualities that ignited the child in all of us. But surely due to Tintin's international acclaim and success a franchise that sold over 200 million copies and translated into 60 languages there must have been at least one film that captured it's narrative style between its very conception in the late 30s and the creation of Indiana Jones in the 80s. For 50 years in between there must have been somebody who loved Tintin as much as I and decided to do something about it. I came to the harrowing conclusion that nobody in America up until the likes of Steven Spielberg had ever made a movie in the footsteps of Herge. Either it didn't reach a wide enough audience in America or Hollywood was too embroiled in the Cold War to be concerned with a good old fashioned adventure. So I looked to France and Belgium where for almost 70 years and at least 4 generations later Tintin has stood the test of time and is as popular inspiring and loved TODAY as it ever was. I was reminded of something I always knew  that the French have always been the romantics and the lovers of adventure and mystery. The novels by Jules Verne Maurice Leblanc and Alexander Dumas The diaries documentaries and books by marine explorer Jacques Costeau The suspense master works of Henri Georges Clouzot AND The enduring comic book creations of E.P. Jacobs Albert Uderzo and Herge have fascinated generations of nations all around the world to this very day. It is in this way that I found out about this beautiful film called That Man From Rio. I don't want to even spoil an action scene let alone a plot point because everything about this film is kinetic energy. It never stops. The action is larger than life. The story is larger than life. The romance is every man's fantasy. To even whisper it's similarity to Tintin would be blasphemous but you will recognize them as the film takes you for a ride and it will put a smile on your face. 'Jean Paul Belmondo' is and was especially in his prime France's most enduring and popular actor and it doesn't surprise me why. His ability for comedy and action has inspired actors such as Jackie Chan in their careers. He's always jumping running falling riding racing shooting punching kicking yelling laughing and clinging for his life and no film better utilizes his gift than this one. The scenario he is put in will remind you of Hitchcock's North By Northwest as he travels the world in pursuit of a girl he loves dearly. From start to finish you are on a rollercoaster hearing the sounds and seeing the sights. It's fantastic and truly a perfectly crafted vintage adventure film. If there was a mediator between Herge's Tintin and Spielberg's Indiana Jones look no further than Philippe de Broca's That Man From Rio. Its fluid ability to manipulate its audience with suspense drama comedy and action is brilliant. You will never see anything coming! If you are similar to me in that you love your adventure film find this film right now and watch it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Some of my fondest of memories as a child was sitting in the library and immersing myself into the Ligne Claire reality of George Remi's The Adventures Of Tintin. They had such a timeless quality and vision about them just like the period in which they were set. The colors were so vibrant and illustrations were clearly defined. Herge's Illustrations themselves defined a new standard of a comic 'universal language' that spoke more words than any bubble text that was added on. You knew who the bad guys the good guys and the stereotypes were. You knew when characters were nervous angry happy confident stupid clumsy and surprised. You even knew when they were sweating! The attention to emotion and narration was brilliant. While reading his albums 24 in total I felt like I was in a movie. The characters were all strange mysterious suspicious and one dimensional except for the protagonist Tintin and the world was as simple as black and whitegood and evil. The stories were always bizarre but world weary and highly adventurous at the same time. I couldn't stop reading them. Not once was I aware I was reading a comic book. The pace builds momentum and doesn't stop. Herge's greatest gift was his ability to effortlessly make a transition in mood and tone. His illustrations evoke shades of FilmNoir when they're serious 'Charlie Chaplin' absurdity when they're comical and a 'Sherlock HolmesArsene Lupin' mystery inspired approach in their narrative.

You would have to be clinically depressed not to give this movie the highest rating.  Of course TMFR uses raucous flamboyant genuine heartthumping stunts by real actors rather than the alwaysphonylookingcomputergenerated special effects of today's movies.  And it has a real plot so it doesn't need the Fword or gratuitous nudity and sex to arouse one's interest.  It has a magical innocence and imaginative style so that you would be comfortable watching this movie with youngsters or your grandmother  it is enjoyable for all ages.  That alone probably accounts for the aforementioned low scores.  But TMFR received unanimously rave reviews and ran forever when it was released a. 1964 a rare thing for a foreign film in the US and it still stands up today to comparison with any other movie of its genre.  I don't think a better roadadventure movie has ever been made and I have been going to movies since about 1945.  Certainly no one makes movies of this calibre today. TMFR has everything  it's fresh exciting romantic bright and original.  It's beautifully produced directed scored and photographed. If I lived to be 100 I could not find one negative or hedging thing to say about it. It has an exceptionally attractive and able cast  including the people of Brazil  and takes viewers on a whirlwind adventure the likes of which will never be seen again because this movie was filmed just at the moment Brazil was becoming modern.  Its natural beauty and energy were not yet spoiled with polluted beaches and touristspewing jets.  Everything was shot on location  it's the real thing  from the streets and museums of sophisticated Paris to the lush exotic locales of Brazil and back again to Paris.  The kaleidoscopic roller coaster of adventure in Brazil takes you from the hotels beaches and slums of Rio which provide the setting for one of the movie's most enchanting interludes to the emerging capital city of Brasilia the city was being built on cleared land at the time this movie was filmed which DeBroca makes brilliant use of. Then there's a surrealistic road trip along a scenic coastal highway the Pan American? and a roughandtumble trip down the expansive Amazon on a gambling riverboat replete with wicked women and riverrat outlaws.  Not to mention a mad scramble through the junglerain forest.  TMFR stars JeanPaul Belmondo as a rakishbutdecent young soldier on leave who is hopelessly in love with the beautiful redhaired sister of Catherine Deneuve and the dark and dashing Adolfo Celi. The music is melodic and intoxicating.  Just writing this makes we want to see TMFR again and I plan to this weekend.  I guarantee you too will fall in love with That Man From Rio.".

There's also a timelessness which helps to make it a genuine classic of the genre. Plus the wonderful supporting cast many nonactors most likely who give Rio an instant appeal like no other movie I've ever seen.Let's hope it eventually appears on DVD.".

Although I watched it with subtitles it didn't feel tiresome at all. I have a little bit of understanding of Fench but not enough to keep my self from looking at the captions. Its a great watch and anyone who values good entertainment and I don't mean the sort of pretentious arthouse crap that I enjoy but really good natured sincere storyline and great filming. Its so well done that it barely feels tacky or overworked. It doesn't even seem like a 60's film. The stunts were some of the best and realistic ones I have seen in a film to date. All the Hollywood junk feels so artificial and contrived compared to That man from Rio. I would watch this over going to the movies to watch the latest Mission Impossible or Harry Potter any day.".

Then  dangerous happenings ensue and things go awry .A fun as well as extravangant adventure full of action  farce  tongue in cheek  and a lot of thrills .

Belmondo is finely accompanied by the gorgeous Francoise Dorleac who unfortunately  a bit later on  she died by car accident  along with two notorious secondaries  Jean Servais and Adolfo Celi. It was heavily influenced by the comic books  by the famous Belgian cartoonist Herge  in fact  there are certain visuals and images as the museum robbing and the Amazon sculptures that are all clearly inspired by Georges Remi's work .It contains an agreeable and atmospheric musical score by the prestigious Georges Deleure  as well as an evocative cinematography  shot in Brazil locations as Rio De Janeiro  Amazons and Brasilia with its monumental buildings  newly built by Le Corbusier . This engaging adventure spoof well produced by Alexander Mnouchkine and was professionally directed by Philippe DeBroca  though  nowadays  it results to be some dated . He directed some good films  most of them comedies  action and adventures  such as Cartouche  The king of hearts  Oldest profession  Le Cavaleur  Jupiter's thigh  The green house  Louisiana .

The film hits the ground running and does not let up for breath as Belmondo swims flies runs drives and parachutes his way all over Brazil. He battles faceless goons barroom brawlers poison darts and a even an alligator. There's undeniable chemistry between the two leads and the clever dialog is hilarious. Georges Delerue catchy music helps a lot and the supporting cast is great Jean Servais Adolfo Celi Simone Renant. Ubiracy De Oliveira plays Sir Winston a clever shoeshine boy who gets Belmondo out of more than one scrape.".

Seen today some viewers might wonder why there was so much fuss about it. Don't get me wrong it isn't a bad movie. JeanPaul Belmondo makes a fairly engaging hero with what he's given performing comedy and action with a lot of enthusiasm including performing his own stunts. Belmondo's spark helps to make a lot of the comedy amusing and the action exciting. The Brazilian backdrop is colorful as well. I just wish there had been more work on the script when it came to the characters and the story. Belmondo's character is engaging but kind of thin  we know hardly a thing about him before he is thrust into saving his girlfriend. The relationship he has with his girlfriend is quite unconvincing  she is kind of aloof and selfish and it's hard to see what each sees in the other. Storywise there are a number of slow spots here and there where little to nothing is happening. And the climax though not awful seems to be lacking significant punch I was expecting something bigger and wilder. Those who have an interest in 1960s European genre cinema will probably enjoy this best. Since I'm one of those people I did find the movie worth my time. Other people however I would give a word of caution. This is a movie that really is a matter of taste.".

Good luck with that Gutman. Bogart is excellent playing a character he was totally at home playing wisecracking tough guy ladies' man. Greenstreet is villainous as ever and perfect at it. Just as in Maltese Falcon Mary Astor is playing a stunning beauty that makes heads turn. Just like in Maltese Falcon she doesn't match the character description. Perhaps Huston had a bit of a crush. Otherwise I don't get her being cast in these types of parts at a time when the likes of Ingrid Bergman and Lana Turner were around. Still despite that element of the casting being off Astor does fine.This movie has an interesting backstory. It was originally to be about a Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor but when that actually happened in real life they changed it to Panama. They never changed the title though despite the movie taking place nowhere near the Pacific. Then John Huston got called to serve before filming was complete so Vincent Sherman had to step in. Oddly it seems Huston was the only one who knew how the movie was supposed to end so Sherman had to make up the final fifteen minutes or so of the movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "A good spy caper starring Humphrey Bogart as Rick Leland a courtmartialled US Army officer who finds himself in the middle of a nifty little bit of espionage work on board a Japanese freighter bound from Halifax to Yokohama via the Panama Canal just before the attack on Pearl Harbour. Surrounded by a rather suspicious group of characters from his love interest Alberta Marlow Mary Astor to Dr. Lorenz Sydney Greenstreet Leland slowly uncovers a Japanese plot to attack the Canal Zone presumably also on December 7 and sets himself to preventing it.This was a good performance by Bogart along with good performances from Astor and Greenstreet. For those not entirely familiar with Canadian geography by the way the pun is that Alberta claims to be from Medicine Hat which is a small city in Alberta  almost TOO cute! There's a fair amount of tension throughout as we struggle along with Leland to figure out exactly what's going on and a nice climax as Leland foils the Japanese plan Bogey had to win! A couple of things I thought were worth noting though. First of all what's with the title? All the action in the movie takes place either on the Japanese freighter as it travels south down the ATLANTIC coast of North America or in the Panama Canal Zone with some minor scenes in Halifax where Leland is rejected by the Canadian Army and in New York City where he snoops for information. The only Pacific connection to the movie is that the freighter was Japanese. And remember of course that this was made in 1942 after Pearl Harbour. The depiction of the Japanese isn't especially flattering although I thought it was more a play on stereotypes than openly antagonistic and the closing shot of the film is the wartime requisite showing off of American military strength.All in all though I enjoyed this movie immensely and would highly recommend it.810".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is okay  watchable and even interesting  but one can't help comparing it to The Maltese Falcon which appeared the previous year. Same principle actors  Bogart Mary Astor Sidney Greenstreet  no Peter Lorre fondling the handle of his cane alas and no gunsel  and for the most part the same Director John Huston. Huston was called up for Signal Corps duty halfway through filming and as a gag shot the scenes up to the point at which Bogart was strapped helplessly into a chair and surrounded by armed guards a situation seemingly without the possibility of escape. Then Huston cheerfully said goodbye and walked off the set leaving his replacement Vincent Sherman to try to figure out how to get Bogart free. It may be unfair to compare Across the Pacific to a lucky shot like The Maltese Falcon but this film invites the comparison. Not just the same performers but similar lines  You're good Angel very very good. But in Falcon the actors fit their fictional characters like enzymes accommodating themselves to a substrate. Here they are just actors playing familiar roles the obese villain the officer who's dishonorable discharge is faked so he can go undercover Gary Cooper could have done as well and in fact DID in a later movie the innocent woman made to look bad because the enemy has imprisoned her dissolute father. The Japanese are all plainvanilla bad guys even the familiar young one who makes amusing wisecracks in American slang. And all the Japanese have real names like Tong Chan Loo Fong and Ahn. To be fair the last one is Korean not Chinese. If the characters are not nearly as much fun to watch as in The Maltese Falcon the plot is no more than a simple wartime mystery involving secret information that the Japanese want to use to start the war by torpedoing the locks of the Panama Canal. Actually the Japanese did develop such plans later in the war. They intended to deliver a handful of torpedo planes to the vicinity of the Canal in huge submarines which were available. The planes were not and the plans folded when the war ended. In the movie the characters move from New York to Canada then board a Japanese steamer back to New York then to Panama where they disembark. They travel from the Atlantic side of the canal to the Pacific  but they never make it across the Pacific.".

This has it all a hardboiled hero exotic locales constant plot twists and turns colorful villains and a mysterious woman.Bogart as almost always plays the same character he always plays. but boy does he fit in SO well into this film.

Her Alberta Marlow is not at all like schoolgirl Brigid O'Shaughnessey but at least openly tougher a perfect match with Bogart during their exchanges of dialogue while remaining to be extremely ambiguous never making sure whether or not she's an ally or a femme fatale. When all is revealed looking back on it things made perfect sense with her character's attitude.Sydney Greenstreet adds another great villain to his own rogues gallery.

Victor Sen Young who played a great shark grinned scumbag in The Letter does good here looking very happy that he at least was able to speak coherently for once in a motion picture.Huston's direction is really worth looking at especially visually stunning during a sequence at a movie theater. Without his obvious presence and Bogart this film would have just been another propaganda story of espionage. Sadly when he had to leave the film for war duty the final scenes were shot by otherwise competent but nothing special director Vincent Sherman. The final 15 minutes seem extremely out of place with the rest of the film and its a shame Huston wasn't around a little bit longer to round up what could have been a quintessential piece of a feature 40's pulp movie.Worth seeing its a film that falls short of greatness but man is it entertaining.".

The essential plot if I remember right is that evil Japanese baddies want to blow up the Panama canal with Greenstreet's help of course and Bogey has to stop them. He meets a mysterious woman on a boat while supposedly going to work for Chiang Kai Scheck in China strange little point to make and has all kinds of strange encounters and adventures along the way falling in love saving the day and fighting those evil Japs...By the way the film actually does make a certain responsible choice to demonstrate that not all Japanese people are bad guys.

	schema:reviewBody "This general genre  Americans fighting Nazism or in this case the Japanese before or during World War II is generally not very high on my list of types of film to watch. However every once in a while one comes along that is pretty decent often because it's not as predictable.One thing that makes this particular film a cut above is the cast much of which was fresh off the success of The Maltese Falcon. This is a good vehicle for Humphrey Bogart who plays a GI pretending to be kicked out of the military to act as a sort of spy on some Americans that are up to no good with the Japanese scheduled right around the bombing of Pearl Harbor However in this case the action is taking place centered around the Panama Canal. The primary bad guy here is Sidney Greenstreet in league with he Japanese. Greenstreet is suitably menacing here. The leading question among the characters is is Bogart's love interest  again Mary Astor a good girl or a bad girl? I actually think Astor is better here than she was in The Maltese Falcon.There are also many Asian character actors here that you will recognize even if you don't remember their names Victor Sen Yung Richard Loo and Keye Luke among others. Another very good character actor here is Charles Halton.Of course as some of our participants have pointed out there is negative stereotyping of the Japanese in this film. Well of course! It was made in the middle of World War II.The degree of suspense here is a little uneven and there are times when the film moves a little too slowly particularly in the first half of the film but overall this film holds your attention.Sidney Greenstreet's love of Japanese culture is really quite entertaining. I never considered him a very versatile actor but he was very good at what he did well.If there are any criticisms due here there are two. First the stunt doubling for Humphrey Bogart here is way too obvious. Second some of the special effects here such as the single airplane near the end of the film is quite primitive. But overall these two things do not detract much from the enjoyment of the film they may just make you smile.Recommended if you wish to savor a taste of John Huston's Hollywood version of patriotism. Quite well done for this genre.".

He has some crackling good dialogue to share with Mary Astor and Sydney Greenstreet and director John Huston keeps things moving at a lively pace with the usual amount of twists and turns.Only problem is this is one of those espionage tales full of hidden identitiesa bit disconcerting considering how complicated the plot is. But after awhile that doesn't matter. What counts here is the great chemistry between Bogart and Astor Bogart and Greenstreet Bogart and Sen Young. In short it's Bogey doing what he does bestand Greenstreet as wellwith Bogart as the tough guy whose mission is to destroy a scheme by spies to blow up the Panama Canal. All of the shipboard scenes are great fun and played for comedy as well as drama. It has plenty of suspense along the way. Sen Young is especially good in a colorful supporting role. It's slam bang entertainment all the way.Of course at the end Bogey singlehandedly destroys the enemy and is free to pursue the mysterious Mary Astor. At times it seems as though these are characters left over from THE MALTESE FALCON with Astor again playing a woman who just might be treacherous. The only ingredient missing among the supporting cast is Peter Lorre.  For Bogart fans this is a must see. John Huston had to leave toward the end of the shooting to go into war service. Filming was completed by Victor Sherman who took no credit for his work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bogey's immediately preCasablanca movie reunites him with his co stars Astor and Greenstreet and his writerdirector of The Maltese Falcon John Huston. Yes Huston revised the script as he shot though he did not receive a credit. This created problems when he was drafted near the end of shooting and Vincent Sherman took over. No join is visible in the film fortunately due to the polished cinematography of Arthur Edeson also from The Maltese Falcon who was to join Bogey on Casablanca. Although the script doesn't measure up to Maltese Falcon standards it's entertaining enough if not taken too critically and provides some wonderful opportunities for star turns by Bogey Astor Greenstreet and a wonderful support cast of delightful oriental offbeats led by Victor Sen Yung as a cheery thug Chester Gan as the philosophical ship's captain It is the Japanese way. If you praise our sons we say they are unworthy Lee Tung Foo as a friendly hotel proprietor and Monte Blue as a silent sot. And of course no Orientaltype movie would be complete without Philip Ahn. Here his role is memorable but brief. That's a curious film we see in the cinema incidentally. Obviously a Japanese silent movie though dubbed dialogue on the sound track is designed to give us the impression it's a sound film. Produced on an expansive budget the film is a marvelous example of Huston's feeling for visual atmosphere. Edeson's lowkey film noir lighting is a major asset here as is Adolph Deutsch's skillful score. The sets are appealingly created too especially the wharf set with its chugging train and the menacing bulk of the Genoa Maru. In short Across the Pacific is a very agreeable piece of entertainment indeed. It has quite a lot going for it especially in the acting atmospheric and artistic departments. If its entertainment total is less than the sum of its parts blame the Second World War!".

Pearl Harbor is never mentioned and it is not clear that it has even happened yet in the film. But it really does make the story pop historically.

	schema:reviewBody "Across the Pacific is minor league stuff in the careers of both John Huston and Humphrey Bogart. It's clearly made as a wartime propaganda film. It certainly doesn't compare to The Maltese Falcon The Treasure of the Sierra Madre Key Largo or The African Queen. It doesn't even have the redeeming feature of campiness that Beat the Devil has. The film is a product of the time.That being said it's certainly entertaining enough. On an action level it has more of it than The Maltese Falcon from which four cast members were retained. The four repeaters are Humphrey Bogart Mary Astor Sidney Greenstreet and John Hamilton.Bogart's not the existential private eye here. He's a cashiered army officer whose trial was really a fake. He's working undercover to find expose some Japanese American fifth columnists. His investigation takes him on a Japanese freighter that does carry passengers on the side. Two of those passengers are an Orientalist professor who teaches at the University of Manila Sidney Greenstreet and a woman who claims to be from Medicine Hat Mary Astor. Bogey spends the entire film trying to figure out not only what the dastardly scheme is but just how Astor fits into it because he's fallen for her.World War II was the greatest time for employment for oriental players except Japanese ones. A goodly group is in this film Kam Tong Philip Ahn Keye Luke and most of all Victor Sen Yung. Until he played Hop Sing Ben Cartwright's Chinese cook in Bonanza Sen Yung was best known for being Charlie Chan's son under a few different Chans. But his role as Joe Tatsuito in this film was pretty good work also. Sen Yung is a hip jive talking Nisei who is supposed to be a deadly killer. Since he's already identified as such before we actually meet him there is an aura of menace about Sen Yung even when he's at his friendliest.Sidney Greenstreet as a scholar has become so immersed in Japanese culture and tradition that it has taken him right over the line into treason. Greenstreet is a talker like Casper Guttman in The Maltese Falcon but in the end he can't walk the walk.What was also happening in 1942 was that we were interning Japanese civilians that year. I don't think Victor Sen Yung being Chinese himself and knowing what the Japanese were doing in the home of his ancestors had any qualms about portraying a man on screen that seemed to be the living justification for such a policy. I've never heard of Across the Pacific being discussed specifically as a propaganda piece for that policy. Nor do I ever remember John Huston ever being questioned about it. Not that he had anything to do with the decision for internment but it would have been nice to hear his feelings on the subject vis a vis Across the Pacific.Huston didn't even stick around for the finish of Across the Pacific it was completed under different hands. He went off to the service where he did some really fine documentaries that have stood the test of time.Better than Across the Pacific has.".

	schema:reviewBody "Across the Pacific 1941This is some kind of cross between Maltese Falcon and the Casablanca and it has a cast that covers both movies even though it is usually matched to the former since it shares the same director the great young John Huston. It's hard to picture this turning into a gem even with these stellar talents at the top of their gamethe plot is just too forced and canned. And the writing not surprisingly lacks the snap and intrigue of both these other films even though screenwriter Richard Macaulay has some great films to his credit including They Drive by Night also with Bogart. It's a decent film filled with common movie tricks and turns and it does have a huge range of scenes and turns of events enough to make it worth watching.But this is a war movie shot right between that great detective movie and that great early war movie. Being 1941 it seems to have the single goal beyond entertainment of presenting the Japanese as a new enemy. There is lip service to their great and unique culture and some of the Japanese characters are charming and warm but gradually most of them become duplicitous. By the end it's an all out guns and torpedoes affair the last scenes occurring on Pearl Harbor day but in Panama and with no direct mention of the attack itself but lots of planes. In a twist it's a Canadian who is the evil mastermind.If Humphrey Bogart makes a great begrudging detective or a great begrudging club owner he isn't quite at home as an undercover spy trying to woo a single woman who happens to be on the same boat and who happens to encourage him. Maybe it's the woman the miscast Mary Astor who is the problem she was the problem in The Maltese Falcon as well but Huston can't seem to see the awkwardness of what is meant to be a major thread in the movie.To put it another way she is no Ingrid Bergman. But then the movie is missing the great and I mean great character actors of the other films especially Peter Lorre. It does have the equally great Sydney Greenstreet who is at his best when a secondary character someone not quite complex enough for the main role here. His erudite good humored worldly nature was stretched thin the same way in the rather charming Christmas in Connecticut.Anyway this is a fun film partly because of the actors who are a pleasure regardless of their roles. And it's a great example of how Hollywood was quickly responding to this new World War II reality.".

By the end it's an all out guns and torpedoes affair the last scenes occurring on Pearl Harbor day but in Panama and with no direct mention of the attack itself but lots of planes. In a twist it's a Canadian who is the evil mastermind.If Humphrey Bogart makes a great begrudging detective or a great begrudging club owner he isn't quite at home as an undercover spy trying to woo a single woman who happens to be on the same boat and who happens to encourage him. Maybe it's the woman the miscast Mary Astor who is the problem she was the problem in The Maltese Falcon as well but Huston can't seem to see the awkwardness of what is meant to be a major thread in the movie.To put it another way she is no Ingrid Bergman. But then the movie is missing the great and I mean great character actors of the other films especially Peter Lorre. It does have the equally great Sydney Greenstreet who is at his best when a secondary character someone not quite complex enough for the main role here. His erudite good humored worldly nature was stretched thin the same way in the rather charming Christmas in Connecticut.Anyway this is a fun film partly because of the actors who are a pleasure regardless of their roles. And it's a great example of how Hollywood was quickly responding to this new World War II reality.";

Here he looks like a beached Moby Dick as he trundles around the tropics in an oversized white suit. But they give him all this elegant dialogue that he does so well. He's a truly formidable menace casting his rotund shadow across half the Pacific and most of the sets.It's just an okay movie looking rushed into production on the heels of Pearl Harbor as it apparently was. Those jungle sets at film's end are really transparent and not up to usual studio standards. And the staging of the livingroom shootout wouldn't even pass matine standards. Up to that point there's a lot of talk and not much action for a spy movie. Fortunately in my little book at least the backandforth banter between Bogart and Astor is really lively and well written. Speaking of dialogue I almost thought no Asian actor could speak anything but pidgin English that is until Charlie Chan's number two son the bebopping Sen Yung showed up to enliven proceedings. What a fine actor and clever addition to this story.Anyway I don't think the 90minutes measures up for Bogart enthusiasts. Looks to me like most any leading man could have handled a role that really doesn't demand much. I did keep hoping the sneaky Peter Lorre would appear at some point. Somehow Greenstreet without Lorre is like cake without frosting. Nonetheless the movie is an early looksee at how Hollywood was gearing up for the big war.".

He leaves the military with a bad taste in his mouth and tries to enlist in the Canadian Army but the recruiter knows about Leland's courtmarshal and turns him down. Not long afterward the Japanese contact Rick Humphrey Bogart of The Maltese Falcon and arrange his passage to Panama on Nipponese freighter Genoa Maru. Rick meets a Canadian lady Alberta Marlow. In the novel Alberta is bound for the Hawaii Islands to visit a rich uncle while in the screen version she says she is going to visit her wealthy uncle Dan Marlow who owns a plantation in Panama. In the Saturday Evening Post story an obese Filipino Doctor Barca serves as the villain while in the story treatment he is Japanese man named Dr. Yomoto. At the end of the story treatment a notation indicates that Yomoto has been changed to Dr. Lorenz. Dr. Lorenz Sidney Greenstreetof The Maltese Falcon greatly admires the Japanese way of life and Lorenz Alberta and Rick spend a great deal of time together discussing a variety of topics until Lorenz gets Rick to himself pours enough liquor into the exartilleryman to loosen his tongue and learns that he has information about the artillery batteries guarding the Panama Canal. About half way through the action the film reveals what many had expected that the dishonored hero is really an undercover agent whose courtmarshal was a sham to elicit Dr. Lorenz to approach Rick. Complications occur just as Rick gives Lorenz his first report on the air traffic around the Canal. Dr. Lorenz has Rick's only contact murdered and leaves Rick for dead after a severe beating with his cane. Rick survives the torture and finds Lorenz has set up a makeshift air field where a Japanese officer plans to fly a bombladen plane to the Panama Canal and destroy it.

	schema:reviewBody "The original theatrical trailer to Across the Pacific offers Sydney Greenstreet introducing the story as an even more astonishing tale to tell than The Maltese Falcon. He should know he was there for both reuniting with fellow costars Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor in a tale of espionage and intrigue touted with the tag line behind every smile an invitation to disaster.The film opens on November 17 1941 with Bogie's character Rick Leland summarily dismissed from the Army for the indiscretion of borrowing military funds. With a reputation that moves even quicker than he does Rick is turned down for service in the Royal Canadian Army or as a wartime recruiting poster advertises  Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. With time on his hands Rick boards the freighter Genoa Maru seemingly to cross paths with a mysterious woman introduced to us as Alberta Marlow Astor yet with a larger goal in mind that of finding a sponsor so he can fight yet again. It's not until he arrives in New York that we learn that Leland is in fact a spy attempting to get the goods on the saboteur Dr. B.F.G. Lorenz Greenstreet and Japanese plans to blow up the Canal Zone.Interestingly the Japanese are depicted on both sides of the American fence. Lorenz describes them as wonderful little people as Captain Higoto of the Genoa Maru dispatches an adversary in a New York back alley and henchman Joe Totsuiko Victor Sen Yung demonstrates his judo skills in a couple of scenes. Yet in Panama Leland's friend and hotel owner Sam Wing On Lee Tung Foo demonstrates genuine concern for Rick's well being and directs him to a theater where he'll get his next set of instructions. With ominous portent the date on a Panamanian newspaper reads December 6 1941 Pearl Harbor looming only one day away even as the headline reads Hirohito Reply to Roosevelt Will Insure Peace.Snappy dialog and gritty one liners are a trademark of the film with Astor's character getting off her own fair share of zingers keeping the romantic angle between her and Rick sufficiently off balance. Apparently the writers were quite pleased with themselves over a line that's uttered not once but twice referencing the difference between their respective firearms Bogie warns Greenstreet's character  Remember mine's bigger than your's.Bogart fans will no doubt be intrigued by the coincidences between Across the Pacific and some of his other movies. For example the Fat Man line is used by Bogie's contact in the Panama Theater a reference to Greenstreet's character and a description that followed him from The Maltese Falcon. The name of Sam the hotel owner in Panama would turn up again almost immediately as that of Rick Blaine's piano player in Casablanca. And need it be pointed out Bogart is Rick in both films! As a fan of the Charlie Chan series of films from the 1930's and 40's I was intrigued by the fact that Number 1 and 2 Sons both appeared in this movie. Although Keye Luke has a throwaway part as a steamship office clerk Victor Sen Yung enjoys a meatier role as Greenstreet's heavy. Oddly out of forty two surviving Chan films they only appeared once as brothers together in 1948's The Feathered Serpent.With both The Maltese Falcon and Across the Pacific sharing name stars along with director John Huston the comparison between the two films is inevitable. I find Falcon to be the superior film but don't let that dissuade a would be viewer. However with Pacific you'll have to overlook the array of coincidences necessary for the story to unfold particularly with respect to Rick Leland's roundabout way of getting to the heart of the Canal Zone sabotage plot. You'll also have to overlook the title the movie never gets that far!".

Abenteuer in Wien is a very difficult film to get hold of. The Austrian Film Archive issued some years ago a DVD which is of very good quality but I doubt that it is much known outside AustriaGermany. There are elements of the film which reminds of Hitchcock but in my mind this film is superior to many Hitchcock's films as this film has also a poetic quality seldom found in Hitchcock's films . This film is both entertaining funny dramatic and have a fantastic atmospheric beautiful photography capturing Vienna five years after the war. Anybody enthusiastic about Third Man and its Vienna locations should not miss this film. The action take place during 12 hours during New Year's Eve in Vienna. The plot is very ingenious and all bits of the puzzle come nicely together. All actors are outstanding. There is no overt violence and the only shot fired is not even heard due to pneumatic drills in the reconstruction of the city after the bombings. There are fantastic scenes of New Year's Eve celebrations mingled with a chase in the labyrinth parts of Vienna which spins out to the bombed parts of the city. There is a very original touch of the movie like the murderer planning his deed while rehearsing Schuman's piano concerto in Musik Verein. In contrast the humble surroundings of the unfortunate taxi driver working without identity papers in the war torn city. By pure chance he gets involved in this murder plot. There are remarkably actors even in minor parts lasting just a few minutes which give a special colour and feeling of the film . The drunken New Year's Reveller with the balloon is a revelation lasting only a minute. These were hard times in Vienna with much of the population living of tips and bribes .There are fine vignettes of bureaucracy reminding of the old Empire I have not seen the American version of the film which seems to have only the main actors slightly changed but I doubt that the original can be surpassed. It seems almost sacrilegious that Viennese population should speak English instead of Viennese German which is part of this picture's great charm. The director Emil Reinert died only a year after the film but his master piece deserves to be much more well known.".

	schema:reviewBody "SON OF FURY is one of the most fondly remembered adventure films from Hollywood's Golden Age. Produced by William Perlberg for 20th Century Fox in 1942 it was directed with a positive flair by John Cromwell. Based on the classic novel by Edison Marshall it had a cracking screenplay by Philip Dunne and the perfect leading man in handsome Tyrone Power who was still enjoying the great success of his popular pirate swashbuckler The Black Swan released just prior to this. SON OF FURY is also notable for an excellent performance from the illfated Francis Farmer who plays the spoilt and priggish daughter of slimy villain George Saunders. Farmer looks quite lovely in the picture and is probably her best remembered role.Ty Power is in his element as the young Benjamin Blake in the early part of the nineteenth century seeking restitution after being cheated out of his proper inheritance by his roguish uncle Saunders. As a boy he becomes his bond servant and grows into manhood in a cruelly treated existence. But after a fierce beating and many other indignities under the uncle's tutelage he flees home. He joins a ship sailing for the South Seas and with a colleague John Carradine jumps ship and comes ashore on an exotic Polynesian island. After some time he meets and falls in love with a beautiful Polynesian girl Gene Tierney. Some years pass and after amassing a fortune in pearls he returns to England. He hires a lawyer Dudley Diggs who clears his name in an excellent courtroom scene and restores his rightful inheritance much to the chagrin of his uncle resulting in a well staged fist fight between Power and Saunders an interesting analogy  some 15 years later in a fight scene with the same two actors while filming Solomon  Sheba 1959 Tyrone Power would die on set from a massive heart attack. He was only 44 years old! SON OF FURY ends with him returning to the island and taking up where he left off with the native girl.This is my only complaint about the movie  the casting of Gene Tierney as a Polynesian native girl! She doesn't look Polynesian nor native! She looks just like Laura in a grass skirt on holiday on a South Sea island!Gloriously photographed in black  white by the great Arthur Miller the picture is also buoyed by a terrific score by Alfred Newman featuring a great swashbuckling main theme and an arresting love motif for the picture's softer moments. Newman's score can be enjoyed for its own merits isolated on the DVD's audio track. Also on the disc is a featurette about Power with a nice contribution from the director's son  modern character actor James Cromwell.In 1953 Fox remade the picture  this time in Technicolor  and called it Treasure Of The Golden Condor starring Cornel Wilde and Constance Smith but it had only minor success. Unlike the splendid SON OF FURY it is now virtually forgotten!".

SON OF FURY is a wonderful multigenre picture that goes from British period piece to South Seas romance quite smoothly. The film's plot has been wellexplained by multiple IMDb members so I'll just concentrate on the performances.The entire cast does fine work. Gene Tierney doesn't appear until a full hour as passed and her role doesn't require much except smiling and looking utterly beautiful and that she does to perfection. George Sanders looking amazingly like John Wayne in the early scenes has one of his most brutally villainous roles and he plays it without flinching this is no character you love to hate he's one scary SOB. This major 1942 film is also notable for giving breaks to two actresses who had been brushed off by many in Hollywood the troubled Frances Farmer who plays Sanders' daughter and Power's first love and early talkie star Kay Johnson making a very rare appearance as Sander's wife. John Carradine has one of his most likable roles as a seedy castaway who turns out to be a great friend. There's also an exceptional performance from Harry Davenport best known as Doc Meade from GONE WITH THE WIND as Power's beloved grandfather.And I've saved the best for last the one the only Tyrone Power. Was there ever a more gorgeous man in movies? And SON OF FURY fairly revels in his beauty his beautiful mop of thick black hair his stunning profile manly arms friendly eyes and infectious smile. And as a bonus there are numerous scenes of Power shirtless running around the island in saronglike swimshorts. To top it all off Tyrone is a fantastic actor one of classic Hollywood's best. He would have been a superstar in any era.".

	schema:headline " A charmingly innocent historical adventure with a great cast of character actors as well as Tyrone Power";
	schema:reviewBody "If Son of Fury were the title of a paperback novel we'd expect a bodiceripping heavy breathing Regency romance. What we have is a highly professional Darryl F. Zanuck adventure of surprising innocence and charm. Everything about the movie from the actors to the script to the cinematography features such a high level of craftsmanship that the few corny moments pass quickly. Please note that elements of the plot are discussed. During the reign of George III Benjamin Blake Tyrone Power is thought to have been born on the wrong side of the blanket leaving his father's rich titled inheritance to Ben's wicked uncle Sir Arthur Blake George Sanders now baronet and the master of Breetholm Manor. Benjamin as a boy Roddy McDowell had been raised by his kindly grandfather until Sir Arthur at last located him. Sir Arthur is taking no chances about that inheritance and turns Ben into a stable hand on the estate. But Ben now grown into a man hates his uncle and has eyes for his uncle's daughter Isabel Frances Farmer a young woman we fear may have inherited her father's nasty ways. Ben rebels fights Sir Arthur and is whipped then flees and catches a ship from England. He learns from a shipmate of a South Seas island where oyster pearls practically cover the ocean floor. By trickery they escape the ship are accepted by the natives dive for a fortune in pearls and Ben meets a lovely young native woman. He names her Eve Gene Tierney. Then it's back to England to hire a lawyer save his grandfather from debtor's prison win a court fight to reclaim his inheritance give Sir Arthur a beating and learn the tricky nature of Isabel. What's left for a rich young man? Well one thing would be to turn his estates and wealth over to all those loyal workers then show up unexpectedly at that South Seas island and run across the sand to embrace Eve. The story even as predictable as this is told with such professional attention to naivety that we cheer for Ben hiss his uncle and even find the unlikely conclusion satisfying. Three things make this movie work as well as it does. First is the script. The story is one set of clichs after another yet the script doesn't wink at us or assume we're too simpleminded to notice. It treats Ben and the people he meets with matteroffact storytelling that doesn't dawdle over the kisses or make too big a thing over the beatings. In other words the script keeps the story moving. Second are the actors. Tyrone Power in my view often was too earnest for his own good. But here that earnestness is just right for Benjamin Blake's character. Power's handsomeness also works. At 32 he still has that youthfulness that quickly turned into maturity after his World War II years. There also are plenty of opportunities for Power to be barechested in this movie. It's reassuring to see a movie star with a reasonably good build who doesn't display the current style of inflatable pecs from too many visits by a personal trainer. And has there ever been so accomplished a condescending villain than George Sanders? His Sir Arthur is unprincipled selfsatisfied and dangerous. He proves he's no coward when it comes to fistfighting. John Carradine plays Caleb Green the sailor Benjamin joins to find pearls. Carradine was a fine actor as lean as a green bean who all too quickly learned a good paycheck could come as easily from selfcaricature as from acting. He plays a good guy here a true friend of Ben's and a man who discovers he can be happy with what he has. There are many other memorable characters...Elsa Lancaster as a prostitute with a heart of gold another clich but Lancaster turns the woman into someone we hope has a future...Dudley Diggs so ripe and forgotten now as the lawyer Bartholomew Pratt and Benjamin's deus ex machina...Frances Farmer beautiful and calculating who lets us know when she's aroused by breathing through her mouth...Harry Davenport as Ben's aged grandfather kindness itself...and Roddy McDowell as young Ben. He was one of the best of Hollywood's child actors and is completely believable here. Gene Tierney was a lovely but in my view limited actress. She's great to look at though whether diving for pearls or leading a hipswiveling dance accompanied by drums and grunts. Third is the production values Zanuck lavished on the film. The dollars Zanuck spent all show up on the screen with impressive sets ranging from the elaborate Breetholm Manor including a ballroom full of lavishly dressed aristos pointing their toes to a desperate debtor's prison from the courts of justice to the idyllic island paradise. The black and white cinematography is outstanding. The camera lingers over the carefully lit Gene Tierney almost as often as it does over Tyrone Power.".

	onyx:emotionText "If Son of Fury were the title of a paperback novel we'd expect a bodiceripping heavy breathing Regency romance. What we have is a highly professional Darryl F. Zanuck adventure of surprising innocence and charm. Everything about the movie from the actors to the script to the cinematography features such a high level of craftsmanship that the few corny moments pass quickly. Please note that elements of the plot are discussed. During the reign of George III Benjamin Blake Tyrone Power is thought to have been born on the wrong side of the blanket leaving his father's rich titled inheritance to Ben's wicked uncle Sir Arthur Blake George Sanders now baronet and the master of Breetholm Manor. Benjamin as a boy Roddy McDowell had been raised by his kindly grandfather until Sir Arthur at last located him. Sir Arthur is taking no chances about that inheritance and turns Ben into a stable hand on the estate. But Ben now grown into a man hates his uncle and has eyes for his uncle's daughter Isabel Frances Farmer a young woman we fear may have inherited her father's nasty ways. Ben rebels fights Sir Arthur and is whipped then flees and catches a ship from England. He learns from a shipmate of a South Seas island where oyster pearls practically cover the ocean floor. By trickery they escape the ship are accepted by the natives dive for a fortune in pearls and Ben meets a lovely young native woman. He names her Eve Gene Tierney. Then it's back to England to hire a lawyer save his grandfather from debtor's prison win a court fight to reclaim his inheritance give Sir Arthur a beating and learn the tricky nature of Isabel. What's left for a rich young man? Well one thing would be to turn his estates and wealth over to all those loyal workers then show up unexpectedly at that South Seas island and run across the sand to embrace Eve. The story even as predictable as this is told with such professional attention to naivety that we cheer for Ben hiss his uncle and even find the unlikely conclusion satisfying. Three things make this movie work as well as it does. First is the script. The story is one set of clichs after another yet the script doesn't wink at us or assume we're too simpleminded to notice. It treats Ben and the people he meets with matteroffact storytelling that doesn't dawdle over the kisses or make too big a thing over the beatings. In other words the script keeps the story moving. Second are the actors. Tyrone Power in my view often was too earnest for his own good. But here that earnestness is just right for Benjamin Blake's character. Power's handsomeness also works. At 32 he still has that youthfulness that quickly turned into maturity after his World War II years. There also are plenty of opportunities for Power to be barechested in this movie. It's reassuring to see a movie star with a reasonably good build who doesn't display the current style of inflatable pecs from too many visits by a personal trainer. And has there ever been so accomplished a condescending villain than George Sanders? His Sir Arthur is unprincipled selfsatisfied and dangerous. He proves he's no coward when it comes to fistfighting. John Carradine plays Caleb Green the sailor Benjamin joins to find pearls. Carradine was a fine actor as lean as a green bean who all too quickly learned a good paycheck could come as easily from selfcaricature as from acting. He plays a good guy here a true friend of Ben's and a man who discovers he can be happy with what he has. There are many other memorable characters...Elsa Lancaster as a prostitute with a heart of gold another clich but Lancaster turns the woman into someone we hope has a future...Dudley Diggs so ripe and forgotten now as the lawyer Bartholomew Pratt and Benjamin's deus ex machina...Frances Farmer beautiful and calculating who lets us know when she's aroused by breathing through her mouth...Harry Davenport as Ben's aged grandfather kindness itself...and Roddy McDowell as young Ben. He was one of the best of Hollywood's child actors and is completely believable here. Gene Tierney was a lovely but in my view limited actress.

In the film we meet young Benjamin played with wideeyed appeal by the 13yearold Roddy McDowall. Suspected of being illegitimate in birth Benjamin lives with his kindly gunsmith grandfather Harry Davenport until the fateful day when his cruel uncle Sir Arthur the typically excellent George Sanders fetches him to Breetholm Manor and fearing that Benjamin will one day be able to prove his ancestry and claim his inheritance makes him a stable boy. Benjamin grows up to be a handsome young man and now as played by Tyrone Power riding high on the success of 1940's The Mark of Zorro after several violent turns with his uncle flees to Polynesia to make his fortune. Entering into a pearldiving endeavor with fellow sailor Caleb Green an untypically likable John Carradine he makes his pile falls in love with a beautiful native girl who he dubs Eve Gene Tierney in her seventh film and returns to Bristol to claim what is his. But many surprises await him on his return....Son of Fury is a marvelous adventure film given the Alist treatment by 20th Century Fox. It features handsome production values rugged direction by John Cromwell father of modernday actor James and a beautiful score by Alfred Newman. Acting by one and all is first rate including Frances Farmer as Benjamin's bitchy cousin and Elsa Lanchester as a barmaid who helps Ben escape from the law. Tyrone and Gene make a wonderfully romantic pair in this their first teaming they would go on to appear together in 1946's The Razor's Edge and 1948's That Wonderful Urge. Gene's many fans should enjoy the awesome sight of her doing a convincing hipshaking hulalike dance in this film she does manage to convince as a Polynesian with only a few dozen lines of broken English still more than the six lines of dialogue she had in her third film Tobacco Road. She is simply gorgeous here and when Tyrone takes her to wife at one point and declares No bride was ever more beautiful the viewer is not inclined to argue. In her 1979 autobiography SelfPortrait Gene tells us that the film shoot on Son of Fury exposed her to mental illness for the first time not her own that would come over a decade later but rather in her costar Farmer who was just starting to evince symptoms and would be institutionalized two years later and stay in mental hospitals for a good eight years. One would never know it though based on Farmer's fine work in this film. Actually though every single aspect of this film is just perfect I just loved it from beginning to end. And at that end in which every character gets precisely what he or she deserves the viewer will likely feel inclined to stand up and cheer. Without giving away too much let me just say that those who have seen such marvelous entertainments as Dodsworth and Dark Passage might know the type of crowdpleasing final scene that is in store for them. Here is rousing robust romantic entertainment the trailer for Son of Fury proclaimed and I could not agree more. Watch it alone or with the entire family it is a perfect film for adventureloving guys romanceseeking ladies and kiddies of all ages. More than highly recommended.".

Farmer after a string of uneven pictures is relegated to a supporting role here but actually fares better than leading lady Gene Tierney because 1 her role is far more complex and 2 her onscreen chemistry with star Tyrone Power is much more palpable. Perhaps the saddest thing about Son of Fury is the knowledge that despite the now recurrent difficulties being reported from the set Farmer had caught herself a break and maybe a chance to finally ride out Paramount's punishment  starting in 1938 of course with the aptlynamed and perfectly awful Ride A Crooked Mile. But as we all know the road got bumpier the turns sharper and the potholes unavoidable ... To see Farmer surrounded not only by the likes of such Alist talent as Power and Tierney but a stellar George Sanders and very young Roddy McDowell is to get a glimpse of what might have been. To read accounts of Farmer being tricked into watching this film years later while incarcerated in an insane asylum if indeed true is unforgivable ... Watch Son of Fury for everything the Golden Age of Hollywood purported to be  solid if not overly spectacular entertainment.

It's the story of Benjamin Blake played as a child by Roddy McDowell and later by Tyrone Power who after being orphaned at an early age is cheated out of his title and inheritance by Sir Arthur Blake George Sanders his sadistic uncle who keeps him as a bonded servant.Ben escapes and stows away to a remote island in the South Pacific at a time when travel was a lot more difficult than dropping into Harvey World Travel or hitting the Trivago App on your iPhone. Years later he returns to England to put things right.Along the way he falls in love with two women. The first is Sir Arthur's daughter Isabel Blake Francis Farmer. Not much of it is made in the film but this surely would have to be a nonstarter as she was his first cousin. Nevertheless Francis Farmer was never photographed to better advantage than in Son of Fury dazzling is a fair description. This was her last movie before her life fell apart.The second is Eve the native girl Ben meets on the island played by Gene Tierney. The camera loved her and those amazing cheekbones that allowed her to play a wide range of ethnicities from Ancient Egypt to Polynesia  nearly always as a princess. It's sad knowing that this was about the time she too was overwhelmed by personal problems.Tyrone Power made every movie he was in seem important. Not just darkly handsome you felt there was depth to his characters and he could wear a Regency top hat and coattails as though he was born to the era.For anyone who loves movies of the golden age the fact that the film stars George Sanders is reason enough to see it. Along with his trademark disdain he projects a powerful physical presence. He was a big dude and in the boxing scenes he looks surprisingly fit and as though he knew some moves. It would be best to smile when calling him a fop.The whole production is polished with plenty of glass shots and moody sets the slightly unreal quality gives it a touch of movie magic. The film features brilliant characterisations right down the cast list and Alfred Newman contributed a vibrant score drenched in salt air and the aroma of the South Seas.You don't have to be a film buff to enjoy Son of Fury but it adds to the enjoyment if you know something of the stars and the filmmakers. They have all gone now but this film is a lasting testimony to their talents.".

To this day I don't think there is an actor that's better at portraying wealthy powerful manipulative sadists that literally ooze smooth sliminess and snobbery. His characters are always convincing and authentic and scarily real never fake or twodimensional or overplayed. Good old George doesn't disappoint this time around either. He's at his usual heartless selfserving coldblooded best here.The big surprise was how fantastic the rest of the cast is. Tyrone Power is impossibly handsome and kindhearted but he somehow pulls it off. Frances Farmer is his gorgeous but notsoinnocent first cousin. She and Tyrone are passionate lovers despite this being Merry Olde England not West Virginia.Things get really interesting when Tyrone ends up on a South Pacific island diving for a fortune in pearls with his partner John Carradine. I kept waiting for Mr. Carradine to doublecross Tyrone but he's actually a good guy on this occasion. This island is an adolescent boy's fantasy complete with Gene Tierney as the ideal girlfriend. She's awesomely beautiful falls madly in love with Tyrone right off the bat and is unfailingly compliant and worshipful of her white boyfriend although she's entirely unconvincing as a native island girl. She's so perfect that she doesn't even get pregnant! That's a development which would really complicate things tremendously for old Ty! And when Ty has to leave to return to England to set things aright she's still supportive and loving and even gives him absolution for deserting her I can never be happy unless you are happy too. You must go!. So Ty goes back gives everybody involved good and bad their just due and then very wisely returns to his island paradise and Miss Tierney thank God.I only mentioned a few of the actors but SOF is packed with great cast members who all deliver topnotch performances. This film zips along with no dull spots and has a fresh energy that overcomes the constant clichs and incredible implausibilities. It's very enjoyable to watch and hits all of the audience's buttons and indeed hits them deadcenter. It's built to please and does so with great skill. For pure entertainment value SOF and its ilk are far superior to a lot of the remakes and comicbookinspired CGIladen bloated blockbusters being cranked out today.".

She and Tyrone are passionate lovers despite this being Merry Olde England not West Virginia.Things get really interesting when Tyrone ends up on a South Pacific island diving for a fortune in pearls with his partner John Carradine. I kept waiting for Mr. Carradine to doublecross Tyrone but he's actually a good guy on this occasion. This island is an adolescent boy's fantasy complete with Gene Tierney as the ideal girlfriend. She's awesomely beautiful falls madly in love with Tyrone right off the bat and is unfailingly compliant and worshipful of her white boyfriend although she's entirely unconvincing as a native island girl. She's so perfect that she doesn't even get pregnant! That's a development which would really complicate things tremendously for old Ty! And when Ty has to leave to return to England to set things aright she's still supportive and loving and even gives him absolution for deserting her I can never be happy unless you are happy too. You must go!. So Ty goes back gives everybody involved good and bad their just due and then very wisely returns to his island paradise and Miss Tierney thank God.I only mentioned a few of the actors but SOF is packed with great cast members who all deliver topnotch performances. This film zips along with no dull spots and has a fresh energy that overcomes the constant clichs and incredible implausibilities. It's very enjoyable to watch and hits all of the audience's buttons and indeed hits them deadcenter. It's built to please and does so with great skill. For pure entertainment value SOF and its ilk are far superior to a lot of the remakes and comicbookinspired CGIladen bloated blockbusters being cranked out today.";

	schema:headline " Tyron Power as Benjamin Blake";
	schema:reviewBody "This is part of the 20th Century Fox's Tyron Power swashbuckler boxed set. There was not a lot of swashbuckling in this movie but the story and its stars still make it a fairly entertaining experience. The movie is based on Edison Marshall's novel about a young boy Ben who was the rightful heir of a large estate in Bristol England. However he has to earn his way to what rightfully belongs to him. In the movie Roddy McDowell plays Ben as a boy while Tyron Power plays him after he grows into manhood. As the movie opens Ben is living and working with his grandfather Amos Kidder Harry Davenport. However when Sir Arthur Blake George Sanders discovers that Ben is his dead brother's son he gets a legal writ making him Ben's guardian so that he can keep a close eye on him. Arthur then makes Ben his indentured stable boy. As Ben grows up he and Arthur's daughter Isabel Frances Farmer fall in love but can do nothing about it because of their stations in life. Even Arthur's wife Helena Kay Johnsonwho had once been in love with Ben's father quietly takes Ben's side hoping that he can someday prove his legitimate claim to the estate. After Ben assaults his master and runs away from the estate to earn money for his cause Ben's grandfather is jailed. But Ben and his grandfather are able to communicate to each other through a prostitute Bristol Isabel Elsa Lanchester who knows how to get in and out of jail without drawing undue suspicion. Ben's grandfather relates through Bristol Isabel that he should make his fortune in the Indies and THEN try to make his case for the estate with money in his pocket. Ben stows away on a ship headed for the Indies. Aboard this cruelly run ship he meets another stowaway Caleb Green John Carradine. Green's crime is that he is a debtor. They both plan and execute an escape from the ship to a South Pacific island. Caleb had heard from a 'Spanisher' that the island atoll is loaded with valuable oyster pearls. His information proves to be correct and they soon harvest a fortune in pearls to free themselves from their past stations.However while on the island Ben meets and falls in love with one of the island natives whom he calls 'Eve' Gene Tierney. He also becomes a great hero to the natives by teaching them how to make crud tools and improve their lives. Even though Eve loves Ben she knows that he is waiting for some European ship to someday come along and take him back to England for revenge and to makes his rightful claim. She helps him watch for such a ship. When a Dutch ship eventually DOES land near the island Ben departs on the ship but Caleb decides to stay on the island for life. When Ben returns to England with his fortune in oyster pearls he is capable of buying himself into respectability through an agent there Bartholomew Pratt Dudley Digges. Pratt takes some of his pearls and promises to use his influence to research and uncover the truth about Ben's parents. However when Ben is put on trial for his past crimes Pratt doesn't meet his promise and it looks as though Ben may face the ultimate penalty... As the movie draws towards its ending it fills in the lack of swashbuckling with some dramatic moments and surprises. There are some interesting variations to the actors' usual character types. For example Tyron Power is never very physical and when he physically fights someone he always loses. It is not his physical gymnastics that wins the day here. It is instead his steadfastness about revenge and his rights. Furthermore this is not the George Sanders that we are used to either While we are used to seeing him as a powerfullyconnected courtier a dandy a fop or a cleverly smug Addison DeWitttype character here he is a physically brutal pugilist who would rather live by his fists and his whip than his wit wordplay and cryptic charm.".

	schema:reviewBody "Released in Sydney in 1976 in the beautiful lost Plaza cineramascreen theatre LL was crazily blown up to 70mm for release here and suffered horrible cropping to make it a rectangle 2.2 ratio pic when it seemed to be shot 1.661. Heads were cut off or in one famous scene with Liza in a chair with Hackman and Reynolds standing behind her the famous fish fart line all we saw was her eyes on the stage and the men's chins at the top. I saw it again in proper ratio and it was far better so whoever's idea to blow it up literally only added to the maligned 'bomb' status of this very expensive 13m 1975 film. Yes the washed out image also looks weird and makes you yearn for better access into the antics on screen. We had one of the 3 reported endings the silly happy one where they all surface in the water after being blown up. The Butch Cassidy ending where the guys die and she is left would have been much better. Amazing that this film cost 4m more than STAR WARS filmed the next year. I saw a terrific 'making of' featurette at a nearby cinema at the same time which was in focus and offered a witty and attractive lead to the film so there is plenty for the DVD if we get it. Reynolds other films of the time AT LONG LAST LOVE and NICKELODEON deserve favourable DVD releases too all 3 are funny and enjoyable and compared to new multiplex releases from the USA are masterpieces. LL is almost a musical and Reynolds is a hoot. The John Held artwork on the credits will make you rush to buy a book of his delicious 1920s cartoons.".

The Butch Cassidy ending where the guys die and she is left would have been much better. Amazing that this film cost 4m more than STAR WARS filmed the next year. I saw a terrific 'making of' featurette at a nearby cinema at the same time which was in focus and offered a witty and attractive lead to the film so there is plenty for the DVD if we get it. Reynolds other films of the time AT LONG LAST LOVE and NICKELODEON deserve favourable DVD releases too all 3 are funny and enjoyable and compared to new multiplex releases from the USA are masterpieces. LL is almost a musical and Reynolds is a hoot. The John Held artwork on the credits will make you rush to buy a book of his delicious 1920s cartoons.";

Overall just a fun movie to watch. Take a group of privateers during Prohibition law passed making drinking liquor against the law in U.S. that wants to make a little fast money selling liquor smuggled in from Canada with the mob and the law hot on their heels and you get the theme of the movie.

Lucky Lady played on a double bill with Sky Riders which starred James Coburn Susannah York and Robert Culp.  I was around 13 at the time and had a little idea of what Sky Riders was about no idea of the story to Lucky Lady though I know it received poor reviews.  I have to admit I enjoyed them both but had a grand time watching Lucky Lady.  It seemed a bit episodic and the humor at times was kinda dumb but I got to like the characters even the minor ones like Robbie Benson as their first mate Michael Hordern as the old captain and even Geoffrey Lewis as the zealous but loony Coast Guard captain out to sink any bootleggers he comes across.  But the villains really stole the show especially John Hillerman as the machinegun toting main villain. One complaint was that the final boat battle was a ripoff of the James Bond battles.  Who cares as long as it's done wellin fact Mr. Donen should have been approached to do some of the Bonds after this movie.I may have seen the movie on tv shortly after its release.  I don't remember if i liked it as much seeing it on tv wasn't quite the same.  I don't know if I would like it as much now either but I would certainly be interested in seeing it on video.  As another person commented so much dreck is being released on DVD I don't see why Lucky Lady shouldn't be made available.  At least it tried to be a class act which is more than you can say for many of today's releases.".

	schema:headline " Liza's a funny lady but unfortunately the film wasn't so lucky.";
	schema:reviewBody "While this is considered one of Liza Minnelli's film career flops the evidence points out otherwise. It definitely was not the box office hit that 20th Century Fox anticipated it would be coming off as her first acting role since winning the Oscar for Cabaret. However box office receipts show that it didn't do as badly as rumor would have it. In fact Liza received a Golden Globe nomination for the film and was still one of the year's top box office stars among very few women listed in spite of poor reviews that the film received. What really tanked that year for Fox was At Long Last Love their big musical spoof which starred Liza's costar here Burt Reynolds.This is a prohibition era story of rum running and Liza plays a Clara Bow lookalike who sings Kander and Ebb songs in a bordertown saloon. She convinces sometimes lover Reynolds to run rum for her and has both the border patrol and coast guard on their trail. On the way they pick up grizzled Gene Hackman who was ripped off by Reynolds and pretty soon the three are engaged in a menageatois although it is clear that manly men Hackman and Reynolds only share Minnelli not each other.Gangsters? a San Francisco hotel clerk asks his manager. No he responds. Hollywood trash. There's tons of lines like this but the all time classic is Minnelli's It's so quiet here you can hear a fish fart! Network TV years ago cut out the line altogether while a cable channel simply silenced the offensive word even though it was clear through Liza's mouthing what she had said. Young Robby Benson plays Reynolds' shy shipmate and quickly moved onto leads in such popular teen films as Ode to Billy Joe One on One and Ice Castles.The film is no better or worse than many fluffy comedies of the 1970's probably a tad higher budgeted than most. Liza was the epitome of the wild '70's lifestyle of the rich and famous and with the Studio 54 days just around the corner some memorable Broadway appearances and much press it isn't hard to see why some critics would want to put her down a peg or two justified or not. She's actually the best thing about the movie and if her Kander and Ebb songs aren't up there among their best which includes the same year's Barbra Streisand hit Funny Lady they do reflect the era. Standards of the late 20's such as All I Do is Dream of You and If I Had a Talking Picture of You are heard in a nightclub sequence. The opening theme Too Much Mustard is best remembered as the AstaireRogers Castle Walk in The Story of Vernon  Irene Castle and snappily gets the film started with some nice artwork over the credits. The title song is one of the highlights of the film a montage of various situations that is quite humorous. Overall the humor of the film is very similar to the 1982 Blake EdwardsJulie Andrews classic VictorVictoria which didn't suffer at all at the box office and a show Liza later did on Broadway.Lucky Lady was part of the '70's nostalgia craze and was obviously influenced by The Sting as were such others as The Fortune and Harry and Walter Go to New York. There is apparently an alternative ending that Liza liked better but was refilmed to be more commercial. I felt satisfied with this conclusion however involving rival bootlegger John Hillerman although the alternate ending sounds more touching. Geoffrey Lewis is amusing as a Coast Guard commander and Hillerman is droll as always. I think in time that Lucky Lady will be like other disappointments of the era and be acknowledged as an entertaining film without pretension that suffered mainly because of the overabundance of attention the three stars were receiving.".

How Stanley Donen CHARADE SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS could have let anyone talk him into the choice of using flashed film is a real mystery. The result looks out of focus and artsy schmartsy destroying what intimacy the cast could evoke given the skelatal storyline. The editing is a disaster. A scene where Reynolds and Hackman make off with two whores after being abandoned by Minelli is immediately followed by all three in bed together. There's little or no narrative establishing Minelli's relationship with her legit boyfriend nor is there any explanation as to why Reynolds and Hackman would except this complication in their already complex relationship with Minelli. There are a few good lines ANYTHING would be better than singing with a Mariachi band but the story is not just light it's almost nonexistant.It's too bad there is no motivation for Fox to open the vaults to show us what we REALLY missed. There MIGHT be a movie in a reedited LUCKY LADY. Unfortunately there simply isn't one on display in the final product. I give it a 5 simply because the story mostly makes sense.".

The result looks out of focus and artsy schmartsy destroying what intimacy the cast could evoke given the skelatal storyline. The editing is a disaster. A scene where Reynolds and Hackman make off with two whores after being abandoned by Minelli is immediately followed by all three in bed together. There's little or no narrative establishing Minelli's relationship with her legit boyfriend nor is there any explanation as to why Reynolds and Hackman would except this complication in their already complex relationship with Minelli. There are a few good lines ANYTHING would be better than singing with a Mariachi band but the story is not just light it's almost nonexistant.It's too bad there is no motivation for Fox to open the vaults to show us what we REALLY missed. There MIGHT be a movie in a reedited LUCKY LADY. Unfortunately there simply isn't one on display in the final product. I give it a 5 simply because the story mostly makes sense.";

	schema:reviewBody "I never had the opportunity to sample the popular Doctor series lampooning the medical profession the inspiration for which was a novel by Richard Gordon  not the horror filmproducer until now while I thoroughly enjoyed this first and universally bestregarded entry I cant quite see how the typical farcical situations could be stretched for seven pictures  especially since the rival Carry On stable made four films of its own on the subject over the years! Interestingly at least five members of the films cast and crew would become fixtures of that even more durable series  actresses Joan Sims and Shirley Eaton composer Bruce Montgomery cinematographer Ernest Steward and editor Gerald Thomas director Ralphs brother who would actually proceed to helm all 31 Carry On outings! incidentally the entire run of Doctor films were similarly Ralphs domain.Still this series clearly had a bigger budget since they were all made in color and attracted a roster of top British stars  none more impressive than the one assembled here Dirk Bogarde he would feature in four of these  amazingly even after he had gone on to more adult roles such as the blackmailed homosexual barrister in VICTIM 1961!

The laughs come less from the obvious or outrageous and more subtly from situations and wit except for the street chase which really doesn't come off that well. True the movie may be no kneeslapper but neither does it cause indigestion afterwards.Well you do have to accept that these 30somethings are still young enough to be starting medschool something of a stretch. Nonetheless Bogarde and Co. come through as a likable crew and I think I'll get sick on the offchance that the cute little number Muriel Pavlow will be my nurse. Too bad we don't see more of that gifted and sexy comedienne Kay Kendall. I love the way she snubs Houston after he makes an untoward remark what a classy looking gal who died much too young. And of course there's the imperious James Robertson Justice looking and sounding like Emperor of the Universe but really a regular guy when the chips are down.I like the way the unassuming Sparrow Bogarde comes to a sense of confidence and pride after delivering his first baby. It's his first case and now after all the training and sacrifice he departs the house a real doctor. What a fine versatile actor Bogarde was. Anyway the movie holds up pretty well a nice balance of the antic and the affable.".

Quickly hooking up with a couple of fun seeking students Simon sets about trying to survive the 5 years of student life before passing the grade to become a doctor. Wine women song and adventure beckons as does being expelledThe most popular film of 54 at the British box office Doctor in the House spawned 6 sequels and a TV series whilst it also represented the point when Bogarde became a name actor. It looks a bit tame now of course its affability hardly giving credence to the given observation that it's an important movie in the British comedy film pantheon. But its worth should not be under stated nor should the flame of warm old time Brit comedy ever be extinguished as the sexually tinged comedy of today jettisons smiley simplicity in favour of overt crudeness.Many behind the scenes of the production had family links to the team that would go on and produce the Carry On series of films that became a staple of British cinema Doctor in the House represents the flip side of the Carry On medical adventures. Where boisterous sauce is replaced by awkward innocence and double entendres replaced by jovial japes and of course there's a wealth of British talent across the cast list to enjoy as they deliver the well timed gags and scenarios. Lovely film really. 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Rambo First Blood Part II 1985 is my personal number 1 favorite action movie of all time. The quintessential pure badass action movie that I call it. This is my favorite badass pure action film of the 80's I cherish and I love this film to death. Sylvester Stallone's best movie he ever made this is one man against an army. I am huge Sylvester Stallone fan he is my number 1 favorite action star. Rambo First Blood Part II is my number 1 film in the action genre Rambo series.This movie has heart and soul in the movie you mourn with Rambo over his lost I love the rescue mission and Rambo doesn't forget anyone. I watch this movie as a kid constantly on VHS it defines my childhood. I have this film on DVD and Bluray disc. It was directed by George P. Cosmatos who reunited with Stallone a year later and directed Cobra. Rambo First Blood Part II First Blood and Cobra are my personal favorite 80's action films of all time.Rambo First Blood Part II is the sequel to the classic First Blood. Sylvester Stallone returns as John Rambo the former Green Beret who is given the opportunity for a Presidential pardon if he accepts a mission to confirm the existence of American POW's captured during the Vietnam War.The film proved to be a massive blockbuster and launched the character of Rambo into the popular culture. Directed by George P. Cosmatos and screenplay was written by James Cameron and Sylvester Stallone. James Cameron wrote a beautiful screenplay with many action scenes. That Is why the movie has ton's of action just like Aliens and Terminator 2 Judgment Day who are really popular action movies. Sylvester Stallone wrote a politics which he meant they were important.Richard Crenna reunites with Sylvester Stallone for this sequel and his character Colonel Sam Trautman is much better well portrayed and acted then he was the first movie. Charles Napier as Marshall Murdock was memorable bad guy and I love those two actors. When Colonel Sam Trautman talks to his nemesis Marshall Murdock is memorable in my opinion. Jerry Goldsmith made a beautiful music score for the film that I enjoy it so much. We also haveSteven Berkoff Julia Nickson and Martin Kove in this movie. Julia Nickson was great as Co Bao who helps Rambo out. I love Aliens to death it is my favorite Scifi action film and I also the same time I love Rambo First Blood Part II the same time and I think it is a classic for the 80's. The film was box office hit. It was competitive with Commando who come the same year and Commando wasn't that successful. This movie is better to me than Commando.The sequel is my favorite action film it has tons of action and multiple explosions Rambo with his Hoyt Archery compound bow with his explosive arrow C4 tips is memorable. I love Rambo's new survival knife and he is Rambo his knife completes him. Rambo blows up a soldier with a bow and arrow C4 explosive tips my favorite scene in the film. Rambo blows the army's vehicles with bow and C4 tip arrow bad ass scene. Rambo uses a rocket launcher RPG7 and destroys the Vietnamese boat. Rambo uses a shotgun and blows pirates to pieces. Rambo fly's the helicopter and destroys all the bad guys blows them to pieces he rescue American POW's and he saves them he did not forgot them I love the rescue mission. Rambo uses M72 LAW launcher and destroys Lt. Col. Podovsky helicopter to pieces.Action adventure fun with some substance . Different than the first one  but great as an archetypical good versus bad movie. Very decent good movie very entertaining fast paced wonderful action HardR fight scenes and some nice oneliners war movie. There's no shaky cam or CGI here but real explosions. Badass action film I absolutely love it to death! Rambo First Blood Part II it is my favorite number 1 action movie with First Blood and Cobra my all time 80's action films of all time.".

Rambo First Blood Part II influenced many of action films. Commando come out the same year and it was very competitive with Rambo but this movie won because it was more box office successful. I love this film to death It is the sequel to First Blood 1982 and the second installment in the Rambo film series In my opinion it is Stallone's best film.Sir do we get to win this time? Awesome and very great intense underrated sequel . it Is a very joy great action movie . Action adventure fun with some substance. Different than the first one  but great as an archetypical good versus bad movie. Very decent good movie very entertaining fast paced wonderful action HardR fight scenes and some nice oneliners war movie. There's no shaky cam or CGI here but real explosions. Badass action film I absolutely love it to death! James Cameron and Sylvester Stallone wrote the script that is why this movie was such a badass action. Terminator 2 Judgment Day and Aliens proves to be one of the best action movies from James Cameron he wrote and directed them that is why Rambo First Blood Part II was such a success. Brilliantly directed by George P. Cosmatos who later directed Cobra with Sylvester Stallone again Leviathan with Richard Crenna again and Tombstone. Of course this wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it and it's perfectly done. Great action a slick pace and a barrage of great moments a random soldier being shot by an exploding arrow being my personal favorite may not make this high art but it does create a fun time at the movies which is what movies are meant to do. It also helps that it has a great score which sets the tone very well. You have ton's of explosions real practical effects. You see a lot of heavy weapons and they are used well. Rambo uses a knife and kills the bad guys well he's Rambo and his knife completes him. Rambo uses Hoyt Archery compound bow which has been well know as the Torque Bow because of the high explosive arrow tips. I have never seen in any action movie a bow and explosives arrows. Rambo uses a flying helicopter kills all the bad guys blows whole base and saves POW's captured prisoners. In this movie you have Russians and Vietcongs as the bad guys. Rambo blows up an enemy boat by pulling an RPG7 antitank grenade launcher blows them to hell. Great explosion I have ever seen. Rambo blows up Podovsky's Hind helicopter with another grenade launcher M72 LAW.Excellent solid cast Sylvester Stallone does great excellent performance as legendary John Rambo Vietnam vet. I love the character to death. Richard Crenna R.I.P. as Col. Samuel Trautman was excellent I really miss him. Charles Napier R.I.P. as Marshall Murdock was fantastic bad guy. The acting is fantastic from Richard Crenna and Charles Napier the politics were important such as a rightwing stance coming from Trautman and his nemesis Murdock contrasted by Rambo's obvious neutrality. Great music score from Jerry Goldsmith R.I.P.1010 Badass action film I absolutely love it to death it is my number 1 action film ! Puts most of action movies to shame. Today they aren't action movies like are this one. Today they are just lousy CGI bullsh crap.".

	schema:reviewBody "First Blood and Rambo are completely different movies. They have same two characters bu that is where the similarity ends. First Blood was a tightly wound excellent action picture directed very well by Ted Kotcheff. Rambo is an action extravaganza that is not to high on the psychological element the way the first one was. They are both excellent films but I find them entertaining for different reasons. One of the reasons that I find Rambo so damn entertaining is because I enjoy that Rambo is now larger than life. He is the ultimate fighting machine who's only desire is to win a war that someone else lost and if winning means he has to die then he'll die no fear no regrets. That is what makes Rambo the ultimate fighting machine and the ultimate movie character.I love this movie. I love how far fetched it is. I love that Rambo can withstand hours of torture and then have enough energy to escape into the jungle and take on the whole Vietnemese and Russian army. That is what makes this movie so damned entertaining. When I was 14 this was my favourite movie and it took a great many films and years before it was dethroned. I think I can enjoy and appreciate movies like Apocalypse Now and JFK better than when I was 14 but my love for Rambo and films of its kind will never diminish. This movie is amazing from start to finish.Rambo's mission in this film is to go back to Vietnam and see if he can find a certain camp that may be harbouring POW's. But if he finds these men he can only take pictures. He has a problem with that and when he does find one he is left behind by the stinkin bureaucrat named Murdoch who orders the mission aborted before Trautman can pick him up. It is while Rambo is captured that the movie becomes tight tense and incredibly entertaining. Rambo is also fun to watch on a physical level. Stallone was in the best shape of his life in 1985 as he simultaneously made Rambo and Rocky IV. He is huge ripped and strong as hell in this movie and it is his psychical presence that adds to his persona. He single handedly goes through a whole army and lives to go get the bastards that left him behind. Rambo is one of the old school feel good summer type movies.Rambo does not claim to be JFK or Mississippi Burning in the sense that it wants you to leave the theater with a message. It has its own beliefs that is for certain but what Rambo does just like Raiders does is it entertains. It has you rooting and cheering for Rambo and dissing and swearing at the bad guys for 90 minutes. It is so much fun that I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes to be entertained. Leave your politics for some other movie that is not what Rambo is about. It is about being entertained and wearing your emotions on your sleeve. That is what is beautiful about this movie. It doesn't apologize for being a bit over the top. Neither should you for enjoying the film. It is a true wonder. A great piece of entertainment.".

	schema:headline " Rambo is an Icon";
	schema:reviewBody "Sylvester Stallone has one of the most recognizable faces in the world for a reason this genius has created two pop culture Icons Rocky and Rambo. Anywhere in the world these two characters will be reconized.  Stallone has many detractors but his vision writing and acting out these characters has made him rich and sucessful in a highly competitive industry.  Before Rambo his sequel to First Blood Stallone was just a star like Gene Hackmen but this movie created a mega star.  As part of gen x I love this film it is a prototype for many action films that followed.  The story brings out raw emotions tension and adrenaline. The viewer relates with John Rambo his pain and how the government lies.  The action takes the viewer on a incredible ride.  I love the battlecry he gives out when he does a chopper assault on the bad guys and the explosive arrow that smashes his adversary along with the machine gunning of the computer system at the base.

Stallone who is ridiculed along with Arnold for his physical acting can with this ability create a great stage presence. This emotion he creates with his body is done by how he walks flexs his arm etc.  Could Robert De Niro done this film maybeie Cape Fear Tom Cruise no way Val Kilmer No. This film is what an  action film should be I've seen very few lines for an Action movie as long as this one.

	onyx:emotionText "Sylvester Stallone has one of the most recognizable faces in the world for a reason this genius has created two pop culture Icons Rocky and Rambo. Anywhere in the world these two characters will be reconized.  Stallone has many detractors but his vision writing and acting out these characters has made him rich and sucessful in a highly competitive industry.  Before Rambo his sequel to First Blood Stallone was just a star like Gene Hackmen but this movie created a mega star.  As part of gen x I love this film it is a prototype for many action films that followed.  The story brings out raw emotions tension and adrenaline. The viewer relates with John Rambo his pain and how the government lies.  The action takes the viewer on a incredible ride.  I love the battlecry he gives out when he does a chopper assault on the bad guys and the explosive arrow that smashes his adversary along with the machine gunning of the computer system at the base.

My father received this movie as a gag gift.  Just by glancing at the cover I had the impression that Rambo movies were nothing but bloodandguts gunsblazing psycho noplotline movies that exist solely for the purpose of making men feel macho.  I hate those movies Steven Segal Chuck Norris etc. But when I popped in this movie out of boredom I was surprisingly pleased.  I'll admit I never saw the first one but this film doesn't really call for it.  It stands on its own.  The plot is gooda little too unrealistic but good the cinematography and scenery is great Stallone may not be the best actor in the world but he PERSONIFIES John Rambo and the aspect that makes the movie worth watching is the fact that a woman was a main character and she was not just there for looks she had an important role and she is portrayed almost as Rambo's equal.  The semihappy ending was cool too.  Although there are many cheezy moments where you just want to roll your eyes there are also many feelgood moments that have the audience cheer for Rambo.  After seeing this film I can understand why it was nominated for an Oscar.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a Sergeant in the Army who previously served in the National Guard. I joined the West Virginia Army National Guard in the summer of 1985 when this film was first released and I have to admit I was caught up in the patriotic Rambo fever that was sweeping the country. Sylvester Stallone was sort of like a modern day John Wayne in creating a hero on screen that made us cheer for him and feel patriotic. John Rambo symbolized the Vietnam veteran that went and fought and did his all for his country and was spit on and left to stand alone when he returned. The first scene in this film is Colonel Trautman visitng Rambo in prison and offering him a chance at a pardon if he will participate in a special mission. Rambo accepts and says Sir do we get to win this time? Trautman says Its up to you. Murdock the character that Charles Napier plays represents the typical government beaurocrat that slept on clean sheets with a full belly while soldiers died in Vietnam because they were sent out to fight with one hand tied behind their back. He lies to Rambo about his combat experience and Rambo realizes Trautman is the only one he trusts. Incidentally Charles Napier is a highly decorated Korean war veteran in real life. Rambo parachutes into Nam and finds there are POWS left alive he even manages to help one escape and Murdock aborts the mission and leaves them to their fate. There is an intense scene where Trautman confronts Murdock and calls him a stinking coward covering his ass! He says you made one mistake leaving Rambo alive! There are some awesome sequences that keep you on the edge of your seat. Stallone's approach to playing Rambo is like the one Clint Eastwood used in playing No Name. He uses a minimum of dialogue. However you sense this man's inner pain that he has borne all his life. This film has some of the most graphic torture sequences ever committed to screen as they try to make Rambo talk. They get him on the radio with Murdock and he says MURDOCK I'M COMING TO GET YOU!!!! I have to admit I cheered like everyone else when Rambo killed all the enemy and rescued the POWs. There is an intense helicopter chase before he finally fakes a crash and then blows the enemy helicopter away! I wanted to mention one error they made in this film. Rambo uses a LAWs rocket to shoot the enemy helicopter if he had done this in real life he would have blown up his own copter as well because of the backblast effect. I have trained with LAWs rockets and I know.I love the last scene in the film where he flys the copter back and goes after Murdock. He scares the  out of him by shoving him down on a table and stabbing his knife into it but he only tells him There are more men out there find them or I will find you The last scene in the film SPOILER ALERT is the best. Colonel Trautman asks Rambo what he wants and Stallone makes his longest speech I WANT WHAT THEY WANT AND EVERY OTHER GUY WHO WENT OVER THERE AND SPILLED HIS GUTS AND GAVE IT ALL HE HAD WANTS FOR OUR COUNTRY TO LOVE US AS MUCH AS WE LOVE IT THAT IS WHAT I WANT!!!! It was like he was speaking for all Vietnam vets. This is a film that makes you stand up and cheer in the end. Corny? maybe but I always remember the lyrics of the song at the end Stallone's brother wrote them Peace in our liferemember the causea cheer for my brothers think of them allhome of the free well never fall the strength of our nation belongs to us all.".

Its comic strip stuff and is much less credible than First Blood. I don't care about that though you want a serious film then watch The Deer Hunter or Platoon but if you want to see a superbly made action film watch this. After the events of First Blood John Rambo is in prison but gets released to be sent back to Vietnam to take pictures of a pow camp to get proof that there is still American pow's there. But he is doublecrossed by his superiors when he tries to take some pow's out with him he wasn't meant to do that he was ordered to only take photos so he's left behind to be captured  imprisoned and tortured by those oh so nasty RUSSIANS! Sly really had it in for the reds in 1985 after this film he sent Rocky out to Russia to beat up that other nasty Russian Ivan Drago! It must have been what the people wanted as this and Rocky IV were two of the biggest smashes of the year. Steven Berkhoff plays the Russian bad guy in practically a carbon copy of his role in the James Bond film Octopussy he does it well though he was one of Hollywoods favourite bad guys of the mid 80's you might remember him in Beverly Hills Cop which was a film initially intended for........Sylvester Stallone! This movie has just been giving the DVD special edition treatment buy it and get yourself one of the greatest action flms ever made.".

Steven Berkhoff plays the Russian bad guy in practically a carbon copy of his role in the James Bond film Octopussy he does it well though he was one of Hollywoods favourite bad guys of the mid 80's you might remember him in Beverly Hills Cop which was a film initially intended for........Sylvester Stallone! This movie has just been giving the DVD special edition treatment buy it and get yourself one of the greatest action flms ever made.";

	schema:reviewBody "The ghost of the Vietnam war has haunted the American psyche for thirty years now. If not because of the fact that tens of thousands of American soldiers went MIA in Vietnam or the manner in which those who returned were treated then because it was the first war that America could be said to have lost. Many men came home from the war a shadow of their former selves and the original First Blood managed to provide a small insight into their problems as they attempted to rotate back into the world as the saying goes. First Blood Part II on the other hand is little more than a fistpumping mess that goes to illustrate how sore America can be both in victory and defeat. Stallone puts in another sluggish performance as the titular Special Forces commando while Richard Crenna attempts to hold up the serious actor quotient. Where it all comes undone is in the script which didn't do any better when it was called Missing In Action and starred Chuck Norris. What little semblance of logic there was in the original is now gone as the filmmakers decide to paint a big S on Rambo's massive chest.The film picks up a little while after the end of First Blood. The film that is  the novel didn't allow for the possibility of sequels. In this mediocre followup Rambo has been put to work at what appears to be some sort of openair mine. As he is breaking rocks and working up a sweat a prison guard pulls him away to go and have a chat with Colonel Trautman who advises him that his government is willing to offer him an early release if he goes on a covert mission. Rambo never one to back down from a hard day's violent work accepts and is promptly shipped off to a covert base in what appears to be Cambodia or Thailand I forget which. From there he is commissioned to seek out a camp where American MIAs are supposedly being held and photograph them. His mission quite clearly specifies that he is not to make any attempt to secure their release. Rambo being Rambo however has other ideas in spite of their possible political implications.Of course things go somewhat awry when it turns out that the people commissioning Rambo's work have more interest in making sure no American MIAs are found. It is the ageold conspiracy theory and makes no apologies for exploiting the plight of many an American family that was left without a son during the ten years that the official Vietnam war had been raging for. Of course with the Jingoism that was inherent in American society during the 1980s they could not help but work in a plot tangent about the Vietnamese army being in bed with what appears to be a single battalion of Russians. Together the two antagonists attempt to extract what information they can from Rambo but it backfires upon them in an orgy of bullets arrows rockets and destruction. About the only thing missing is the moment when Rambo drinks from a graillike chalice and declares himself invincible.To be honest First Blood Part II is a wellphotographed and wellchoreographed action spectacle. The handtohand combat with the larger Russian commander is one of the few battles in the film that has any dramatic tension whatsoever. The rest is simply a case of the lead actor and the director building a fantasy for Americans to pump their fist to. Fortunately this fad of America ber alles action films soon died down when more introspective and intelligent war films such as Platoon began doing the rounds. Some of the kills shown here are quite creative despite all the problems. The Vietnamese commander meets an end that many an action film villain would envy. The Russian commander bites it in a manner that is as spectacular as it is ridiculous. Only in a 1980s action film would one see a LAW being used from inside a helicopter. Sure there have been action film clichs rooted in contradictions of fact but never this ridiculous before.I gave Rambo First Blood Part II a one out of ten. It is so bad it is ridiculous and so ridiculous that it is often funny. One doesn't even need to have served in the military to know how stupid some of the action sequences are. The only risk it takes is in trying to make a stupid political statement with what is a heartbreaking subject for those directly involved. Keep the tongue firmly in the cheek and it might be watchable.".

After the events that have transpired in First Blood we find Rambo breaking rocks I am not making this up inside a Federal Prison somewhere in Mexico the entire movie was filmed there. Col. Trautman offers him a deal with Black Ops. He can either sweat to his heart's content for the rest of his life getting even bigger by breaking rocks or he can go to Mexico I mean Vietnam and settle some old scores I mean take a couple of snaps.Whilst Rambo chooses the easier of the two options the filmmakers give him ample camera time to show off his new ripped body he earned breaking rocks in the Federal Pen. But like all of these movies nothing ever goes like the way they're supposed to. Check out Rambo as he grunts and moans his way into American pop culture. Despite all of the cheesy flag waving and macho dialog Rambo II is a fun popcorn movie. Especially when Charles Napier passes the torch to Sly Stallone. Martin Kove and Richard Dicky Crenna costars as well. Fun for all they should have ended the series here but since this is the 80's well.... Recommended for a few chuckles.P.S. Check out the female lead in this picture. A Eurasian actress who almost becomes Rambo's only love interest in the series! She's kind of hot in a tough girl sort of way.".

The film remains a wonderful example of what the human spirit can achieve if people work as a team. This is not only a testament of a mesmerizing movie but a symbol of how wonderful art can be when artists all contribute their heart to a project. This film is nothing short of a perfect picture and I quote the back of the original 1985 video release One of the greatest films you could ever hope to take home with you If anyone sees any faults with the film I'd certainly like to hear from you. But in 20 years time the 80's will be praised for their superb art and this film will become one of the greatest cult classics ever. Not just because it was successful and impacted the whole world whilst Stallone's career was burning hot but because it justifies how skillful movies can actually become if the people pulling the strings are nothing short of genius.

	schema:reviewBody "Rambo First Blood Part II picks up 3 years after the events of First Blood. John Rambo is in jail for his crimes. Col. Sam Trautman shows up one day and offers Rambo a way out...He must accept a mission to Vietnam to investigate unlikely claims that there are still POWs being held there. He goes in intending to take pictures but when he realizes the claims are true he engages the enemy which angers the mission commander Murdock. He leaves Rambo behind in Vietnam which throws Rambo into another vengeful frenzy. This movie has a better story and way better action than First Blood and is way more entertaining.In mood and style this movie is a lot like First Blood. John Rambo is still a deadly 'Nam vet that's slightly off his rocker and Col. Trautman is still Rambo's only friend whose only purpose is to warn others not to screw with him. One change I didn't like was that in First Blood Rambo was spiteful but in this film he becomes a cheesy God Bless America action hero even though he's still angry about the war. The story was much better this time around and had way more exciting action scenes particularly when Rambo escapes from capture and proceeds to eliminate all of his enemies through various quiet tactics as well as loud destruction. The movie is a cheesy 80's action movie but as long as you're not expecting a masterpiece you'll like it.The acting is the same as the first film. Sylvester Stallone is still just Sylvester Stallone. Richard Crenna is still good as Trautman.Overall Rambo First Blood Part II is a very entertaining action packed film. A classic in the action genre.810".

My father received this movie as a gag gift.  Just by glancing at the cover I had the impression that Rambo movies were nothing but bloodandguts gunsblazing psycho noplotline movies that exist solely for the purpose of making men feel macho.  I hate those movies Steven Segal Chuck Norris etc. But when I popped in this movie out of boredom I was surprisingly pleased.  I'll admit I never saw the first one but this film doesn't really call for it.  It stands on its own.  The plot is gooda little too unrealistic but good the cinematography and scenery is great Stallone may not be the best actor in the world but he PERSONIFIES John Rambo and the aspect that makes the movie worth watching is the fact that a woman was a main character and she was not just there for looks she had an important role and she is portrayed almost as Rambo's equal.  The semihappy ending was cool too.  Although there are many cheezy moments where you just want to roll your eyes there are also many feelgood moments that make the audience cheer for Rambo.  After seeing this film I can understand why it was nominated for an Oscar.".

She is the most important character in the movie apart from Rambo and deserves all respect for the fantastic job she does for freedom.All the action in this movie is very good and Rambo's final quotes will let you speechless. And I understood what is heroism just watching Rambo's attitude on behalf of his fellow soldiers who were brutally tortured by the North Vietnamese communist regime.Perhaps at US public opinion the war was lost but in the battlefield no doubt Americans won overwhelmingly. History will honor the sacrifice of thousands of heroic American youngsters in that war against communist imperialist oppression. This is a mustsee movie.".

But it was taken seriously my many people especially overseas. Silly as it sounds wherever I went in Europe in the late 80's people seemed to judge me and Americans in general by this film. Unrealistic? Hmm let's see. A monosyllabic musclebound cretin is pulled off a prison work gang to go on a secret mission to SE Asia to free some American POW's. In a running battle he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an M60 machine gun that never runs out of ammo and never overheats. And he never misses running with a 32lb gun held up with one arm. I could go on but I'm getting a headache. I gave this a 210 only because it's slightly better than Rambo III.".

Sylvester Stallone as brawny hero Rambo is a previous Green Beret who's forced to go Cambodia in search of American POWs . He frees the American MIAs but Vietcong soldiers sett off in pursuit and Rampo leads his pursuers into all kinds of booby snares  puts dangerous traps in the jungle woods and mountains . Rambo appears threatening  lurking and harassing to his enemies pursuers escaping the innumerable risks and dangers . Rambo is doublecrossed but his former superior Richard Crenna will attempt to help him .From the beginning to the end the comicbook actionpacked and extreme violence is continued and it's fast movement  for that reason the picture is pretty amusing  furthermore contains lots of explosions and some unintentionally comic dialog too . The outdoors are spectaculars  the landscapes have been filmed on location in Acapulco Guerrero Mexico waterfall sceneand in Tecoanapa Guerrero Mexico . Stallone is enormous as the tough and rebel ex soldier and Richard Crenna is top notch as the former trainer officer. Appears notorious secondaries as Martin Kove  Charles Napier Steven Berkoff and screen debut of Julia Nickson  David Soul's wife . Awesome and exceptional cinematography by the classic cameraman Jack Cardiff . Again a splendid and rousing musical score by the great maestro Jerry Goldsmith . The motion picture is preceded by the original First blood by Ted Kotcheff in which Rambo is falsely accused as vagrant and wrongfully imprisoned and he pull off the breakout . And followed by Rambo III with Kurtwood Smith and Spiros Focas and of course Richard Crenna  in which Rambo against the Russians who control a particular sector of Afghanistan and he goes behind Russiandominated enemy lines too rescue his former coroner from jail . The trilogy was a completed by the recent Rambo  a definitive improvement with Julie Benz and directed by the same Stallone in which Rambo fights enemies in Thailand  nevertheless the best considered is the original . The film will appeal to action enthusiast and Stallone fans . It's a movie for adrenaline lovers and frenetic thrillers buffs. Rating  Good entertaining but violent  two thumbs up . This improbable and silly motion picture is professionally directed by George Pan Cosmatos. Although the movie has some aspects a little tough to take  this exciting film still has its moments. This largescale and lavishly produced pic attempts a bemusing atmosphere with spectacular results.".

This won't be enjoyable for many men.But now on to the good things. It's dramatic it's sad it's funny and it combines all those elements with beauty. It's primarily about Kate Andie MacDowell trying to find love. MacDowell stands out in this film. She does have two best friends played by Imelda Staunton and Anna Chancellor but to me they were just annoying and continuously acted inappropriately.But then into Kate's life comes Jed Kenny Doughty. The entire theatre audience sighed as Doughty appeared on the screen. Very handsome and he had the smouldering stare down pat as he melted our hearts. I had predicted that he would go on to be a star and that might still happen but slowly as he toils around in some small roles.The film was shot beautifully with the location in England being spectacular. The filmmakers also made a number of beautiful subtle contrasts to the men in Kate's life. These filmmakers definitely know how to make a great film. Too bad they don't know how to write characters very well. Andie MacDowell's Kate is the only great character unless you count Kenny Doughty's looks.Crush is not for men and only for fans of Andie MacDowell Kenny Doughty and technically superb and beautiful filmmaking.".

For once the director of a MacDowell film did not make her beauty another character in the film. The romance between Kate and her young man is lovely to watch and it plays out very well. Her relationship with her friends is both a thorn and a balm in her life. Imelda Stalinson who has been a MVP in so many British films does a great job in this. There is some tragedy in this but I think the film is saved in the end by the brilliant acting clean direction and witty writing.The film quality is excellent and the music is good too though unavailable on sound track.".

Her relationship with her friends is both a thorn and a balm in her life. Imelda Stalinson who has been a MVP in so many British films does a great job in this. There is some tragedy in this but I think the film is saved in the end by the brilliant acting clean direction and witty writing.The film quality is excellent and the music is good too though unavailable on sound track.";

The film is nicely filmed with lovely scenery and swift cinematography. The performances from the three leads Andie McDowell Imelda Staunton and Anna Chancellor were believable in their roles and there is a decent supporting turn from Bill Patterson. The music is lovely too and the direction from firsttime director John McKay is average.However the film has several failings namely the weak characterisations despite the actors' stellar performances. The script is implausible at best and lacked wit. The plot is also predictable and contrived in places that has been done many times and better and there are uneven transitions from comedy into tragedy though there are many valiant attempts. There was a scene where Molly says to Kate I can smell man on you and I just wondered whether that was rather inappropriate to say that to another woman. There is a lack of chemistry between Kate and Jed and the conclusion of the film is rather unsatisfying. All in all good but could have been better. 610 Bethany Cox".

I'm a gal I watched this film with two guys and we spent an hour afterwards exclaiming over how bad it was.WARNING PLOT SUMMARY BELOW!

They want her to marry a boring guy their own age who is kind of in love with her. But she's so happy with her oversexed puppy that you're rooting for them to stick it out and sure enough she decides to marry the guy. But her harpy girlfriend aided by the wishywashy one sets up a plot to trick our heroine into thinking the guy is cheating on her. It works. She has a fight with him he runs out of the house and is crushed by a truck Remember the movie's title? So now he's dead twothirds of the way through the film. And although our heroine is a school headmistress who spends her time watching over girls she apparently forgot to use birth control and is pregnant.She's already broken off relations with her girlfriends because they were so unsupportive. Alone and pitiful she decides to marry the boring guy. Did I mention that the boring guy who kind of loves her is a minister? She had asked him to marry her to the young guy nice huh? but now she tells him she'll marry him and apparently he has no objections to being dicked around in this fashion. But her girlfriends rescue her at the altar and take her home where they notquiteconfess that they were mostly responsible for the love of her life getting smushed. She has the kid. In the final scene they leave it in a crib inside her house while they go out on the porch to drink smoke and be smug. I kid you not it's that bad.

	schema:reviewBody "What started as a funny story of three women in their 40's going thru a kind of middle life crisis and their bad relationships with men then turns serious when an unusual romance blossoms for one of them. The relationship develops unexpectedly well the characters seem real. The young man who's the love interest delivers some surprising twists and it's all very believable.

She also has the most delicious and engaging smile.I was very much enjoying Crush up until that tragedy came out of left field so angering me that I yelled at the screen. I actually felt betrayed after becoming so swept up in all the joy and romantic eroticism beforehand. There could have been all sorts of adversity for the couple to face without the great plotshifting finality as written. This is the only reason I can't count the film as a true favorite.Still there's that one pivotal magical scene in which Andie's character first meets her former student as a strapping adult. When he asks her barely suggestively if he could get her anything Andie provides the most wonderful and telling expression her eyes soften and her jaw slowly drops with breathy desire  longsuppressed desire  and without a word she speaks volumes about her deep well of longing and the smoldering lust that is overcoming her in the moment...she is a vital beautiful woman and her needs can no longer be ignored. Jump cut to the teacher wellmounted behind some bushes and you have the cinematic equivalent of orgasmic abandon all done quite politely. I still become uh...quite moved by the memory of it.".

The other is a Doctor who is angry foul mouthed and cynical and as it turns out spiteful.At a funeral Andie runs into an old pupil of hers some 16 years her junior who happens to be the Organist. Before the re introductions are barely over they're shagging in the Cemetery. This is the kind of movie this is. Hedonism is King or is it Queen? She decides that this is a man story she'll keep secret from the girls but it's soon out and they are not pleased. The Doctor seems jealous while the cop seems concerned by the age and class difference. Although why a cop should pull the class difference issue is beyond me! SPOILER When Andie makes the decision to marry him the friends pull out all the stops to divert her to no avail. At this point I said to my wife I bet they the writers kill him off. Sure enough the Doctor convinces the cop to have her video her seducing the boyfriend. Andie walks in on the seduction which unknown to her has failed and storms out. In the ensuing fight she kicks him out and he is run over by a truck while sitting in the road trying to put his boots on.That's the first two thirds and it's not bad. The lines are often witty if a little to self consciously so but it seems as if we are going to attack the May  September love affair issue head on. It is not to be. The message is instead to be about how friends make up after screwing one of their own. Which would be fine if there had been a serious attempt to do so. Instead the seriocomedy goes all comedy and darkly so! Andie walls herself off from her friends and then in a colossal show of thoughtless dishonesty she sets up the school's vicar to marry her. By this time we have seen her get sick and know she's pregnant and assume she is perhaps seeking a father for the child through subterfuge. As it turns out Andie has not only become deceitful she has also become stupid as she is unaware she is pregnant! The friends decide to intervene again but this time for a good cause. No matter that Andie has set a man up for an emotional crash but now her friends add poison to the gruel and have her arrested at the altar by none other than her cop friend and her willing bobbies.Off they go to the Doctor's office where the pregnancy is revealed and in a quick unconvincing scene all is forgiven. A bad taste in the mouth is the ending! People behaving badly and stupidly and learning not a wit from it!".

I thought it was a pretty good movie until I begin to see what was really happening between Andie McDowell's character Kate and her friend Anna Chancellor's character Molly. At first I thought Molly was just bitter against men because she had been in a number of crummy marriages and while that may be part of the problem the real truth of the matter is that she has a HUGE crush on Kate. This explains the lengths she goes through to keep any man away from Kate. Molly is a lesbian whose loyalties lie with women which may explain the failures of her three marriages and her lesbian tendencies come out at near the end of the movie when she kisses the other woman at the medics party. This confirmed for me what I had been suspecting all along that Molly was a gay character in this movie and she wanted Kate from the beginning. Molly is very domineering and controlling with her friend Janine in whom she has no sexual interest but rather she uses Janine as pawn to help constantly interfere in and destroy Kate's relationships. Molly initiates the breakup of any love interest Kate may express in a man and being Kate's doctor she also has access to Kate's body. The director was very clever in very subtly showinghiding this lesbian aspecttriangle of the film but lesbianism is the fantsy of most males even directors. As we can see love between women is not always a pretty or sexy sight.".

Can you imagine a screenwriter actually submitting a script with this plot element?  Up to then its a comedy that intends to be frothy but lacks any real fizz.  Everybody but Jed is just annoying.  And then they kill Jed and everybody's sad until the end where the gals learn to love one another and be supportive instead of destructive.  I give it 2 ugh's.";

And MacDowell's performance is strikingly fabulous. Yep good solid acting that should receive an Oscar nod! Her facial expressions and her physical appearances are wonderfully coherent with the different stages of her moods and condition. Anna Chancellor and Imelda Stauntan are well casted in their roles to support the events that follow Kate.Amazingly beautiful shots of a neat English village credibly filled with an air of prim and pomp. Yep an English countryside filled with uniformed school children and stuffy villagers including a shy old village vicar! Yep the quaint sort of population who will break into whispers over the minutest scandal!  Guess what? If you think Kate's relationship is a societal taboo how then would you define Molly and Janine's final success with love!The movie is fastpaced. Even the flashbacks work well as an important reminder to Kate and Jed's relationship. There are some edgy moments to the story that help prevent boredom to seep into the plot. And thumbs up to its originality. I was totally absorbed. Even the ending does work to sum up the whole!".

It is blessed with a fine cast of actors and has the courage to take a comedic start and turn it into a tragic mode without destroying the main theme of the special friendship among a small group of women. Kate Scales Andie MacDowell is a headmistress of a private school in a smallish English town and is close friends with policewoman Janine Imelda Staunton and physician Molly Cartwright Anna Chancellor each of the women is in the 40s range of age and each is single their social life is meeting together for booze smoking and gossip and competing by putting themselves down for having the worst faux pas with men. Kate encounters a young former student of hers Jed Willis Kenny Doughty as he plays the organ for funerals. There is a mutual attraction and soon they are having a frequent physical relationship. Jed is sincerely in love with Kate but Kate feels the 20 some odd year difference in their ages in an insurmountable gap  though she is passionately attracted to Jeb. When Kate shares her 'affair' with Molly and Janine her friends are appalled and set out to destroy a relationship they feel is completely wrong and doomed to failure. Molly and Janine take extreme measures to see to it that the couple is broken up and their intentions result in a tragedy they all must face. The repercussions of this behavior creates a whole new set of circumstances and despite the tragic elements the friends are able to reunite by film's end  with very clear discoveries about each other and changes in each of their lives. There is a lot of well written and well delivered humor in the first half of the film with the trio of women creating a bond that seems to be ceaselessly entertaining. The introduction of Jed  played to perfection by the very talented Kenny Doughty  changes the theme of the story and while many viewers will feel negative about the turn of events there is here a chance for the examination of the spectrum of friendship that is solidly written and performed. What seems to be a bit of fluff movie develops into a psychological study that makes it stand above many other 'chick flick' comedies. Grady Harp".

I felt that the score worked very well with the emotion of the changing scenes adopting at least twice the simple motif of a quiet sustained note that abruptly heralded silence the song whose lyrics I had thought to have been always central had not been. I also gathered that the film had been edited from around 180 minutes to 102 with the result Verena said that the complexion of what happened after the initial location in Berlin had changed much.As the other Verena commented Maryam Zaree's performance as a hardpressed mother Pelin was very strong and I found that Tilla Kratochwil's Christa for all that she seemed dominating and hidebound gave her real scope for being near someone with different experiences and for them to learn from each other.However I am not quite sure that the trajectory of Pelin's story is really as set out in the Festival brochure and I do not know where in life she may be heading at the close but she certainly desires to change her position if she can be allowed to do so  that is one of the very heartening things about this film that we are shown her being given a chance and also that healing and forgiveness can take place. Alongside those things we also witness selfinterest being a motivating force and the fact that trying to shake off past ties brings new problems.Thinking about the issues that lead to the family's seaside placement made me wonder whether the story could have fitted in the UK. The concerns portrayed would certainly have brought the same attention to bear on Pelin's behaviour as a mother and she might if very lucky have had a social worker who was prepared to work with her to make things better for her children on the basis of a profession and evidence of a willingness to change. Even some sort of respite is sometimes possible but maybe not so easily on the coast because of funding so this is not a scenario unique to Germany and not say Cambridge but perhaps what it would miss is the tendency to a specially German propriety about how life should be conducted.That however is not what I shall take from this film Maryam's expressiveness and the fatigue with which she battles her care however wayward for her children her interactions with Chista and her sheer exuberance when she breaks the rules and goes out dancing  oh and her utter convincingness as someone who tattoes 'inks' others and believes in herself and in that sort of statement.".

Am I an undercover cop are You an organized criminal? The movie Abgefahren is such a nice example of a gasolinedriven film which is in fact characterdriven. The way the girl and the cute! boy heat each other up with their witty dialogs is exhilarating. They seem to be like a cat and a dog both too proud to admit that they love each other both wanting to be strong and cool and on the other hand longing to embrace each other. Can You imagine Hepburn sitting in a Dodge and Tracy sitting in a Cobra arguing about who is the better driver? No? Well watch Abgefahren!".

The cars are also excellent. Director Jakob Schuffelen does love those hero shots but in this film it works fine because it is such a playful story. Sonja Rom's cinematography is as usual excellent. On the downside for the Englishspeaking audience the current DVD only has the film in German with no subtitles or other languages. That's too bad because I think this film could appeal to a wider audience. Abgefahren may not be classic cinema but sometimes all you want is to be entertained and Abgefahren does the trick.".

	schema:reviewBody "Abgefahren I will spare you the several German alternate titles is a German 85minute film from 2004 so this one will have its 15th anniversary next year. The director is Jakob Schuffelen and for this Bavarian filmmaker it is among his most known works for sure and same can probably be said about the three writers who worked on the script for this one. Yes indeed it took no less than three writers to come up with this horrible script here. But first things first The central character is played by Felicitas Woll and I am always a bit undecided about her and how talented she is. She has some decent films in her body of work but for every solid work there is also at least one pretty bad film in there too if not more. The rest of the cast are not particularly known and even the biggest German film buffs will have a hard time recognizing their faces. If you understand the play on words in the German title then you will realize that this is another German film with major focus on cars and car racing a long long time after stuff like Manta Manta for example. But maybe they should not have tried to revive this genre as it turned out really a gigantic mess here. The only real conflict in here is what should be considered worst the lame car racing sequences the horrible romance plot the conflicts between the bitchy girls the irritating and constantly changing behavior by the protagonist in terms of who she wants to hang out with or the fact that this film actually dares to take itself seriously for the most part. Impossible to make a definite statement. I guess it all comes down to your personal preference and subjective taste in order to determine what you despise the most. Oh yeah nice try too with the admittedly pretty hot lesbian kissing scene between Woll's character and Tenge's character but sadly this reference really makes obvious that they really weren't scared to include anything in order to make money by getting people to theaters and if the writers don't have the talent for depth and authentic character development than at least get them horny and lets include pointless sex references on several occasions. This is a horrible film with low production values in all key areas. I highly recommend to skip this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Germany 1910 after a true story ... In deepest prussian Germany at the beginning of the 20th century the shoemaker Wilhelm Voigt Heinz Rhmann is released from prison where he spent most of his lifetime. By nature never truly a bad guy but someone who kept over water by smalltime swindling he mostly got unlucky and repeatedly went to jail. Generally of good will he spent his time there working and learning everything he could. In a military influenced society and era like this the scholarylessons were dominated by army knowledge which one would actually call meaningless for civil life. Particularly today everybody would fear any such knowledge in the hands of civilians as a basis for terroristactions. Now on the edge to retirement Voigt gets his pardon and goes free the law knows he's too old to commit serious crimes. Equipped only with the releasing paper of the Ministry Of Justice he tries to get back into life eager to finish it as a decent working man. But the paper though stamped and typed by the legal authorities ain't accepted nowhere as a passport and isn't even meant to be swapped into one not even at any communal registration office. And without passport no job! Without registered employment no passport! A vicious circle... Weeks of unregistered residence later the order to leave the country hits Voigt like a nail to the temple. Desperate about the authorities oppression he roams the streets and comes to a pawnshop. He spots an abandoned captain's uniform which in this film has had an own interesting story in the window and puts his last money down for it. His age and the scholary lessons from prison make him appear like an experienced veteran the uniform does a perpetuing job in the streets where no one would ever dare to question it's bearer. Even soldiers of lower rank submit to the uniform and the harsh commanding voice of the shoemaker who's sharpest weapon was that he simply had nothing more to loose. The uniformed Voigt hijacks a coincidentally patrolling imperial platoon and orders them to the cityhall of Kpenick a suburb of the capitol Berlin. Under his command they set the building under siege while Voigt intends to get a couple of minutes alone at the registrationoffice to issue himself a real passport. That's when the true HighCommand gets aware of the incident. Heinz Rhmann  who in his prime may have been for the Germans what Tom Hanks is for Americans these days shows the essence of his actingnature here a humorous always kindhearted simple man with a tragic halo who is nevertheless willing to find his place in life and to do anything for that except harming other people. Der Hauptmann von Kpenick is a brilliant and disarming masterpiece about the naive militarymania and the ridiculousness of blind obedience to uniforms and is generally even valuable about it these days. It also accuses the monstrous prussian bureaucracy which is also criticiseable even today and which still refuses to see the human beings behind all the documents.Ever since the original incident from 1906 in German gossip the term Kpenickade is used to describe masquerades mainly to cheat authorities andor to accomplish something which is actually your right but which you can't accomplish the straight way. But it is only used in these contexts when nobody came to harm.From this factbased theaterplay by novelist Carl Zuckmayer there've been numerous screen or TVadaptions. You actually only need this one. Pronounced KoPanicUhDe".

And it certainly is the most known movie by Helmut Kutner who directed here and also adapted the literary work this is based on. And with Rhmann the film got one of the most known German actors from that time probably the number one. This 90minute film is a pretty good example of how Rhmann transitioned more and more from pure comedy to pure drama of course with how he also gives his subtly funny approach to his characters. However I must say that even if I enjoyed the watch I would say agree with another reviewer who said that this is not among Rhmann's best performances and also not among his best films. I was not really that impressed here. There were some moments that were good of course and overall I also believe the good outweighs the bad but an Academy Award nomination may have been a bit too much. Still the best thing about the film is the acting as the movie is a bit of style over substance in some other areas. All in all a cautious thumbsup from me. Oh yeah final note it is in color which is not a given looking at how this was made 60 years ago. There were many blackandwhite films from Germany from that era too.".

I see this movie has only had one review and a few votes since it came on this site. That is a crying shame because this movie needs to be seen by every single person alive. The willful absence of major companies such as Coke Pepsi and Nestle is extremely telling in light of all the material presented.

It's an expos of champion reporting. Some will likely put the propaganda label on Tapped however and one could split those hairs insomuch as it's predisposed to a certain alliance. But the information is indisputable unlike the propaganda of today that functions to make us believe what its makers don't believe themselves. Tapped joins the crusade to battle corporate Goliaths who have milked local water supplies to sell it in toxic bottles sometimes during droughts that constrain towns to rigorously limit their own water use.We're first brought to Fryeburg where one day their standard of living is as it's been for generations and the next day enormous trucks roll in. Without any prior communication Nestle just silently procured land to tap for water and since then they've been rolling those trucks in and out extracting from the local spring but paying no taxes to recover the community. And unlike other trades they're not even required to purchase resources to make their product save for those plastic bottles made by petroleum factories with cancercausing constituents.All effective modern documentaries seem to need statistical facts presented in graphic design effects to give their allegations a source. And in an age of instant gratification they must. Conservative Libertarians want to know what's wrong with someone making a buck? Well just 1 of the water that envelops 75 of the planet is drinkable. A year before this documentary was finished there was a drought in 35 of 50 States. No water no life. The first words said in Tapped are By 2030 twothirds of the world will not have access to clean drinking water.During a Raleigh drought Pepsi kept hauling over 400000 gallons a day. How are such reckless actions possible in a democracy? Well the FDA we gather from intense footage of Senate hearings relies on tests run by the companies themselves! Meanwhile one FDA penpusher is accountable for supervision of the entire industry. Put in closeup and faced with facts we ultimately even hear the FDA publicist telling Soechtig that if he'd known this was the course the interview was to take he wouldn't have agreed to grant the interview. Why does the FDA even need a publicist?A visit to Corpus Christi familiarizes us with residents who live within miles of the factory producing the plastic bottles used by the big three water manufacturers. All have health troubles. The more you watch the more scared and livid you become. American industry has been reduced to a criminal kingdom over the last thirty years but the bottled water industry has clearly avoided greater scrutiny. Hopefully that's changing.

	schema:reviewBody "Some time ago I had a constructive debate with my sister who is just finishing her biogenetic study with straight 10's if I may add on the topic of tapped and bottled water. She was the first person to made me think over this and frighteningly also their tests of PET bottles as well as other EU countries showed the same result as we can see in the documentary. Its bad enough that we all know the excessive use of plastic which is an oil bye product is ruining our natural habitat and our living environment but its also affecting our health since the corporations care for profits over our health and preserving nature. If you disagree hard with this documentary than I guess its time to open your eyes and stop thinking narrow minded as the earth is not here just so this extremely greedy generation could rape her all over again.Documentary mostly focuses on the USA tapped water but since the industry is driven by world corporations its still a good example probably what's happening all over. And since the USA have by my opinion one of the most corruptible government  corporation relationship its a good example what could be there for us all in near future if people will not start thinking a bit out of the box. And I would not agree with some of the comments that says the documentary is biased. If you watch it carefully you will see there are quite some interviews or inserts that shows how unregulated this business really is.Most recommended for ALL viewers and ages. 1010".

	schema:headline " Taking our water for free and selling it back to us";
	schema:reviewBody "This incredibly shocking documentary and the similar documentary BLUE GOLD 2008 see my review made by a different team need to be seen by anyone interested in whether the human species will survive. One would think all humans would be interested in this question but so stupid are some people that they actually are not interested which is perhaps why our survival is really under threat namely that the human species contains such a very large proportion of idiots. It used to be said of a boring person that he was 'like a long drink of water'. Well the ways things are going long drinks of water are going to be in such short supply that we'll never be able to use that expression again. This film unlike BLUE GOLD limits itself to the United States and the Pacific Ocean. The film shows in detail that public water is being taken by big corporations like Nestle CocaCola and PepsiCola at the rate of millions of gallons per day bottled and then sold back to us as 'bottled water' at 10000 times profit. And the idiot politicians who allow this seem to think it is OK perhaps because their wallets have increased by 10000 times as well for being 'friendly' to the ruthless corporations. The toothless useless Food and Drug Administration FDA has only one member of staff working halftime on the regulation of bottled water production in America! 70 of all bottled water in the USA is sold within the same state so does not come under federal jurisdiction anyway. The remaining 30 is required to be tested but the test results are not required to be filed with the FDA or divulged to anyone and can remain secret within the private files of the corporations. So while municipal free water supplies are tested sometimes as often as 400 times a day bottled water is effectively never tested. It often contains dangerous chemicals and contaminants. Since 1989 when bottled water began to become available in plastic bottles which are made from petroleum at refineries the bottled water for sale has often been full of deadly carcinogenic chemicals leeching out of the plastic into the water. The main dangerous chemicals are PET PETE and BPA bisphenol A. Of these BPA is the deadliest. So what does this mean? It means that water which is free 70 of all bottled water in the USA comes from municipal free water supplies and not from springs or wells! is taken in gigantic quantities by large corporations bottled in poisonous plastic bottles and then sold to the public at a huge profit under the phoney pretext that it is 'safe' but if municipal water is 'unsafe' why is 70 of bottled 'safe' water merely 'unsafe water' in a poisonous bottle?. But that is not the end of the story. The bottles are then all thrown away and make their way onto beaches and into the oceans. This is billions of plastic bottles per year. The Pacific Ocean for instance has a huge area larger than Texas known as a gyre which is just a vast sea of plastic. Every ocean has at least one such gyre. All the fish and other wildlife turtles seabirds etc. of the oceans are being killed by the plastic. In other words bottled water is now one of the greatest threats to the planet but even more urgently it is one of the greatest threats to people. Don't you think it would be ironic if the human species ceased to exist because of bottled water? Wouldn't that just be the funniest of all cosmic jokes? For a species as stupid as humans this is only fitting that they should die with neither a bang nor a whimper but with a pathetic feeble gurgle. This film was produced by the same people who made WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR? 2006. The directors of this one are Stephanie Soechtig and Jason Lindsey both of whom also cowrote it with Josh David. They clearly had a much bigger budget and team than the people who made BLUE GOLD. Both films and their DVD 'extras' need to be seen together. They do not duplicate but rather they complement each other. And I shall here add something which I included in my review of BLUE GOLD As Ford Madox Ford said in the February 1924 issue of The Transatlantic Review of which he was editor 'That one should stand by and observe without a note of warning the sure shadow of doom engulfing a civilisation would be to display an equanimity passing the power of most men.'".

	schema:headline " I watch tapped and drank it all up! It's a wellmade documentary.";
	schema:reviewBody "The great debate of bottle water vs tap water got bottle up and release as a wellstructured aweinspiring documentary call Tapped. Directed by Stephanie Soechtig  Jason Lindsey the movie shows the environmental injustice aspects of bottled water. While the movie is indeed onesided and can seem biased. The movie does give a chance for bottle water supporters to defend their product. It was deeply surprising to see representative from these big companies as in most documentaries they mostly refuse to speak. I do think their interviews was edited a bit to make them look dumbfounded to certain questioning or expose them as spin doctors. It was bit too trickery. The movie had a lot of good amount of evidence sources. The way the documentary told it through interviews music datagraphs and video footage made watching the film very entertaining. While the movie did indeed had a bigger budget there were little to no slow lectures parts here. It's clear that tap water is indeed better for you than bottle water. The movie shows us why but you can clearly go research it yourself and you find yourself with the same results as the movie. I think a lot of people need to watch this film as one of the big reasons why people purchase bottled water is due to the old wives tales inaccuracies. These claims are often create by companies to set fear into the public so that the community would purchase overprice water over nearly free drinking water. This is a great example how fear can somewhat dictate somebody's life. While yes there are some proved facts that some tap water in certain areas are contamination. For the most part even for the lowincome  minority households tap water is deed safer than bottle water in developed countries like the US  Europe. Bottled water are believe to reduce amounts of copper lead and other metal contaminants since it does not run through the plumbing pipes where tap water is exposed to metal corrosion however this varies by the household and plumbing system. Bottle water often carry similar or worst off chemicals such as PET PETE and BPA bisphenol A. Of these BPA is the deadliest. This is because due to the lack of regulated by the company. It's not as regulated as often as tap water. One thing the film also forgot to mention is the alarming rate for bottled water in poorer developing countries. Sales of bottled water in Mexico China and parts of India are rising steeply due to fear of contaminated water. In my viewpoint bottle water and tap water have the same health risk in those countries due to the fact that most bottle water are indeed tap water. While I don't believe people that should buy bottle water I do understand the reasons why certain people choice to. The lack of safe drinking water in certain areas should be the only reason to buy bottled water. Even so I have to agree that plastic tax has be put into place to help recycled the plastic and stop wasteful trashing. Better yet people should learn how to purification their own water supply which the film also left off. The movie also left out the religious questions of if the 'privatization of water is ethical. One thing that the movie should explore more is the myth is the taste of water because it was one of the contributing factors to the marketing success of bottled water. Pure water has no taste. However minerals and impurities can alter or add to the taste but it's not very noticeable. Most bottle waters misleads its consumers with this false advertising. While the movie gave a lot of information that can be useful for years to come. It's somewhat already dated. If you want more information about the debate of tap water over bottle water. Watch 2003's Penn  Teller episode on bottle waters to get more information about this. Also check out 2008's Blue Gold World Water Wars 2010's Water on the table and 2008's Flow For Love of Water. All of them are very good and worth the time watching. Overall I would recommend this documentary to anyone willing to sit down and think about their future. Indeed water will play a big role in that.".

I have probably bought bottled water maybe a dozen times in my entire life. It was only when there was no other option to get any other sort of water or I needed a bottle to fill up w god forbid tap water! I cannot understand for the life of me why Bottled water is a business at all. It is after all nothing more than a giant scam. It simply amazes me that this is a 10 billion dollar or more industry. How is this possible? There is a great Penn  Teller BullSht that proves just what a joke it really is. They test a bunch of people drinking bottled waters against regular ol' tap water  guess what 810 of them went for the tap water! The thing that will upset you the most is the way the Nestle company continued to bottle water in Maine while they are in the middle of a drought! So basically these people all had to ration there water so that Nestle could continue to bottle their water. Now I understand to a certain extent the companies side too because it's a huge boon to them considering they are upping the price by 9999 so it's an obvious cash cow. Plus you have to imagine even if it is a joke people are buying it  it must help wjobs  wthe local economy too. Overall it seems really stupid but there are good arguments on both sides of the fence.".

Spring water from a certified spring purified water must measure 10 parts per million or less of ANYTHING in the water distilled etc.2. they fail to mention why BPA is used in the bottles or in any plastic to strengthen and keep the bottles from failing part. I've seen bottles over 20 years old just as solid as the day made. So how can all this horrible chemical be leaching out of the container.3. the overwhelming majority of bottled water is consumed out of bottles that do not contain BPA they are PETE bottles no BPA involved.4. In another anti plastic movie Plastic Paradise the cute little Asian chick wants to demonstrate how horrible it is to drink out of plastic bottles because of the horrific dangers of BPA. SOOOOO she gets a blood test done to measure her currant BPA levels THEN she handles a THERMAL STORE RECEIPT then gets another blood test. Unh? What? Wait a minute. Why doesn't she drink out of a plastic bottle? Because the majority of BPA in people comes from other sources far more insidious than plastic water bottles. Another documentary goes further by locating people who have NEVER drank bottled water and yet they have elevated levels of BPA in their systems.5. The FDA the GUVMINT is trying to kill us by NOT banning BPA the GUVMINT allows the chemical companies to kill us with pollution from oil and bottle making processes but we are to trust the GUVMINT when they send tap water to your house? I mean they put CHLORINE in the stuff to KILL THINGS!! But THAT'S OK to drink because the GUVMINT says so? No thanks. I'll stick to drinking bottled water from reliable sources.Ask yourself where does Coke Dasani and Pepsi Aquafina get the water for their soda? And how come it tastes consistently the same from coast to coast given that over 700 different containment are found in tap water across the country? Do you really believe they would allow the nasty water say in LA spoil the taste of their magic formulas for their products? Reverse Osmosis is what they use amongst other processes to make sure the water is a neutral as possible.Just do you homework. In many areas there are water stores that process city water through Reverse Osmosis filtration systems that remove virtually all contaminants from the water.The GUVMINT and a lot of these environazis are in bed together more than you realize and do not want you to drink bottled water.

	schema:reviewBody "'Be Kind Rewind' has already become one of my favourite films of the year. It's funny. It's charming. It's nostalgic. It's awkward. It's unique and it's moving. The entrance of DVDs to our lives have lead to the rapid extinction of video cassettes but does one remember the days of renting collecting and watching those big tapes? Rewinding them and forwarding them? Something small but one that I find fascinating. While 'Be Kind Rewind' pays respect to that generation it's also a wonderful tribute to filmmaking in general. All the classic movies and blockbusters this film refers to are some of the most memorable movies that played during the VHS days and in a way 'Be Kind Rewind' is a superb homage to those films. Just watch all the sweded 'refilming' of for example 'Driving Miss Daisy' with Danny Glover and Mia Farrow 'Ghostbusters' and 'Rush Hour 2' with Jack Black and Mos Def...and so many more hilarious surprises. 'Be Kind Rewind' also explores what it is about cinema that fascinate the ordinary man.Gondry's writing is just as great as his direction. Everything fits together excellently. The comedy and drama blend smoothly. Michel Gondry's screenplay is impeccable. The dialogues are laugh out loud and never out of place. The characters are genuinely heartwarming goofy and lovable.The performances are heartfelt and fantastic. A wacky Jack Black an endearing Mia Farrow who's a science fiction fan a very impressive Mos Def I was very impressed by his comic timing a humbly naive Danny Glover a vivacious Melonie Diaz Sigourney Weaver as an inspector in charge with a touch of comedy and many more talented actors make a terrific ensemble.Gondry has tackled a lot of themes like a strong sense of community people's love for movies people being accustomed to old technology as a result to which they sometimes have difficulty moving on to more updated sources reviving loved artists who have vanished into oblivion and the overall sense of doing something great together like the last movie on Fat Waller's life. He tells the story skillfully. I liked that it ended on a bittersweet note but somewhat ambiguously. I was having so much fun and laughing out loud so many times that I didn't even care if it bothered other people.Many people seem to have trashed this movie because it wasn't like 'Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind'. I'd like to tell those people to get over it. How can people even begin to compare too totally different films and then call one of them trash for not being like the other? I love both movies and to me with 'Be Kind Rewind' Gondry proves to be a versatile director and my appreciation for him as a filmmaker has only increased.".

	schema:reviewBody "Michel Gondry is a very talented filmmaker especially when it comes to visuals. His music videos and films go beyond simple video marvels into a world of simple visual trickery. This is something Gondry is very good at. Furthermore he has a do it yourself mantra when it comes to filmaking. He's not into the marvels of CGI. He's more into what you can do without it.But it takes a little more than visual trickery to make a film a success. Be Kind Rewind is a prime example. The film starts off well enough. Mos Def helps run a video store owned by Danny Glover's character. The store is probably one of the last remaining stores catering to VHS. Jack Black is Mos Def's left of center friend who works at an electrical plant. Through some plan to sabotage the plant he becomes magnetic erasing all the tapes.Our heroes are forced to rerecord the movies and do it through a process called sweding producing 1015 minute versions of the film using a wide array of do it yourself techniques that Gondry himself has utilized in his work. An example is a simple trick where filming through a fan makes the film look old. All of this is fun. The way the guys try to truncate the film's stories into a little time or their lack of knowledge regarding some films like Driving Miss Daisy. the crude effects are fun and are prime examples of why we love Michel Gondry.The downside to the film is the script penned by Gondry. Clearly the film is built around the sweded films. But I was starting to think that watching the sweded films would've been more fun than watching Be Kind Rewind itself. Gondry never fully fleshes out his characters or resolves some of the subplots. The visuals are fun but when Gondry's forced to wrap up the movie it becomes a little sporadic and we start to realize the the film doesn't go much beyond its rich concept.There is something great to take away from this film. And while I have some reservations about the film my recommendation for the film is based on Gondry's filmaking vision. That is to say there is clearly a joy of filmaking associated with Gondry that will have me continue to look forward to his work. If you're not sure what I mean take a look at his promotional materials or at his other short films. The man loves filmaking and has fun with this movie. However I'd recommend he build an alliance with some good screenwriters that would help his visions become fully realized and not just good natured diversions as this film is.".

Some moments are very funny others not so much but this is not supposed to be a Farrelly Bros. kind of flick. With a simple but very compelling idea Gondry created a story about people's love for movies the sense of community the compulsion for memories the oblivion of oldtime artists the Fats Waller subplot and oldfashioned technology should Glover finally adhere to DVDs?. Gondry said in an interview I am not against modern things. I use technology but what I am against is when the technology creates a system that makes you believe you need to use it. I couldn't agree more. By the end even though not being a masterpiece like Eternal Sunshine Be Kind Rewind leaves you with the bittersweet feeling of other movies about our love for filmmaking more notably The Purple Rose of Cairo by the way Mia Farrow plays the video store's most loyal customer and Cinema Paradiso. Definitely worth seeing. 810.".

By the end even though not being a masterpiece like Eternal Sunshine Be Kind Rewind leaves you with the bittersweet feeling of other movies about our love for filmmaking more notably The Purple Rose of Cairo by the way Mia Farrow plays the video store's most loyal customer and Cinema Paradiso. Definitely worth seeing. 810.";

Michael Gondry did a more than exceptional job to capture the tone of this film which i'll describe as oldschool and scraggly. Jack Black once again played the same part he usually does just a funny weird dude Mos Def did a real nice job a lot better than I expected after seeing him in Hitchikers Guide to The Galaxy. Danny Glover was really great. But the thing I loved about this film is that it was so different from the usual clich comedy. The movie does have some flaws but what the heck just go see it and relax. Its not supposed to be a Citezen Kane. Overall the film was real fun and actually a little touching so go see it. I recommend it for sure. Real Fun!!".

	schema:headline " Gondry lays out another visual feast";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the latest brainchild of Michel Gondry the one time video maker turned director of 'Eternal Sunshine..' and 'The Science of Sleep' and once again there's a visual feast on offer. On many levels this is just a clever comedy but on many others its much more than that it is a homage to filmmaking as a whole the death of artistry in the face of technology the sense of community that cinemas can bring in a world where cinema is struggling against the internet and apathy. Jack Black and Mos Def play at odds friends who have an outlet running the local video store 'Be Kind Rewind' with the huge DVD emporium down the road the business is struggling and in danger of being pulled down to make way for condos. After a freak accident wipes all the tapes in the shop the pair decide to remake all the films rather than get caught and lose the shop and this then is where Gondry et al step up to the mark and let their imaginations run wild with hilarious consequences. The first film they make is 'Ghostbusters' and it sets the premises of what is to come as they do their own versions of 'Robocop Lion King Rush Hour 2 and Men in Black to name but a few. Black and Def play off each other really well but it's the ingenuity in the sets and lofi costumes that make all these little twenty minute 'Swedes' The tapes are described as having come from Sweden as an excuse for higher rental fees and longer wait times brilliantly funny. They are even available to watch online and you're also encouraged to make your own! The story is for want of a better word silly and my only criticism I have is that Gondry tends to be too whimsical and over idealistic at times but that said he is portraying a fantasy world where he can play like a child with bits of old rubbish and sticky back plastic and come up with stunning arty creations that shine on screen. With so much subject matter to work with Gondry picks films that he is sure most people will have seen although I hadn't seen 'Rush Hour 2' and so struggled to find all of that section funny so on the off chance you haven't seen any of the films being Sweded you may wonder what the hell is going on. Be Kind.. is not a new story or even a new idea but it has new things to say about the state of the industry copyright law and ownership that hide subtly below the comedy and it is so full of visual ideas it's a film you could quite easily watch again. Not as dark as 'Eternal Sunshine' and slightly better than 'Science of Sleep' Gondry is proving he can do aesthetically great lofi films without the lure of CGI or the Hollywood big budget. Like the war between VHS tapes and DVDs Gondry is taking on the big boys and coming out relatively unscathed.".

	schema:headline " Black and Def are excellent but the rest of the film is just disappointing";
	schema:reviewBody "Just reading a brief synopsis got me fairly hyped for Be Kind Rewind. The film was written and directed by Michel Gondry who directed my favourite movie in the last five years Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind so it was a nobrainer that this would be a movie I would want to see. But unfortunately the idea seemed to be a whole lot better than the final product.Mike Mos Def works at an aging video rental story in New Jersey run by Mr. Fletcher Danny Glover. Despite the advent of DVD the store only carries VHS tapes and rents them to local customers at a fee far cheaper than the usual rental store. The store is apparently a landmark so Mr. Fletcher does not want to give into local developers looking to turn the block into a nice piece of real estate. He leaves Mike in charge for a few days but leaves specific instructions for him to not his friend Jerry Jack Black into the store. He does and after a rather amusing accident Jerry manages to erase all of the tapes in the store. To help cover this up Mike and Jerry begin to film their own versions of the films.It sounds creative on paper but Be Kind Rewind is too muddled in subplots to really take advantage of its outrageous idea. The entire landmark dispute becomes rather boring and annoying right after it is mentioned and the frequent mention of jazz musician Fats Waller loses its sentimental and nostalgic touch far too early on in the film. It just lacks the focus of Eternal Sunshine and lacks the daring scope of The Science of Sleep another film by Gondry. While Sleep was not all that great either it seems to have had a much better grip on the point of the movie than Rewind does. It mopes around far too much and I found myself more bored than I ever thought I would be watching it. I wanted to be interested but the film did not make for many interesting moments. It has a sense of purpose and clearly knows what it wants to accomplish but allowing it to seems to be an issue the film can never overcome.One of these reasons may be the lack of depth in the characters. We learn very little about Mike or Jerry and their pasts and motivations seem to never come up. We just know the basics and that seems to be enough. Ditto for Mr. Fletcher the frequent customer Miss Falewicz Mia Farrow and Alma Melonie Diaz who seems to get thrown into the mix rather randomly half way through the film and never seems to fully materialize as anything other than being a female in a primarily male dominated main cast. Gondry clearly has a point for these characters to be here interacting and a couple of curious supporting characters like Irv Gooch's Wilson who lend the film a lot of its laughs but he does not seem to want to make them be anything more than near onedimensional cutouts. I do not want to make them seem as simplistic as that but more often than not I really found myself not seeing anything other than that.When the film actually gets to its key drawing point the refilming of the VHS movies or sweding as the film refers to it as it does bring in a lot of that creative depth Gondry is known for. Using many different angles and stylistic devices Gondry remakes specific scenes out of these movies with ease and brings a lot of humour to them as well. Watching Def and Black redo Ghostbusters is absolutely hysterical as is their redoing of Driving Miss Daisy King Kong We Were Kings and 2001 A Space Odyssey. But unfortunately these scenes are really short and sweet and many of them are never lingered on. Frequently they are only mere seconds long before the next sweded movie scene comes in. At one point there is just a scrolling list of movies that are being redone but barely any are shown on screen. It is a little disappointing but I did really like the footage that is shown.While the film's storyline is a little winded and the character development is a little off the actors themselves do really well.Def continues to impress and helps carry this film from beginning to end. I am never really impressed with his work but he seems to have a knack for making his characters enjoyable and very human in their design. He just seems to have that natural acting talent that every young actor tries to have but never can truly create for themselves. Even in its most boring sections Def delivers a great performance that is insightful and more introspective of what the film could have been had Gondry put more effort into it.The same goes for Black who continues to redefine himself as an actor. On one hand he does his usual screwball schtick to its finest degree and gets plenty of laughs for it. But on the other he really develops his dramatic side one that is seen only in the likes of King Kong where his performance is not nearly as well liked as I think it is and pretentious fare like Margot at the Wedding which I doubt many people will ever attempt to see. It is a fine balance and Black walks it perfectly throughout the film and gives a solid performance for one of the film's most undefined characters. Kudos to him for really making something of it.While the rest of the supporting cast does fairly well for themselves none ever match the charisma or the chemistry that Def and Black share. And in a film that is disappointing already that makes it all the more worse.710.".

	schema:headline " Imaginative and sweet film and with interesting themes  shame the first third is easily the weakest";
	schema:reviewBody "I shan't bother to describe the plot because it is impossible to do that without describing a different film or making it sound stupid. To avoid plot synopsis one must concentrate on the start of the film in describing the plot but this section is easily the weakest part as the film contrives to get the tapes wiped and the sweding of the films begins. Once it reaches this point it remains a bit weird and silly but it is actually pretty funny. The one thing you cannot deny is that these parts are inventive in how the remakes are made. The standard plot summary understandably tends to focus on this part of the film but the downside is that it suggests that the film is therefore all about the comedy of the remakes  a suggestion strengthened by the presence of Jack Black.The thing is that they are not so much things to be laughed at so much as little flights of fancy that are wonderfully inventive in how the various effects and scenes from the various films are reproduced. I totally understand why some viewers were frustrated with the messy opening parts and perhaps also disappointed not to find themselves rolling in the aisles with laughter  I know that this is sort of what I was led to expect by the trailers so I'll not pretend that I didn't struggle with it at times. However the film does manage to be entertaining enough to hold you and also make you forget what a nonsense the plot is up till this point. Gradually this gives way to a ultimately warming and simple tale of community and active involvement with others and it is this that stays with you as you leave the film  not the early rubbish.It is a shame that it is so weak and weird at the start because this does put people into the wrong mindset and that is a thing that is hard to shake. I know I felt this way and was already mumbling to myself that this was yet another weak film from Gondry I was not that impressed at all by Science of Sleep when little by little it won me over by how inventive it was but also how much heart it suddenly had  it is difficult to be silly but then also engage but this film does it. The cast went through a similar cycle in my eyes  weak at first but getting better as the material got better. Black doesn't benefit from this so much and he is always just a bit of a loud clown although he gets less annoying as he moves away from being the magnetic narrative device of the early parts. Glover is consistent quality and is a great presence in the film outside of also giving some nice laughs. Farrow doesn't have much to do while Diaz is quite fun but the real surprise to me was Mos Def. I do wish he would kick out some good albums but at the same time it is a pleasure to watch him turn out good performances such as this. He is good when the material is weak and great when the material gives him something to work with  a really nice turn all round.Be Kind Rewind is a very weird film that doesn't totally work but it toploads all the weakness into the first third of the film where the plot setting is silly and messy. The rest of the film is an increasing delight though as it gets funny inventive and ultimately touching. Not as accessible as the trailer would suggest but as long as you keep in mind that it is a Gondry film then you probably know what to expect and can forgive it its flawed nature in exchange for what it does really well.".

The standard plot summary understandably tends to focus on this part of the film but the downside is that it suggests that the film is therefore all about the comedy of the remakes  a suggestion strengthened by the presence of Jack Black.The thing is that they are not so much things to be laughed at so much as little flights of fancy that are wonderfully inventive in how the various effects and scenes from the various films are reproduced. I totally understand why some viewers were frustrated with the messy opening parts and perhaps also disappointed not to find themselves rolling in the aisles with laughter  I know that this is sort of what I was led to expect by the trailers so I'll not pretend that I didn't struggle with it at times. However the film does manage to be entertaining enough to hold you and also make you forget what a nonsense the plot is up till this point. Gradually this gives way to a ultimately warming and simple tale of community and active involvement with others and it is this that stays with you as you leave the film  not the early rubbish.It is a shame that it is so weak and weird at the start because this does put people into the wrong mindset and that is a thing that is hard to shake. I know I felt this way and was already mumbling to myself that this was yet another weak film from Gondry I was not that impressed at all by Science of Sleep when little by little it won me over by how inventive it was but also how much heart it suddenly had  it is difficult to be silly but then also engage but this film does it. The cast went through a similar cycle in my eyes  weak at first but getting better as the material got better. Black doesn't benefit from this so much and he is always just a bit of a loud clown although he gets less annoying as he moves away from being the magnetic narrative device of the early parts. Glover is consistent quality and is a great presence in the film outside of also giving some nice laughs. Farrow doesn't have much to do while Diaz is quite fun but the real surprise to me was Mos Def. I do wish he would kick out some good albums but at the same time it is a pleasure to watch him turn out good performances such as this. He is good when the material is weak and great when the material gives him something to work with  a really nice turn all round.Be Kind Rewind is a very weird film that doesn't totally work but it toploads all the weakness into the first third of the film where the plot setting is silly and messy. The rest of the film is an increasing delight though as it gets funny inventive and ultimately touching. Not as accessible as the trailer would suggest but as long as you keep in mind that it is a Gondry film then you probably know what to expect and can forgive it its flawed nature in exchange for what it does really well.";

	schema:headline " Gondry's film is endearing homage to the movies themselves and to an outlook not unlike Capra";
	schema:reviewBody "Michel Gondry has an extremely cool funny and intriguing new film with Be Kind Rewind as it finds him growing even more emotionally as an artist while taking a very slight step back with style though not that it's a bad thing. It's rightfully called by Ebert WHIMSICAL all in caps but in his own right Gondry has made what could possibly be his closest yet or maybe ever to making a kind of Cinema Paradiso mixed with something out of It's a Wonderful Life. It's a crazy fable that only Gondry could do.It goes without saying that one of the main draws of the success of the piece are the movie 'parodies' as they end up being almost by default. Mike Mos Def with a fullon lackadaisical kind of voice not a strong performance by any measure but cool and relaxed works at a video store in Pasaic NJ with his friend Jerry Jack Black who is almost by default Jack Black as we know him in comedies is a kooky nagging dude who lives in a trailer by a power plant. Despite the best efforts of Mike's bossmentorfather figure Mr. Fletcher Danny Glover while he's out of town Jerry gets into the store after getting an astounding amount of electricity in his system. He magnetizes i.e. erases all the videotapes he touches which is very quickly all and there's only one answer with no access to videos and an inability to switch to DVD right away make the damn movies as they were! But better! At least in the eye of the beholder. It's a marvel at times to see how much invention there is in Gondry stripping everything down to a level of filmmaking that reminds one of what it's like to pick up a camera for the first time. Aspiring filmmakers alike can attest to it the first time you get a camera and try for something you go for what you know and Gondry charmingly uproariously most times captures that feeling going between Ghostbusters Rush Hour 2 The Lion King Driving Ms. Daisy RoboCop and a whole host of titles as was also my friend's favorite seeing Gummo on the list of Sweded titles was a gas. Seeing this process happen with the Be Kind Rewind store is like seeing what many conventional comedies go for the big up of success at something of this variety can't compare it right now but you know where it's from going all the way back to comedies of the 40s  but done with the right pathos.Gondry loves this sect of marginalized folk in this rundown area of Passaic right off to the side of Route 80 and area some of us New Jersians pass by every day without a second thought as he previously revealed not without some coincidence in his documentary Block Party of the natural thrill that comes with people getting on camera. It goes without saying some of them aren't the best of actors not that Def and Black don't have their faults at times too but Gondry isn't one to back off of that chance to back up his snappy script with a multitude of faces we haven't seen plus a couple of surprises with Mia Farrow as the local oldladyquasidingbat and Sigourney Weaver a brilliant injoke to the Be Kind's first remake as a cold copyright agent.Which brings me to what the most enchanting aspect yes enchanting a word to use here of the film which is that while it's often very very funny in the places to be expected it's also got real empathy for its characters and for the society painted here. Going back to Capra cause it's worth noting Gondry isn't one to not recognize the forces at work in conglomerating i.e. West Coast Video gentrification i.e. tearing down the square block to build a big apartment complex sending them away to the projects and the cynical attitude of the corporation towards the innocence of the Be Kind Rewind folk And we're the bad guys Weaver's character comments to her other agents whilst all of the Sweded videos are destroyed.But in digging into all of this including an climax and just last act in general that inspires faith in these people Gondry grows all the more closer to being a greater filmmaker than he's been before almost in spite of the fact that he's shot a somewhat more conventional comedy than Eternal Sunshine or Science of Sleep. It's about nostalgia for an dying technology to an extent but it's moreover about the nature of the people who would still throw down the gauntlet for the craft itself. This is an amazing muddy pup of a flick.".

After all how could such selfserving Hollywood love letters come across as anything more than pretentious and selfcongratulatory? It would seem eclectic director Michel Gondry has found the answer by crafting a film with charm but not Hollywood glitz with humour but not generic sight gags and with heart but no mainstream sap  Be Kind Rewind is the end result and a truly laudable feat as consequence. If taken at face value Be Kind Rewind may appear simplistic to the point of appearing patronizing at times but Gondry is too shrewd to operate on directorial autopilot and instead allows the form and cinematics of his own feature to mimic the unassuming homemade feel of his protagonists' shorts. Indeed upon closer examination there is much to appreciate as the structure of the film itself can be taken as allegorical for the development of the film industry itself and its ups and downs a couple of men fooling around with cameras with no real idea what they were doing impulsively deciding to make movies which steadily become more streamlined and mass produced a montage sequence joyfully alludes to the days of assembly line Hollywood studio production as they increasingly become less about art and more about making money. The film also makes witty references to the scare of video pirating in today's culture as well as an examination of the changing home viewing technologies and the inevitable transition from more nostalgic days of video cassettes to DVDs. But Gondry's film also celebrates the enormous cultural significance of film and glimpses at the joy of producing them and the heartwarming reaction of viewer enjoyment. Quite simply Be Kind Rewind can be taken in a nutshell as a movie about loving the movies which although potentially coming across as too schmaltzy for some is surprisingly touching as opposed to dissolving in a mess of Hollywood glitz. Although the film is without question not without its faults they scarcely detract from a film so unpretentiously touching and charming. Yes there are certain prominent lapses of credulity logic and even some paltry special effects whether intentionally so or not they do stand out. Yes some parts do undeniably drag or appear to be slightly off track and the script carries the improvised low budget feel a bit too far in certain segments. But such concerns are easily forgiven when the final product is so earnestly enjoyable and the remake sequences as Black and Def lampoon such films as Ghostbusters 2001 A Space Odyssey Boyz 'n the Hood and Rush Hour 2 are comedic gold and feel disappointingly rushed considering their being the primary draw of the film. Similarly the film's genuinely moving finale is a triumph  one feels transported to the earliest days of audiences screening silent films in a flickering theater with only a whimsical solo piano accompanying and it hard to resist giving in to the sweeping feeling of genuine nostalgia and heart rather than typical Hollywood tearjerking. And perhaps this exemplifies the film in itself one gets the feeling the film could have reached and easily succeeded loftier or more profound aims but ultimately the film doesn't pretend to be anything but what it is a celebration of the art of creation and a parable for the love of filmmaking and its cultural significance. Gondry's cast similarly light up the screen with enough infectious enthusiasm and good natured quirkiness to easily sell an occasionally rocky concept. The boundless charisma of Jack Black is put to perfect use as the irrepressible Jerry taking a bumbling attention seeking anarchistic character and still effortlessly capturing the hearts of his audience. Mos Def's offbeat comedic talents also perfectly compliment the film's quirky tone and while undeniably funny Def is given a chance to shine dramatically in several understated emotional scenes and he rises to the challenge. Backing up the two charismatic leads Danny Glover brings class and authority to the role of the gruff video store owner Mr. Fletcher and Mia Farrow brings dignity and offbeat comedy simultaneously as an eccentric video rental patron. Melonie Diaz makes a lovably bizarre addition to the inspired pairing of Black and Def as an aspiring actress roped into the duo's moviemaking frenzy and a delightful cameo from Sigourney Weaver is priceless especially considering the earlier Ghostbusters spoof. For whatever faults or shortcomings Gondry's film boasts such low key unassuming heart and charm that it is almost impossible to dislike. While not as overall funny as one might hope for it is exceptionally hard to resist a smile creeping onto one's face throughout and the film proves surprisingly moving despite the noticeable lack of Hollywood emotional showiness. Be Kind Rewind is somewhat of an anomaly in its unpretentious refusal to be anything apart from what it intended to be  a movie about celebrating the joys of making and experiencing movies it hard to resist and Gondry's film is just cute and unassuming enough to pull it off with considerable skill. 710".

I am a huge fan on Jack Black and love him in School of Rock however this was not his best work.Me and my friend had heard the movie was very average but however i was sure i would like it.I was shocked and stunned at what i saw the point of the movie started around 35 minutes into the movie it was unfunny bad script bad acting on some parts not Jack Black Mos Def or Mia Farrow the point of the movie was overlooked and people were getting restless.People began leaving the movie after 40 minutes or so and at the hour mark I done the same.After being shockingly disappointed i proceeded to ask for my money back after i paid 5 for the ticket the wouldn't let me have it back.The film was shocking and I wouldn't advise anyone to go and see it.The promos FALSE ADVERTISING! Just Plain Bad!Film is terrible!";

He is usually extremely animated and his movies are filled with parts where you just bust out laughing saying Did he really just do that?... but this movie fell short. The beginning was quite dull.. not very funny at all. It was only towards the middle of the movie when things got a bit funny but only a bit. The dialog was not snappy at all. I think the writers must have been depressed or something. Very bland. I went to the movie looking for a light hearted comedy that would make me laugh and out of the 2 hours of movie maybe about 90 seconds of it hit my mark. The ending was the best part of the movie but it was too little too late. Pretty lame movie in my opinion. If you want a good laugh go rent School of Rock or Shallow Hal or something...".

We were highly disappointed when it turned out to be lacking in humour and plot.The story line was unbelievable and not funny and it was hard to identify with any of the characters. The film seemed to stray between genres of comedy and drama but never settling on one. It seemed to want to appeal as a genuine homage to film making but the story was full of unrealistic turns and events that ruined its credibility. Having made ourselves sit through it we were further confused by the abrupt ending that gave no real conclusion and added to sense of wasted time. Such a shame for a cast that held so much promise.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow another fun movie of WriterDirector Michel Gondry! It attempts to reach out with a very subtle message. Gondry is again calling the shots for his creatively alluring visual style never to cease his manipulation of mise en scne! And I love it! Indeed this film is inspiring for the creative minds of America! With the story's delightfully charming and fun characters and with very memorable oneliners zinging away throughout the simple tale Gondry brings the audience a sweet and warmhearted fable to salute America's creative talents.The charmingly comedic cast ensemble Jack Black Mos Def Danny Glover Paul Dinello etc. including Mia Farrow and Sigourney Weave collaborate with Gondry very successfully to field up the loony razzmatazz about the inventive fun of Sweding films.Boy did I enjoy following Jerry's journey into his new career! Jack Black is such a natural comedian! Boy did I have any doubt that Jerry and Mike would pull off their manipulation! Nope. And you can bet that my heart warmed to the uncanny goodwill and appreciation exhibited by those commonfolks of their little community's heritage. Good or bad the folks of Passaic are proud of their 'native' talents. And that's so emotionally touching! The story bubbles with so much creative hullabaloo liv and energized spirit. Hhhmh the film even has Sigourney Weaver's Ms. Lawson  a spoilsport villain out to make life miserable for all? Just to watch films like Back to the Future Robocop Rush Hour 2 Driving Miss Daisy King Kong Ghostbusters and 2001 A Space Odyssey being revamped by goons for loons is worth paying the price of a regular tix to watch this film! Michel Gondry and his cast of actors are giving the audience a treasure trove of spontaneity creativity playfulness fun laughter and tears. Oh yes their film does put a test to the audience's tearducts especially toward the close of the film.Gondry's film is bound to delight those with dreams of making movies. It's also a film that appreciates the passion of refreshingly new talents. But will it serve to remind film institutes promoters and sponsors not to neglect their objectives in inspiring and encouraging creative new talents? I should hope so. As Gondry's film does suggest creative minds do inspire and spark off creative juices to flow in every walk of life! Yep this is absolutely an uncanny and ingenious fable presented in all good humor and in a pleasantly unique avantguard dynamostyle to make it memorable. Call it a mock doc within a mock doc if you wish but it sure will remind us that smallbudgeted homegrown indie films can sell just as well as big Hollywood blockbusters.".

	schema:headline " To all the films with heart and soulBe Kind Rewind";
	schema:reviewBody "Thankfully Michel Gondry has once again taken his warped mind and melded together a piece of work that is personal and touching without ever going too far into sentimentality. For all of you who saw the trailer and think that either it will take a onenote joke and beat it to the ground or be outloud funny at all turns don't bother watching because it is neither. I only wish I could have told the four 16year old girls in front of me who were constantly on their cell phones talking making a ruckus as they went to the bathroom halfway through and at the end yelled out finally. Maybe the mistake was bringing it to a Regal and not letting it lie in its rightful home of a Dipson. You will not get mainstream laughs or stellar acting instead we are shown a whole lot of heart and compassion for the people you love the town you call home and the imagination and knowledge that you can make a difference no matter how small. Be Kind Rewind is a feelgood film that wears its creativity and craft blatantly on the screen. Gondry tells the tale of two men handcreating movies by molding his own stamped throughout with his personal fingerprints blemishing each frame.I could go the easy route and say that the acting was kind of atrocious but I won't because I really feel the amateurish quality was deliberate. Between Mos Def whom I love as an actor mumbling Danny Glover sounding as though his teeth were falling out and Mia Farrow acting so over the top happy with broad expressions running the gamut the cast is as unpolished as the sweded films they are shooting. Something about that feel works perfectly though and I don't think the movie would have been as successful if they all were pristine. Each plays their part to perfection and even Jack Black reins it in to portray a fully fleshed character and not a caricature as he is used to. Sure you get his manic comedy at times but just his reaction at the end proves he was into this film completely and was willing to do what was needed for it to succeed. All the supporting roles were great as well with brilliant turns from Melanie Diaz and Irv Gooch as Wilson along with Marcus Carl Franklin playing an actual boy something that was a departure from his very adult portrayal of Bob Dylan in I'm Not There.But why am I talking about the acting? That is the least of my memories from this film. Gondry is a true genius in the definition of the word. The way he creates set pieces and allows for each erased VHS to be recreated is astonishing. When we are shown a montage of the crew filming multiple stories at once the true inventiveness comes in. Going from 2001 to Umbrellas of Chermbourg to Men In Black we are given a brief glimpse of the setup that is slowly turned into the film. Watching a crank with numerous cars spinning while Mos Def and Black are upside in a car looks absolutely absurd until the title flashes on the bottom and you realize it is the tunnel scene of MIB just an amazing transition. Every second is laced with creativity from a skewed camera angle showing Black slide down a stair banister to appear like a fire poll the fake depth of field to show Black as King Kong grabbing Diaz to the laughably perfect mat of a city laying on the ground and shot from above to make it look as though characters are falling to their death off a building. Gondry might have singlehandedly created a phenomenon that will be mimicked and YouTubed in the very near future. Heck he even sweded his own trailer to rake up some added press. Sweded of course being the term to describe the art of recreating movies to their personalized condensed format. I'll buy the DVD just to see the full versions as I am sure they will be included how could they not?.There is an underlying story of course a race against time to try and save the video store from demolitioncomplete with an FBI lawsuit of copyright infringementbut all that takes a very far backseat to the human story at the front. The way these films bring the rundown lowincome city together as a community is heartwarming and a big payoff for the film. Credit Gondry for knowing what he was doing too. He shows Ghostbusters being filmed but then only snippets of the rest so as not to ruin the joke. When the group finally decides to shoot an original story we are still intrigued by the workmanship that goes into the process because we have not yet been bored by it from before. And of course he films the finale the only way he could have. As an audience it really doesn't matter what the end product is it's the reactions of those watching that counts. To see the laughs and the tears on the faces of all the people who helped create their masterpiece is the true endgame that I wanted to see. You won't experience a more charming and original film with enough heart to warm those in it and those outside in the theatre watching anytime soon.".

Even the art therein as typified by Niki de SaintPhalle is wan.But these ideas have always had promise and combined with the American invention of noir have more or less become embedded in everyday film. There isn't a better example than Michel Gondry. He was an ordinary drummer in an ordinary band until making that band's videos. And then Bjork's. And then Kaufman films and then an Oscar. Finally perhaps the highest honor for a creative mind to be named artist in residence at MIT.Here is the product of that tenure.Its a film with three distinct parts. These parts are not well integrated I think by design and that will allow newspaper and internet reviewers pretending to be critics to give it bad marks. And that will be too bad. In my city this was showing in one theater for one late showing per day.The first part of the film is a rather conventional Jack Blackcentric comedy. It involves his battle with the massive power plant next to the junkyard in which he lives. Its funny in what is already a conventional juvenile style. It however has one of the best sight gags in recent memory Black shows up one day in camouflage to convince the Mos Def even the name is a joke character to participate in an assault on the plant. Later he in cameo as well and Jack do climb the fence surrounding the plant. But they are interrupted by the cops and freeze their cameo perfectly matching where they happen to be standing complete with partial signage. That one joke is worth your six bucks.The middle section has the two taping ad hoc versions of the movies in the store. Its a wholly different sort of humor goofing on the folding mechanism I note so often in my comments. These are homemade movies within a homemade movie. Each follows Ted's law in being precisely as abstract which in this case includes the offhand homemadeness as the movie in which it exists. Some of this is really good and to keep it funny the pace increases phenomenally until it would take many viewings to get the jokes.The final section is a third film whose effectiveness depends on the first two. Its sweet deep and very affecting. You will end up crying as I did. They are unable to continue making Sweded versions of movies because of the evil studios who surely are moving to become as strong as possible in fighting imagination. So they make a new movie a fiction about Fats Waller. You will have seen parts of this at the beginning of the film and there's no mistake that this is the emotional center of the project  and why Danny Glover was required.Its in the tradition of a RooneyGarland let's have a show movie involving the entire neighborhood. And it is as sweet and endearing as can be. Extremely postracist and human unashamedly using children where they mean something. And celebrating the sort of random make up anything fun that's at the soul of Waller's music. If you know Swedish films even the term is a massive joke.This is a gem. If you like film and as a result are in danger of jaded watching of analytical hell this will help you escape. It could be one of the two best films you will see this year.Oh and after you see it. Not before after you really must see the trailer by Gondry where he Swedes his own film replacing the Black and Def characters  in fact every character  with himself. Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:headline " Quirky enough to be above average";
	schema:reviewBody "While I don't usually comment on other reviews from this site I was struck with one person who included Another thoughtprovoking film by Jack Black in the headline. And while everyone has a right to their opinion I'm trying to figure out what thoughtprovoking film Jack Black has made lately.Was it Shallow Hal? Was it Nacho Libre? Was it Orange County?Could it have been King Kong? Or maybe it was Tenacious D or Holiday.Might have been HiFidelity which I did like but then again that was made almost 10 years ago. His pictures have been cute funny stupid and interesting but never thoughtprovoking. Even this latest release Be Kind Rewind directed by Michael Gondry Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Dave Chappell's Block Party isn't so much a thinking man's movie as it is a quirky goofy silly genrebending mishmash. It isn't bad at allbut it certainly is not up there with either of Gondry's other two efforts.In fact it was Jack Black who forced me to give this movie a 6 rather than a 7.

These scenes however are few and far between as well as way too short for example the Lion King takeoff lasts only a minute or two. A tepid love story is thrown in between Mike and a local cleanerturnedactress Alma Melonie Diaz A Guide To Recognizing Your Saints Lords of Dogtown for no reason other than to throw a tepid love story into a movie like this.Mos Def is fine in this picture and despite his willingness to go along with the ludicrous antics of Jerry he knows when to draw the line. Glover does a nice job as well torn between pleasing his customers making himself happy and earning enough money to save his livelihood. His devotion to Fats Waller while bordering on the obsessive seems genuine and heartfelt.Black has his moments but continues to milk the crazy wildeyed lunatic that people in reel life think is cute and eccentric but folks in real life would not tolerate for more than 15 minutes. He is rude to people in the store a jerk to Mike and is a general nuisance to anyone he comes in contact with.Overall however this is just interesting enough to check out. It's certainly nowhere near a perfect 10 movie like so many reviews on this site seem to rate itmaybe the writers have never seen pictures like Citizen Kane Casablanca Lawrence of Arabia The Godfather Raging Bull or GoodFellas among others but it has it's Jarmuschian charm.And sometimesespecially in these dark cinematic timesthat's good enough.".

	onyx:emotionText "While I don't usually comment on other reviews from this site I was struck with one person who included Another thoughtprovoking film by Jack Black in the headline. And while everyone has a right to their opinion I'm trying to figure out what thoughtprovoking film Jack Black has made lately.Was it Shallow Hal? Was it Nacho Libre? Was it Orange County?Could it have been King Kong? Or maybe it was Tenacious D or Holiday.Might have been HiFidelity which I did like but then again that was made almost 10 years ago. His pictures have been cute funny stupid and interesting but never thoughtprovoking. Even this latest release Be Kind Rewind directed by Michael Gondry Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Dave Chappell's Block Party isn't so much a thinking man's movie as it is a quirky goofy silly genrebending mishmash. It isn't bad at allbut it certainly is not up there with either of Gondry's other two efforts.In fact it was Jack Black who forced me to give this movie a 6 rather than a 7. He can be a bottlerocket of superheated energy and passion when directed correctly like in School of Rock or he can be an embarrassing loose cannon of buffoonery such as Libre.Here he plays Jerry a junkyard worker who lives in a trailer beneath a huge electrical transformer.

	schema:headline " Fast forward through the beginning and you have a great movie here...";
	schema:reviewBody "Remember the days when the VHS dominated the market the days you had to sit for ages rewinding or fast forwarding the damned things just to find the moment in the film you wanted. I know it seems like a lifetime ago DVD quickly saw an end to that tedious routine. However there is still something nice about a VHS I don't know what it is but it just feels a bit more homely. That's the way that Be Kind Rewind seems to have gone sure it isn't as nice looking it isn't as memorable and hell it even gets a bit tedious after a while but it has a nice feel to it. Be Kind Rewind in essence appears to be nothing more than a string of amateur movie clips strung together by a plot that's what the trailers make it out to be. But when you watch the film and you peel back the surface you find something more a good natured storyline that actually is genuinely heart warming. Unfortunately however the movie takes a while for an humour or heart warming to kick in. The film for at least twenty five minutes verges on boring. But once you get past the dull part and the movie remakes kick in the movie just becomes hilarious and when the movies true moral kicks in at the end despite it at times feeling forced the movie at least does seem to suck you in still. The performances are pretty top notch and the script is witty. Sure it is not even in the same league as Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind but the movie is well written and will leave you feeling that little bit warmer inside once you leave the cinema.So let me get onto the performances. Jack Black is obviously the major star of the film now I'll be honest I approached his performance with some caution. I admit that Jack Black is an incredible talent School of Rock and to some extent even Tenacious D the movie confirmed this nevertheless when given the wrong material he is pretty awful. Nacho Libre one of the biggest disappointments in recent years left me horrified that someone had made me dislike a Jack Black performance. And then at Christmas I had to endure The Holiday the less said about that the better. Thankfully Black is at home in this movie he has the opportunity to be completely manic he does a classic Jackie Chan impersonation and he also has a genuine heart in the film. He also works superbly alongside Mos Def who is admittedly quite dull at the start of the movie but when he has some weight in the script he delivers a great performance. Danny Glover finally proved he could act in this movie in recent films he has been on autopilot but here he seems to like the movie he is in. Mia Farrow makes a welcome if admittedly pointless appearance. And Sigourney Weaver pops along and almost steals the movie in way too brief screen time.I suppose however that Be Kind Rewind's biggest selling point has to be the remakes of the movies. Well I was quite surprised not to see too much of them in fact one of my biggest complaints is that we say way too little of them. The Ghostbusters sequence is a classic in fact in years to come I'm sure I'll love that scene as much as I do today. The driving Miss Daisy scene is priceless but apart those and the Rush Hour 2 scenes we get brief glimpses at the other films. I'd have loved to see more on Men In Black the Lord of the Rings remake that we see the case of 2001 and all those others. They're the best bits of the film yet they flash past way too quickly. Matters are never helped that too much time is focused on the making of a Fats Waller movie sure those scenes are extremely touching but the characters waffle way too much about the man and you get sick and tired of it by the end. Thankfully the movie does have genuine heart the final fifteen minutes just make you feel happy and make you smile. The ending is very abrupt but the scenes proceeding it are pitch perfect.Be Kind Rewind is a decent movie that could have been an all time classic alas the movie just has too many mediocre moments for it to ever be something you can endlessly watch. The remake scenes are priceless and it is a nice movie to watch but a very slow beginning and a lack of memorable moments make this something to rent or watch once.".

All these films seem to have a genuine sense of fun particularly where children are involved yet have a deeper message that lingers as an uncomfortable question in the back of my mind long after the film has ended School of Rock about the nature of teaching Shallow Hal about our perception of beauty and Be Kind Rewind about communities and filmmaking. I have found no answers to any of the questions posed by these films.I easily managed to suspend my disbelief for two hours and found this movie genuinely funny and touching all at the same time. As a moviemaker myself this film reminded me that great movies are made by people who love them e.g. Somewhere in Time The Sting and they're made for the audience of that time and place. It's not about realism it's about loving the story. This film reminded me that communities are broken up in the name of progress which gives the film a rather melancholy feel towards the end. But most of all it reminded me of the fun we have in making short films and the excitement you feel when you see the product of your own efforts.Great acting by all  without exception.

	schema:headline " Negotiating Traumas in Berlin";
	schema:reviewBody "Leben ist eine Baustelle titled in English as Life is All You Get explores the aftermath of the Wende in late 90's Berlin.  The story of Ossi Jan Nebel which means 'fog' is a mixture of discontent and pleasure nihilism tempered with hope.  As he encounters conflict after conflict it is not any individual obstacle that is insurmountable but the sheer number of them that threaten to crush him.  Paired with Vera the mysterious yet charming streetsinger Jan finds himself in emotional strangleholds that can only be understood through an examination of the sum total of events.  How else explain leaving a dead man in the kitchen to go on a date? A great extent of the film's tensions are related to issues of sex and sexuality.  Jan lives with his sister and her lover and acts as a surrogate fatherbrother for his niece whose real father is unmentioned throughout. The film opens with a street riot that appears as a video game and Jan wanders through the maze from the bed of a woman to his temporary job at the slaughterhouse unable to comprehend the devastation that surrounds him. This inability to comprehend or to face continues when Moni tells him of the threat of HIV and he refuses to get tested for what seems to be an interminable amount of time.  Meanwhile Jan's relations with Vera are conflicted and dubious they keep secrets from each other without even trying.  His roommate Buddy moves in with him and they revitalize the apartment of Jan's deceased father.  Nevertheless until the end a gloom hangs alternately over one man or the other.  The Greek woman appears with all the exoticism of a faroff island and relieves some tension and loneliness simply through existing and yet even this raises tensions as Buddy and she grow close but in a fit of misunderstandings we find her in bed with Jan. Perhaps as was discussed in class this film plays into the crises of heterosexuality so evidenced in the earlier comedy wave.  Simultaneously however Leben ist eine Baustelle draws upon the economic hardships of the characters as much or more so as their sexual identities.  It is their struggle for survival that ultimately binds them together whether selling birds or being birds.  The film does not end with any solutions as both German and English titles attest there is no solution.  To exist is to attempt to create and so a hybrid family skates across the ice Vera Jan Buddy Jenny Kristina breathing thin air and sharing their dreams.".

	schema:reviewBody "Life is a construction site huh? Well first of all that title held absolutely no meaning to me whatsoever. Even now I must admit that I still do not fully comprehend such a strange movie title. I saw the parallels between the title and the renovation of Berlin and of course the ever ongoing dilemmas that the characters seemed for some masochistic reason to repeatedly place themselves into. In the beginning of the film I found myself completely turned off by the characters. I quickly lost any feelings of sympathy that I first experienced when I witnessed what a terrible life the lead character was slowly being suffocated by. Not only was he irresponsible and in through my eyes just plain weird I mean who would leave their father's corpse to rot while they went out on a date seriously? but most of his suffering seemed to be selfinflicted. He had to have know how bad Vera was for him and his already deteriorating life. His first encounter with her landed him and jail and an incredibly hefty fine. I think that I first realized how little value Jan placed on his life when he didn't even bother to speak up and defend himself in court. He at least wasn't guilty of shoplifting or rioting the rioting charges that were surely placed upon him but he just accepted his punishment without even so much as a bat of an eyelash. Again who does this? Jan obviously had very little desire for happiness or stability and Vera only served to pull him even further down into his abyss... in the beginning anyways. There were small pockets of the movie that teased us just with an inkling of hope of potential happiness. The first scene of the movie that I remember Jan smiling was while running from the police with Vera. Even though he didn't know her he defended and left with her and he did it with passion and a smile. Who in their right mind would do this? The moments spent between Jan and his niece also offered some redemption from the ever enclosing darkness that continued to move towards Jan. Something about their relationship seemed off though like they would be wrong if viewed from a different perspective. Perhaps it was the childlike nature of Jan or the elevated maturity level of his niece but at times it almost seemed as if they were in a relationship. This dirty feeling left me feeling anxious whenever they were alone together. When she crawled in bed with him and he placed his arm around her in a very spoon like position I had to turn away from the film for a moment. The entire scene just felt wrong which of course fit perfectly with most of the other off putting scenes in the film. And the ending? I haven't been this upset over a film's ending since Die Weisse Band. Nothing I felt was fully resolved I had no answers to the multitude of questions that the film dumped on me like yesterday's trash. BUT with all of this said with all of the dingy tainted moments that the filmed possessed and kept shoveling off the screen onto us there was always this very very very faint glimmer of hope. I found myself latching onto to this small ray in the darkness like a breath of fresh air while I was slowly drowning in a sea of sludge. After I walked away from the film I swore to never ever watch this again. Over the last week however my mind has slowly changed. I began to feel like there was more truth here than I first realized. Jan's cluttered life and severe depression in some ways reminded me of my own life and how I have just up and walked away from my problems never from a decaying corpse though! to try and eke out some sort of distraction from life. Good or bad distractions it didn't matter. As long as I had some sort of consistency as long as I could still chase that one ray of hope in the darkness then almost magically I could find the strength to keep moving to fight of the worst of evils stagnancy and apathy. And this is truly what I believe Jan was doing throughout the film he trying to keep moving. As soon as we stop moving we die and just by making his choices even though most of them were terrible Jan was telling us that he wanted to be happy that he wanted to live. I suppose in a construction site if you stand still you will inevitably be run over by a piece of machinery or some heavy object will fall and crush you so you have to keep moving keep building even if your foundation isn't as secure as some others. Now I think I understand why it's called Life is a construction site.".

Sounds great right? Add to this the creative style of Wolfgang Becker and Tom Tykwer and how can it go wrong? Well I'm not sure how it went wrong but it definitely did.In a classic example of good idea no substance this film begins to deflate around the halfway mark with no backbone to hold it up. The interesting lives we had been led to anticipate turn out to be rather commonplace. Dialogue is so sparse it's negligible. And the plot falls back to a series of boring clichsthe kinds which you can overhear in any bar at closing time if you're patient enough to listen. It reminds me very much of Wim Wenders' early unscripted work Paris Texas which begins famously but thins out into oblivion. Or maybe it's like a Lenny Kravitz song that starts with a cool guitar riff but goes nowhere but boredom.I would recommend this film to fans of mood rather than substance. If you are a fan of Godard Bela Tarr or movies where Ethan Hawke plays the lead Reality Bites Before Sunset then you may enjoy this. However if you're a fan of Kieslowsky Kubrick Herzog or typically the filmmakers who pack a hidden message I would suggest you pass on this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Das Leben ist eine Baustelle. is a German movie from 1997 so this one will have its 20th anniversary next year. The writer and director is Wolfgang Becker and he got help with the script from Tom Tykwer here. The cast includes a handful known names such as Jrgen Vogel Martina Gedeck Christiane Paul Armin Rohde and Andrea Sawatzki all people who are still maybe even more than back then very wellknown here in Germany for their work in the last over 2 decades. Vogel plays the main character a man whose life crumbles no matter where he looks. His girlfriend leaves him he has no stable longterm relationships with women his father dies he loses his job etc. So yeah he is pretty screwed. But from these ruins a new love and new friends emerge as well and they may help him in finding happiness and stability once again in his life. But then a truly dangerous suspicion arises. Does he have the HIV virus? This virus was still seen entirely different back in the 1990s compared to how people see it today not just in medicine but by everybody. These references were maybe also the best thing about the film even if including an HIV positive beggar in the subway may not have been the most subtle and intelligent way honestly and the exgirlfriend with the virus being randomly in the subway too is just one coincidence too many for sure. On another negative note I never really ended up caring for the main character's life or fate at all but this may also have to do with the fact that I am not a great fan of Vogel's early works. And lets be honest The relationship story with Paul's character was never working at all. They did not fit together at all and I felt zero chemistry there which made it impossible for me to cheer for them becoming an item. As a whole despite a solid moment here and there the negative outweighs the positive and the film also has some lengths at almost two hours. I give it a thumbsdown and I cannot share the praise. I especially wonder what the German Film Awards were thinking. it must have been a very weak year if Vogel wins Best Actor for this. You can watch Life is All You Get completely different title than the original Life is a construction site. to understand that I am 100 correct with this review but I suggest you save yourself the time and watch something better instead. Maybe I also ended up not liking this one because I found Becker's and Tykwer's work generally not too inspiring.".

Our protagonist Theo is raping his third victim when we meet him. He is a smoldering violent thug. We next encounter him 9 years later as he is released from a mental hospital into a supervised residential setting. He is a broken man. He is riding a beast he hates and he has no idea when the beast will bite again.As a portrayal of psychology angst subtlety of emotion and real human relations I would give this film a 10. The sparring session between Theo and his budding girlfriend Nettie is a brilliant display of the subtle forces which are torturing the both of them. The fact that these two people have the sparsest dialog in the history of cinema may not be realistically correct but it is an excellent artistic way of turning the focus to their inner emotions. This film is art after all  not a documentary.The only reason I didn't go for 10 stars is that I had a persistent feeling that something was missing. Maybe I'm old fashioned but I would have liked some back story about Theo's youth something that would make him a whole person. The film does work without that but it is a lack that a writer and director of such brilliance could somehow have remedied.This is not a feel good date movie.".

It's unfortunate that some audience members and critics will focus on the graphic scenes of rape tender lovemaking masturbation and emotional trauma. The movie ultimately is about the extreme strength and fragility of personal will. We're shown how one person's surfacing unconditional love strengthens that person's will enough to accept and heart wrenchingly and not stop the complete relinquishing of another's personal will. Heady stuff but very cleanly done. The two lead performers Jrgen Vogel  Sabine Timoteo fully inhabit and bring to surface the deeplyburied emotional chaos and trajectories of their characters. The brilliance of their work would be lost on audience members who aren't used to understanding different cultures i.e. Germans cool thoughtful communication style. Their performances are nothing short of phenomenal.If you love great film making see this. But brace yourself for a very compelling and intense 2.75 albeit efficient hours. You will be blown away.

	schema:headline " the opposite of chick flick  only for the strong of heart  bold movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw the first screening of this movie on Berlinale this year. I have to say that it is easy to condemn this movie and in the extremely politically correct atmosphere of a movie festival the audience refused to applaud afterwards despite the amazing performance of both Jrgen Vogel and Sabine Timoteo. I don't know whether the refusal to applaud was due to the fact that the audience was still speechless or that the topic is simply to risqu. Probably both.The movie takes the bold step to try to get into the skin of a rapist Vogel who has just been released from prison after serving a nine year sentence for sexual assault.Jrgen Vogel conveys the feeling that he is both scared to death of himself and women as he knows that he is not able to master his urge to repeat what brought him into prison. Most people will not want to get this close to one of the most outcast pariahs we have in society  and boy do we get close. In one memorable and very explicit scene he masturbates as if he wants to rip his penis from his groin. Other scenes show him struggling with himself when he is confronted with women. The film makes it very clear that there is no hope for Theo in this battle against an urge that is too powerful and soon his free will leaves the stage and we are invited to see a seemingly endless rape scene that  honestly  got me on the verge of leaving the theater. It's slightly reminiscent of the ugliness of Henry  portrait of a serial killer.Where most directors would now offer some psychology101explanation as to what turned Theo into such a hideous monster in order to give the audience some sort of rationalization of the horror onscreen Mathias Glasner does no such thing. Instead Theo is even allowed to fall in love with Nettie tellingname nett means nice but it's not hard to guess that they are not going to have a pair of twins and marry in the end.What makes this movie so difficult to digest is the fact that its premise seems to be that Theo is still a human being with emotions. That he has a cross to bear that none of us could carry. But at the same time it is also clear that he is a ticking time bomb and that nothing can keep him from repeating his monstrous deeds. What are we to do with this dilemma? The movie offers no answers therefore it's easy to point the finger and accuse it of moral indifference. But not all issues especially the question of what to do with sex offenders can be solved. This movie sticks a finger into this festering wound with a relentlessness that few will find bearable. The guts it took to shoot this movie both from the director's point of view and  to an even higher degree  from Jrgen Vogel's perspective deserve respect. He plays this character with an emotional force that leaves you wondering how much Theo is actually in him. In America this movie would have destroyed his reputation for a decade. And at times you wonder from where Jrgen Vogel got the strength to pull this one through.All in all a shocking disgusting and deeply depressing movie that has the guts to tackle a true taboo  and there aren't many left. One word of advice though  don't take your girlfriend. If you are a girl  don't watch it.".

Because of the very gritty atmosphere and some disturbing scenes quite a few people left the cinema. Even though I appreciated some of the film's aspects like not holding back on anything and developing deep characters I still felt like the director forgot to deliver a final cut of the movie it was so long 160 minutes and stuffed with endless shots that didn't help the story that I felt bored many times in spite of the extreme story and the brilliant acting. Another thing that bugged me was the low resolution low color video camera style which was probably supposed to make the film look even more bleak  unnecessary in my opinion.Had it been cut to regular film length it would have greatly benefited the impact of the movie. Like this for me it's a 7.P.S. One guy here mentioned in his review that understanding of different cultures is necessary like the Germans' cool and thoughtful communication style. I have never seen people in Germany talk as little as the characters in this movie and can't imagine any two people to build a relationship based on one sentence per five minutes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Der freie Wille is the tragedy of the rapist Theo Vogel. After years of imprisonment and struggle for a normal life and love he realizes that he can never be free of his pathological sexual urge. I saw this movie yesterday and it left intense but contradictory impressions on me. First and above all I appreciate the brilliant and authentic acting of J.Vogel S.Timoteo M.Zapatka and the whole ensemble. I saw real persons not roles sharp characterizations not clichs good actors not stars. I appreciate the courage of the producers to realize such a movie too. It's necessary to make movies like this. But in my opinion it has some severe structural problems and that's why I refused to let story  characters affect me till the end. What a pity! Okay some extremely disturbing scenes are shown because the story isn't nice. Okay this movie is a hard challenge for mind  heart because cruelty against women is bad reality  worldwide. Okay the main character Theo is a tragical monster because of his unsolved conflict. Okay Theo's only girlfriend Nettie Timoteo has to be both a highly neurotic and very intelligent person  other girls wouldn't be able to like Theo and he wants her love so badly. Okay the story is concerned with pain cruelty dread fear sorrow  all the abysses of human soul. But 3 hours long? It seemed to me that the movie contains too much unnecessary scenes i.e. Nettie's job in a Belgian chocolate factory that didn't help the story and unfortunately failed its impact on me. Eventually for Theo his victims and Nettie their lives are infinite real time human catastrophes. But to be and stay deeply affected by a character's tragedy in a movie it isn't necessary to reveal every little detail of his or her life as if it happened in real life. This fact even weakens my attention and sympathy for the antiheroes.It appears to me that the movie couldn't decide between drama and documentary. But the really bad effect on me as the film's audience who expects drama art not real life in the long run it's too exhausting to follow the plot. Unfortunately the key scenes get the same attention as the underplots and after a too long time no attention anymore. Therefore the dramaturgy kills itself. Besides too much Method Acting. The story is intense enough  why so much long takes of sighs and yells? Timoteo does a brilliant job  when she shows her feelings subtle and reserved. I was also fascinated by Vogel's performance  when he shows soul instead of nakedness. I also concede I'm not happy with the very hard ending. But somehow I would've liked it if the movie would've been cut as a piece of drama art not as a diary of pain. c.k.".

	schema:reviewBody "This almost 10yearold movie is a definite contender for longest German film in recent years. It easily passes the 150minute mark and yet manages to drag on only very few occasions. Most of the film is well done and will have you curious about what is gonna happen next. A lot of that is thanks to lead actors Jrgen Vogel and Sabine Timoteo. I also liked Zapatka's performance while I thought Hennicke was fairly forgettable. The film is directed by Matthias Glasner and also written by him with the help of Judith Angerbauer and Vogel himself.Let me say that this is a very graphic movie. Vogel plays a convicted sex offender and in the first 10 minutes we already see how he rapes a young woman. A similar scene happens at the end of the movie and that is by far not everything. No taboos here and the ending is very tough to watch as well. Yet it never feels that these scenes were just included for the sake of it. They all serve a purpose. Even if we know the main character is a violent monster we still feel with him and hope he can be cured and will not commit any crimes again maybe even become happy with Timoteo's character.The movie takes place in Berlin but as a Berlin resident I have to say the references were not that big. I only remember a metro station sign. It's all about the question if he can defeat his evil desires and choose love over all the temptation that constantly seems to follow him. My favorite scene is maybe near the end when he realizes what he has done and what is going to happen to him again in the bathroom. Maybe the bestacted scene from Vogel's career. In terms of impact the ending is very important too. I liked how joggers just ran by not realizing the drama that had just taken place. Also the decision of Vogel's character is also a very clever reference to the film's title. I am not sure if I would watch this film anytime soon again but it I certainly recommend it if you are interested in the subject appreciate films with little dialog and can deal with the heavy material. Finally i want to add that I very much liked the way Ave Maria was used here.".

She was the daughter of the owner of the publishing factory. Through some small little incidents Theo and Nettie knows one another better. They developed a relationship later. However while going through a normal relationship Theo found himself fighting the battle against sexual urges with the opposite sex which can leads to rape if he did not do something problem to stop himself from walking back to the same old road again.The Free Will is a test on the audience's moral values and patience. Why moral values? Theo uses porn to find satisfaction and later engaging in a sexual relationship with Nettie. It questions the audience on the moral values on sex and urges in the human beings.And why patience? The Free Will is a slow moving film that lasts 163 minutes longer than any other movies that discuss similar topics. However 163 minutes were used to explore the inner world of Theo right from the beginning when he sexually violated the problem to finding a solution for himself. Rather than having everything fast forward it goes on the pace of things happening in our daily life.Using a digital video camcorder to shoot the film The Free Will takes a much more closer approach to the story on an ex offender finding ways to change himself. Irreversible which was also filmed using a digital camcorder takes a real life approach on an incident that took place in less than 12 hour's time.The Free Will is a piece of fine work that explores beyond The Free Will.".

It is a German production and premiered In competition at the 56th Berlin International Film Festival in 2006. It tells the story about Theo Stoer a rapist who after spending more than nine years in a psychiatric hospital for crimes he committed while living and working as a kitchen helper on a Baltic Sea Island is sent to an assisted living residence in Mlheim Germany. Helped by a parole officer named Sascha Theo gets a job at a printing office begins to practice Martial Arts and is encouraged to find himself a woman whom he can take out on a date. Though struggling with a high level of anxiety Theo follows Sascha's advice and has no luck. He decides to give it a rest and focus on his daily tasks but one day he is introduced by his boss Claus Engelbrecht to his daughter Nettie a 27yearold kitchen assistant who is about to move out from her father's house and into her own apartment. Theo and Nettie are both lonely individuals who seek the company of others and without knowing anything about Theo's history Nettie becomes attracted to him.Finely and acutely directed by European filmmaker Matthias Glasner who was cowriter cocinematographer coproducer and coeditor on this feature film this quietly paced independent film draws an incisive and unsettling portrayal of a man who is trying to get back into society after serving time for committing horrendous crimes against women and an intimate and humane portrayal of a friendship and of a lonely considerate and independentminded woman who finds a connection and falls in love with a person she hardly knows. While notable for its gritty and naturalistic urban milieu depictions the versatile production design by production designers Tom Horning and Conny Kotte and the fine editing by Matthias Glasner German film editor Mona Braer and film editor Julia Wiedwald this at times silent and characterdriven story depicts two merging studies of character and examines themes like loneliness guilt and human relations.This dense somewhat disturbing and demanding psychological drama which alternates between the two main characters' viewpoints and between realism and nonrealism is impelled and reinforced by its rigorous narrative structure and the introspective and heartfelt acting performances by German screenwriter producer and actor Jrgen Vogel and Swiss actress Sabine Timoteo. An unsentimental and afflicting lovestory which gained among other awards the Prize of the Guild of German Arthouse Cinemas Matthias Glasner and the Silver Berlin Bear for Outstanding Artistic Achievement Jrgen Vogel at the 56th Berlin International Film Festival in 2006.".

Helped by a parole officer named Sascha Theo gets a job at a printing office begins to practice Martial Arts and is encouraged to find himself a woman whom he can take out on a date. Though struggling with a high level of anxiety Theo follows Sascha's advice and has no luck. He decides to give it a rest and focus on his daily tasks but one day he is introduced by his boss Claus Engelbrecht to his daughter Nettie a 27yearold kitchen assistant who is about to move out from her father's house and into her own apartment. Theo and Nettie are both lonely individuals who seek the company of others and without knowing anything about Theo's history Nettie becomes attracted to him.Finely and acutely directed by European filmmaker Matthias Glasner who was cowriter cocinematographer coproducer and coeditor on this feature film this quietly paced independent film draws an incisive and unsettling portrayal of a man who is trying to get back into society after serving time for committing horrendous crimes against women and an intimate and humane portrayal of a friendship and of a lonely considerate and independentminded woman who finds a connection and falls in love with a person she hardly knows. While notable for its gritty and naturalistic urban milieu depictions the versatile production design by production designers Tom Horning and Conny Kotte and the fine editing by Matthias Glasner German film editor Mona Braer and film editor Julia Wiedwald this at times silent and characterdriven story depicts two merging studies of character and examines themes like loneliness guilt and human relations.This dense somewhat disturbing and demanding psychological drama which alternates between the two main characters' viewpoints and between realism and nonrealism is impelled and reinforced by its rigorous narrative structure and the introspective and heartfelt acting performances by German screenwriter producer and actor Jrgen Vogel and Swiss actress Sabine Timoteo. An unsentimental and afflicting lovestory which gained among other awards the Prize of the Guild of German Arthouse Cinemas Matthias Glasner and the Silver Berlin Bear for Outstanding Artistic Achievement Jrgen Vogel at the 56th Berlin International Film Festival in 2006.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is the best example for what happens when someone does not focus on the script while making a movie.The DVD booklet says a lot about intimacy about how this intimacy with the characters was developed while making the movie. I can only say Thanks for wasting at least an hour of my life. The movie starts with a most brutal raping scene that made me wanting to puke. From there it staggers along with a lot of scenes showing Jrgen Vogel naked exercising masturbating and similar until the love story with Nettie played very well by Sabine Timoteo develops.The movie is 163 minutes. With enough meat to make it 90 minutes. In an interview the director who shows his semiexistent camera skills in too many shaky scenes talks about the script becoming a kind of map with a lot of blanks to be explored while filming and thats shown in the movie. 5 minute long end scene with Nettie holding Theo at the beach 15 minutes chasing Theo through Berlin etc. No focus. No story. Very arty. Thanks for wasting German TVfee money on that one.And we see way too much of Jrgen Vogels penis. Some things need not to be shown. Art is too impress without showing. Too show it all just shows that the director lacks the means to create all the horror and disgust without the clear picture. On the contrary when Theo breaks into a woman's apartment to rape her we see him leave but we have no idea whether his demons got the upper hand or not. So there is sadistic curiosity when someone is raped but when the free will has it's short time it's too much to just state the fact and the audience is left in the dark.The camera is so bad that it hurts. Has no one ever told the director that a digital camera is not the right choice for dark scenes ? When a leg in the dark or a face consists of about 57 shades of grey the camera might have been the wrong choice. And the movie has a lot of dark scenes. And they all look the grainy way which is the best such a camera can do in such a scene. Maybe some less intimacy and some more professional pictures might have been achieved by using a real camera man instead of doing it all alone.So after all the movie sucks. The actors are great 3 stars for that but thats about it. 3 years of research and writing just to throw the script away as soon as you start filming. But hey who cares it's not as if this movie was supposed to make any money. A classical German.".

I hope no female viewer will memorize that move because it will not work at all but even put her in greater danger.A typical poor German movie I have seen many of this kind.

	schema:reviewBody "Abgeschminkt!or Making Up! is a German romantic comedy movie from 1993 so this one has its 25th anniversary this year. It was the first full feature film effort by director Katja von Garnier and she is also one of the writers here although full feature film is pretty debatable with this one staying comfortably under the 1hour mark. You don't see films with this running time too often also here in Germany. And you see it even rarer that they actually get a solid deal of awards recognition especially from prestigious awards bodies like the German Film Awards here with both lead actresses receiving nimoninations and the movie also getting in for Best Picture. Actually that is fairly inspiring and I would certainly support more films of this running time being made. But nonetheless I cannot agree with the perception of quality here really. Maybe it is because it is a movie that is really more for females as it is mostly about females but the plot is a bit predictable and the writing not too creative most of the time and rarely funny admittedly and that is of course a negative deal breaker for any comedy. Plus I am not a great fan of Riemann in general and did not care a lot for Kronjger here either. As a consequence I found it really difficult to find the characters they portray likable or even hope for them to find happiness and they clearly were supposed to be likable. And yeah like I said the predictability especially in the second half was not helping matters either at all to be fair so I must say I am glad it was such a short movie to be honest even if it is by no means bad on a level where I would call it a failure even if von Garnier has some later projects in her body of work that kinda fit the description. By the way on the script here she worked together with actor Hannes Jaenicke which is a rare occurence to see him anywhere else as cast. Of course you don't know how much he contributed to the script and if it was a good idea that he mostly stayed away from that department. but all production values taken together this was neither a successful watch for me in terms of both romance and comedy. That's why I give it a thumbsdown and suggest you watch something else instead.".

Possibly the most benign and engaging performance ever by Alec Baldwin Geena Davis Winona Ryder and Sylvia Sidney are also very appealing. The new couple from New York who take over the house Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara aren't as well written or thoughtout as the other characters and some of their bemused dryice comic lines take a few seconds to reach you. Of course there's Michael Keaton wildly comic as Betelgeuse. I recall hearing comments back in 1988 that Keaton wasn't around enough to make the picture worthwhile but that's only if you watch the film for the fast quips and sightgags. Keaton is truly wonderful but he's also bombastic and I felt there was just enough of him to satisfyit's really not his story anyway it belongs to Baldwin and Davis Betelgeuse is used as a horny vulgar punchline. Director Tim Burton is very careful not to overload the movie with raunch he is surprisingly careful in setting up this story and he works magic within a dubious scenario a comic fantasy about dead folks which ultimately celebrates life. 12 from ".

He picked a great leading male Michael Keaton as well as to pick a very strong cast that turned into what could have been a total flop into a cult classic that will be remembered for ages to come. Beetlejuice is a very strange movie that explores life after death turning into a ghost and having to accept that you died now move on. But what if there was one ghost who maybe had too much fun and just wanted to rock the living world? That's what Beetlejuice is about the one zombie that you'd love to party with once but then ignore at the next party he's invited too.Barbara and Adam Maitland decide to spend their vacation decorating their idyllic New England country home. Upon returning from the trip to town however Barbara swerves to avoid a dog wandering the roadway. The couple's vehicle crashes through a covered bridge and plunges into the river below killing Barbara and Adam. The couple soon returns home in spirit form and quickly come to the conclusion that they are dead. A book entitled Handbook for the Recently Deceased confirms the couple's suspicion that they are in fact dead. Barbara and Adam's peace is soon shattered when their house is sold and the new residents arrive from New York City. Charles Deetz aspiring sculptor and Charles' second wife Delia and Charles' goth daughter Lydia from his first marriage move into the home. Juno who informs Barbara and Adam that they must remain in the house for 125 years. If they want the Deetzes out it is up to them to scare them away. Although the Maitlands remain invisible to Charles and Delia their daughter Lydia can see Adam and Barbara and becomes their friend. Against the advice of Juno the Maitlands contact the miscreant Betelgeuse a freelance bioexorcist to scare away the Deetzes but they have their hands full now with this crazy psycho.Beetlejuice is an awesome movie it's one of the funniest movies you'll see. I will be honest it's a strange humor as it's a dark comedy but it's all good. Seriously Michael Keaton is such a great comedic actor he was the perfect choice he brought the right amount of cockiness and comedy to the role. Also Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin had great chemistry as well as the perfect Leave it to Beaveresquire type of couple that has a hard time accepting their world as the afterlife. Jeffrey Jones Catherine O'Hara and Winona Ryder were perfect as the Deetzes quite disturbing and awkward. I highly recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it it's a great comedy classic.1010".

Along with 'Blade Runner' 'Blue Velvet' 'Videodrome' 'Brazil' 'Paris Texas' 'The Terminator' and 'Repo Man' it was one of the most astonishing and memorable  movies of the 1980s an era dominated by Hollywood dreck like 'Flashdance' 'Top Gun' and 'Footloose'. The whole BruckheimerSimpsonSpielbergHughes zeitgeist that dumbed down popular movies as never before. Movies like 'Beetlejuice' were a glimmer of hope in a truly awful period.The big question is  how does it stand up today? The answer is better than ever! In fact I would argue that 'Beetlejuice' is Tim Burton's most successful and least compromised film. Everything about it is perfect. A great cast lead by the very appealing and likable Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis as the newly dead Maitlands a star turn by Michael Keaton as the gonzo bioexorcist title character and strong support from Jeffrey Jones Catherine O'Hara and especially Winona Ryder a performance that really put her on the map as the new occupants of the Maitlands house. 'Beetlejuice' juggles gruesome trippy and genuinely witty sequences and ends up becoming one of the freshest and surreal movies to find a mainstream audience since the heyday of 60s70s head movies. Forget Burton's more recent hit and miss big budget efforts and try this for the real deal Luis Bunuel meets Tex Avery meets George Romero and then some! 'Beetlejuice' is a blast!".

It took me four viewings before I finally appreciated Catharine O'Hara's comedic talents in this movie. Now she's my favorite and someone I find absolutely hilarious as the messedup wifemother of a family who moves into a haunted house inhabited by Baldwin and Davis.Keaton made himself a name as an actor with this whackedout Robin Williamstype role although he never really followed up with anything that was as popular as this film. Winona Rider is cute as the teenage daughter and we get other fun supporting roles from diverse people as talk show host Dick Cavett singer Robert Goulet and actor Jeffrey Jones. All of them are good.Tim Burton directed the film and so I wasn't surprised there were the typical occult themes with ghosts and the like and no heaven or hell but some other strange existence being touted where dead people go....a ridiculous picture of the afterlife.

Michael Keaton steals the show as the repulsive and raucous Bioexorcist  he spent only two weeks filming his part in the film  which lasts 17.5 minutes out of the 92minute running time . The highlights of the film are the unforgettable Calypso scenes that result to be priceless images . The original script was a horror film  and featured Beetlejuice as a winged reptilian demon who transformed into a small Middle Eastern man  subsequent script rewrites turned the film into a comedy and toned down Beetlejuice's character into the ghost of an wise cracking conartist rather than a demon. Winona Ryder is astounding as the Gothic adolescent with a death complex and majoring in weirdness  while Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones are amusing as the yuppie marriage . The picture packs eyepopping and colorful cinematography by Thomas Ackerman . Lively and amusing musical score by Danny Elffman  Tim Burton's usual .Not surprisingly the movie's impressive boxoffice success created plans for a sequel Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian. A script was commissioned and Michael Keaton and Winona Ryder both signed on to reprise their respective roles but Tim Burton lost interest in the project and went on to direct Batman and Batman Returns instead. As late as 1996 Warner Bros. was still trying to get the original sequel concept into production but a finished film has yet to materialize.The motion picture was well realized by Tim Burton  giving a quirky vision of the afterlife and showing his usual weird touches .

I seriously considered turning the thing off right then and there because I had already vowed never to see another Burton film.But I'd heard a lot of good things about this movie so I decided to give it a chance.And in truth I'm kind of glad I did because it wasn't too bad. The premise was interesting and original. It was certainly a different take on the afterlife and it definitely had me at times thinking What would I do in this situation? Which is a good thing. I liked the protagonist couple and was rooting for them. Also a good thing.But in typical Burton fashion it ends up trading coherence for oddity. This occurs as soon as the title character comes in. Betelgeuse the character makes no sense. His motivations his situation what it exactly means to say his name three times none of this ever really makes sense in any coherent consistent way. And Burton obviously doesn't care. He just wants to make things weird and overthetop. So in the end the plot really degrades into making no sense and going nowhere. How exactly is Betelgeuse apparently trapped in the model? No explanation offered. Why do the ghosts suddenly turn all old and dried up during the sance? No reason offered. It just makes things weird and over the top. What would have happened if the good guys had managed to say his name thrice during the wedding scene? No clue Burton can't be bothered to think through his premise in any consistent way.The result is a flashy busy climax full of sound and fury and signifying NOTHING. In a movie where the whole plot was set up to be about a ghost couple trying to drive the living out of their house the climax ends up being about stopping this other ghost from marrying one of the living. The plot has Officially Gone Nowhere.And it's a shame really because this started out being a pretty good movie and really could've been much much better than it was. Step one would've been entirely removing Betelgeuse from Beetlejuice.Jeez they couldn't even manage to spell the title correctly.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I recently reviewed his 'Big Fish' on this board I stated that Tim Burton is generally at his best directing quirky offbeat films such as 'Edward Scissorhands' 'Ed Wood' or 'Big Fish' itself and less entertaining when he moves into the mainstream. Having since then seen 'Beetlejuice' for the first time I realize that there are exceptions to that general rule. 'Beetlejuice' a black comedy about the afterlife is hardly mainstream Hollywood fare but I also found it far from entertaining.The central characters Adam and Barbara Maitland are a nicebutwet young couple who live just outside an idyllic small New England town in one of those huge rambling weather boarded mansions that looks as though it has been taken straight from an Edward Hopper painting. After they are killed in a road accident they return to their house as ghosts. The view of life after death in this film is an unusual one which has little in common with Christian eschatology or with traditional ghost stories. The dead are compelled to return to the house where they lived during their lifetimes if they attempt to go outside they find themselves in a desert landscape populated by monstrous worms. This imagery was presumably derived from Frank Herbert's sciencefiction novel 'Dune' and the film that was made from it a few years before 'Beetlejuice'. They can however contact other departed spirits who can help them cope with the trials of the afterlife by for example leaving them a copy of the 'Handbook for the Recently Deceased'. The Maitlands' main trial takes the form of Charles and Delia Deitz the pretentious yuppie couple who buy their house. Irritated beyond endurance by this tasteless pair the Maitlands attempt to scare them away but their efforts prove ineffectual because the only member of the family who can see them is their daughter Lydia who far from being frightened by Adam and Barbara takes a liking to them and befriends them. Like another reviewer I was struck by the thematic similarity to Oscar Wilde's 'The Canterville Ghost' which deals with the attempts of a ghost to frighten away an American family living in his ancestral home. In that story too the only person to befriend the ghost is the young daughter of the newcomers. Wilde's story although it has moments of pathos is also a satire directed against both the traditionalism and snobbery of the British aristocracy represented by the ghost and the materialism and brashness of the American nouveauxriches. 'Beetlejuice' also contains some satirical material chiefly at the expense of the pretentiously bohemian Deitzes who redecorate the Maitlands' house in a garish modernistic style and fill it with Delia's abstract sculptures. It is never explained why a couple with such radically contemporary tastes would actually want to buy a Victorian mansion in the first place. Modern art however is a notoriously difficult subject to satirize largely because it is impossible for the satirist to come up with a concept which is more extreme and exaggerated than the artists' own ideas. Delia's sculptures might look like pretentious tat but one can see aesthetically similar items in established museums or in galleries bearing pricetags marked in thousands of pounds. Lydia a follower of the thenfashionable 'Goth' cult claims that she can see ghosts because she is 'strange and unusual'. The film loses the chance to make the point that the Goth movement like most teenage cults from the Teddy Boys to grunge was not so much strange and unusual as an alternative way to be conformist. Satire however is largely abandoned when the title character enters. Despairing of their own ability to scare away the intruders the Maitlands engage the services of Betelgeuse a 'bioexorcist' who specializes in helping ghosts rid their properties of the unwanted living. Although the film is called 'Beetlejuice' the name of the character is spelt 'Betelgeuse' I can only presume that the producers wanted to change the spelling to something more userfriendly and failed to realize that we actually see the name written down several times in the film. From this point on the film becomes an evermore frantic slapstick comedy as Betelgeuse makes increasingly manic attempts to get rid of the Deitzes. Betelgeuse is played in bizarre makeup by Michael Keaton in one of the most frenetic overthetop pieces of acting in the modern cinema. Even some of Jim Carrey's efforts look restrained by comparison. The other characters fade into the background and any attempt at a plot degenerates into a series of stunts and gimmicky special effects. The film certainly shows evidence of Tim Burton's vivid visual imagination but he seems unable bring any discipline to his talents. 'Beetlejuice' is an inventive but disappointing film even when viewed as a pure comedy and lacking the wisdom and philosophical insight that Burton was able to bring to 'Edward Scissorhands' or 'Big Fish'. 410".

	schema:reviewBody "Beetlejuice is one of those films you feel guilty about not liking more. Sounds daft I know but it's a bit like not liking as much an aunt everyone else insists is a real sweetie but with the best will in the world you just can't see it. I mean Beetlejuice is by Tim Burton right and an early masterpiece right and Michael Keaton in the title role delivers a barnstorming performance right and it's full of examples of Tim Burton's celebrated offthewall wacky humour right with loads of imaginative special effects right. And anyway everyone and I mean everyone thinks it's really really good and really really cool and just you know brilliant I mean really really brilliant right. So if you disagree and you know you don't get it it's your problem man because everyone else thinks it's really really cool and really really brilliant. But unfortunately I don't think it is really really good and really really brilliant. The real problem is that I don't think I even have a problem  I just don't think Beetlejuice is quite as good as everyone and I mean everyone right says. It's rather like Robert De Niro's performance in Mean Streets everyone says it's pure genius then you see it and you think aren't they exaggerating just a little I mean just a little? It's good yes but . . . Beetlejuice is this film I had heard so much about which was truly original and with which Tim Burton first made his name or something. But I had never seen it because somehow I didn't when it first came out and then it was never in a cinema near me or else when it was shown on TV I didn't get to hear about it until it was too late. But I also made a mental note that I simply must see it and when I found that one of our local supermarkets was selling a copy for 4 which is my sort of price in it went into the shopping basket. In the event I didn't get to slip it into my DVD player i.e. my iBook until a few weeks later but when I did I couldn't get rid of the niggling suspicion that I was in for something of a disappointment. Now it would be pointless to go into chapter and verse pointing out a flaw here and a flaw there because quite truthfully Tim Burton does have a rather extraordinary imagination and in many respects Beetlejuice is streets ahead of the competition. You might even say that Burton rewrote the rules for making films in a certain kind of genre although I would be hardpushed to give that genre a name. But let me give just one example the Maitland's are in so many ways such caricatures that you assume such characterisation will be part of the plot. But it isn't. Then we are presented with the Deetz family and their camp interior designer and again the characterisation is so broadbrush that you wonder just at what level the whole thing is being pitched. Well actually it doesn't matter. This is cartoon stuff except that it doesn't feature animation but acting. OK fair enough. Then we get to Keaton giving an undoubted tour de force but in an odd sort of way it never really takes off. We are informed that at one point he was someone's assistant but his behaviour became so extreme that he had to be let go. Well perhaps I'm being a little overpernickety here but I want some sort of back story which would help flesh out Beetlejuice. But all we are led to believe is that he should on no account be invoked. Naturally he is invoked but oddly the film finishes quite soon afterwards in an ending which involved a deus ex machina of such obviousness that I would bet my shirt the writer simply did not know how to end his story. In fact apart from the fact that one could dies and wants to scare another couple out of their home what was the story. When the film came I was even taken by surprise was that it? I thought for although by now Beetlejuice had already been running for 90 minutes odd in a sense it was only just getting going. But no that was it like it or lump it. Perhaps I am expecting too much. Perhaps I am being too serious. Perhaps I should just relax and get into the spirit of the film and no silly pun intended there. The trouble is that Beetlejuice could have been so much more. We often say that soandso was more than just the sum of its parts and hope to indicate that it included an x factor which raised it above the rest. Well for me Beetlejuice is in a sense less the sum of its parts. It seemingly has everything but . . . Oh well I'll just have to firm a subgroup of those who don't think this is the best thing since sliced bread.".

	onyx:emotionText "Beetlejuice is one of those films you feel guilty about not liking more. Sounds daft I know but it's a bit like not liking as much an aunt everyone else insists is a real sweetie but with the best will in the world you just can't see it. I mean Beetlejuice is by Tim Burton right and an early masterpiece right and Michael Keaton in the title role delivers a barnstorming performance right and it's full of examples of Tim Burton's celebrated offthewall wacky humour right with loads of imaginative special effects right. And anyway everyone and I mean everyone thinks it's really really good and really really cool and just you know brilliant I mean really really brilliant right. So if you disagree and you know you don't get it it's your problem man because everyone else thinks it's really really cool and really really brilliant. But unfortunately I don't think it is really really good and really really brilliant. The real problem is that I don't think I even have a problem  I just don't think Beetlejuice is quite as good as everyone and I mean everyone right says. It's rather like Robert De Niro's performance in Mean Streets everyone says it's pure genius then you see it and you think aren't they exaggerating just a little I mean just a little? It's good yes but . . . Beetlejuice is this film I had heard so much about which was truly original and with which Tim Burton first made his name or something. But I had never seen it because somehow I didn't when it first came out and then it was never in a cinema near me or else when it was shown on TV I didn't get to hear about it until it was too late. But I also made a mental note that I simply must see it and when I found that one of our local supermarkets was selling a copy for 4 which is my sort of price in it went into the shopping basket. In the event I didn't get to slip it into my DVD player i.e. my iBook until a few weeks later but when I did I couldn't get rid of the niggling suspicion that I was in for something of a disappointment. Now it would be pointless to go into chapter and verse pointing out a flaw here and a flaw there because quite truthfully Tim Burton does have a rather extraordinary imagination and in many respects Beetlejuice is streets ahead of the competition. You might even say that Burton rewrote the rules for making films in a certain kind of genre although I would be hardpushed to give that genre a name. But let me give just one example the Maitland's are in so many ways such caricatures that you assume such characterisation will be part of the plot. But it isn't.

The Maitland couple dies and starts their afterlife but are confined the their house that they previously owned. But as they are just ghosts a new family moves in which is made up of a money scheming father a artistic greedy stepmother and a lonely daughter. The ghost couple make friends with the daughter but it is their goal to make this obnoxious nuisance of a family and their cronies to leave the premises and themselves in peace. While they attempt to go through with their plans and figure out this new strange existence they run into and seek the help of a bioexorcist or scareroftheliving named Beetlejuice.

This film also brought us one of many wonderful collaborations with the musical genius Danny Elfman. A side to Michael Keaton that I had never seen before was revealed through his character it added a new depth to his skill in acting. While I did enjoy the overall idea of the strange and unusual film it was far from perfect. The makeup was exquisite which it deservingly won an Academy Award for but some of the other effects looked straight out of fake looking theme park attraction. It had the meticulously detailed diorama and the up close version that was even more fascinating when they switch over to that world yet they also had ridiculously cheesy characters that brought the overall appearance down. I thoroughly enjoy stop motion animation but it's presence in much of the film seemed out of place and unnecessary.To be honest I am surprised that this film is so popular. It seems like a film that would appeal to very few yet it draws people in. This movie made it on the American Film Institute's list of 100 Greatest Comedies. While I did find some parts amusing a lot of the humor was really corny. The singing scenes were simply awful and I found Beetlejuice more offensive and annoying than comedic. The story also seemed to not be very focused. We had about seven main characters and no sense of direction. While I did love some aspects of it I found more of it to just be disappointing.".

After recently watching this film I found this to be inevitably true.At a much younger age I had the privilege of watching Tim Burtons 'Beetlejuice' and was taken aback by this wonderment of fiction versus reality. Ghosts ghouls a freaky child a scary woman and a clownlike rogue who everyone can't help but love  Beetlejuice. Sounds like the perfect recipe for a good comedy well not if you're over the age of ten.Beetlejuice  revisited was a disappointment. I was alarmed at the wooden performance given by Alec Baldwin as Adam a man who is recently deceased and has to face life as an immortal along with his wife Barbara  Geena Davis. Now I do understand that it is a family comedy and brilliant acting is not essential but I was alarmed that he actually agreed to star in this film.The story is pretty straight forward. Adam and Barbara become the undead and a new obnoxious family move into their home. Adam and Barbara still live there but as they are dead they cannot be seen except by the family's gothlike daughter Lydia Winona Ryder. The couple take a liking to Lydia and she begins to help the couple in their distress. They are unable to come to terms with their new selves and are drawn into dealings with the great 'Beetlejuice' a helper of the recently deceased. However as time passes Beetlejuice's antics as a troublesome rogue become too much for everyone.Overall it is a good film for children it has the impish comedy seen in films like 'Home Alone' and it would most definitely occupy a younger viewer. An advantage is that it stars Michael Keaton as the indelible 'Beetlejuice' and his performance is worthy of a look. as always.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tim Burton's Beetlejuice was not marketed as a surrealist film when it came out and as such no one remembers it for the batshit crazy journey into the absurd that it treats you to. It's touted as a slightly subversive yet also vaguely family friendly ghost romp and yes that's the jist of it yet hidden beneath the lines that people can read between if they are keen enough is a completely organic stream of nonsensical almost dreamlike events threaded together by a shaky theme of life after death. Michael Keaton portrays rambunctious zombie bio exorcist Betelgeuse in a face smacking loony toon of a performance that's the best of his interesting and varied career. He's a whackjob wonder a perverted pile of silliness with a mean streak a mile long and a penchant for all kinds of bizarre paranormal mischief. He's called to action when a quaint naive New England couple gorgeous Geena Davis and an oh so young Alec Baldwin perish in an auto accident and are looking to rid their home of its insufferable new inhabitants. They arrive in the form of gag inducing trendy NYC interior designer Otho Glenn Shadix RIP who acts like he walked right out of a satirical episode of South Park Charles Jeffrey Jones the lovable bugger and Delia Deetz a spastic Catherine O Hara and their cutie daughter Lydia an emo Winona Ryder one of my first movie crushes . They walk right in like they own the place well.. they kinda do with dastardly plans to remodel it to their eyebrow raising yuppie fashion fanaticism. Baldwin and Davis see no other option but to summon Keaton by saying his odd name three times. After that all bets are off as Betelgeuse leers right out of the astral plane to cause no end of trouble for literally everyone including himself. Keaton soars like he hasn't since then giving a performance that makes the Joker the Mask and Bugs Bunny seem like introverts. There's a constant cascade of phenomenal practical effects and gooey makeup on display as well. When Davis and Baldwin venture into the afterlife beyond their home into the cluttered bureaucracy of the spirit world we're treated to all sorts of sights sounds and an out of this world creative aesthetic that honestly seems like Burton entered someone's dreams on the night before Halloween and pulled out all kinds of wonder for the viewer to behold. From a DMV like waiting room for deceased souls to a football team that doesn't realize they're dead yet to a massive snake with Keaton's ugly mug on the end of it there's just no stop to the jaw dropping spectacle on display. Sylvia Sydney is dryly hilarious as an otherworldweary afterlife caseworker and there's fun bits from Robert Goulet Dick Cavett and more as well. For something truly unexpected endlessly creative and undefinable check it out. Although I assume that anyone reading this has at least seen this five times if not more. I've lost count.".

	schema:headline " Involving Affecting Drama from Scott Elliott";
	schema:reviewBody "Strong performances by Sigourney Weaver and Julianne Moore highlight this involving and at times emotionally draining film about the boundaries that are inherently a part of our lives and the limits of those boundaries both in how much we are able to give as well as how much we can take.  A Map of the World' directed by Scott Elliott examines the confines of the parameters within which an individual must live and the finite capacity of any one person to endure stress that exceeds the specific limitations established for that individual by nature.  And it's not a matter of one knowing one's limitations rather it is a matter of knowing how to cope with the results once one has been driven past the breaking point into a world that can no longer be viewed in black and white but only in shades of gray that point beyond right or wrong or what is politically correct the point at which nothing matters but survival how to live in a world that can have so much to offer while being so relentlessly unmerciful and decidedly unforgiving at the same time.Transplanted from the big city to a farm in Wisconsin Alice and Howard Goodwin Sigourney Weaver David Strathairn are attempting to make a go of their own dairy business.  But it isn't easy.  Howard is immersed in his work while Alice in addition to taking on the full time responsibilities and pressures of raising their two daughters and maintaining the household also works as a school nurse.  And though Alice likes her life the constant strain of keeping her own life on task as well as seemingly everyone else within her sphere of existence begins to take a toll on her.With no respite from the daily grind Alice becomes increasingly exhausted and exasperated.  She finds some solace in her close friend Theresa Collins Julianne Moore but what she really needs is some time to herself some time to clear her head and regroup.  Instead an unexpected summer tragedy strikes the Goodwin and Collins households which damages Alice's much needed relationship with Theresa.  And as if that isn't enough further trials and tribulations are about to descend upon Alice one of those curves life has a way of throwing at you when it's least expected or needed.  And it's something that will test the limits of Alice's capacity to endure more than ever before.Working from a remarkably insightful screenplay by Peter Hedges and Polly Platt adapted from the novel by Jane Hamilton director Elliott presents a genuinely honest film that takes an indepth look at what it often takes just to maintain' on a daily basis and the very real issues and situations that a person like Alice is apt to encounter.  From the very beginning Elliott establishes the credibility of the film by creating an atmosphere and setting that is entirely real so real in fact it will be more than a bit disconcerting to many who will so readily be able to identify with Alice and relate to her situation.  And having effected such realism Elliott then moves on to deliver a thoroughly engrossing emotional drama which he renders with great care and sensitivity.Elliott achieves success with this film through an obviously keen understanding of the material the story and the characters and their corresponding attitudes and reactions to given situations.  And he keeps it real' throughout by eschewing any superfluous melodrama or subplots the likes to which a film like this in lesser hands could easily lend itself. In the final analysis Elliott knows what he wants to convey and furthermore knows how to do it by exacting the kind of performances from his actors that really sells it.As often happens too often in fact the extraordinary performances in this film were inexplicably overlooked as well as the film itself andor ignored.  Sigourney Weaver gives a commanding performance as Alice arguably as affecting and effective as the work that earned Hillary Swank the Oscar this year for her portrayal of Brandon Teena in Boys Don't Cry.'  This is quite simply some of the best work Weaver has ever done and it's a shame that she has not enjoyed the kind of acclaim that would accompany such an accomplishment in a perfect world.  Which adds some irony to the whole thing inasmuch as part of what this film is attempting to convey and does so successfully is that we do not in fact live in a perfect world. All that aside this is a memorable portrayal in which Weaver exhibits a phenomenal depth and range of emotion.The field was strong in the Supporting Actress category this year Angelina Jolie received the gold for Girl Interrupted' but Julianne Moore's performance here stands alongside any of those honored with a nomination for their work.  Like Weaver Moore faced the challenge of creating a character that is so mainstream and normal' one of those everybody's neighbor or theclerkatthestore type of roles that the real difficulty lay in making it look so natural which when successfully effected makes it all look so easy.'  Which is exactly what Moore did with her portrayal of Theresa.  And again like Weaver it's a performance for which she has never received the deserved acknowledgement.  Suffice to say it's terrific work and a big part of what makes this film so emotionally stirring.Also effective is David Strathairn as Alice's selfabsorbed husband Howard a man suffering from a terminal case of tunnel vision.  How good he is here in fact can be measured by the feelings of disdain he manages to evoke toward his character which at times is quite substantial.The supporting cast includes Arliss Howard Reverdy Louise Fletcher Nellie Sara Rue Debbie Nicole Parker Sherry and Aunjanue Ellis Dyshett.  An ardently thought provoking film A Map of the World' invites a sense of introspection and reflection a film that's definitely going to make you do some thinking.  910.".

It has adult themes and some very troubling subject matter. As good as Weaver is the supporting cast also offers some very powerful moments. David Strathairn portrays Howard Goodwin Alice's husband as he helplessly watches the community turn against the entire family and as he struggles with the decisions that need to be made to free Alice. Julianna Moore as Theresa Collins the mother whose child died while being watched by Alice is very believable as the grieving mother struggling with her anger toward Alice over her daughter's death and yet also convinced that the assault charges against her are ridiculous. The scenes between Strathairn and Collins both playing vulnerable characters dealing with circumstances completely beyond their control are raw with emotion. The only performance I found truly disappointing was that of Arliss Howard as attorney Paul Reverdy. I didn't find him believable in the role.All in all though this is a strong movie and well deserves an 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Map of the World is easily one of the most honest films I've ever seen. The merits go specially to a very fine cast and a clever well written screenplay. Sigourney Weaver really shines here in an Oscar caliber performance as Alice Goodwin a woman who is not afraid to show what she is feeling. She is married has two young girls lives in a farm and works at a school nursery. Her life seems calm but happy until a terrible accident happens followed by a sad mistake and her life falls apart.A Map of the World had everything to be a bland and conventional film but it is not. I have to say that I don't give any merit to the direction this is indeed the main problem. The director doesn't captivate the audience and doesn't seem to care about that. There are many slow moments and scenes that could have been cut. But A Map of the World is a rarity a very good film with mediocre directing. Who is the miracle maker? Sigourney Weaver surely. She shows passion for acting and an incredible strength as Alice Goodwin. I can't imagine anyone else playing Alice because Sigourney is perfect building her character. The Oscar was gone but I put Weaver on my list of snubbed stars this year. But she doesn't work alone Julianne Moore is here and when she is in you can expect much. I'm a fan of Ms. Moore since I've seen her in Short Cuts and now that I've seen Magnolia if you've read some of my reviews you know how much I praise Magnolia I'm starting to adore this lady. She shines even in slapstick comedies as Nine Months... There's nothing she can't do!Getting back to A Map of the World I have to say that I appreciated very much its screenplay. It was written with strength trying to escape of the clichs even in courtroom scenes. There are many beautiful messages the film has to pass and it should be admired for this. It shows that everyone commits mistakes more than one time and that is why we are ordinary people with qualities and flaws. We should learn with ourselves and with the others. We should believe in ourselves and try to cope with our mistakes. The film has messages like these to learn and many others resulting in a complex study of people in conflict.I truly recommend A Map of the World despite its flaws. Watch it for Sigourney Julianne and the messages and forget the weak directing. It is a worth seeing.".

	schema:headline " Good story weak directing";
	schema:reviewBody "When I finished this film I was sure that it ran over two and a half hours. In reality it was only 125 minutes.  That reveals something about the pace.  If you can imagine a worm burrowing through granite you have the idea.Actually the story was a good one.  The problem was the screenplay and the direction.  This is a story of Alice Goodwin Sigourney Weaver a city girl who has moved to the country so her husband could try his hand at farming. However this is no Green Acres.  Alice is having difficulty coping with country life and her relationship with her two children.  One day she is minding a friend's children and leaves them playing with her own children momentarily to put on her bathing suit.  Upon returning she discovers one of her friend's little girls missing and after a desperate search finds her face down in the pond.  Subsequent to this tragic accident Alice is accused of child abuse by another child who claims she molested him in her duties as school nurse.  The two incidents together turn the whole town ugly as they assume she must be guilty.  The story is an indepth character study of Alice and her struggle to cope with both her guilt and innocence.  The guilt is her feeling of responsibility for the little girl's drowning and the innocence is the knowledge that she is not a child abuser.Usually I enjoy complex character studies with deep conflicting emotions but this one left me exhausted.  This is not because of the story but because of the script and the presentation by Director Scott Elliot.  Far too much time was spent on scenes that weren't really interesting or relevant.  The dialogue often seemed inconsistent with the characters especially in Howard's David Straithairn case.  The lawyer was made to look like a buffoon.  Having seen Arliss Howard in a number of other films I know he is a capable dramatic actor so I have to assume this was the director's interpretation of the character.  Sigourney Weaver has received much critical acclaim for this performance but I found it to be somewhat uneven.  She was superb in parts especially the parts where she was playing the strong woman trying to hold it all together.  However she seemed to struggle with the vulnerable parts as if she wasn't comfortable with the character.  I realize that part of the point was that Alice wasn't comfortable in her own skin and used a lot of defense mechanisms to cope but Weaver seemed unnatural and forced in these scenes. She seems to have a lot tougher time playing weakness than strength.  In that regard Julianne Moore's performance was much better.  Her breakdown scene in the woods was compelling and heartrending.David Straithairn was well cast as the selfsacrificing and supportive husband a role with which he is well familiar.  However he too seemed uncharacteristically tentative.  When veteran actors have so much trouble giving confident performances one has to wonder if there was a disconnect between the actors and the first time director.Overall despite some good performances and a solid story the whole project just didn't come together and dragged ponderously from scene to scene.  I rated it a 610.  For patient viewers only.".

Some people have sleighted this movie because of how quickly the trial is taken care of near the end but in fact the book is the same way and for good reason the trial is not what the story is about. Unfortunately as with so many booktofilm translations the poetry of the prose and thus some of the deeper meanings are lost. Some of the changes between the film and the book work effectively to condense dozens of pages into one idea the wall of baby pictures in the jail helps quickly convey Alice's changing relationship with her unit mates but other changes only serve to hammer home a point that was made with much more subtlety in the book. Did we really need angry graffiti on the side of the Goodwin's house? WE GET IT  the town didn't like them! Pat Metheny's original soundtrack was beautifully melodic as he usually is but it didn't fit in with the feel of the movie and surprisingly it didn't have much of the Midwest sensibilities one would expect from a composer from Missouri. Nonetheless this movie will at least be worth a video rental especially if you are a Sigourney Weaver fan and want to see her doing something other than an Alien pic. While it took me awhile to warm to it her portrayal of Alice in the end is stunning and much more complex than anything else in this movie.".

It's about the life of a married woman a city woman in a farming small town environment with two young daughters and a not quite communicative husband how things just happened one day out of the blue and the subsequent unexpected spinoff events turning her life topsy turvy and her unusually calm approach to it all. Nothing is what it seems  we just have to ride the enduring travails with the three principal characters.Very mature performance by Sigourney Weaver as Alice Goodwin the seemingly always selfassured independent educated person in control as the wife giving instructions to her husband as the mother handling her daughters as the school nurse attending to the kids. She always knows what she's saying or doing. Yet she's actually holding back a lot of mixed emotions within herself unable to let go most of all unable to forgive herself.Julianne Moore is Theresa a good friend and neighbor to Alice. She gave another supporting nuance performance. David Strathairn is Howard the quiet gentle husband. Arliss Howard is the assured lawyer that Alice wanted for the case he commented he has never seen anyone took to these wrongful accusations so well and asked what's her trick to keep so calm and collected to which she replied Have you ever wanted to go away on an island That's how she felt about being away from it all  that world of conceivable madness outside.The three principals are veteran actors who have matured with such elegance and in multiple intelligent rolesSigourney Weaver is far beyond the queen of alien movies since 1979 with the subsequent three sequels she has been the unattainable woman opposite William Hurt in 1981 Eyewitness Mel Gibson in 1982 The Year of Living Dangerously Michael Caine in 1986 Half Moon Street delivered tour de force performances in 1988 Gorilla in the Mist 1994 Death and the Maiden 1995 Copycat. Twice opposite Kevin Kline in 1993 Dave and 1997 The Ice Storm. Comedywise she shines as one of the super fun members in 1984 and 1989 Ghostbusters flicks the wicked boss to Melanie Griffith in 1988 Working Girl and yet another fun member of the hilarious team in 1999 Galaxy Quest.David Strathairn  I first remembered him in director Phil Alden Robinson's 1992 Sneakers with the fun ensemble cast of computer wizards Robert Redford Sidney Poitier River Phoenix Dan Aykroyd Strathairn was the wiz who's blind and what an outstanding performance he did. His other roles have been pretty much the subtle supporting man e.g. to Mercedes Ruehl in 1993 Lost in Yonkers as the pastor in 1998 Simon Birch but he was definitely front and center in his long time association since 1980 and seventh time round with John Sayles in 1999 Limbo delivering a terrific performance opposite Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Vanessa Martinez.Julianne Moore  I remember her initially in Robert Altman's stellar ensemble cast of 1993 Short Cuts then her unforgettable performance in Todd Haynes' 1995 Safe she stands out in another ensemble cast in Paul Thomas Anderson's 1997 Boogie Nights. In 1999 she's in five films an outstanding delivery playing opposite Glenn Close in Altman's fun ensemble piece Cookies Fortune another ensemble tonguewhipping cast in Oscar Wilde's An Ideal Husband Oliver Parker directed yet part of another ensemble engineered by P.T. Anderson in Magnolia then front and center as the love of Ralph Fiennes' character in Neil Jordan's The End of the Affair and here an effective supporting role in A Map of the World.Bold debut direction by Scott Elliott. A bonus is the film scored by the Pat Metheny Group  the guitar plus strings aptly complemented the mood and flavor of the plot. This film may not be for a teenage audience it certainly warrants mature appreciation.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here's how A Map of the World gets its title  Alice Weaver drew a child's colorful version of a map of the world with a big rainbow when she was young. The map makes a couple of appearances during the film and is part of the last scene when Alice narrates using her map of the world and her family of four in an analogy.I rate this film a solid 8 of 10. There are no special effects character development is relatively deliberate and the complete storyline unfolds gradually much like Lone Star does. Weaver's and Strathairn's characters remind me of the two leads in Limbo  good people who are just barely holding things in their lives together. They are bigcity folk who decide to buy a rural dairy farm and work it with their two small girls. A couple of tragedies enter and their lives are forever changed. The film deals with relationships and the human resiliency that allows us to adapt.CAUTION  SPOILERS FOLLOW Things start to unravel when Alice a gradeschool nurse allows a friend's Theresa Julianne Moore little girl to wander off and drown in their farm pool. The girl actually dies a bit later in the hospital only kept alive by machines. This happens about the time Alice is going halfcrazy dealing with the brats at school and especially the kid who seems to always be sick and who once spit out medicine into her face and she slapped him in angry reaction. Days after the girl dies Alice is arrested but for sexual abuse of the little brat at school. Two other children later join with complaints. At first it seems that Alice looks at her imprisonment as a vacation from the daily grind of taking care of her kids and the farm. She asks Howard husband David Strathairn to bring her books she reads a lot stays to herself hardly asks about the kids. It starts to look like she may really be guilty and inside a very sick person. What's really going on she feels that she has earned her punishment because of letting the girl die but is not worried because she is innocent and will get out only in a matter of time. Meanwhile Howard is having a very difficult time on the farm cannot raise the money to bail Alice out all the friends and neighbors assume she is guilty and snub them.  He eventually sells the farm moves to a small apartment gets Alice out of jail they hire a good lawyer they expose the hoax clear Alice Thresa become her ally again and Howard ends up working at the state driver license office. The story ends with Alice Howard and their two girls sitting at a round table and Alice's narration about the 'map of the world. Weaver does a marvelous job and her character is detestable at times. The DVD is clear but simple no 5.1 soundtrack very limited extras but overall one of the better films that deals with life's difficulties and triumphs. A mature film for mature viewers.".

It's not the most incredible film ever made but it's so much better than many films made in 1999. It's beauty is organic in that from a good storynovel comes a very finely honed and skilled script. A story that manages the odd laugh in some very dark situations. A script that gives us the kitchen sink drama of folk attempting the American dream the tense drama that sometimes has you wondering whether you like that person you loved a minute ago and some very normal human days. Then you take the immensely talented Sigourney Weaver David Strathairn and Julianne Moore along with other mentionables such as Richard McMillan and Aunjanue Ellis to deliver the dialogue and we already have something worth watching.I could attempt to interpret it and tell you what it's all about what it all 'means' but in essence it's a story about some people dealing with some extraordinary events in their ordinary lives. What we learn or take away from it is down to the individual watching.The direction and photography is flawless with some subtle colour themes running throughout the movie. Greys and pale blues set with rust and bright orange as the story progresses fields and concrete hope and despair. The story is linear but very rarely the camera cunningly takes us to different times and places. The soundtrack is just fine and while it and the film sometimes verge on being a little saccharine which it manages to avoid in the main what we see here are some very talented people making a good solid film.A lot of the time what you think is about to happen next often does. But be ready for a couple of surprises and even if what happens next is what you suspected would occur just watch some people acting their socks off! I only found this film because the DVD was on sale for half a dollar and bought it purely on the strength of Sigourney Weaver and Julianne Moore who have never let me down. They are a couple of the best actors of their generation  I only have to point you to Snowcake The Hours or Magnolia for solid proof of that. Apart from their obvious acting abilities I particularly applaud their lack of vanity and dedication to getting things right.If you think you're into good film and want to see all of them before you die then you really should watch this one.".

Dude there is a pot boiling over inches from your head don't you smile at her all innocently like nothing's amiss what is wrong with you?Alice is the only responsible person in the house and drags everyone's weight whether it be her children's abuse or her husband's uselessness like a beast of burden. To top it off she has a terrible job as a school nurse that she hates as well.All of this is pointing to a nervous breakdown on her part perhaps a comingaround of her husband and children. This conflict alone would make a solid narrative with a satisfying if frustrating structure. Does this happen? No because...Conflict 2  Child in Alice's care drowns herselfWow. Um that came out of nowhere. I see that the reason the kid dies was because A. nasty bitch daughter demanded that Alice leave them alone to find a different bathing suit and Alice like a doormat does as she's told and B. useless dad was too busy screwing around with the car to see the tiny child wander past him. That is a heap of unnecessary stress on an already stressful story. While this conflict alone would be good as it's own movie  exploring guilt and grief and a broken friendship between two moms  it's pretty spoiled by an already gaspingforbreath stressful setting. Okay maybe this can be salvaged.Conflict 3  Alice is wrongly accused of molesting one of the studentsWhat. The. Fudge. Wait this has nothing to do with the previous two plot lines? Why is this here? ANY of these three conflicts would be enough to cause a nervous breakdown in a normal person and deserve to be explored individually. Lumping them on top of each other like a precarious ice cream cone does none of these serious issues justice.Alice isn't strong  she's the butt of a sick cosmic joke. She's the universe's doormat and she doesn't have the guts to demand better. Three stars for Julianne Moore.".

	schema:reviewBody "Guilt is one of those inner demons that affects everyone differently and often determines someone's future state of being.  Alice Goodwin is consumed with it when her best friend's daughter accidently drowns while in her care.  A MAP OF THE WORLD follows Alice over a period of a year as she is center stage in two tragediesthe little girl's death and her arrest weeks later involving a seemingly unrelated matter.     Alice is married to Howard David Strathairn a man who is living his dreams of owning his own dairy farm.  They are urbanites now living in rural Wisconsin.  There closest friends Theresa and Dan Julianne Moore and Ron Lea respectively are the parents of the deceased girl.  Alice and Howard along with their two young daughters live a simple but harried life that comes crashing down after the death of the little girl.     On paper this sounds like a predictable TV movie but its strength is not in contrived plot twists and overly dramatic courtroom scenes but rather in how one ordinary woman handles herself in the midst of tragedies that have engulfed her.     Sigourney Weaver is wonderful as usual in the role of Alice.  She understands how often one has to heal themselves before they can continue the relationships with the ones around them even their own children.  Her husband David is supportive but is increasingly frustrated as Alice seems to be using her jail time they are unable to come up with the bail for her own interesting form of therapy.  In one scenes she refers to her incarceration as getting away to a deserted island.     Other characters are strong in the film.  Louise Fletcher plays David's passive aggressive mother who doesn't approve of Alice's unconventional ways.  In one scene where Alice is trying to work through her own depression she tells her to quit thinking such dark thoughts.  Arliss Howard as Alice's attorney is also excellent as a lawyer who views  his clients as pawns in a hyperactive game.  Sadly the viewer realizes that is the only way many attorneys keep up their competitive nature to be successful.     The film directed by Scott Elliot is not without its faults.  It's pacing is at times too slow and the people within the community are painted too broadly as uncompromising country folk who are always suspicious of outsiders.  One character mentions she knew Howard was strange when he painted his barn blue.     However the strengths of this movie far outweigh its minor flaws. Julianne Moore is terrific as Alice's best friend.  In many films her character would have been strictly consumed with anger at Alice but here she is much more complex than that which in turn makes her so much more believable.     A MAP OF THE WORLD is a powerful film about the strengths of family and friends and the capacity to trust one's own instincts in a world that quite possibly no longer believes in you.     As a popular pop song from 1999 remarked tragedies are rarely able to be seen in advance.  Instead they blindside you on a Tuesday afternoon. This film completely understands that sentiment.9 out of 10".

After she is imprisoned hints are dropped that there is something deeper and darker about her than we know about.  This turns out to be a red herring and an unsatisfying one at that.  One gets the same feeling about Chloe Sevigny's character  that there's something else about her we need to see but the filmmakers can't figure out how to show it.

	schema:reviewBody "The Spy Who Loved Me 1977 is Roger Moore's finest best action spy film. From James Bond it is my second favorite James Bond 007 film and first favorite Roger Moore film. I love this film to death do I love it equal as Moonraker it is my favorite James Bond film I grew up watching it and it is brilliant. I'm a hardcore James Bond fan. I make no apologies for believing that Roger Moore is the closest thing we've seen to IAN FLEMING's James Bond.James Bond has a relationship with a resourceful and beautiful Russian agent Anya Amasova Agent Triple X is something new for the Bond films. Lewis Gilbert's film provides direct allusion to David Lean's epic movies bringing back a Blofeldtype character... His name is Karl Stromberg a shipping tycoon who despises every aspect of terrestrial civilization. The storyline involves a reclusive megalomaniac named Karl Stromberg who plans to destroy the world and create a new civilization under the sea. Bond teams up with a Russian agent Anya Amasova to stop Stromberg.I love the underwater world and Karl Stromberg's vision about destroying the civilization in which he wanted to fire a missiles on Moscow and New York City. He hijacked two submarines British and Soviet and the plan from Karl Stromberg was brilliant. Stromberg's aquarium of sharks and other deadly fish is his pride and passion... 'For me this is all the world' he declares 'There is beauty. There is ugliness. And there is death.'James Bond investigates the hijacking of British and Russian submarines carrying nuclear warheads with the help of a K.G.B. Agent whose lover he killed.Roger Moore was the best James Bond 007 but so underrated he is my second favorite James Bond. R.I.P. he visit Slovenia many times he is really missed. He stated that this is his favorite James Bond film he made his best one. I agree I also enjoy For Your Eyes Only the same way than this movie but is my second Roger Moore James Bond film. The Spy Who Loved Me is my number 1 favorite Roger Moore James Bond 007 film and my second best James Bond 007 film. GoldenEye is number 1. Barbara Bach as Anya Amasova Russian spy was incredible hot sexy babe her performance was wonderful. I have enjoyed the girl so much she was terrific. Barbara Bach is attractive classy stylish intelligent confident very sexy and absolutely wonderful she had a great ts I loved her. Karl Stromberg Curd Jrgens R.I.P. was a really great Bond villain I really miss him he was brilliant and intelligent. I really loved his hideout Atlantis. Stromberg's three killers are Jaws Sandor and NaomiJaws Richard Kiel R.I.P. he is really missed steals the show as the most menacing and fearsome henchman Bond has ever faced since the mute Korean assassin Oddjob in 'Goldfinger.' Sandor Milton Reid is the bald musclebound assassin who tries to kill Bond at Aziz Fekkesh's apartment in Cairo. Naomi Caroline Munro is Stromberg's luscious assistant and helicopter pilot who shows her 'lovely lines' giving Bond a lewd while trying to shoot him and Anya down from the air. Caroline Munro was extremely great babe as Stromberg's assassin she was terrific girl.Lewis Gilbert directed wonderful this film on the train sequence and even on the Stromberg's ship Liparus. Nobody Does it Better by Carly Simon was a great soundtrack and the music score by Marvin Hamlisch was wonderful. This film has a lot of action hardcore action car chases car that is under water in really beautiful performances by Roger Moore and Barbara Bach she was a sweetheart. Great climatic fight on the ship between British Russian and American sailors fighting against Liparus's crew. James Bond destroys those two submarines. Bond fights on the end Jaws and kills Stromberg by firing at his with his gun PPK  Walther and he saves Anya Amasova. The Spy Who Loved Me is a 1977 British spy film and the tenth in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions and the third to star Roger Moore as the fictional secret agent James Bond. Barbara Bach and Curt Jrgens costar. It was directed by Lewis Gilbert and the screenplay was written by Christopher Wood and Richard Maibaum.1010 It is my second favorite James Bond film and the first of Roger Moore's film. Roger Moore is in my opinion is so underrated James Bond I really enjoy this two film The Spy Who Loved Me and For Your Eyes Only. They don't make em like this anymore they don't. I miss movies like this one. Why can't we get movies like are this one today? I want movies like this one today.".

Roger Moore is in my opinion is so underrated James Bond I really enjoy this two film The Spy Who Loved Me and For Your Eyes Only. They don't make em like this anymore they don't. I miss movies like this one. Why can't we get movies like are this one today? I want movies like this one today.";

Yet it does finally work the word spy into the title of a Bond film. 7 points.PreCredit Teaser It's all very nicely done Within a few minutes we see a submarine stolen and its crew kidnapped we meet the Soviet's top agent who just happens to be  surprise!  a woman and we get the added treat of one of Bond's greatest stunts the great skiingskydiving trick. A pretty cool way to kick off the film and set up the various story lines. 9 points.Opening Credits Arguably the silliest of all of Maurice Binder's efforts the opening sequence finds 007 bouncing around on a trampoline while various miniature and apparently naked babes do gymnastics on the barrels of guns. Pity he didn't come up with that idea for THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN. Bordering on selfparody it is nonetheless naughty and fun and colorful and ohso very James Bond. 9 points.Theme Song No beating around the bush here the song gets right to the point Nobody does it half as good as you Baby you're the best. Just what Bond is best at is open to interpretation. The music by Marvin Hamlisch is swanky and matched by Carol Bayer Sager's dreamy and only slightly sarcastic lyrics. And Carly Simon's vocals bring it all home. Maybe not the best Bond song but right up there. 9 points.Bond James Bond Moore finally makes the role his. The number of smug oneliners have been trimmed yet he still invests the character with humor  plus some warmth and charm and unexpected sadness. And we get to see a bit of Bond's vanity as he matches wits with a female agent who is his equal and not impressed by his stockandtrade flirtations. Moore's best appearance as Bond. 9 points.Bond Babes The prevailing notion has always been that Bond Girl equals Bimbo which is only partly true. Most of the women Bond encounters are highly skilled professionals  as well as being bimbos. But Soviet agent Major Anya Amasova a.k.a. XXX is the first Bond Girl to give James a run for his money. She's smart sexy capable resourceful and it takes her almost the whole movie to actually fall in love with Bond. What will power! As played by Barbara Bach a.k.a. soontobe Mrs. Ringo Starr Anya ranks as one of the best Bond Girls easily worthy of 9 points.Bond Villain Karl Stromberg nice villainous name by the way is one of those mad billionaires who hopes to create a new world order by mass genocide and building a new society this time underwater. It is pretty much a clich character and unfortunately Curt Jurgen plays the part like a grumpy old man and can't seem to muster up even a maniacal laugh. 5 points.Bond Baddies Oddjob lookalike Sandor played by Milton Reid puts in an appearance long enough to die a memorable death but it is Richard Kiel who steps into the limelight as Jaws one of the great Bond villains. If being a hulking sevenfoot tall muscle man weren't enough he also has steel teeth and an amazingly obsessive desire to kill 007. Playing Wile E. Coyote to Bond's Road Runner Jaws earns 9 points.Sinister Plot Stromberg steals a Russian and a U.S. sub as well as a British one with the hopes of starting World War III and destroying the civilization as we know it today. Been there done that. 4 points.Production values Romantic imagery clever lighting effects and intriguing camera angles make this the most visually appealing Bond film. In the past the emphasis was always on the most effective way to film action sequences but here director Gilbert Lewis strives for that little bit extra as far as mood and romance. 9 points.Bonus Points Connery had his Astin Martin and Moore gets a Lotus Esprit. It is not nearly as snazzy but it does turn into a submarine and you never know when that will come in handy. 5 points.Summary It had been hinted at in the three previous Bond adventures but a new sense of style is fully apparent here. The roughness and grit that many of the purists loved about Connery's films are pretty much gone in favor of a polish and panache. Whether that is being suave or merely superficial is open to interpretation but it does set the tone and the expectations for all future Bond adventures.Bondometer Rating 84 points out of 100.".

	schema:reviewBody "After the critical and commercial beating taken by THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN producer Albert Broccoli now solely in charge of the 007 franchise had to reevaluate the series for the third time in less than ten years. Certainly Roger Moore would never be believable in a Sean Connerytype Bond film but couldn't some of the series' best elements be restored and the comedy reduced a bit to make Moore's Bond a bit more believable?The research which became the basis of THE SPY WHO LOVED ME took over two years to complete and the script went through many writers before the final draft by Christopher Wood and Richard Maibaum. With a renewed emphasis on more realistic action Broccoli brought back Lewis Gilbert to direct his earlier Bond effort YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE while not a major 'hit' had featured the most spectacular action sequences of the series. With Gilbert on board the production became very reminiscent of the Connery film Even the concept of a supertanker 'swallowing' submarines echoed YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and the spacecraft'eating' SPECTRE capsule. As the villain esteemed German actor Curt Jurgens was cast as Karl Stromberg an ideal choice as the actor with his bulging eyes 'fit' the role of a fishlike megalomaniac. Playing his henchman Jaws in an inspired piece of casting giant Richard Kiel complete with 'beartrap' steel teeth would provide Moore with the greatest danger he'd ever face as Bond. Kiel was in fact so good in the role possibly the most popular villain of the entire 007 franchise that he would return in MOONRAKER to bedevil Bond some more. Less successful dramatically but still astonishing to watch would be Stromberg's 'hit woman' Naomi played by voluptuous Caroline Munro.In an effort to 'update' Bond into an era of feminists the strongest most independent love interest to appear in at Bond film to that point was introduced. Major Anya Amasova played by Ringo Starr's wife the exotically beautiful Barbara Bach was Bond's opposite number on the Russian side an equal to 007 in every way. In a pivotal scene she would display a knowledge of Bond's past that even included his dead wife Tracy the first time Bond's marriage had been mentioned since ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. Moore's reaction to her comment would be both emotional and abrupt and demonstrated that he could do far more than just deliver witty oneliners.From the spectacular ski chase pretitle sequence climaxing with a parachute free fall off a cliff love that 'Union Jack' to Bond and Anya's confrontations with Jaws in Egypt reminiscent of Bond's fights with Oddjob in GOLDFINGER and Tee Hee in LIVE AND LET DIE to the amazing Lotus that would do service on land and in the ocean to the massive tanker battle while Bond disarms a nuclear warhead shades of GOLDFINGER THE SPY WHO LOVED ME would do homage to 007's previous adventures and utilize humor in support of the onscreen action instead of spoofing it other than the brief use of the LAWRENCE OF ARABIA theme...you'll spot it.And to top things off Carly Simon's rendition of the film's title tune Nobody Does It Better would become a Top Ten hit worldwide.Critics and audiences loved THE SPY WHO LOVED ME hailing it as Moore's best work and one of the better Bonds of all time. Things were again looking up for 007...but STAR WARS was about to debut and things would go dreadfully amiss when Broccoli decided to send Bond into space in MOONRAKER...".

Moore is good as Bond Bach stunningly attractive as his partner though not very convincing as an actress and Jurgens provides a suitably overconfident villain. The location work in various locations most notably Egypt is nicely photographed. Marvin Hamlisch provides the music marking a change from the usual composer John Barry and Hamlisch's score is decent enough though it does have a dated '70s quality to it when listened to nowadays. The plot is totally implausible and selfparodic if they'd stuck to the plot in the book though it would've been almost impossible to make a Bond movie in the expected sense of the phrase but director Lewis Gilbert cleverly plays it with tongueincheek so that the absurdness of the onscreen events becomes curiously endearing.

The Spy Who Loved Me is Moore's best Bond film not necessarily his best Bond performance but as a movie it's near faultless it gets all the main ingredients right.

He makes a telling mark we know he's a mad dastard but he only really sits around giving orders and pushing death dealing buttons.

The Spy Who Loved Me scarcely puts a foot wrong. Sure the plot is far fetched to the extreme an underwater building and a villain looking to repopulate the earth in his underwater city but it has plenty of charm and is frequently enjoyable. Moore looks very confident in his performance as Bond the one liners oozing effort and confidence showing he has hit  his stride in this his third appearance as the character. His chemistry with Barbara Bach is in full swing despite her odd Russian accent and the two of them make for a great on screen couple.This is a return to the values of many of the Bond films that were missing the last  time around. The extravagant sets are back the villain has plenty of henchman for Bond and the cavalry to fight and the gadgets are in full swing. Everything from a parachute with the Union Jack on it to the Lotus with just about every conceivable gadget at Bond's disposal. The emphasis on sight gags and overt comedy is gone and replaced with moments of genuine suspense just check out Bond having to steal the detonator of a nuclear weapon not to mention the superb theme tune Nobody Does it Better by Carly Simon.It's an apt song for a series that found its footing and gave its lead actor his first classic Bond film.".

There's an underwater battle like the one in 'Thunderball' a ski chase not too dissimilar to the one in 'Her Majesty's...' and even the final big shoot out is not unlike the one in 'You Only Live Twice' which was also directed by Lewis Gilbert but 'The Spy Who Loved me' is more than merely a sum of its parts and when each part is handled as expertly as these you don't seem to care if it has indeed been done before.The film like Moore exudes a certain charm and provides a certain amount of nostalgia looking back at it now with it's lively 70's fashions even Bond's theme gets the disco treatment quite superbly. Ken Adam's stunning larger than life sets fit the film's extravagant big budget flavour perfectly. Appreciative nods must also go to some fantastically attractive women Caroline Munro playing the enticing Naomi has to be one of the most seductive looking femme fatales to steam up a widescreen and more's the pity that she didn't grace it longer. Barbara Bach is equally alluring and a fine match for Roger Moore in all sense of the word . The film also offers a wealth of laughs while not forgetting the chills and spills Richard Keil providing all as the relentless and unforgettable Jaws. The scene where he tears open a Sherpa Van like a sardine can is particularly memorable as is him brushing himself off after plummeting into a farmhouse from a flying Mercedes. Some fine touches of drama too Bond's response to XXX's remarks about his career and wife are handled with compassion and reverence.   So in all everything is here you could possibly want in a 007 adventure top stunts beautiful women cool villains those gloriously huge Pinewood sets and THAT car wrapped in an exciting globetrotting story line where Bond has to save the world from certain destruction accompanied by Carly Simon sveltely singing 'Nobody does it better' it's not surprising that the 'Spy Who Loved Me' is one of the most memorable of all Bond films.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Spy Who Loved Me put the 007 epic back on truly epic grounds after the bitter disappointment of Diamonds Are Forever and the mixed measure of Live and Let Die and The Man With The Golden Gun.  Spy adds vast new spectacle to the Bond epic along with strong interplay with some interesting new characters and a major improvement in the series' production values. The idea of Bond meeting his match is the starting point for The Man With The Golden Gun but here the match is in a rival and ally from the Soviet secret service Anya Amasova Barbara Bach who admittedly is over her head here but holds her own overall.  We see in Anya the direct counterpart to HMSS complete with omnipresent leader in General Gogol Walter Gotell who becomes one of the series' best supporting characters and a pretty secretary.  The Bond series also revisits the SPECTRE days in a sense in that the antagonist is a selfcontained independent force shipping magnate Karl Stromberg Curt Jurgens.  Stromberg owns a vast experimental undersea headquarters Atlantis and the world's largest container ship the Liparus. Stromberg becomes linked to the disappearence of several nuclear missile submarines through a schematic of a submarine tracking system stored on microfilm.  Just what Stromberg's role entails becomes the mission for both James and Anya and both find allies in the US Navy attack boat USS Wayne under the command of Captain Scott Carter  here is a rarity in film a supporting character who steals the show here thanks to the splendid performance of Thunderbirds' own Shane Rimmer.Another supporting cast member steals the show as well and would do so in the next Bond film.  Richard Kiel joins Harold Sakata as the most memorable of James Bond's offbeat villainous henchmen  where Sakata's Oddjob killed with a rapiersharp bowler hat Richard Kiel's Jaws uses steel alloy teeth as well as his own gigantic height Kiel even brings back memories of Robert Shaw's Donald Red Grant in one of the most memorable stages for a Bond fistfight  the Orient Express.The film is scored by Marvin Hamlisch rather than John Barry and Hamlisch adds a surprisingly effective disco touch to the Bond series one that modernizes the series without disrupting the power of the triedandtrue music cues of before.  But the biggest quality in the film is the vastly improved production values.  Shane Rimmer was not the only Thunderbirds alumni to work in the Bond universe  SFX master Derek Meddings had worked with John Stears on Man With The Golden Gun but here he takes over the SFX unit and greatly improves the scope and quality of the effects work aided greatly by enormous and effective sets at Pinewood Studios that combine the best of Dr. No You Only Live Twice and especially Thunderball.The relationship between James and Anya is the primary drive in the tension of the film.  At first both try to oneup each other such as in decoding the microfilm identifying an obscure logo on the microfilm and in the famous Lotus chase sequence when she reveals she stole blueprints for the design years earlier.  But the real strain lies in the film's prologue when Anya's lover himself employed by Mother Russia's security service crosses paths with James  a confrontation James may not live down now.  His own feelings for Anya however put what is past fully in the past and it leads to a showdown with Stromberg amid a threat of annihilation.It all adds up to an enormously entertaining spectacle a highlight of the Bond epic.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a nice surprise this was a change for me since reviewing some of these old Bond movies. With the exception of Goldfinger I've been disappointed in the rest....but not this one. This film seemed far better than I had remembered one of the best James Bond movies I've seen. My first look in over 30 years at this stunned me. I couldn't believe how entertaining and fun it was to watch!It's enjoyable right from the start and features my alltime favorite Bond song  Nobody Does It Better By Carly Simon. It's sung or palyd throughout the movie.This was Roger Moore's third attempt at playing James Bond and he really hit his stride with this being a natural as the suave spy. The action is plentiful but never seems too much or gets boring with an excess. It never quite crosses that line although it comes close a few times.Curt Jurgens is very lowkey as the villain Karl Stromberg. His role really isn't all that big. You don't see much of him until the end. Who you DO see is the sevenfoot twoinch giant Jaws Richard Kiel the main with the iron teeth. He is fun to watch and is almost indestructible like the evil cyborg in Terminator 2. Jaws just keeps coming back no matter what you do to him.Overall this Bond film is attractive because it has just the right mixture of action suspense and humor and another pretty leading lady in Barbara Bach. I'm not sold on her Russian accent as Major Anya Amasova but she is nice the eyes. The accent made her appear sub par as an actress. Otherwise no complaints.The cinematography in here too is aboveaverage. There are very nicelyfilmed scenes with interesting camerawork. Good work allaround!".

	schema:headline " Before the movie XXX there was the agent XXX.";
	schema:reviewBody "This particular James Bond movie is one of my favorites perhaps the favorite. Though it is in a particularly close battle with another of Roger Moore's films For Your Eyes Only for the top spot. Bizarre that these two are the two Bond films vying for top spot as they are both a bit different as far as the plot goes. Here the entire world is in danger whereas in that one they are only going after a decoding device which sank in a ship. While The Man with the Golden Gun features my favorite Bond villain in Scaramanga this one features my favorite henchmen in Jaws played by Richard Kiel. His Jaws is also one of the few bad guys to return in another film. Granted Blofeld did as well but I do not believe he was ever played by the same person twice. So this Bond film features a lot of action a very attractive Bond girl and a very awesome henchman whose sheer size is intimidating enough but then they add metal teeth to the equation! It all adds up to be one of the more fun Bond films ever and a film where the action almost never stops! The story has both a British and Soviet submarine going missing. Bond is the man sent to find out what happened to the British one while a female Soviet agent codenamed XXX is the one who must find the Soviet. They begin their search in Egypt where they learn of a submarine tracking device but there is more to this than mere missing subs. Seems a very rich man who has a very strong affinity to the sea is somehow responsible and it will take a joining of the two agents who work for opposing companies to find out what this man's ultimate goal is before it is too late! The villain here is pretty good but Stromberg is just not as equal a foe to Bond as was Scaramanga. He is the villain who must rely heavily on others to get what he wants which is why he has two henchmen though Jaws definitely was more up to the challenge than was Sandor. Roger Moore once again does great as Bond and Barbara Bach as XXX is absolutely stunning. She looked absolutely gorgeous at the end as her outfit got wet! This movie also features my favorite Bond vehicle the Lotus. It is a very cool car and they actually have a rather cool chase before it plummets into the ocean where we learn of its other special functions. Just a lot of good things here as the story is much improved compared to the previous film which had great characters galore but not the strongest story to bring it all together.So this is a favorite Bond film of mine. It often baffles me how people complain today of all the action in movies with very little plot development as I see too many films these days that do not do all that much action and have way too much plot. This film was action sequence after action sequence while take your typical comic film of today. Lots of people crying and doing nothing with maybe three action sequences at best. Yet these films apparently cost 200 million plus while this film has action and set pieces galore using more people and props because on cannot simply craft a special effect with a computer. This Bond film had it all and makes most of the films today seem very slow paced by comparison then again as the song in this film says nobody does it better!".

Here the entire world is in danger whereas in that one they are only going after a decoding device which sank in a ship. While The Man with the Golden Gun features my favorite Bond villain in Scaramanga this one features my favorite henchmen in Jaws played by Richard Kiel. His Jaws is also one of the few bad guys to return in another film. Granted Blofeld did as well but I do not believe he was ever played by the same person twice. So this Bond film features a lot of action a very attractive Bond girl and a very awesome henchman whose sheer size is intimidating enough but then they add metal teeth to the equation! It all adds up to be one of the more fun Bond films ever and a film where the action almost never stops! The story has both a British and Soviet submarine going missing. Bond is the man sent to find out what happened to the British one while a female Soviet agent codenamed XXX is the one who must find the Soviet. They begin their search in Egypt where they learn of a submarine tracking device but there is more to this than mere missing subs. Seems a very rich man who has a very strong affinity to the sea is somehow responsible and it will take a joining of the two agents who work for opposing companies to find out what this man's ultimate goal is before it is too late! The villain here is pretty good but Stromberg is just not as equal a foe to Bond as was Scaramanga. He is the villain who must rely heavily on others to get what he wants which is why he has two henchmen though Jaws definitely was more up to the challenge than was Sandor. Roger Moore once again does great as Bond and Barbara Bach as XXX is absolutely stunning. She looked absolutely gorgeous at the end as her outfit got wet! This movie also features my favorite Bond vehicle the Lotus. It is a very cool car and they actually have a rather cool chase before it plummets into the ocean where we learn of its other special functions. Just a lot of good things here as the story is much improved compared to the previous film which had great characters galore but not the strongest story to bring it all together.So this is a favorite Bond film of mine. It often baffles me how people complain today of all the action in movies with very little plot development as I see too many films these days that do not do all that much action and have way too much plot. This film was action sequence after action sequence while take your typical comic film of today. Lots of people crying and doing nothing with maybe three action sequences at best. Yet these films apparently cost 200 million plus while this film has action and set pieces galore using more people and props because on cannot simply craft a special effect with a computer. This Bond film had it all and makes most of the films today seem very slow paced by comparison then again as the song in this film says nobody does it better!";

So I was a little apprehensive about rewatching a film that is a cherished memory.I am happy to report that this movie holds up. From the tremendous ski off the mountain opening shot through Maurice Bender's always terrific opening credits to Richard Jaws Kiel and villain Curt Jurgens underwater hideout I was entertained throughout. True this movie has to overcome some truly tremendous 1970's synthpop soundtrack but add in Barbara Bach's wonderful turn as Agent XXX andyou have the quintessential Roger Moore Bond movie.So why is that? I think it is because Moore finally came into his own as Bond. In his third movie Moore and director Lewis Gilbert dropped any attempt at Moore copying Sean Connery's roguish toughness and started cultivating Moore's natural tendency towards comedy. This comedic bent will ultimately overcome Moore's portrayal of Bond in future installments but in TSWLM they strike exactly the right tone.Go back and checkout THE SPY WHO LOVED ME you'll be pleasantly surprised on how good this movie is.7 out of 10 stars and you can take that to the Bank of Marquis".

	schema:reviewBody "This was a spectacular addition to the series and in my opinion the best James Bond film since Goldfinger. It completely washes the bad taste of The Man With The Golden Gun out of your mouth.Roger Moore has perfected his take as James Bond by this outing. He is suave sophisticated and delivers the oneliners with aplomb. He is proving to be a worthy successor to Connery. He also doesn't try to be Connery which is a very good thing.Anya AmasovaXXX played by Barbara Bach is one of the very best Bond girls. Her Russian accent is incredibly fake but she's so beautiful and has such an engaging personality that I didn't mind it. She had great chemistry with Moore.The plot while essentially a reworking of You Only Live Twice is very fun and engaging and Lewis Gilbert the director of Twice continues his style of crafting big epic set pieces that leave you in amazement.Carl Stromberg is a pretty awesome villain but he is completely overshadowed by his henchmen. Jaws is a classic villain. He is super intimidating and is pretty much invincible. Bond is never quite able to put him away. He even kills a shark. Oh my!The action is almost nonstop and keeps you on the edge of your seat. For instance we get to see a thrilling chase with Bond using the Lotus Esperit the best Bond vehicle ever next to the Aston Martin and there are many tense fight scenes with Jaws and a heck of a climax at Stromberg's lair. Let's also not forget the opening sequence with Bond skiing off a cliff. Crazy.A fantastic addition to the series very much deserving of its classic status. Arguably Moore's best Bond film just a hair ahead of For Your Eyes Only and one of the very best of the series as well. As Carly Simon says in the wonderful theme song Nobody does it better than James Bond.RATING A".

Well for starters it contains literally everything that was cool about the cinema James Bond in its running time. Charismatic and cool hero? You bet as Roger Moore turns in his best and one of his most complex interpretations of James Bond. Evil antagonist with an insane over the top plot? This movie has it in Curt Jurgens genuinely creepyeven if he was sparsely usedvillain who plans to blow up the world and create a civilization under the sea it does not get much more over the top than that. Evil henchman? Oh boy this movie delivers there with probably the best one of the whole series with Jaws who is scary and fearsome in his role unlike in Moonraker. How about the gadgets and car? They are also among the best with the submersible Lotus Esprit which is pretty much tied with the DB5 as the best Bond car ever. Is there exotic locations? Yes Egypt and Sardinia fit the bill nicely. Lastly and most importantly there are several dropdead gorgeous women like Barbara Bach Valerie Leon and my personal favorite actress Caroline Munro. The Spy Who Loved Me is like a greatest hits collection of Bond but what pushes the familiar elements over the top is the level of execution polish and creativity shown here. There have been skichases in the series before but oh my none of them before or even after have lived up to the jawdropping chase and stunt that was in the opening teaser it perfectly set the tone for the movie as an action packed thrill ride which it definitely is. There have also been massive conflicts that pit the evil mastermind's forces against the good guys before in the series but few have ever lived up to the titanic clash in the submarine hold near the end of the film. That is what makes the movie great everything is bigger better and bolder than virtually everything else in the series. Even the story is somewhat familiar as it hearkens back to You Only Live Twice but once again it is improved on. The entertainment value in this movie is through the roof with some of the best stunts and fights in the series and the story itself is good enough to keep the viewer interested until the conclusion. To top it all off this movie has one of the best opening songs in the entire series with Nobody Does It Better a departure from other songs before this movie in style and name but it is a beautiful piece that arguably sums up why James Bond is such an aweinspiring cinema legend for over 50 years This film is just amazing and any true fan of the movies will love this piece of classic cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Spy Who Loved Me was the first Bond film to be produced solely by Albert R. Broccoli after Satzman's decision to sell his share of EON productions to United Artists. Although I think Broccoli was not aware of what Bond really stood for paying far more attention to action and stunts than story lines and scripting Moonraker attests to that he nevertheless managed to produce some outstanding Bond movies. The one under discussion here also features an exceptional performance by Roger Moore who proved he could really rise to he challenge of playing the world most famous secret agent in his own way.Despite having a thin plot which Bond film doesn't? Spy is still a grandiose adventure with a romantic edge to it that works wonderfully. The initial section of the film set in Egypt though slowpaced allows for a delightful romance between 007 and Russian female counterpart XXX. There is real chemistry between Roger and Bachrendering the film believable they are just the world coolest secret agents and they naturally fall in love.However the movie has still its share of thrills and mindboggling stunts. The Lotus Sprit is perhaps the coolest car to ever grace a Bond movie and the final confrontation on board the Lyparus a gritty and crisply directed sequence remains one of the series highlights. Jaws makes his first appearance  and all of his showdowns with Bond have a real sense of danger to them.As for Lewis Gilbert after having crafted the sheer spectacle of You Only Live Twice he is equally comfortable here dealing with the romantic side of the story as well as the humorous lighthearted touches spread throughout the film. An special mention should go to the priceless scene of the Lotus Sprit emerging from the water before the amazed tourists' eyes.While many socalled Bond fans despise this comic relief I think it is necessary to balance the moments of seriousness and violence. Marvin Hamlisch's Oscar nominated score effectively helps Gilbert to create the special mood that permeates this film.But perhaps the most compelling aspect of this movie was Moore's performance possibly the definitive portrayal of Bond. He is witty and seductive but he is ready to kill unhesitatingly if necessary. Check out the Egyptian rooftop fist fight sequence and you will know what I mean. The gesture of coldness and anger of Moore is unforgettable. He obviously wants to kill the guy but still waits a few seconds to get the information before dropping him.Where did all this go? Moonraker for all its entertaining moments seems a selfparodynot to mention the slapstick in Octopussy. Fortunately this approach to the character was recovered in For Your Eyes Only not as brilliant as this movie but still worth a look.All in all this is Moore's best and definitely ranks up there alongside Goldfinger and You Only Live Twice".

The gesture of coldness and anger of Moore is unforgettable. He obviously wants to kill the guy but still waits a few seconds to get the information before dropping him.Where did all this go? Moonraker for all its entertaining moments seems a selfparodynot to mention the slapstick in Octopussy. Fortunately this approach to the character was recovered in For Your Eyes Only not as brilliant as this movie but still worth a look.All in all this is Moore's best and definitely ranks up there alongside Goldfinger and You Only Live Twice";

	schema:headline " One of Roger Moore's Strongest 007 Films";
	schema:reviewBody "While GOLDENEYE was my first exposure to the world of James Bond the video game and then the movie it was the Roger Moore films where I first really dove in to the series. Moore was the most productive actor to serve in the role of the legendary secret agent with seven films and while they certainly suffer their fair share of issues there was some real good stuff from his run. THE SPY WHO LOVED ME was probably his best film as the character. It's got a perfect blend of action and humor the Bond girl is gorgeous and well developed and it introduced one of the most iconic henchmen to the series. In the movie a nuclear submarine has gone mysteriously missing from both the British and Russian navies. James Bond Moore is brought in when MI6 believes someone has developed a system for tracking submerged nuclear submarines and is using it for nefarious purposes. Bond's mission will force him into a partnership with Major Anya AmasovaAgent XXX of the KGB Barbara Bach which leads to tension when a late revelation puts the two agents at odds. Their mission will take them from the Great Pyramids in Egypt to the beautiful ocean shores of Sardinia as they investigate Karl Stromberg Curd Jrgens a shipping magnate with an obsession for ocean life and his magnificent laboratory dubbed Atlantis. And it should be noted that the movie is directed by Lewis Gilbert who was responsible for my favorite Sean Connery 007 film as well YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE.Roger Moore has always been considered the campiest James Bond as his movies spent more time mugging to the camera and quipping oneliners than giving us a serious secret agent on a worldthreatening assignment. With Moore you don't want to go too far on either end of the humor spectrum and THE SPY WHO LOVED ME fell perfectly in the center. This is Moore at his 007 best before he got to be too old to really take seriously in the role. He's suave and serious but he's got his moments of levity we've come to love from him e.g. the moment when he and Amasova are attempting to escape Jaws in a utility van. His counterpart in the film is Major Amasova played relatively well by Barbara Bach. Bach has got the beauty for the role and then someshe's absolutely stunning but her acting feels a little stunted. I'm not sure if she was dubbed in post production which happened a lot in the early films or if she was just having a lot of issues with her Russian accent but her line delivery doesn't sound all that genuine. The character on the other hand seems better developed than some of the previous Bond women who existed solely to swoon over the hero and find themselves in danger. Amasova in essentially Bond's equal within the KGB. She's resourceful and dangerous in her own right occasionally outsmarting Bond himself. And she's got her own motivation in the opening sequence Bond kills a Russian agent in a mountain ski chase with close ties to Amasova and she's not happy about it.But enough about the heroes. Jaws Richard Kiel is the coolest part of THE SPY WHO LOVED ME. Who doesn't love Jaws? He's one of the most iconic 007 henchmen right up there with Oddjob from GOLDFINGER. He's the only henchmen who was beloved enough with audiences for the filmmakers to bring him back for another round in the following movie MOONRAKER. He's a coldblooded silent killer with steel teeth who's method as impractical as it must be is biting a person's neck Pinching off their jugular? I'm not surethere's rarely blood involved.. As threatening a presence as the 7.5' Jaws is he's got some funny bits too. Let's face it everyone remembers Jaws in this movie. Fewer people remember the actual villain Karl Stromberg. And it's not because he's lame. He's just overshadowed by his hired goon. Jrgens is actually real good as Stromberg. He's certainly got some Blofeld elements to his characterstoic calculating and egomaniacal. His plans are sort of a blend between Blofeld's in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and Hugo Drax's in MOONRAKER. Eliminate the world's major cities and crumble society so that he can rule what remains from his beloved ocean. From the characters to the locations to the gadgets I love the submersible Lotus! THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is Roger Moore at the top of his game and a classic 007 film. I highly recommend it to any fans new to the series who want a good taste of what Moore can do as James Bond.".

	schema:headline " Roger MooreBond";
	schema:reviewBody "The Spy Who Loved Me 1977 is the tenth film of the James Bond film series as well as being Roger Moore's third outing as the famous gentleman agent. This is the first film to be solely produced by Albert R. Broccoli Due to Harry Saltzman's outside investments creating huge debts that prompted him to sell his rights to United Artists thus breaking his partnership with Broccoli and the first film that is not adapted from a Fleming novel besides the title of Fleming's tenth novel of the same name. The plot focuses on two nuclear submarines British and Russian being stolen by a megalomaniac Karl Stromberg Curt Jurgens to exterminate the world and create an underwater society. Both governments send their top agents Bond from the British and Agent Anya Amasova Barbara Bach from the Soviet. The onscreen chemistry between these two characters is really fun to watch with Moore's sterling humor and Bach's stubbornness as a female agent. The two eventually fall in love during their mission but is cut short when Anya discovers that Bond killed her KGB boyfriend seen in the pre titles sequence. Another great element in this film is the henchman JawsRichard Kiel who kills people with his metalrimmed teeth. His indestructible presence was scary in the first few moments but then gets really amusing towards the end of the film. Bond's Lotus Esprit was a cool car that could transform into a submersible vehicle unbelievable but not too corny either. The music was great with a fantastic title song sung by Carly Simon and a discooriented Bond theme conducted by the great Marvin Hamlisch.This film was a tremendous financial and critical success during it's theatrical release and is considered to be one of the best Bond films of all time. This film had also firmly established Roger Moore as Bond. I give this film loads of credit to Moore who was 50 at the time of this film's release for his usual nonchalant performance as Bond who can also get away with a couple of awesome fight scenes. Barbara Bach was probably one of the most attractive Bond girls of all time and Curt Jurgen's cool performance as Stromberg was pure Bond villainy. Some fans and critics compare this one to Goldfinger 1964 but this film is way more sophisticated and Bondlike. The sets particularly the tanker set by Ken Adam were one of the best in a single Bond film. The Spy Who Loved Me is a great film which never bores you no matter how many times you watch it.".

Whether it's an unforgettable filming location a legendary flamboyant villainous character or absurdly inventive gimmicks ALL Bond movies are worth checking out in order to discover the particularities. In The Spy Who Loved Me it's the presence of a trio of exceptionally beautiful ladies and  to make it even more special  all three of them are iconic culthorror wenches! The primary Bond girl Barbara Bach is an unearthly ravishing Italian actress who appeared in several genre highlights like Don't Torture a Duckling Island of the Fishmen and Big Alligator River. But there's also the feisty Caroline Munro Maniac Captain Kronos Vampire Hunter as one of the evil opponent's most remarkable accomplices and there's a sadly way too small supportive role for the exquisite Valerie Leon Hammer's Blood from the Mummy's Tomb as a luscious hotel receptionist. On average 007 sleeps with 34 women per film but in this one he even has severe difficulties to lure just one into bed and that probably is because they're all way out of his league! Anyways I think I'm in a minority but The Spy Who Loved Me is one my most favorite James Bond titles in the entire series! The film features a fantastically overthetop evil mastermind with a fantastically overthetop evil plan to destroy the world and receives help from a couple of fantastically overthe top evil accomplices the aforementioned Caroline Munro but obviously also the legendary metaltoothed and indestructible Jaws. When both an English submarine and a Soviet submarine simultaneously vanish from the radars under inexplicable circumstances the two nations naturally blame each other and each assigns their finest secret agent to investigate the case. 007 and his yummy female Russian counterpart TripleX quickly discover  in Cairo  that both underwater vessels and their entire crews were hijacked by the multimillionaire marine biologist Karl Stromberg He turns out to be a dangerously deranged version of Jules Verne's Captain Nemo from 20000 Leagues under the Sea who built a bizarre beautiful hi tech headquarters in the middle of the ocean from which he catapults his enemies straight into an aquarium where hungry tiger sharks finish them off! But contrary to Captain Nemo who merely just turned his back to the world Stromberg intends to destroy the world with nuclear missiles and create a brand new Atlantis type of community under the sea! Delicious Bond material in other words brought to an even higher entertainment level thanks to a wide collection of great gimmicks the transforming Lotus car is awesome and numerous impressively staged action sequences. The battle beneath the sea between the freed submarine crew and Stromberg's troops is very spectacular as well! I always wonder how these evil geniuses manage to recruit so many docile and disposable employees who are practically volunteering to get slaughtered. The casting of Barbara Bach in a substantial role also results in an interesting sub plot as she has a secret and very private mission to search for the bastard who killer her KGBlover And can you guess who that is? I'll give a hint he fled from the scene hanging from a giant Union Jack parachute! This is Bond at his very best and did I mention it has sharks!?!".

I may actually have to check out others if this film is any indication. Compared to modern Bond this version is more cheesier and invested in gadgets but I liked this Bond. The plot was preposterous but then again I think it was meant to be. This film is meant to have fun and you know what? It certainly succeeded. This Bond adaptation has 007 teaming up with an Russian operative named Anya to investigate the disappearance of a nuclear sub. They track the disappearance all the way to a billionaire magnate who has intentions to end the world with these stolen nuclear missiles. I think Roger Moore made a rather good Bond. Sure he seems a little older but I liked his sense of humor and his savvy attitude towards women. Barbara Bach made a beautiful Bond girl and I think she held her own opposed to Moore. Finally Richard Kiel as the professional killer Jaws was very good. Despite his obvious clumsiness he made for quite an intimidating character. Overall The Spy Who Loved Me has me curious in checking out the other oldschool Bond films. This was an actionpacked film with high use of explosions and gadgetry. I also noted this was one of the few films released during the Cold War that actually has Russians and Western nations as allies. A solid if not spectacular entry in the James Bond franchise. I rate this film 810.".

Sure he seems a little older but I liked his sense of humor and his savvy attitude towards women. Barbara Bach made a beautiful Bond girl and I think she held her own opposed to Moore. Finally Richard Kiel as the professional killer Jaws was very good. Despite his obvious clumsiness he made for quite an intimidating character. Overall The Spy Who Loved Me has me curious in checking out the other oldschool Bond films. This was an actionpacked film with high use of explosions and gadgetry. I also noted this was one of the few films released during the Cold War that actually has Russians and Western nations as allies. A solid if not spectacular entry in the James Bond franchise. I rate this film 810.";

	schema:reviewBody "After the disappointment that was The Man with the Golden Gun Eon Productions bounces back with one of the series' best films. The Spy Who Loved Me improves on its predecessor in almost way bigger battles more elaborate sets and effects shots prettier scenery and a more beautiful and much more assertive female lead. If only Christopher Lee had been in this movie instead of Golden Gun we'd have a film to rival Goldfinger.The storyline is suitably over the top. After an alpine ski chase which ends in one of the most spectacular stunts ever performed on film Bond Roger Moore is called back to London on urgent business. One of the Royal Navy's nuclear submarines has been hijacked! A microfilm in Cairo may hold the key to solving the mystery so it's off to Egypt. But Bond soon discovers that those connected to the microfilm have an alarmingly low life expectancy and that he's not the only one seeking it. His rival is KGB major Anya Amasova the stunning Barbara Bach. Before long the two have joined into an uneasy partnership which is made tenser for the viewer by the knowledge that he's killed someone close to her with neither one yet realizing it. The clues eventually lead to shipping baron Karl Stromberg Curd Jurgens who is planning nothing less than global domination.Besides being absolutely gorgeous Anya is one of the toughest women Bond has ever come across. More than just a sidekick to drag along she can hold her own in a fight and even gets the better of Bond on occasion. Of course it wouldn't be a Bond movie if he didn't have to save her at least once but we never get the feeling that this is going to become a pattern. The subplot about Bond having killed Anya's boyfriend adds an extra dimension to their relationship and we tensely wait for them to put two and two together. The confrontation is well handled when it comes and opens the possibility that she may kill Bond if the bad guys don't.Speaking of bad guys TSWLM introduces one of the series' best villains yet Jaws. Played by the massive Richard Kiel Jaws is by far Bond's most physically powerful opponent and practically indestructible to boot. No matter what happens to him he just keeps coming back like the lead in a mad slasher and indeed during his early scenes he provides a real feeling of horror. Jurgens also does well with his role coming across as intelligent ruthless and deeply insane. He's no Blofeld but he comes fairly close.This movie is also very well made from a technical standpoint. The battle sequences towards the end are quite impressive as are the effects shots including the nowlegendary scene in which the car turns into a submarine. The visuals are excellent as well with wonderful location shots especially in Egypt and topnotch set pieces.One of the biggest problems with Golden Gun was the use of comic relief. The attempts to get laughs were laid on to heavy and instead of providing a few chuckles they slowed down what should have been exciting scenes. Fortunately the filmmakers have learned their lesson this time around and deliver laughs without overdoing it. Most of the film's humor comes from Bond's quips and oneliners although the funniest moment relies on a bit of automotive trouble that puts our hero completely out of his usual element. And I challenge you to keep a straight face when the closing theme rolls.There are of course ancient clichs and plenty of improbabilities but we knew that coming in. The Spy Who Loved Me may not be high cinema or the kind of masterpiece that filmmakers will seek to emulate for generations to come but if it's entertainment you're looking for count on it to deliver.".

I don't think I would ever buy it maybe not even bother to watch it again but i am glad i watched it. It was amusing and kept me entertained something a movie should do. Sure the plot had been done before and it wasn't super original. But as far as i was concerned it was a solid movie. No slow points no terrible writing no stupid special effects. It just wrapped itself up into a convenient little ball and... i got nothing.Point is if you are ever looking for a good movie that isn't heavy on the morals and you don't have to concentrate to hard to watch this is the movie.

I had no real expectations of the film and I had no idea what it was about other than who was in it and the cover looked like a good heist kind of movie. Wow. It was so much better than I ever would have imagined. Not only was it actually funny and not just trying to be funny and then totally failed during the trial but actually truly funny.The lines were wellwritten the acting was all right on and I thought everyone was perfect for the characters they'd been given except for one person and that was Woody Harrelson. He was good but I just don't consider him all that funny and so it was kind of a bad choice in my opinion anyway to cast him in this role.Alicia Silverstone was really good surprisingly enough and didn't carry any of her 'Clueless' days along with her for this role. John Cleese was just right for the role that he was given David Krumholtz was annoyingly good because that's what his character required and drum roll please...the best person in the whole movie was Paulo Castanzo. He was hilarious as he always is and very smart. He delivers his lines perfectly and without failure always makes each and every one of his scenes priceless and memorable.The basic plot of this film is that there are three employees of a bank in a small noname town who all want to rob the bank for different reasons. The movie starts off at the end and works it's way backwards so that you see what happens in order for the rest of the film to make sense. It was cleverly written and very much over looked. Although we won't be seeing any Oscar nominations for this film it still was noteworthy and definitely worth the rental fee. There is no sex no violence and no language as far as I remember so the whole film would be appropriate for younger audience viewers.I enjoyed it immensely and recommend it without question. It's rare that a movie like this comes along that's quick and smart. Check it out you won't be disappointed.".

There is no sex no violence and no language as far as I remember so the whole film would be appropriate for younger audience viewers.I enjoyed it immensely and recommend it without question. It's rare that a movie like this comes along that's quick and smart. Check it out you won't be disappointed.";

Undoubtedly the funniest bits are the extremely varied ways in which Woody Harrelson's character messes up  occasionally predictable but well acted slapstick at its best. John Cleese was middling best at the end while the opening sequence has a splendid running gag and a marvellous outbreak by Alicia Silverstone. Perhaps Rachael Leigh Cook's and Paulo Costanzo's talents are underused and the actor who played George Sr. in Arrested Development makes only a guest appearance. I hope there will be more good writing like this from Joe Wein.".

It may not be the most demanding as far as performances go. The plot is wellwritten and certainly never lost my interest. The pacing is fairly even. This has a couple of impeccable surprises. The music is cool. The majority of the jokes and gags work however it can cause a loud and reverberating crash when the others fall flat. The DVD of this that I have... R2 if that makes any difference... holds no features. There is rather little language but it's as strong as it comes. There is no violence if a bit of the physical comedy can come off as disturbing. Sex goes no further than minor dialog and eyecandy. I recommend this to any fan of anyone involved in creating it. Just be sure that you do not let yourself be exposed to any quirk for a while before watching this or you may OD on it. 610".

I like it when there are a bunch of characters and they all kind of have there own stories and they come together at one point or at the end of the story. Example when Shmally and Doleman where running from Merchant and Sheila and Mark got involved near the bank. I'm surprised the Wein brothers never came out with another movie. There pretty good writers. I liked Marcus Thomas' role in the movie Doleman. I think hes underappreciated. He should get himself out there more. Great movie Wein brothers!".

	schema:reviewBody "When The Mummy hit theatres in 1999 critics everywhere panned it as being a poor man's Indiana Jones. While the two movies are about as similar as Dr. No is to GoldenEye thankfully I suppose comparisons between one nonstop adventure film and other are inevitable. In the end what really counts when determining a film's quality is the level to which it can entertain. And if there is one thing The Mummy did well it was entertain. Brendan Fraser Rachel Weisz and Arnold Vosloo were very well chosen for their roles.The Mummy Returns is easy to see as being another sequel churned out to satiate the greedy moneymachine that Hollywood has become but it has a few things working for it. One thing that is immediately obvious is that the sequel was very much intended to be a film that could be enjoyed without ever having seen the original. The only references to the previous film are done to fill in the narrative gaps about who Imhotep is and why he is the way he is. The addition of The Scorpion King was an interesting effort to give the film a new antagonist but the lack of screentime didn't work well in this tangent's favour. Another tangent that could have been better developed was the rivalry between Imhotep's girlfriend and whatever her name was. Imhotep originally mistook Rachel Weisz's character for being his girlfriend reincarnated so the use of a woman who looks exactly like her while creating this new tangent needed to be developed differently.Most people won't give a damn about complex story tangents and will want to know if this film is entertaining. And it is entertaining alright. There is barely a dull moment in the film's substantial running length and Oded Fehr does a bangup job of providing a MadMaxcumIndianaJones hero. I want to know where they get those groovy costumes and tattoos from they look quite nice. Anyway when all is said and done this is an eight out of ten film. A few badly constructed story details here and there but some extremely entertaining action sequences make up for them. Don't listen to the naysayers. This is matineestyle material at its almost best. Get the DVD when it comes out it will at least tide you over until George Lucas gets his head out of his proverbial and realises that the VHS era is well and truly over.".

Some characters are more developed and some others more expanded all the same some others are reduced and we are introduced to new characters.  The plot is good not as good as the first movie but still does a good job keeping you interested and entertained the whole time. The sequel takes place 10 years later when Rick O'Conell Brendan Fraser and Evelyn Carnahan Rachel Weisz are now married and have a son Alex Freddie Boath.  Alex has been kidnaped by the bad guys including the infamous Imhotep Arnold Vosloo and his eternal love reincarnated Patricia Velazques.  Now it's just a matter of time for them to find Alex before it's too late for everybody...The performances are pretty good almost all of them.  Brendan Fraser does a good job once again as the handsome Rick he is strong funny charismatic what else can you ask?  Rachel Weisz role has been developed a lot more she is no longer the clumsy egyptologist wannabe now she runs the British museum and is a mom and she does a great job with that.  John Hannah is also back as  the useless Jonathan this time not as funny as he used to be. Oded Fehr  character has been expanded a lot we get to see him a lot more in this movie.  He did a good job as Ardeth.  One more time the winner of this movie is Arnold Vosloo as the villain his performance was excellent! He manages to express all the emotions without opening his mouth!  This guy has great acting skills too bad not many movie producersdirectors have noticed it.  The Rock does his movie debut with this movie he is the Scorpion King the whole movie turns around him even though he was in the movie for the first 5 minutes of it.  Still he did a good job for his first time.  Patricia Velazques was the only one who did a BAAAAD job.  Her acting is awful! She is pretty and everything but she really needs some acting classes.The music once again is one of the key parts of this movie it is really good even though Jerry Goldsmith wasn't in charge of it. The direction is good too just like in the first movie and we get to see a lot more of special effects.This movie is good i really enjoyed it I liked the first one better though but that's just me.  You might like this one better so YOU MUST SEE THIS ONE!  out of ".

Rachel Weisz role has been developed a lot more she is no longer the clumsy egyptologist wannabe now she runs the British museum and is a mom and she does a great job with that.  John Hannah is also back as  the useless Jonathan this time not as funny as he used to be. Oded Fehr  character has been expanded a lot we get to see him a lot more in this movie.  He did a good job as Ardeth.  One more time the winner of this movie is Arnold Vosloo as the villain his performance was excellent! He manages to express all the emotions without opening his mouth!  This guy has great acting skills too bad not many movie producersdirectors have noticed it.  The Rock does his movie debut with this movie he is the Scorpion King the whole movie turns around him even though he was in the movie for the first 5 minutes of it.  Still he did a good job for his first time.  Patricia Velazques was the only one who did a BAAAAD job.  Her acting is awful! She is pretty and everything but she really needs some acting classes.The music once again is one of the key parts of this movie it is really good even though Jerry Goldsmith wasn't in charge of it. The direction is good too just like in the first movie and we get to see a lot more of special effects.This movie is good i really enjoyed it I liked the first one better though but that's just me.  You might like this one better so YOU MUST SEE THIS ONE!  out of ";

	schema:reviewBody "If you've seen the trailer for this movie you're probably expecting fast paced adventure nonstop action and a special effects extravaganza with just enough story to keep it all interesting.  And if that's what you're hoping for you certainly won't be disappointed because that's exactly what you get in The Mummy Returns' written and directed by Stephen Sommers. The story begins in Egypt where Rick O'Connell Brendan Fraser and his wife Evelyn Rachel Weisz discover an ancient bracelet that had once belonged to a warrior known as The Scorpion King The Rock' who back in the day had sold his soul to the god Anubis for control of his armies and domination of the world.  Now it seems The Scorpion King's resurrection is imminent and if he succeeds and once again raises the armies of Anubis he could very well take over or destroy the world.  Followers of ImHoTep Arnold Vosloo however who are privy to this information as well decide to resurrect their dark leader so that he can face The Scorpion King defeat him take control of Anubis' armies and conquer the world himself putting them in control.  But the key to the whole plan lies with who has control of the bracelet at the time of The Scorpion King's resurrection.  And the O'Connells have taken it back home with them to London. So the adventure begins in earnest moving from Egypt to London then back again to Egypt.  Along the way there's plenty of mummies fighting and bugs but very few surprises except for one scene near the end when something quite unexpected happens.  The story itself gets somewhat lost in the muddle but it doesn't really matter plot is fairly insignificant in a movie like this as long as it maintains at least a thread of credibility and can give the action some context.  And that it does so all is well and it allows you to get on with what this movie is really all about which simply put is having a good time.With shades of Indiana Jones' and Star Wars' abounding the real success of this movie lies in the fact that it never pretends to be anything other than what it is or what it was meant to be and that is an entertaining fun movie.  It's visually explosive from the sweeping desert vistas of the converging battling armies to the mummies and assorted demons and creatures generously sprinkled throughout.  And the handtohand combat scenes between Evelyn and AnckSuNamun Patricia Velazquez are especially thrilling.  The one element of the film that doesn't seem to work too well has to do with a particular mode of transportation to which the O'Connells must resort upon their return to Egypt and which ultimately plays a significant part in the outcome of the whole adventure.  It's something that seemingly would have been more appropriate in The Adventures of Baron Munchausen' or Peter Pan.'As far as the performances suffice to say that the actors involved all do their jobs well after all in a movie like this you're not going to find anyone struggling with The Method.'  Fraser strikes a handsome heroic pose call him a poor man's Indiana Jones and Weisz is becoming as Evelyn.  Most importantly they all walk the walk and talk the talk and Sommers keeps them on track and wisely avoids allowing any lapses into camp' or tongueincheek character interpretations which makes this a solid funfilled actionadventure movie that is what it is.The supporting cast includes John Hannah providing some comic relief as Jonathan Carnahan Adewale AkinnuoyeAgbaje Lock Nah Freddie Boath Alex O'Connell and Obed Fehr Ardeth Bay.  As with most sequels you'll get more out of The Mummy Returns' if you've seen the original which had more of a story and of course would give you the background of the characters. But even on it's own and taken at face value this movie is a feast for the senses and just a lot of good fun.  Just don't go in expecting anything more than what the trailer promises if you can do that chances are you're going to enjoy the movie and have a good time.  I rate this one 710.".

I HATE movies that are carried by SFX but Mummy Returns incorporates them into the story in a seamless way. How cool is the big balloon? Or the approach of Anubis' army?Most directors screwup big budget big scale movies AVP King Arthur Sky Captain Exorcist Prequel Catwoman but Stephen Sommers knows where the heart of this kind of movie is and delivers once again a cheeky adventure with loads and loads of action and enough story and character to back it up. Filmed in Panavision the 2.351 anamorphic picture is perfect and the DolbyDTS 5.1 is very loud and thundering. A very good soundtrack indeed. The extras are total fluff and not worth the time.".

Arnold Vosloo gets to do more with his character and Patricia Velasquez who has about 10 times as much screen time as she did in the first film has a lot of fun acting like Jennifer Lopez's alterego. There are a few new characters as well including young Freddie Boath who is excellent as Alex. His screen appeal rivals Macauley Culkin at his best. Shaun Parkes is a much better source of comic relief than Kevin J. O'Connor he's consistently funny and the dialogue between him and Rick or Jonathan is hilarious. Adewale AkinnuoyeAgbaje is suitably creepy as a new villain and Alun Armstrong is suitably kooky as the ringleader.Stephen Sommers knows how to create an action movie. He creates real characters not actors who are given different names and sends them into action scene after action scene. It's a fun and exciting flick and that's all it tries to be.".

I hadn't seen it since it was released for homeviewing so it's been about a year or two. I must say that this movie takes my breath away each time I see it. The Mummy Returns is a roller coaster ride which barely stops during the entire 2 hours! I love the CGI effects and how lavish the scenery looks. The movie made me feel as though I was witnessing Ancient Egypt and and the 1930's era in person. So what if things look 'cartoony' during the battling sequences! I think that the battle sequences in Two Towers looked just as much the same. I find that with many fans nowadays they take things way too seriously. If a movie or TV series is not what they hope for then they blast it all to hell just because they are whining babies. Take for instance Star Trek Nemesis. That was another really good movie yet the so called 'fans' ripped it apart piece by piece and then fed it to the dogs. I just wish that the babies would enjoy the movies instead of complaining that a movie isn't good quality. If thats the case they should just go back to their rooms and watch Fargo or the English Patient! Both the Mummy and the Mummy Returns rock as far as action movies go. Get a huge bag of chips a large bottle of pop sit down with your girlfriend and enjoy two great movies!! Excellent fun!!".

What made this movie work for me was the humor. Normally this kind of movies takes itself much too serious there is no place for any joke or funny situation at all. In The Mummy Returns this is different. Thanks to the humor this movie was very enjoyable but it is of course the many special effects that make this movie what it is. Don't expect anything real a mummy coming to life sucking the life out of people armies of mythological creatures... will of course never exist in reality but it certainly was nice to see. I guess it is best to qualify this movie as some excellent way to pass some boring hours on a cold and rainy afternoon. It's certainly not an intellectual movie but I didn't mind about that when watching it. I give it a 6510.".

	schema:reviewBody "After seeing The Mummy in the theaters for the first time two years ago I knew I would be hooked. I've watched it about twenty times since then and as many people know this movie does not get boring or less funny after watching it numerous times in fact I think it gets more and more thrilling each time. I began hoping for a sequel to be released and when I heard that one was in the making I was relieved that they weren't going to end this great storyline with just one film. When The Mummy Returns was finally released in theaters it didn't recieve very many good reviews right away. I was dissapointed because I didn't understand how Stephen Sommers could direct such a great movie classic and then totally botch a promising sequel. I let the reviews get to me and I didn't see the movie while in the theaters. I waited until this past weekend to watch TMR on payperview not expecting much due to the bad reviews but I soon found out that boy were some of those critics wrong.Right from the opening scene I knew I wasn't going to be disappointed. The action special effects acting comedy and romance were all better than it's prequel in my opinion. The plot was a little confusing and the Scorpion King graphic at the end looked like the same one used in the video game but all in all it was an extremely fun and enjoyable movie. I actually found myself watching it three times in a row. I probably could have watched it 24 hours straight but I didn't want to ruin it right away.The SFX in TMR were outstanding. The pymies were so amazing and the Anubis warriors were excellent as well. But on to the greater aspects of the film. I thought that Jonathan played by John Hannah is one of the funniest characters ever his oneliners are terrific I was laughing out loud during his lines. Arnold Vosloo is great as the title character but could have been more like the original he was not as powerful in this film but was good anyway. Many people disliked Alex O'Connell played by newcomer Freddie Boath but I found him to be quite funny and likable. He had many great lines and was sarcastic when the film needed it. He is a cute kid and l hope he will have a good acting career. Oded Fehr is wonderful as Ardeth Bay. He keeps the heroes grounded.MeelaAncksunamun played by Patricia Velasquez has some good scenes but I found her to be not as great as the rest of the cast. I wasn't really looking forward to seeing The Rock as the Scorpion  King in this film but he wasn't as bad as I thought even though he was only it for about three minutes I would have labled him as an extra. It was all hype for him. My favorite part of The Mummy Returns was the great chemistry between Brendan Fraser Rick and Rachel Weisz Evie. They looked like an actual couple in this film unlike other recent movies. This was why I liked this one better than the prequel. A little bit of romance was what was missing from the first 23 of The Mummy and I am so glad it was included much more in this film. Brendan Fraser is very easy on the eyes and he looks like a downtoearth guy not like a stereotypical moviestar. I think this is why the two seem so believeable in TMR they are just two normal people who are still very beautiful people. I am glad they made Evie more attractive in TMR she deserves to show off her pretty eyes. Rick is great because he is still the same sarcastic wiseguy handsome hero who has all the females in the theater including myself drooling and sighing that he was in the first mummy movie.I hope that they will make another sequel with Fraser Weisz Hannah Vosloo Fehr and Boath all included. They can't take out any of these characters without the movie being butchered. I probably won't see The Scorpion King since Brendan and Rachel my favorite characters won't be in it. I know there are many others just like me who love the romance in this film. I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes action SFX comedy romance and good clean fun. I would give this movie a 9.9 out of 10 points with the 0.1 being subtracted because it wasn't long enough to really explain the plot in more depth. When it ended I wished it wasn't over. This goes in my top 5 movies of all time.".

	onyx:emotionText "After seeing The Mummy in the theaters for the first time two years ago I knew I would be hooked. I've watched it about twenty times since then and as many people know this movie does not get boring or less funny after watching it numerous times in fact I think it gets more and more thrilling each time. I began hoping for a sequel to be released and when I heard that one was in the making I was relieved that they weren't going to end this great storyline with just one film. When The Mummy Returns was finally released in theaters it didn't recieve very many good reviews right away. I was dissapointed because I didn't understand how Stephen Sommers could direct such a great movie classic and then totally botch a promising sequel. I let the reviews get to me and I didn't see the movie while in the theaters. I waited until this past weekend to watch TMR on payperview not expecting much due to the bad reviews but I soon found out that boy were some of those critics wrong.Right from the opening scene I knew I wasn't going to be disappointed. The action special effects acting comedy and romance were all better than it's prequel in my opinion. The plot was a little confusing and the Scorpion King graphic at the end looked like the same one used in the video game but all in all it was an extremely fun and enjoyable movie. I actually found myself watching it three times in a row. I probably could have watched it 24 hours straight but I didn't want to ruin it right away.The SFX in TMR were outstanding. The pymies were so amazing and the Anubis warriors were excellent as well. But on to the greater aspects of the film. I thought that Jonathan played by John Hannah is one of the funniest characters ever his oneliners are terrific I was laughing out loud during his lines. Arnold Vosloo is great as the title character but could have been more like the original he was not as powerful in this film but was good anyway. Many people disliked Alex O'Connell played by newcomer Freddie Boath but I found him to be quite funny and likable. He had many great lines and was sarcastic when the film needed it. He is a cute kid and l hope he will have a good acting career. Oded Fehr is wonderful as Ardeth Bay. He keeps the heroes grounded.MeelaAncksunamun played by Patricia Velasquez has some good scenes but I found her to be not as great as the rest of the cast. I wasn't really looking forward to seeing The Rock as the Scorpion  King in this film but he wasn't as bad as I thought even though he was only it for about three minutes I would have labled him as an extra. It was all hype for him. My favorite part of The Mummy Returns was the great chemistry between Brendan Fraser Rick and Rachel Weisz Evie.

The bad guys are for the most part fun to hate. ImHoTep is a good villain. Maybe he isn't given enough to do here but he's still cool. Patricia Valazquez is a real stunner as his love interst AnckSuNamun. She's probably the best thing about the film. Adewale AkinnuoyeAgbaje was good as Lock Nah the main henchman. Perhaps the weakest part of the film is the Rock as the Scorpion King. The narration during the film's prologue is not nearly as good as it would be if we were watching the story develop. The Scorpion King is basically a boring character. His computeranimated doppleganger at the film's climax is neat but it would have been better if there were some feelings towards that character.People who know their action flicks will notice that the Mummy Returns steals about every action scene from every action movie made in the past 20 years quoting movies like Aliens Indiana Jones Jurassic Park 2 why? that movie was terrible and especially Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace with which if you remember The Mummy I was competing with in the box office successfully in May of 1999. They don't try to hide any of it. They even make a jest at Spielberg with a shadow against the moon from ET and Amblin Entertainment. It's all in good fun. You shouldn't be too angry at the sloppy script. If you are going to be angry the shoddy computer animation should be your target. Still it's not bad.".

This actually is OK for those who enjoyed the first film immensely because Returns is every bit as enjoyable as family blockbuster entertainment.

While there might have been a couple tiny bits that left a bad taste in my mouth overall I thought it was great.  Stephen Sommers is an awesome writerdirector I've always enjoyed his films.

They had all the original cast coming back John Hannah Oded Fehr... slam dunk hole in one. But this...They took the first movie then instead of taking all the good stuff they just condensed the Bad Taste In My Mouth parts.  I'm amazed the Kid wasn't the worst thing about it.  Oh he was Bad but there's a lot of bad in this movie.  Historical innaccuracies zero characterization cliche's galore...any one of those I could have forgiven but not all of them.This is a big soulless hollywood summer movie.  This is Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.  I hated Short Round...and I hated this Kid.  For the most part it's a total rehash of stuff from the first movie.  I'd put in a SPOILER warning but if you saw the first one you know how this is gonna turn out.  Bad.  It's bad.The chick that played Ananck Su Namun is back and apparently she wanted a speaking role this time.  Bad Idea.  The Rock out acted her.  Not the wrestler one of the rocks on film.  Not that good acting would have saved this plotless chunk of filth.  If you want decent characterization I guess they thought it would carry over from the first movie.  The actors were there for filler in between pointless special effects and dumb fight scenes.  If you're a fan of either forget what I've said go see it enjoy.Plot holes oh the plot holes.  Big enough to pass the Giza Pyramid through. How did Oded GET to england much less to Rick's mansion?  He says he's never been on a bus before.  Evie is a kungfu chick?  Why didn't these neato abilities kick in in the first movie??? They sure as heck woulda been useful.  Rick is a magi?  Does he need a DAMN reason to fight the mummy? Flashback to Ancient Egyptian Foxy Boxing why?  The huge honkin' tropical rainforest...around a PYRAMID...in the middle of a DESERT!!!  No one noticed this before?  Seems odd in a world filled with ROCKET POWERED BALLOONS!!! Sorry suspension of disbelief only goes so far...jets...we didn't even HAVE JETS THEN!!! That guy would have made some serious money with his inventions.  I know the Germans woulda been interested...And the special effects...sure they're impressive...but they don't make a movie Good in my book.  Case in point Dragonheart.  Nuff said.  Goin' to see a bad movie for good special effects is akin to goin' to the circus to gawk at the Freak Show.  Well looky that.  If that don't beat all! They're nice they're gravy...but I'd rather have a well made movie.  And the ScorpionRock...man flashback to Clash of the Titans.  Ray Harryhausen is turnin' over in his grave...if he's dead.  I hope not Ray's a good man. But this...guh.I'm not alone in my feelings either.  Pretty much all in the theater felt this way.

	schema:reviewBody "What a joke this movie is. The first Mummy was quite alright with the right dose of suspense an interesting story likeable characters and quite subtle visual effects. Not an 'Indiana Jones' in any way but an enjoyable movie nevertheless.'The Mummy Returns' looks fake from start to finish. Sommers tried to create a sequel that is bigger an better than the first one but he failed in almost every way.Someone should tell film makers that today's computer technology is not yet able to replace EVERY movie set and definitely it's not ready to replace actors!!This movie includes some of the worst effects ever created by ILM and maybe it's not even their fault. Because it's their job to do what the director wants so if they were asked to create the Rock as a CGI character they just had to do it.Of course the result is totally laughable an embarrassing moment for a movie with such a high budget. Also the moment where the pyramid sucks in all the jungle is the stupidest most fake overthetop effect I have ever encountered.What the hell was Sommers thinking? Ah that's a nice idea I'll just ask the ILM guys to do it and we're done. Well it looks totally cartoonish and ridiculous.Having recently watched the good old 'Big Trouble in little China' all I have to say is that the rubber monster in no way worst than any of the effects in 'Mummy Returns'. Why? Because principal photography is at least applied on set and can with the right director produce a quite realistic result.Listening to the DVD audio commentary by Stephen Sommers all I can say is that the guy is totally untalented and has no appreciation of art at all. He was just lucky. The people are always hungry for Indiana Jones type of adventures and he was there at the right time.

	onyx:emotionText "What a joke this movie is. The first Mummy was quite alright with the right dose of suspense an interesting story likeable characters and quite subtle visual effects. Not an 'Indiana Jones' in any way but an enjoyable movie nevertheless.'The Mummy Returns' looks fake from start to finish. Sommers tried to create a sequel that is bigger an better than the first one but he failed in almost every way.Someone should tell film makers that today's computer technology is not yet able to replace EVERY movie set and definitely it's not ready to replace actors!!This movie includes some of the worst effects ever created by ILM and maybe it's not even their fault. Because it's their job to do what the director wants so if they were asked to create the Rock as a CGI character they just had to do it.Of course the result is totally laughable an embarrassing moment for a movie with such a high budget. Also the moment where the pyramid sucks in all the jungle is the stupidest most fake overthetop effect I have ever encountered.What the hell was Sommers thinking? Ah that's a nice idea I'll just ask the ILM guys to do it and we're done. Well it looks totally cartoonish and ridiculous.Having recently watched the good old 'Big Trouble in little China' all I have to say is that the rubber monster in no way worst than any of the effects in 'Mummy Returns'. Why? Because principal photography is at least applied on set and can with the right director produce a quite realistic result.Listening to the DVD audio commentary by Stephen Sommers all I can say is that the guy is totally untalented and has no appreciation of art at all. He was just lucky. The people are always hungry for Indiana Jones type of adventures and he was there at the right time. He is under the impression that because his movie sold well he created something good.Well this movie has zero suspense the characters are now unlikeable except for the always brilliant John Hannah and everything's totally predictable. Plus there are so many elements in 'Mummy Returns' you just can't keep track of. Pygmy mummies out of nowhere flying zeppelin things projector bracelets weird reincarnations among others.

This one is very funny and keeps you entertained all the way through. The music is superb as well it is also nice that the main cast returns as well as 92 percent of the crew! At first I was not sure of Freddie Boath but as soon as I saw the first scene he was in I knew that if a child of that age can act that well the so can all the adults. Anyone whose anyone must see this movie. Nothing bad can be said about it. So get to the cinema now and relive the adventure started off in the first one and continued in this one.".

This is Indiana Jones written large with more humour and a few twists. This is the 1930's equivalent of Steampunk with the rocketairship and all the gunplay as well as all the magic and mayhem that goes on.

The Kid is funny he just has this habit of being incredibly sarcastic at the most inappropriate moments which is hilarious when you see the reactions he gets.

Arnold Vosloo is as scary as all hell as Imhotep although I would have liked to have seen some of his other powers. The other players turn in excellent and amusing performances too. The Rock even gets to do his famous eyebrow!The whole film is just one huge fun wild romp through fantasyland from beginning to end.

And watch out for the number of scenes where one of the good guys is in serious trouble only to have the hero appear to save the day . It really does get tedious after the first three or four times it happensI may be accused of taking this film far too seriously and not realising its a dumb popcorn movie .

	schema:reviewBody "The plot of this film is too complex to set out in any great detail. Suffice it to say that a group of villains including one of the curators of the British Museum have revived the corpse of the Ancient Egyptian priest Imhotep who was put to death for his part in the murder of the Pharaoh a crime carried out by his wife AncksuNamun who was also Imhotep's lover. The villains are also seeking to use a magic bracelet to revive the Scorpion King a warrior from another period of Egyptian history who sold his soul to the dark god Anubis in exchange for military success and his army. The idea is that they will then use Imhotep to kill the Scorpion King which will give them control of his army which they will then use to achieve their ambition of world domination. The only people who can thwart their schemes are Rick O'Connell an American archaeologist and his beautiful English wife Evelyn whose young son Alex has stolen the magic bracelet. Evelyn just happens to be the reincarnation of the daughter of the murdered Pharaoh.You get the general idea. Don't you just love social realism?Despite the fact that the plot of 'The Mummy Returns' is clearly nonsensical I rather enjoyed the film. It is set in the 1930s and it clearly owes much to the 'Indiana Jones' films also set in that period. Both involve Egyptian archaeology and artefacts with mystical powers. Although this will sound heretical to the army of Spielberg devotees who have voted 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' to number 17 in your list of the 250 best movies of all time I have to say that I enjoyed 'The Mummy Returns' at least as much as any of the 'Indiana Jones' series and considerably more than 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'. The reason is that the film is fastpaced and occasionally witty the film whisks the viewer from one adventure to another and generates enough excitement to make him or her forget the many absurdities and inconsistencies in the script. The film never makes the mistake of taking itself too seriously a mistake that can often ruin an adventure film of this nature. The best thing about this film is that it stars the gorgeous Rachel Weisz. Indeed it helped to change my ideas about her. I had previously seen Rachel as an attractive but rather conservative and proper actress always playing English rose types in arthouse movies. 'The Mummy Returns' I have never seen 'The Mummy' showed that she has a larger range than this and has not only the looks but also the sex appeal and cinematic presence to take the lead in Hollywood blockbusters. Her predecessor as official English Rose Helena Bonham Carter has also made a similar move. Brendan Fraser has never really been my favourite actor but here he did well as Rick the solid and dependable family man. This is very much a 'family values' thriller like 'True Lies' or 'The River Wild' in which mum dad and the kid all play their part in thwarting the bad guys. This phenomenon perhaps marks a change in the way in which women are seen by the film industry. At one time leading actresses often disliked being cast as a mother even of young children as it was seen as a sign that their career as a leading lady was over and that henceforward they only had 'character' roles to look forward to. Rachel Weisz however plays a mother both here and in her next film 'About a Boy' without her career suffering any harm. Of the other characters there was an amusing cameo from John Hannah as Jonathan Evelyn's cowardly and avaricious brother. The villains do not really stand out  with the exception of Patricia Velasquez as the reincarnated AncksuNamun a villainess almost as sexy as the heroine. Her duel with Rachel Weisz will probably strike most male viewers as the film's most memorable scene. The sense of menace overhanging the heroes comes more from the film's computergenerated effects. One thing I did not like was the Scorpion King in the early scenes a human being but in the later ones a rather ridiculous and unconvincing halfman halfscorpion monster like something from a cheap Bmovie. In a way the film could be seen as a modernday Bmovie an updated largescale bigbudget version of those old Saturday morning quickies. Much the same thing however could be said of many of Spielberg's films and not just Indiana Jones. 'The Mummy Returns' may be nonsense but at least it is entertaining nonsense. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers herein.My disappointment in this film was profound.Most films are ordinary and being ordinary are about other films. In this case the precedent is Indiana Jones which added a comic book perspective to the wellestablished genre of mummy curse films. The key elements from both Lucas and Spielberg were chases and humor. The kernel of the idea comes from an enterprising reporter who formed a cosmic revenge story around the discovery of Tutankamen's undisturbed tomb in the 1922s.That tomb as all such tombs cursed the disturbers death shall come on swift wings to him who disturbs the peace of the king' and Lord Carnarvon the first man to enter did indeed perish soon after of a strange malady. There are even fresh arguments concerning mold spores. 11 others also died mysteriously. Around that curse were resurrected cosmic battles about the powers of gods and the nature of the afterlife. A near contemporary Akhenaton lost the battle but won the war on this matter as a tribe of semites later left Egypt and founded the onegod beliefofthebook modernheaven religion that now permeates the west. Comic book versions followed.This is great stuff around which one can spin a popular tale of terror from the afterlife. To Indiana the first Sommers Mummy movie added some novel computer work which still amazes us. But the core notion of reach from the afterlife was relatively preserved. Here the same team used the theory of more to produce a mess preserving nothing.We still have massive computer graphics and for a year or two more we will still marvel. But the underlying structure has no soul it has inexplicably been tossed leaving us without a footing for our thrills.Simple stuff Fraser has a greater comedic range than celebrity franchise Harrison Ford but humor is rare here.Instead of one good guy we have a whole extended family plus the good arab.' The chief guy  we discover  is destined to save the world as designated by a tattoo. The chief girl is the reincarnated good girl so she can play both the good daughter and good mom. Its confusing whether the kid is special  tapped by fate  or just stumbles on the bracelet.Instead of one bad guy we have the scheming museum curator and his unexplained sect the reincarnated in body only   whatever that means bad girl the bad mummy priest the more powerful scorpion warriorking who himself is a hireling of someone we don't meet the black guy who has some special role the moriarty gang and the pygmy demons.Instead of one magic we have the 12 tribes of  Magi clearly related to the magic of the word the magic of the books the magic of the spear bracelet diamond which will factor in the sequel the magic of the scorpion curse the magic ofthe mummy's curse. But despite all this magic everything revolves around fights with knives. How quaint.Instead of one vision of the underworld it is a parking place for demons to be recalled from sort of a suspended animation zone or a Dantelike place of eternal torture. Neither is particularly Egyptian.Which brings me to the sense of place. Many of the sets are lush.

	onyx:emotionText "Spoilers herein.My disappointment in this film was profound.Most films are ordinary and being ordinary are about other films. In this case the precedent is Indiana Jones which added a comic book perspective to the wellestablished genre of mummy curse films. The key elements from both Lucas and Spielberg were chases and humor. The kernel of the idea comes from an enterprising reporter who formed a cosmic revenge story around the discovery of Tutankamen's undisturbed tomb in the 1922s.That tomb as all such tombs cursed the disturbers death shall come on swift wings to him who disturbs the peace of the king' and Lord Carnarvon the first man to enter did indeed perish soon after of a strange malady. There are even fresh arguments concerning mold spores. 11 others also died mysteriously. Around that curse were resurrected cosmic battles about the powers of gods and the nature of the afterlife. A near contemporary Akhenaton lost the battle but won the war on this matter as a tribe of semites later left Egypt and founded the onegod beliefofthebook modernheaven religion that now permeates the west. Comic book versions followed.This is great stuff around which one can spin a popular tale of terror from the afterlife. To Indiana the first Sommers Mummy movie added some novel computer work which still amazes us. But the core notion of reach from the afterlife was relatively preserved. Here the same team used the theory of more to produce a mess preserving nothing.We still have massive computer graphics and for a year or two more we will still marvel. But the underlying structure has no soul it has inexplicably been tossed leaving us without a footing for our thrills.Simple stuff Fraser has a greater comedic range than celebrity franchise Harrison Ford but humor is rare here.Instead of one good guy we have a whole extended family plus the good arab.' The chief guy  we discover  is destined to save the world as designated by a tattoo. The chief girl is the reincarnated good girl so she can play both the good daughter and good mom. Its confusing whether the kid is special  tapped by fate  or just stumbles on the bracelet.Instead of one bad guy we have the scheming museum curator and his unexplained sect the reincarnated in body only   whatever that means bad girl the bad mummy priest the more powerful scorpion warriorking who himself is a hireling of someone we don't meet the black guy who has some special role the moriarty gang and the pygmy demons.Instead of one magic we have the 12 tribes of  Magi clearly related to the magic of the word the magic of the books the magic of the spear bracelet diamond which will factor in the sequel the magic of the scorpion curse the magic ofthe mummy's curse. But despite all this magic everything revolves around fights with knives. How quaint.Instead of one vision of the underworld it is a parking place for demons to be recalled from sort of a suspended animation zone or a Dantelike place of eternal torture. Neither is particularly Egyptian.Which brings me to the sense of place. Many of the sets are lush. We are supposed to feel the sense of in turn ratty Egypt lux London spectacular desert  train ancient magical Egypt. Think now  were they successful with any location? Did you get any feel of magic like say even Stargate' conveyed? Were you awed by the visions the bracelet produced?Worse the horror was all mouth horror.

And sure enough the sequel was released just two days later. The opening of the film had already utilized many special effects including the Tower at Thebes and the two armies fighting till the death. Also The Rock even though his only line was in Ancient Egyptian was still pretty solid. After an intense war scene we finally arrive on the O'connells. Rick Brendan Fraser is now a family man. his son Alex shows as much strength and warmth that both Evy and Rick have. Throughout the film the relationship within the family grew and amassed to that of an odd family. The film doesn't slow down yet we are then treated to beautiful sets that have you believe they actually were in Egypt all those years ago. Also Alan Silvestri has a truly magnificent score that is used to its fullest potential. The film takes us to Hamunaptra where Imhotep is found inside of some cocoon like object. later we are at the museum in a truly memorable fight sequence. There are also some nice scenes to look at interesting dialogue. And some AMAZING special effects.Overall Consensus The Mummy Returns is without a doubt the best Sequel ever made. It's fun engaging Beautifully shotacted and will make the audience feel as if sand is between their toes wanting to see more of the action.".

	schema:reviewBody "Satyajit Ray's 'Abhijaan' tells the story of taxidriver Singhji Soumitra Chatterjee who travels in his Chrysler with companion Rama. A misogynist due to his wife's abandonment and an alcoholic it doesn't take long for Singhji to have his license revoked because of his unproffesionalism. Thereafter he soon arrives at a small town while giving a paying lift to a sleazy businessman. The passenger offers him a proposition due to which he decides to temporarily stay at this town. During his stay he unexpectedly reunites with an old friend Joseph and his sister Mary. Unexpectedly he receives visits from the enigmatic mistress of the shady businessman Gulabi Waheeda Rehman who falls in love with him. 'Abhijaan' is another proof of why Ray is one of the best filmmakers in history. It is just as much characterdriven as story driven. Ray effectively tackles different themes such as betrayal alcoholism corruption sex discrimination prejudice and unrequited love. For example in one dialogue he brilliantly tackled the theme of attempted suicide. The scene takes place during a conversation between Singhji and Gulabi where she describes her temptations to commit suicide and why she eventually steps back because of fear of missing out on life. I have only seen but very few movies that explore themes of suicide in such a brilliantly effective way another example is Stephen Daldry's fantastic 'The Hours'. Most movies show characters succeeding or the character being rescued or the aftermath on others but hardly is the theme further developed but here in just one line Ray skillfully explores this sensitive theme making it a powerful scene. The discrimination against Indian Christians is also an interesting theme that Ray has introduced. I did not know that Indian Christians suffered so much discrimination except during the British Raj and it was interesting to see.Ray is known for his ability to recognize talent. Soumitra Chatterjee is pretty much considered a regular in Ray films. He carries the film with sheer ease and delivers an incredible performance. Soumitra's display of the range of emotions and complexities of Singhji is amazing. The relationship between Singhji and Gulabi begins with reluctance and pity even though he is aware that her attempts to visit him are not entirely honorable then it shifts to lust but with every subsequent visit love develops. Waheeda Rehman can be counted on to deliver at least a good performance and here she is a total surprise right from her first scene where she attempts to seduce Singhji and eventually revealing her vulnerable side sharing her dreams about her prince charming rescuing her and then marrying her the dream that kept her alive and finally the scene where she confronts Singhji about his weakness and fatal path towards self destruction. While Singhji may have had mixed feelings for Gulabi she has always looked at him with love as a savior who will one day take her away from this state of purgatory and give her a new life. It is one of the most sympathetic performances of a prostitute that I have witnessed on screen. As Singhji's sidekick Robi Ghosh is fun to watch. Gyanesh Mukherjee and Ruma Guha Thakur offer great support as the friend and potential love interest respectively.In a way the movie may remind one of Saratchandra's 'Devdas' except that Singhji isn't a guiltridden whining 'loser'. Even though he is about to embark a similar path of self destruction to me his character is more human and the bond between him and Gulabi is more real than that of Devdas and Chandramukhi.'Abhijaan' is another winner from the late genius called Satyajit Ray. I don't think there is more I need to say that has not already been said by someone else but if you haven't seen it then what are you waiting for?".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this somewhat slow BW 1962 film at London's National Film Theatre a couple of years ago during their excellent Satyajit Ray retrospective. It displays the qualities which most Ray fans like about his earlier films the camera is thoughtful and the time it takes to reflect on the characters is useful time for the viewer to do the same. The story is interesting as well and much of the scenery and dialogue provides a fascinating insight into 1960s Bengali life e.g. references to quinine an antimalarial compound whose chemical derivatives which are more potent are used in modern prophylactic antimalarial preparations. Highly recommended as an introduction to Ray's best era. I personally haven't seen his Apu trilogy e.g. Pather Panchali but I know that they have been criticised for being too sentimental. Abhijaan is nothing of the sort it is a wellmade exploration into an eventful period of a 1960s Indian taxi driver's life.".

It's odd because he is badtempered for a lead character whereas the 'bad guy' the corrupt businessman is extremely good natured and likable.The theme is the struggle to get ahead embodied in the taxi driver's efforts to get past the cars ahead of him or beat a train to its destination. The scenes on the dusty roads are among the most interesting as villagers and cows hurl themselves out of his way. Any intelligent film automatically contains humour but the little chap playing the mechanic  familiar from other Ray films  is there for good measure. Everything is in conflict here caste against caste boss against employee business against business woman against man  it's a tough old world. Ray put famed Bollywood goddess Waheeda Rehman among the lowlife and the effect is startling.

The response in turn at first baffles the researchers until American cartographer David Laughlin deciphers the meaning of the response. In the second electric company lineman and family man Roy Neary and single mother Jillian Guiler are among some individuals in Muncie Indiana who experience some paranormal activity before some flashes of bright lights in the sky which they believe to be a UFO. Roy becomes obsessed with what he saw unlike some others especially in some form of authority who refuse to acknowledge their belief that it was a UFO in not wanting to appear crazy.

	schema:headline " Transforming Fear to Wonder";
	schema:reviewBody "An amazing film one of my favorites. I watch this regularly especially at times when the reality of life is overwhelming just to refocus and regain some sense of perspective.Everything in this film works toward one end to transform the adult sense of fear back into the childlike sense of wonder at the world. From the very opening moments of the film designed to create confusion and startlement this movie creates a sensation of dread and foreboding. The dissonance of the soundtrack the juxtaposition of images they all are working to build into the viewer a feeling that something just isn't right that something out of the ordinary is taking place and underscoring this all with a sense that this is something to resist to pull away from to not allow it to affect one's ordinary life. But as the movie progresses the tone begins to shift and the true intent of the film begins to peek through. This isn't about being afraid of the unknown but rather embracing it. Paying attention to the subliminal images in life allowing them to lead you into something unknown and perhaps dangerous only then can one be open to wonder and experience the world through the magical eyes of a child.Dreyfuss' character takes us on this journey met with resistance all along the way. His wife his neighbors his job his community all are working against him and it's only when he's reached his craziest that he truly gives in and begins to stop trying to understand and instead embraces the experiences in store for him. The scientific community is seeking to understand but without having any personal calling to be involved. Only Barry is truly able to throw himself into the strangeness that is taking place and his enthusiasm is greeted by both the characters and the audience as somehow alien and threatening.The ending of this film when all the fear is finally stripped away and the sense of amazed wonder overtakes everyone on the screen and in the audience brings about an amazing catharsis. Discarding all the adult sensibilities and being able to approach life once again with a sense of innocent amazement for the Strange hidden amongst the Ordinary one can begin again to approach life from a fresh vantage point. Powerful mystifying and rejuvenating. I highly recommend this film for anyone jaded with life and seeking a sense of renewal.".

	schema:reviewBody "For my taste the first hour and a half of this movie is the greatest stretch of filmmaking ever.  Up until Roy and Jillian reach the dark side of the moon on Devil's Tower this movie is perfect.  No it's beyond perfect  it's sublime.  It takes me to a level of bliss that no other movie can do.Many critics and viewers  including a number on this site  don't like this movie at all.  Those who do like it almost uniformly like the final sequence the alien landing the best.  For me it is the rest of the movie that is the most remarkable.  Some of my favorite sequences1.  The blinding flash of light that ends the opening credits and leads us to a sandstorm in Sonora Desert Mexico  Present Day with various team leaders Bob Balaban and Francois Truffaut speaking three languages as they find a whole bunch of old Navy planes lost in the Bermuda Triangle and an old geezer who saw something very strange.  El sol salio a noche.  Y me canto he keeps saying.  Translation He says the sun came out last night. He says it sang to him.  Then Balaban translates for Truffaut Il dit que le soleil etait venue ici hier soir et qu'il chantait pour lui.  Then Balaban disappears in a cloud of dust.  The mystery created in that sequence is incredible  the greatest opening of all time if you ask me.  Trivia note  that sequence was the last Spielberg filmed before the movie's release.  The shooting script opens with Indianapolis Flight Control but Spielberg decided he wanted a new opening and shot this after production had wrapped.  Supposedly this sequence was inspired by the Iraqi prologue in the Exorcist.2.  Roy's first encounter with the aliens in his power company truck  a brilliantly conceived and edited sequence.  I love the dolly in to Roy's window as he pants in shock in the shadows then the comedy of his reaction when the lights in the truck come back on.3.  The sky speeders disappearing into the clouds over Muncie followed by lightning and then the lights of the city coming back on bit by bit. Spielberg's use of miniatures here is breathtaking  as it was in 1941 and as it is later in CE3K when the UFO believers gather again to await another encounter and the lights from the government helicopters move toward them across the plains below.4.  The entire sequence of Roy going crazy.  This was controversial with critics  Pauline Kael who loved the movie generally hated Roy throwing the bushes into the kitchen  and Spielberg actually cut the entire digging up the garden sequence from the socalled Special Edition.  To me though this is the absolute heart of the movie.  Ask people what they remember from CE3K and the first thing they'll say is mashed potatoes.  To my mind the garden sequence is one of those magical moments that is so funny and so sad it's just perfect.  I believe every second of it every time.  The reactions of the kids are perfect  the oldest son is big enough to be angry while the middle says Dad when we're finished with this can we throw dirt in my window?  In the dinner sequence little Sylvia has arguably the best line in a movie full of them  I hate I hate these potatoes.  There's a dead fly in my potatoes.  An ad lib of course.In recent years Spielberg has expressed concern with the fact that Roy leaves his family to pursue the aliens and has said that if he were to make the movie over again he would change that part.  To my way of thinking if you take that out there is no movie.  What this movie is really about is Roy's obsession and that I think is why it has such a hold on me personally.  This movie is about what it's like for a person whose life has lost its meaning suddenly finding there is a really important purpose and pursuing that purpose at all costs.  Is it right for him to turn his family's life upside down and ultimately leave them behind to do that? No. But his obsession is understandable I think and the purpose Roy finds is something a lot of people would like to feel.  Also it's clear that Roy is not acting entirely of his own free will  he has been commanded subliminally to make his way to Devil's Tower.I am not aware of any other movie  or book or any other source for that matter  that portrays 70s suburban life so accurately.  The street the house the cars the toys the furniture  it is like an archeological document.  And the way the kids act and the family conflicts  to my way of thinking they are all portrayed with unerring accuracy and realism. Some have contended that Ronnie is unflatteringly portrayed but to me that's not fair.  She can't be blamed for reacting the way she does to Roy  many people in her shoes would.  Garr's performance is brilliant she and Dreyfuss are magical together.  Melinda Dillon too is brilliant in her role.  In the shooting script the sexual attraction between Roy and Jillian was more overt but Spielberg wisely downplays it in the finished film. It's only hinted at although it is there.The actual alien landing sequence in my opinion is a letdown.  It's brilliantly photographed and realized but once Roy and Jillian make it to the dark side of the moon the primary tension in the story is gone.  If I could edit this movie I'd take a major pair of shears to the final sequence cut it down to maybe half its current length.  I do get choked up when I see Roy in his red suit at the end of the line of astronauts though and Jillian wiping tears away as she clicks away with her Kodak.As with the original Star Wars my other alltime favorite movie I have a problem with the way this picture has been hacked and altered from its original release through various special editions.  I understand it's possible to watch the original 1977 cut on the DVD and I'm glad of that. That original version is the best.  I first got to know this movie on ABC in the early 1980s when it was shown with all the original and Special Edition footage edited together.  Personally I don't think the special edition footage adds much even the Gobi desert sequence which is an interesting concept that was in the shooting script stands out because it was obviously shot by a different DP and doesn't have Truffaut in it.Anyway I will always cherish this movie.  You tell Crystal Lake we're going to candlepower in ten minutes!  Zey belong here more zan we. There's always some joker who thinks he's immune.  You can't fool us by agreeing with us.  What the hell is going on around here?  Who the hell are you people?  Ronnie everything's fine.  All this stuff is coming down.".

	schema:headline " Watch the 1977 Version Only then Judge it.";
	schema:reviewBody "The version of Close Encounters that you've seen on TV or video may not be the best version. For years I had watched a TV version of the film that combined parts of the theatrical cut and the special edition and I felt like it was decent but somehow it seemed edited by an amateur. I chalked it up to a 70s approach towards special effects movies that lingered too much on visuals without having a plot. Decades later I finally watched the 1977 version on Blu Ray and realized it really was a much better film. Apparently Mr. Spielberg was pressured to finish the film quickly and he wanted to spend more time on some scenes but it looks like the studio pressure was a gift. The 77 version of the film is more coherent and enjoyable. If you read the reviews that say the Richard Dreyfus character is obnoxious and unlikable chances are that the reviewer saw the special edition or a TV version that adds footage from that version into a poorly edited version of the film. Whichever version you watch the character does have family problems but in the 77 version you have scenes of Dreyfus on the job some shorter scenes of him having a meltdown at home and the pace isn't as slow because of Spielberg or someone? reshuffling other scenes to add the pointless Gobi Dessert sequence. Basically it isn't just the fact that some scenes are a little shorter or longer its the placement of those scenes. Brian De Palma once got a complaint that the pool hall scene in Carlito's Way was too long. But he said if felt longer because it was missing some shots that would make it more suspenseful. He added those shots showed it to the studio and they thought it was a shorter scene. Spielberg is usually great at creating suspense but sometimes he messes it up. His original cut of Close Encounters got it right. It's the only version that I think really qualifies the film as a classic.".

	onyx:emotionText "The version of Close Encounters that you've seen on TV or video may not be the best version. For years I had watched a TV version of the film that combined parts of the theatrical cut and the special edition and I felt like it was decent but somehow it seemed edited by an amateur. I chalked it up to a 70s approach towards special effects movies that lingered too much on visuals without having a plot. Decades later I finally watched the 1977 version on Blu Ray and realized it really was a much better film.

	schema:reviewBody "Steven Spielberg has made huge popcorn blockbusters that gross more money at the box office i.e. Jaws Raiders of the Lost Ark or Jurassic Park and are more exciting on a visceral level. As he as aged and matured as a director he has also made movies that are more important and will hold a more solid place in the chronicles of film as an artistic document of history i.e. Schindler's List Saving Private Ryan and Munich. For my money his best film will still always be Close Encounters of the Third Kind. This film is Spielberg's humanistic and heartfelt answer to Kubrick's intellectual and cerebral look at man's first contact with life from elsewhere in the universe in his 1968 opus 2001 A Space Odyssey.Close Encounters came early on in Spielberg's career made in 1977 and has all the hallmarks of his later films played just right before he became so selfreferential. Here we have his typical bag of tricks long before they became so typical familial strife coming to terms with something bigger than oneself that challenges the male protagonist's view of the world around him little kids in jeopardy superb build up of suspense fantastic visual effects and a memorable score from John Williams. From the first UFO sightings in Muncie Indiana to the fantastic finale at Devil's Tower in Wyoming this is grand entertainment. Lots of films have emulated this movie to varying degrees of success from Robert Zemeckis' earnest Contact to the shameful scam that was M. Night Shymalan's Signs and even Spielberg himself recently did the dark natured flipside to benevolent alien encounters with his remake of War of the Worlds which makes a fantastic doublefeature with this. However nothing compares to this true original. No other film has made me want to believe in aliens more and I'll never look at a plate of mashed potatoes the same again.".

All characters are credible and you just learn to love 'em. The story lines including family values what is more important in one's life and what the ultimate experience in heaven is are as empathetic as it can get. John Williams scores a masterpiece with a score that touches all the senses in our subconscious and takes us on a journey with the characters but on a journey within ourselves as does the movie and in the end you feel refreshed and ready to take on your troubles and strife.The matter of which version is which is a real conversation piece. As the original theatrical version is VERY rarely seen one suspects based on many reviews that the 1980 re  release is a much better film.

There's nothing here truly worth watching.The script written by Spielberg himself isn't particularly compelling.

	schema:headline " Lost in the spectacle and suspense is a necessary character component";
	schema:reviewBody "After Jaws launched him toward eternal fame in 1975 Steven Spielberg's followup film would tackle a bigger cultural phenomenon UFOs. Close Encounters of the Third Kind was only the beginning of the directorproducer's love affair with the possibility of life on other planets and the first to capture the magnitude of what first contact would be like with aliens in the era of emerging special effects.But let's take a look at a film released just before it in the same year 1977 in fact. A little film called Star Wars. More than 30 years later it might not be fair to compare to the two but the truth is that one film was about producing a bigbudget casheating spectacle while the other was fulfilling the dream of a filmmaker to tell an amazing story in a world never before imagined. Star Wars has heart and Close Encounters has nothing but our attention.It's hard to knock a film made before I was born in an era where I can't appreciate it for what it was at the time but there are a lot of fundamental storytelling principles simply left out of this story that one cannot overlook. Visual effects cinematography and Spielberg's knack for crafting great cinematic moments aren't enough to cover up barely existent character motivation.I've read that Spielberg has regrets about the ending of this film that his main character Roy Richard Dreyfuss wouldn't make the choice he makes in the end. I have to agree  and it's symptomatic of his entire film. Roy is a normal suburban Indiana family man who we don't know much about. Then his truck stalls and he has a close encounter with some kind of UFO. Suddenly he's a madman being haunted by images of a mesa ruining his familial relationships. He's driven as if by some other force to go all the way to Wyoming to figure out what it's all about.Spielberg has us at that last bit of figuring out what it's all about. Roy on the other hand and the mother of a child who was abducted Melinda Dillon are just inexplicably possessed and driven to madness by a vision of a mesa. Roy going crazy and throwing dirt into his kitchen window or randomly sitting in the tub with the shower on for hours keeps our attention but there's little sympathy going on because we really have no idea who he is. The ending scene of the film is much the same way. It's this drawn out scene of VFX spectacle and flashing lights and John Williams music but it's only a climax in that awing sense and in finally delivering what the film has been hiding from us the whole time. It is not a climax of great character realization or at least epiphany that makes sense. It can be completely basic like Luke Skywalker trusting the force believing in his destiny and then becoming victorious but it still has to be there and resonate with us in some way.I certainly recognize some of the brilliant scene work Spielberg does throughout parts of the beginning and the latter half of the film but there's a reason this is not a classic for all generations great movies especially scifi films tell stories that transcend bad special effects or any other inhibitors and Close Encounters is about making a suspenseful film not telling a deeply human story.Steven CVisit my site at httpmoviemusereviews.com".

More than 30 years later it might not be fair to compare to the two but the truth is that one film was about producing a bigbudget casheating spectacle while the other was fulfilling the dream of a filmmaker to tell an amazing story in a world never before imagined. Star Wars has heart and Close Encounters has nothing but our attention.It's hard to knock a film made before I was born in an era where I can't appreciate it for what it was at the time but there are a lot of fundamental storytelling principles simply left out of this story that one cannot overlook. Visual effects cinematography and Spielberg's knack for crafting great cinematic moments aren't enough to cover up barely existent character motivation.I've read that Spielberg has regrets about the ending of this film that his main character Roy Richard Dreyfuss wouldn't make the choice he makes in the end. I have to agree  and it's symptomatic of his entire film. Roy is a normal suburban Indiana family man who we don't know much about. Then his truck stalls and he has a close encounter with some kind of UFO. Suddenly he's a madman being haunted by images of a mesa ruining his familial relationships. He's driven as if by some other force to go all the way to Wyoming to figure out what it's all about.Spielberg has us at that last bit of figuring out what it's all about. Roy on the other hand and the mother of a child who was abducted Melinda Dillon are just inexplicably possessed and driven to madness by a vision of a mesa. Roy going crazy and throwing dirt into his kitchen window or randomly sitting in the tub with the shower on for hours keeps our attention but there's little sympathy going on because we really have no idea who he is. The ending scene of the film is much the same way. It's this drawn out scene of VFX spectacle and flashing lights and John Williams music but it's only a climax in that awing sense and in finally delivering what the film has been hiding from us the whole time. It is not a climax of great character realization or at least epiphany that makes sense. It can be completely basic like Luke Skywalker trusting the force believing in his destiny and then becoming victorious but it still has to be there and resonate with us in some way.I certainly recognize some of the brilliant scene work Spielberg does throughout parts of the beginning and the latter half of the film but there's a reason this is not a classic for all generations great movies especially scifi films tell stories that transcend bad special effects or any other inhibitors and Close Encounters is about making a suspenseful film not telling a deeply human story.Steven CVisit my site at httpmoviemusereviews.com";

	schema:reviewBody "Strange things are happening around the world things that challenge the imagination and open the mind to possibilities almost beyond imagining. Things that only director Steven Spielberg can explain which he does in his monumental epic of man's encounter with alien life Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'  Planes lost in WWII suddenly appear in a Mexican desert a long lost ship turns up in the middle of the Gobi Desert and in Dharmsala Northern India hundreds of people are gathered together singinga short tune' that consists of a mere five notes over and over repeatedly.  When they are asked where they heard this tune the throng as one dramatically thrust their hands into the air and point to the sky.  And indeed in the skies all around the world strange things are happening.And even as these events are transpiring one evening in Muncie Indiana the city is suddenly blacked out by an inexplicable power outage.  Roy Neary Richard Dreyfuss is at home when it hits and he is called in by the power company for which he works then sent out in the darkness to an unfamiliar location.  Lost he sits in his pickup truck at a railroad crossing studying a map when all at once he notices a disturbance' around him. Mailboxes along the side of the road are clanging open and shut by themselves then things inside his truck begin to move subtly at first then erupting and flying about as if caught up in a tornadoand then just as suddenly his truck is engulfed in a blinding light.  He leans out the window for a look but it's too bright and he has to pull back.  Then just as abruptly it all stops the disturbance the light everything.  And he looks out the window again but this time he sees something.  And though he doesn't realize it at the time at that moment his life changed forever.In this wonderfully realized highly imaginative film that is extremely well crafted and presented by Spielberg he takes you along with Roy in the days that follow that strange occurrence in Muncie.  Roy becomes lost in thought drifting unable to focus on anything much to the consternation of his wife Ronnie Teri Garr.  But he can't help himself something an image has begun to form in his mind.  He has no idea what it is or what it means but it becomes an obsession and slowly it begins to take shape  First in a handful of shaving cream then in a plate of mashed potatoes which he piles up and begins to sculpt with his fork while Ronnie and his kids look on in bewilderment.  But he can see it in his mind and it's like a mountain a mountain shaped like a tower.'  And Roy isn't the only one.  Around the world others are being drawn to the same image in their minds and it's a force that compels them pushing them on to find whatever it is a power so strong in cannot be denied or refused.  They know only one thing  Whatever it is it's important and they have no choice but to follow where it may lead.  And it becomes a great adventure one in which they discover what Man has long suspected  We are not alone.Richard Dreyfuss is perfectly cast as Neary a regular guy he could be your neighbor or the man who comes to install your phone and gives a thoroughly convincing introspective performance while creating a character with whom it is easy to relate and through whom you are able to share this unique adventure.  Garr does a good job as well as Ronnie the wife concerned with her husband's sudden and seemingly bizarre behavior someone with whom you can certainly sympathize.  Dillon delivers too as the single mother who suddenly finds herself caught up in these inexplicable and extraordinary events and also turning in a memorable performance is the young Cary Guffey as Barry Jillian's son who makes his own connection with the otherworldly visitors. The supporting cast includes Francois Truffaut Lacombe Bob Balaban Laughlin and Lance Henriksen Robert.  An uplifting positive motion picture Close Encounters of the Third Kind' is thoroughly entertaining as well as thought provoking.  Spielberg draws you in as few filmmakers can with a great story and with characters who are readily accessible and with whom it is easy to identify all of which adds up to an absorbing memorable and enjoyable experience and a perfect example of the real magic of the movies.  I rate this one 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind 1977 is a genuinely silly unfortunately outdated story. Its epic scope made it one of the highestgrossing films of 1977 nominated for two Academy Awards  it lost Best Visual Effects to George Lucas' Star Wars. Now 27 years later it just seems goofy and sickeningly sweet.Spielberg adds a schmaltzy layer to most of his films that set his projects apart from the work of other directors. Arguably the most famous filmmaker since Hitchcock in terms of public recognition Spielberg is responsible for some of the greatest films ever made. Most critics consider E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind  both films that deal with extraterrestrial life  to be some of his finest. For me they are both rather disappointing. And unbearably sugar coated.So what is the primary problem with Close Encounters? Is it a bad movie? No not really. But it's not a particularly memorable one either. Apart from a few socalled classic sequences the boy opening the door the mashed potatoes the alien arrival the movie fails to spark much interest. Most of it  to be completely blunt  is quite stupid. Spielberg admits on the Special Edition DVD that he finds Close Encounters a bit too optimistic and unrealistic. When Spielberg made this movie he believed in extraterrestrial life and was a young man with no children. In retrospect Spielberg claims that the movie is a perfect snapshot of his youth but as an adult he would never make the movie the same way he did in '77.One of the largest flaws is the fact that Roy Neary played by Richard Dreyfuss fresh off the success of Spielberg's 1975 smash hit JAWS abandons his own family wife and children to embark on a crazy search for extraterrestrial life. In a matter of thirty minutes of screen time he has packed up traveled to Wyoming broken past blocked off roads found a new romantic interest and by the end...well...let's just say that the conclusion is rather shameful on Spielberg's behalf. It is quite evident that he had no firm grasp of moral obligation in '77 and Roy's climactic decision is wholly unbelievable.Then again most of the film is like that too.Neary is an electrician who experiences a close encounter one night when a UFO seems to attack his car and then flies off into the distance. Roy soon struggles with confusing mental images that have mysteriously implanted into his brain. Hounded by the smart Dr. Lacombe French director Francois Truffaut in his acting debut Roy soon realizes that the extraterrestrials plan to land on earth  and he wants to be there to see it all.Roy's evolution is too fast  in a matter of what seem to be few days he has turned into a complete loon and because of Spielberg's lack of character arc the sudden change is startling and  worst of all  cold. We lose all sense of empathy for Roy primarily because we do not experience his pain  we see him suffering sure and moping around like a cry baby as his son names him. But this happens so fast that we are left wanting more.The movie's conclusion  which lasts over forty minutes long  is the most exciting part but the abrupt change of pace from being a slowmoving charming family film about close encounters to an oddball chase movie about the government covering up a dangerous conspiracy and hunting down escaped witnesses hinders the lasting impact. Spielberg is constantly trying to find a groove for his movie and never really finds one to stay the course.Then there's the longawaited alien introduction which lasts over twenty minutes long. Most people flocked to the theaters in order to see this sequence  the special effects showcase of the year. This is proven by the fact that Spielberg purposely draws out the scene for such a lengthy period of time. Then audiences savored the FX because they were the best since Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey even the trailer advertisements claimed this was so in order to entice viewers. Now they're outdated by almost all standards of special effects. Watching them for twenty minutes becomes tiring.And of course the annoying musical conversation between man and alien comes next  something else that only makes the film more grating so many years later. It's so '70s! someone once said. I agree. Many great masterpieces were made during the 1970s but most people forget how many downright cheesy forgettable movies were made too.Close Encounters of the Third Kind simply does not hold up after 27 years which is quite unfortunate. The FX are shoddy the ideas are insane the movie is long and boring and the direction and acting are about the only two things that approach greatness. Spielberg shows talent behind the camera here but it is vastly inferior to JAWS. Even John Williams' score fails to leave the same impact as JAWS Jurassic Park etc.Produced during a slew of happy alien movies followed by another slew of mean alien movies during the '80s after Ridley Scott's Alien in 1979 Close Encounters is at times amusing annoying fast long and silly all at once. The nation needed hope during the '70s and they turned to the skies. Spielberg answered their calls with a movie that set records but is now nothing but a forgettable tale. Many will disagree with me when I say that Close Encounters of the Third Kind is an overrated disappointing motion picture with few redeeming qualities. The harsh feedback should be interesting.2.55".

	schema:headline " Strong emotional core that avoids Rockwellesque sentimentality";
	schema:reviewBody "When the whole area suffers a full blackout electrician Roy Neary is called out to service some poles suspected of being down.  Sitting in his truck trying to find directions he is suddenly caught in a bright light and the electric's on his truck fail.  Shortly it passes and he sees a craft pass overhead.  At the same time nearby a woman pursues her young son who has wandered out in search of the lights that have been calling to him.  Both adults are left wanting to know the truth and filled with halfideas and images that haunt them  when Gillian Guiler son is taken this becomes even more important to them.  Meanwhile the military led by investigator Claude Lacombe uncover planes and ships that have been missing for decades and uncover hidden codes and signals in the mysterious crafts.I am currently ploughing my way through Speilberg's Taken on BBC2 so I thought I'd give this classic another view just to remind myself how good Speilberg and aliens can be.  The plot is perfect for any UFO nut  the government are behind everything and know of everything.  The story unfolds really well  the three main stories complimenting each other and giving the film a sense of pace.  The strand with Lacombe following events all round the globe is the least personal and thus least involving but it is enticing us for the climax of the film.  Neary's soul searching maybe does go on a little too long but the emotion in the family situation is intense and his frustration and sense of confusion is very real.  Although the thrid strand has less screen time the abduction of the child is a powerful scene and the emotion is well brought out.The special effects are very good but the glue of the film is the emotional telling.  This is Speilberg doing well  he never really gives into his American Apple Pie style sentimentality and the film keeps moving along and has a real emotional heart to it.  The climax of the movie always sort of messes me up and I find it best not to question it's logic on any level for fear of holes opening up all over it  but it does have a sense of childlike wonder to it which I guess Speilberg was trying to get across.As usual Dreyfuss does well under Speilberg and he is mostly responsible for keeping the emotion in his character realistic without being all syrupy and sickly.  Truffaut is OK but it's impossible to see him as anyone but Francis Truffaut and his character suffers as a result.  Garr and Dillon are both strong female characters for different reasons and the support cast are generally very good including a good handful of the Dreyfuss family.Overall this film never gets me as one of the greatest scifi's of all time but it is certainly a very good film that takes real' people as it's driver and not flashy effect shots.  That Taken' seems to be slipping into Norman Rockwell type mawkishness is good enough reason to revisit CE3K.".

	onyx:emotionText "When the whole area suffers a full blackout electrician Roy Neary is called out to service some poles suspected of being down.  Sitting in his truck trying to find directions he is suddenly caught in a bright light and the electric's on his truck fail.  Shortly it passes and he sees a craft pass overhead.  At the same time nearby a woman pursues her young son who has wandered out in search of the lights that have been calling to him.  Both adults are left wanting to know the truth and filled with halfideas and images that haunt them  when Gillian Guiler son is taken this becomes even more important to them.  Meanwhile the military led by investigator Claude Lacombe uncover planes and ships that have been missing for decades and uncover hidden codes and signals in the mysterious crafts.I am currently ploughing my way through Speilberg's Taken on BBC2 so I thought I'd give this classic another view just to remind myself how good Speilberg and aliens can be.  The plot is perfect for any UFO nut  the government are behind everything and know of everything.  The story unfolds really well  the three main stories complimenting each other and giving the film a sense of pace.  The strand with Lacombe following events all round the globe is the least personal and thus least involving but it is enticing us for the climax of the film.  Neary's soul searching maybe does go on a little too long but the emotion in the family situation is intense and his frustration and sense of confusion is very real.  Although the thrid strand has less screen time the abduction of the child is a powerful scene and the emotion is well brought out.The special effects are very good but the glue of the film is the emotional telling.  This is Speilberg doing well  he never really gives into his American Apple Pie style sentimentality and the film keeps moving along and has a real emotional heart to it.

	schema:reviewBody "Close Encounters Of The Third Kind is a film about aliens landing on earth but instead of descending into the usual lasergun confrontations between humans and aliens this one dares to remain peaceful. It is a film about contact not conflict. It is also a wonderfully thoughtful film and a prime example of compelling storytelling. If there is a weakness with Close Encounters Of The Third Kind it is that the director Steven Spielberg occasionally allows sentimentality to enter into the proceedings but in truth it is a very minor weakness and it doesn't significantly spoil this tremendous movie experience.Several missing aircraft turn up over 30 years after they were reported lost. More baffling still is the fact that they vanished over Florida but have turned up in pristine condition and without pilots in the middle of Mexico. Other weird things happen an aeroplane pilot reports a near collision with a brightly lit spacecraft a Navy warship missing for decades is found in the desert thousands of Indians report a light in the sky which sang to them and across America there are scores of inexplicable UFO sightings. Electrician Roy Neary Richard Dreyfuss is a normal family man who sees one of the UFOs. Soon after he is tormented by a vision apparently implanted in his mind by the aliens. His torment becomes obsession as he tries to figure out the meaning of a hilllike shape that has become embedded in his mind. As his marriage collapses he desperately tries to find answers and is finally gratified when he discovers that the picture in his head is trying to tell him where to go in order to witness an extra terrestrial landing.The fact that Roy Neary is just an everyday guy cast into the most incredible of circumstances gives this film a real human dimension. Roy could represent any one of us  you me your next door neighbour your father whoever. Spielberg tells his story very carefully adding clues and more layers of mystery before actually revealing where the story is heading. It is probably the most controlled and skillfully paced of Spielberg's '70s films. The ending featuring the alien arrival is a technical tourdeforce but it works well on an emotional level too because the viewer has grown to know Roy and has been drawn into his quest for answers. John Williams provides yet another legendary music score  including an iconic fivenote tune which the aliens and humans use to communicate with each other. Close Encounters Of The Third Kind is a classic scifi film as fresh and absorbing now as it was back in 1977.".

	schema:reviewBody "This came close to breaking box office records when it was released in 1977 but for the life of me I have no idea why . I disliked this movie upon seeing on its British television premiere one Christmas  In those days the only time you'd get to see a good movie on television was at Christmas or Easter  in the early 1980s and after seeing it again earlier today I now know why I disliked it  It was directed by Steven Spielberg I'm sorry to be a heretic but has there ever been a more overrated director ? With CLOSE ENCOUNTERS we see all the flaws of Spielberg's work 1  Shot duration  Notice how the camera stays locked onto a scene ? Take for example a scene early in the film where the Neary family make small talk ? There's no inter cutting in the scene as the camera holds still for a couple of minutes . I may be wrong but it might in fact be shorter than a couple of minutes but feels far longer . There doesn't seem to be a single scene in the whole movie that doesn't suffer from this flaw which means the entire film feels painfully longer than it actually is . To give you an idea of how bad this is cast your mind back to the first time you saw the special edition . Didn't you ask yourself if there was any difference between the original and special editions ? I know I did  and compare the special edition of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS to the special edition of ALIENS or the extended releases of LORD OF THE RINGS and you'll realise the original version of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS is a very badly edited movie that suffers from overlong shot duration and most of Spielberg's other movies  especially AI  suffer from this directorial flaw 2  The score  I can understand Spielberg rehiring John Williams after the superb work the composer did with JAWS but if he did such a good job with JAWS why did Spielberg allow him to get away with a mediocre score here ? The alien spaceship theme is memorable but the other music in the film is very irritating because despite being intrusive it fails to convey what the audience should be feeling and eventually sounds like an orchestral dirge . It's also interesting to note that while Hans Zimmer and Howard Shore are head and shoulders above Williams as a composer Spielberg still continues to hire him for every film he directs and I've no idea why . This movie should have ended the partnership 3  Mawkish family sentiment  Being a Spielberg movie means we have to endure American apple pie family scenes and my god it's an endurance . Living in Scotland I fail to connect with these middle American families but I guess if you live in middle America you'd probably fail to recognise these type of characters also . I notice Spielberg's latest release WAR OF THE WORLDS has shoehorned an American family into the narrative when the original novel worked well enough without an American dad and daughter Sorry if you're reading this Steven  I hope this criticism hasn't ruined my career as a Hollywood screenwriter and I realise that it's not entirely your fault since a movie about benign aliens isn't going to impress a lot of critics so lets blame the producers . I mean we see people being abducted by alien spaceships which was the premise of UFO . Despite the overall flaws of that Gerry Anderson series the idea of aliens abducting humans so they can steal their organs is a scary and compelling idea . Unfortunately there's no such horrible goings on here as we're treated to a happy ending . Likewise the government conspiracies of keeping alien contacts secret is very twee after seeing numerous episodes of THE X FILES  in this movie nosy people don't meet a violent death at the hands of government spooks Can you imagine how much better this film might have been if it had been produced as UFO meets THE X FILES ? In fact it'd probably have increased Spielberg's standing amongst a lot of people including myself . But as it stands I think this movie is summed up best as STAR BORES".

At least without giving him a solid intensive course in how to speak English. I don't mean to be so U.S.centric but come on  when one of your main characters has to have his every sentence translated it gets awfully annoying and calls undue attention to itself. A real Special Edition would have shown mercy for the audience and had his entire character edited out.9 Terri Garr  Again nothing against her but this has to be next to Willie Scott in Temple of Doom the worst written female character in any Spielberg film. Ok we're supposed to get that Roy Neary is becoming obsessed moving dangerously away from his family  but how well served is that premise if his wife is such an unfeeling bitch from the getgo? We never see any kind of harmonious rapport between them but neither are any marital problems examined or made clear to us. She's just the cardboard bad guy of the piece and such twodimensionality is cheap in a movie which purports to at least be partly about real people. After all Darth Vader or the Nazis make more enjoyable and less offensive villains than Teri Garr ever could. But her character is only symptomatic of a much bigger problem the film has which leads directly to. . . 8 Who the hell ARE these people?!  And why are they so goshdarned obsessed with UFOs. Why is it so important that Roy Neary get on that spaceship? Why is Melinda Dillon's kid  alone amongst the entire preadolescent population  singled out for abduction by the mysterious aliens? Why are all these seemingly normal people drawn to making replicas of that oogabooga lookin' Devil's Tower? I mean I know there's a place for dramatic ambiguity hey I love 2001! but Steven can you at least throw us a bone? What is it about the particular people who are invited in the words of Truffaut's interpreter to see the alien landing that makes them so special? If Spielberg could have figured out some way to tie these peoples' emotional lives to the urge for extraterrestrial contact as he did in E.T. he might have had something powerful here. In the absence of any such clear link however all we get is a bunch of sound and fury oh and LIGHTS too! which ultimately signify nothing.7 The funereal pace  Steve yo Steve  who told you that you had to be so damn solemn about this whole thing? I guess after Jaws you were trying to prove that you could be SERIOUS and WEIGHTY  and that translated inevitably as SLOW. Things take forever to happen in this movie  probably to cover up for the fact that not much does. 6 The running up the mountain sequence  Ok this is perhaps a crass criticism but am I the only one who noticed that Neary's and Jillian's escape to the top of Devil's Tower against direct Army orders could have made for a great action chase? In a movie I might add which desperately needs some action! A whole tenminute cat and mouse game between Neary and co. and the Army helicopters in pursuit could have been a tourdeforce of style tension and kineticism. You know the kind Spielberg is known for. Instead he just throws the sequence away. They get to the top of the mountain  end of story.5 Mothership sequence lasts far too long with no real payoff  Yeh all those flashing lights were cool and that fivenote musical motif is ominous and haunting  but what of it? Ok so the set pieces are in place for a great sequence but. . . nothing really happens does it? And as with the rest of the movie it takes so long for it not to happen that you're numb about halfway through. This is where all the individual failures of the movie come together to lay one big colossal turd upon the viewer. Since we don't care about or even understand the characters we are cut off from their personal rapture at the landing since the aliens' plans or general purpose is never articulated or even suggested there is no tension generated by wondering what they are going to do when they get here and since the entire movie has been so deliberately slow and ponderous this scene has to be even slower  you know to show how important and climactic it is. What we're left with is a big sound and light show nothing more. Anyone who's ever been to a Pink Floyd concert has seen it all before  and better.Ah I don't have the heart or the interest to continue with this list  anyway you get the idea. Close Encounters so clearly wants to amaze and enrapture us but it forgets that you do that best by engaging us with actual characters making us care about them and then leading them through a fantastic trip or quest where they find some kind of meaning. The movie has the quest part down but neither the meaning nor the engaging characters. It's like it believes that the suggestion of UFOs and other intelligent life in the universe by itself is enough to make us sit up and take notice. Well it isn't. This movie lacks the zip and excitement of Star Wars on the one hand and the philosophicalmetaphysical speculation of 2001 A Space Odyssey on the other. From Spielberg's own canon it is missing the fundamental heart and whimsy of E.T. as well as the strong interconnectedness of the main characters found in Poltergeist.So what does it have? A ranting Frenchman a shrewish wife a ragtag group of inexplicable characters a deathly snail's pace and a cheesy Disneyesque parade of  bright lights and colors Wow!. If that's your idea of a good time then be my guest. You deserve every frame of this movie.".

As with the majority of Steven Spielberg's work an exception being the powerful masterpiece Schindler's List this is a film constructed to appeal to the sensibilities and maturity level of teenage boys.

It is perhaps something to entertain children whom You tell something about the man in the moon. If Spielberg tried to make something to be taken serious he failed totally  in my eyes he will come over it. He had a fantasy and he made a film out of it and interestingly enough many spectators seem to have the same kind of dream in the US not so much in Europe. It is not a sophisticated dream to say the least. Supposed that aliens like the aliens in this film came to land in my garden I would start to laugh and could never end it. How would the aliens react fly away peeved and demoralized? These bloody immature humans! I am sorry that I am so uncultivated! Spielberg has either a childish character or a good sense for business  perhaps both. There is nothing to be criticized for making childish fairy tale movies except if anybody starts to take it serious. The idea of aliens who try to contact with humans developed in this way is not too bad but how its was put into practice is just nonsense. Ah look the aliens how cute they are! Nice people let us shake hands with them! Peace joy and eggcake! I am anxious that aliens will not visit our Earth as long as we make films like that  sorry as long as here are humorless people like me!".

	schema:reviewBody "While I do respect Spielberg's talent in certain but not all of his later films he had a rough start in his directing career.The cinematography is mediocre at best.  It is filmed in a very plain and standard fashion.  The camera rarely moves except for the most basic following takes.  Most of the takes are framed in the same bland manner. The camera is never used in a creative way.  You get the impression Spielberg just set up a camera about head height said 'go' and let the actors do their thing rather than paying attention to how he was portraying his scenes.The acting nothing special.  Emotionless government workers unconvincing family tension weakly portrayed feelings of wonder and amazement.  The motivation of the characters is rarely visible through their expressions or voices.The plot was threadbare and predictable.  I never once felt that the main characters' would fail on their mission or wondered what I would see at the end.  Rarely have I seen a movie take so long to tell so little.  The movie has an annoying habit of constantly pretending as if it were building up to something and leaving you wondering whether anything dramatic will actually happen.  There are few explanations of the events apparently for the failed goal of making the film 'mysterious'.The dialog was stiff and agonizingly cliche.  The scripting bears the shallow markings of the other films which Spielberg helped write.The effect were embarrassing.  Nearly every effect relied on simple red and blue lights.  In some scenes the only effect was a red light shining through a window or a grate.  The UFOs were nothing more than red blue and sometimes white how alien light bulbs dangling on strings.  Sometimes two at a time sometimes in threes.  The grand finale involves lots of these little light bulbs and something that looked like an upside down christmas tree without the tree just the light bulbs.  The large 'spaceship' a painfully obvious model then engages in a tacky game of Simon says with the Earth scientists.  The 'alien' reminds you of an arthritic anorexic muppet. The ending is no different than any other SciFi Bmovie.  Pitifully predictable ending and laughable effects.  For anyone who ignorantly claims that the effects were good for their time I would like to point out that this came out the same year as Star Wars.Overall the film had a feel of pretending to be epic while really telling a superficial and unconvincing tale.  The only reason anyone even remembers this film is the popularity of it's topic frequently the case for Spielberg not for the films ability to impact the viewer.  It was neither visually nor emotionally engaging.  It lacked any signs of creativity or talent.  A failure in every aspect.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mankind encounters numerous UFOS for the first time in this uneven but memorable outing for writer  director Steven Spielberg who'd become a hot property after the major success of Jaws. Here Spielberg personalizes the story by focusing on Roy Neary Richard Dreyfuss a line worker and basic Everyman character who becomes a man obsessed after his own close encounter. He becomes determined to unravel the mystery of an enigma that persists in his life. In the company of a single mother named Jillian Melinda Dillon he travels to Wyoming where a history making event will take place.At approximately two and a quarter hours Spielberg could and should have tightened this a bit and he unfortunately tends to distance us from Roy by making the guy so flaky. When his wife Teri Garr takes their four kids and leaves him he gets over it in record time. His behaviour is overall bizarre and destructive. But one thing that the director successfully conveys is a true sense of wonder. The visual effects are truly impressive and the events are given great scope by having so many people be witness to the extraordinary extraterrestrial activity. John Williams as usual does a very nice job with the music even if his score here isn't as iconic as his best known works. The finale is the absolute best part as it has a genuine otherworldly quality.His character may not always be so relatable but Dreyfuss delivers an effective deeply committed performance. He's surrounded by very fine actors and familiar faces. Placed front and centre is an investigator played by the well regarded filmmaker Francois Truffaut Fahrenheit 451. Bob Balaban Roberts Blossom Lance Henriksen George DiCenzo Josef Sommer Carl Weathers Bill Thurman and John Dennis Johnston all turn up as well. Cary Guffey is adorable as Dillons' son just one of many abductees.While this won't become one of this viewers' personal favorite Spielberg films it IS a very impressive achievement in some ways.Seven out of 10.".

I can't say if that's true or not but as a film in its own right this version of Venus in Furs really is something special. Massimo Dallamano is best known to cult film fans for his incredible Giallo What Have They Done to Solange as well as the less successful followup What Have They Done to Our Daughters although this is a film that is a success for very different reasons. The plot focuses on a nobleman named Severin. He believes that a man is the sum of his childhood traumas and his childhood which involved punishments for voyeurism has lead to him exhibiting some perverted desires. He meets the beautiful Wanda and wants their relationship to exist on a plain where he is dominated by his lover. He begins to ferry her around as her chauffeur and enjoys watching her have sex with other men...but as their relationship continues he begins to question his own motivations.Venus in Furs is an incredibly beautiful film. The cinematography is scintillating and this really helps to bring on the story. Lead actress Laura Antonelli is beautiful also and the director uses her and her character well. Rgis Valle is the main standout on the acting front with his understated yet believable performance as the central perverted character. It's clear that the film relies on atmosphere more than story and the character's decisions are what drive the plot forward more than anything else. The film could easily have been turned into a low rent skin flick in the hands of a less talented director but Dallamano clearly values his subject material and treats it in a respectful manner. The film does manage to justify the lead character's motivations and while masochism may be an alien concept to some people the film should be fairly easy to get on with even for someone with no prior knowledge of it. However this is not a film for everyone and if you like your films plot heavy then Venus in Furs will do nothing for you but for me this is a beautiful and memorable film and tracking down a copy is well worth the effort.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie combined the overrated novel of Leopold SacherVon Masoch who gave us the word 'masochism' the talent of underrated Italian director Massimo Dallamano and the physical charms of European sex diva Laura Antonelli. It has often been confused with the identically titled Jesus Franco movie released about the same time. It is not quite as good as Franco's surreal masterpiece or Dallamano's own followup What Have You Done to Solange? which was easily better than ANY Franco movie. Still it is certainly not a waste of time and it does adhere pretty faithfully perhaps too faithfully to the banal source novel.The movie tells the story of a jaded cad who meets a beautiful young woman Antonelli and falls in love in love with her after spying on her showering masturbating and having sex with strange men. The problem is that she also reminds him of a maid who relentlessly teased him as a adolescent by having sex with the butler while he watched. The woman falls in love with him but her love quickly sours into contempt when he insists that she beat him and openly cheat on him with various men. This is one of those movies like Godard's Contempt or Polanski's Bitter Moon where you want to jump onto the screen and slap the protagonist for scorning the adulation of the kind of beautiful woman who most mortal men will never enjoy but then this guy would probably like that.Antonelli would go on to be one of Italy's biggest female stars after she went from taking all her clothes off in movies like this to taking all her clothes off in more arty bigbudget fare. This movie is fairly unpretentious at least. Antonelli has her hair dyed blonde and is nearly unrecognizable at least until she gets undressed for the first time but her performance though regrettably badly dubbed into English is quite passable. Dallamano also delivers a lot of the superior visual style he would demonstrate in later films like Solange?. Fans of Eurotica who want to venture beyond established auteurs like Franco Jean Rollins Walerian Borowzyx and Jose Larraz would be well advised to check this one out.".

The Leopold von SacherMasoch tale is a difficult one to get across at the best of times but the choice of lead actor is crucial and here Regis Vallee appears to not even understand his own role let alone convey to us his feelings. It's not all his fault the terrible jingly muzak doesn't help and nor does the slow pace. I guess it must have seemed a good idea to have voice over for passages from the book but when they are so inappropriately spoken over glossy clichd scenes it detracts and even for me denigrates the original work itself. Antonelli does her very best ever ready to be seductive loving hateful and even violent but we just don't buy it. Jess Franco's movie of the same name that came out the same year is better but then it's Venus in Furs in name only! For anyone keen enough to try again with the theme I recommend the 1994 film of the same name by Seyforth and Nieuwenhuijs.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1969 Venere in pelliccia could have been Laura Antonelli's big break had it been released in Italy. It would have predated Malizia by four years but due to censorship problems it came out in other European markets only. Finally in 1975 in Italy as well  but in a heavily edited and changed version. More on that later.The lake Tegernsee in Upper Bavaria Writer Severin's leisure is interrupted when the gorgeous model Wanda arrives at his hotel. He can spy on her through the wooden wall between their rooms and quickly falls in love with her. After a rather oldschool advance they get together. Severin then discloses his sexual fantasies In his view a man is defined by his childhood experiences and traumas. For him this means he has to suffer in a relationship both physically and mentally. Wanda on the other hand is used to cheat on her partners but she falls in love with Severin and agrees to play along in his games. This means for her to have sexual encounters with other men enforced and watched by Severin. But after a couple of weeks during their honeymoon in Spain Wanda is sick of it and the relationship spirals downwards into disaster This may sound very plot and dialog driven but it actually isn't. Characterisation and motivations are explained very quickly and mostly through thoughts in voiceovers. It's up to the viewer to interpret the rest although there are instances where this doesn't work out completely. Especially regarding Wanda's actions I was not convinced throughout. At one point she is obviously sick of it all beats Severin down and we see him hurt and bruised. But in the next scene the bruises are gone some time must have passed and they are back in their role playing. Why would she stay with him after that given that she is a nymphomanic selfconfident dream girl and can do whatever she wants? But maybe that's just me who can't see that as said it's up to the respective viewer. A little bit of explanation would have helped especially since this is a rather short film not reaching the 90 minutes mark.Problems like these are easily forgiven as this is a fantastic film to watch. The visuals are incredibly well made every single scene is shot perfectly. The locations are beautiful too especially the lake and meadows of the first half. The score supports the plot perfectly. A fascinating mix of 60ies loungepiano and wild psychedelic flowerpower feel.And oh boy this movie is hot. Incredibly hot. For the time of production it goes surprisingly far but this is still the time when you couldn't show all and had to be creative. The amount of nudity including full frontal and sex scenes performed by Laura Antonelli is absolutely incredible and the director and camera knew what they were doing. Tasteful and absolutely arousing.Speaking of the actors Rgis Valle performs decently and is convincing although he may seem a little bit too passive towards the end of the film. Laura on the other hand puts her heart and soul into her role. She steals most of the scenes with Valle and definitely not just for appearances.Now let's speak of the Italian version of 1975. You can see by the way it was made that the censors have had problems with two things The sadomasochistic aspect of Severin wanting to suffer and some of the sex scenes were too explicit. So they brought in Valle to shoot a background story Severin is in jail and later in court being accused of the murder of that guy Bruno they shot some extra scenes with that actor too. Severin tells the story of his relationship to Wanda and how it could come to the murder. It is terribly boring. The 1969 scenes are arranged differently mixing Bavaria and Spain scenes at random and strongly edited. The voiceovers all the suffering dialogs all gone. It's not true the sex scenes were all cut many are completely intact. Others were shortened for the scene at the lake when Severin satisfies Wanda orally they even added a filter on the right side of the picture in order to cloak what's going on. And the horse sex scene is gone too luckily. The film was redubbed completely and shows Severin as a normal guy who falls for Wanda who is the one to openly cheat on him and cause them to break up which leads to the murder. Anyway the 1975 one is a total waste of time and should you decide to watch it you should do it before you watch the 1969 version.Overall this is a very good film and an absolute mustsee for fans of Laura Antonelli although I didn't like her dyed hair and the strong makeup too much. The sexual liberality is surprising sometimes shocking clearly the film was way ahead of the times. Superb cinematography and soundtrack convincing actors and a controversial subject  but go for the 1969 version please.".

I haven't actually read the book myself although I am very familiar with the seminal song 'Venus in Furs' by The Velvet Underground. So I had a basic idea that this story is about a sadomasochistic relationship between a couple  Severin and the 'whiplash girlchild' Wanda. The song is of course a bona fide untouchable classic the film somewhat less so. Nevertheless it's still a stylish and effective slice of Eurotica.It tells a tale about Wanda Laura Antonelli who is driven by her masochistic husband Severin into sexually dominating him. This entails her being blatantly unfaithful and treating him contemptuously. As time progresses he struggles with his own rules.The movie benefits from the sure hand of director Massimo Dallamano who was responsible for two excellent later films the giallo What Have You Done to Solange? and the giallopoliziotteschi crossover What Have They Done to your Daughters? Venus in Furs isn't in the same bracket as those but then it is a very different type of film. It's pretty playful tonewise for the most part with a cheerful lounge soundtrack. It also looks pretty good with some decent locations while Antonelli is great to look at as well. It is fairly erotic with a lot of classy nudity but be warned it does also contain a pretty notorious moment where we are treated to the sight of a couple of horses banging each other. Its horses for courses if you can excuse the pun.Overall though this is a pretty good erotic drama. Also it should not be confused with the Jesus Franco film of the same name also from 1969 which is similarly impressive but has nothing whatsoever to do with the novel Venus in Furs.".

This film may prove to be of some interest to those who have seen other films named Venus In Furs and it is a pleasant distraction for fans of the gorgeous Laura Antonelli but it would prove to be of little interest to anyone else.";

	schema:reviewBody "I find it interesting that only one or two of the 17 comments here are by women. I'm not sure whether that reflects the proportions of those who saw the movie  or merely those who were generally irritated enough to comment on it. The movie is confused.  SPOILERS  Very early on we hear a ludicrous argument by the protagonist in court one that would provoke laughter in any courtroom yet there are only sober gazes in response. Why? No one would ever say We must smash him crush him etc. unless they wanted to torpedo any sympathy toward their client. The argument is so funny  yet no one laughs. Why? Later we hear the protagonist's partner's assessment that the protagonist is a killer and therefore a desired judicial appointee. The viewer laughs again  we've seen how poor a lawyer the protagonist is though briefly and the idea that the killer nature of the lawyer in a civil suit would somehow cause anyone to predict how she would be as a criminal judge  is again ludicrous. Later we learn that the Governor is so FAR from eliciting hardline responses from his potential judicial nominee that he happily talks about the joy of his five daughters!. So the viewer assumes we are meant to believe that the protagonist and her partner are deluded in their assessments of legal realities  yet we learn nothing further to confirm the protagonist is a poor lawyer and the partner a deluded man. Why? We see some bizarre store in which only a few articles hang on hangers and in which old men sit in the lingerie section watching women who parade in front of him and the mirror. Why are old men allowed to sit there? And again since the protagonist is an extremely thin woman when she asks time and again whether the garment is too small  and hears voices telling her she's fat  we are again distanced from the protagonist's sense of reality. We can't trust what she believes about anything later in the movie. We see a sweet and charming new associate interviewing at the firm  however she speaks negatively about the new lipstick she and the protagonist have bought  and has therefore brought down the enduring deep loathing and profanity of the protagonist. This is rather funny since lipstick color is perhaps one of the least important decisions in anyone's life. So of course it distances us from the hating protagonist  yet why should the movie so want us to be distanced from the protagonist? To see her as a foulmouthed promiscuous person easily roused to hatred by superficialities who has deluded views of reality? A running and repetitious home movie is seen of a woman acting sexually aggressively with a man who wants to read. He finally pushes her away  she falls. I've no idea what this is supposed to represent. E.g. imagine the aggression taking place on the man's part  his wife wants to read he undresses pushes himself upon her  she finally pushes him away he falls. What would we be supposed to be making of that?. The movie can't be asking us to condemn the man since he was rather obviously showing a lack of interest and the woman was the aggressor  yet the protagonist says yet I want up to my father after her mom had fallen. Yes so? Would she not have gone to her mother if the situation were reversed and the father had been the aggressor climbing upon a mother who had shown she wanted no part of sex that night? What are we supposed to make of this?We are informed by one unstable character that the reason for her persistent crimes is sexual thrill. Yet of course all criminals get sexual thrills from their defiance of society and morality. E.g. think of Leopold and Loeb and the use Hitchcock made of this in Rope. Yet somehow the protagonist about to be named a judge! has never heard of this  and dismisses the citations from psychological treatises read by the criminal. Again it distances us from the protagonist  why this ignorance? There's certainly nothing related to gender about this. Ask any teenage delinquent of either gender who has stolen something from a store  or another child  whether it was thrilling  sure. Crimes are almost always thrilling  so? And what are we to make of the protagonist's ignorance about this?We are shown several scenes establishing a sexual relationship between two women the protagonist and the psychiatrist. The protagonist has instigated the relationship. After staying through the night at one point the psychiatrist leaves the protagonist's home to go somewhere. In the last scene between the two women the psychiatrist says she wants a different kind of relationship. In what way? We have no idea. The psychiatrist doesn't offer and the protagonist doesn't ask. The music tells us that this is somehow a bad thing  but why?We see a mother divorced? widowed? never married? We never know  and it would have helped to know who designs and sells wedding dresses  she becomes disappointed that her recent relationship has soured. But we know so little of her that we don't know why the relationship has really ended  the cited argument is far too slight to end a relationship that had so progressed that the mother anticipated a proposal  or why this should be important.There are just bizarre instances of human behavior throughout the movie  i middle aged sisters sharing baths and beds ii kleptomaniacs throwing in garbage cans the object of their theft in full view of the store but only sometimes  we don't know why she kept some articles and tossed others iii absolute rage at having to spend just a few nights in a rural jail despite knowledge of criminal guilt iv middle aged lawyers wearing short skirts who continue to sit with their legs over the chair arm  while engaged in conversation with the partner v prospective appointees to the appellate bench who care more about wearing their lucky suit than anything else in life vi drunken revels by whole office staffs in state office building lobbies vii adolescent girls who slash with a razor at clothing everywhere they find it viii crazed lawyers sending flowers to themselves with nonromantic notes of congratulation so it can be found by their secretaries ix purportedly successful lawyers being able to drop all other matters in an instant to handle their sister's larceny case.The resemblance to real life is zero  but what are we to make of this? We don't know. Incidentally I'm pretty sure that's reporter author editor Bob Woodward playing the Governor  why isn't he or anyone else listed in the credits in the part? Did he wants his name withdrawn?  SPOILERS END  The movie is just a mess. I watched it because several actresses I like Sillas Porizkova Madigan Robins Cross were in it. And the acting was fine particularly a very unusual turn by Frances Fisher but you'll find yourself resisting a fastforward throughout the movie. When the mess ends it's a relief. Better luck to these actresses next time.".

	schema:headline " Not a pornographic film despite the title";
	schema:reviewBody "The title of this film is dangerously misleading because the film might be thought to be pornographic and many people who might otherwise find it interesting will not see it. The contrary is also the case that all the wrong people will want to watch it because they are titillated by the title. They will also react with violent antipathy in the wake of their disappointment. The choice of title seems to have been a deliberate act of provocation. The German title translated is 'Fantasies of a Woman' which is rather milder. The film is a feminist essay and the title is intended to be ironical the 'female perversions' referred to being those imposed upon women by a conventional maledominated society so that for instance being a housewife is regarded as one type of 'female perversion'. It seems somehow natural that the wildly experimental Tilda Swinton would have to be in this film indeed how could she say no? How could such a film be made without her? She seems to be everywhere that people and films are pushing the envelope. As usual she is breathtakingly brilliant. A surprising addition to the cast is Frances Fisher who made such an impact as Angie the redheaded waitress in the diner in the intriguing television series 'Strange Luck' in 19956 at about this same time. Here she does some rather unnerving 'exotic dance' routines which all goes to show something I'm still trying to decide what but whatever the reason for this is she does it very well and one would think she had been a stripper or a showgirl all her life if one did not know she had instead been an actress. Tilda Swinton is electric here as a career gal who is so tense she might snap like a wire stretched too taut. She is about to be made a judge God help us! Many judges are crazy or weird anyway but she would be more so than most as the film makes all too clear. Tilda Swinton portrays an extreme neurotic and 'looking good' is essential to her so she is always doing and redoing her lipstick an insecure woman's last refuge. She is a control freak and insanely superstitious. For instance if she cannot wear her white suit for an interview with the Governor of California not Arnie a fictional one for a judgeship because it is 'lucky' she falls apart. Her kleptomaniac sister sees to it that she cannot wear the suit to the interview. Things are pretty tense like this throughout and there are many fantasy elements to this film written produced and directed by women with women for women. I don't believe this film can really be excused by a 'women searching for their identities' justification and if one approaches it earnestly from that angle which may have been the earnest intention of the makers for all I know it is a failure which verges on parody sometimes and has pretentious aspects. The merits of the film are different and concern the intensity of portrayal and the mysterious depths of character revealed especially of hidden or suppressed motivations. The lesbian aspects of the film are not central but merely a part of the evolving selfrealization of Tilda Swinton's character. I am firmly convinced that men can never understand women and women can never understand men. I first came to realize this in my teens when the novelist Pearl Buck said to me that 'men and women are completely different species and can never hope to understand one another'. That shocked me a lot I never forgot it and it has been repeatedly verified. I have now come to the conclusion that Nature has designed things this way. The imperative of Nature is the propagation of the species. If men and women understood each other that would get in the way of propagation and many fewer babies would be born. Consequently evolutionary pressures have seen to it that this can never happen in order to safeguard the future of the species. That is why men like myself who do not regard women as inferior beings as many of my gender definitely do are so intrigued by 'the mystery of women' and interested to see attempts to make films like this one where women contemplate women and try to understand themselves. It is true that there are no admirable characters on offer here and that they are all pretty horrible people. Nevertheless this film manages to be fascinating although it is understandable that it would cause a lot of contradictory reactions some of them violently opposed to it and some admiring and appreciative. If we want films to punch us in the ribs instead of putting us to sleep this one certainly qualifies. This is what is called 'independent film making' and long may it continue.".

Eve is forced to deal with her problem to keep on track for the judgeship.She also has problems dealing wither her replacement Paulina Porizkova who is considerably more attractive.I am not sure about the fantasy sequences with what I guess to be an Earthwoman.

The difficulty in balancing the two is driving her mad and makes for an excellent film about the role women play in the corporate world.She is not satisfied with the executives in her firm she also picks up Renee Karen Sillas a new psychiatrist in an elevator.Her sister Madelyn Stephens Amy Madigan fulfills her erotic desire by shoplifting. Eve is forced to deal with her problem to keep on track for the judgeship.She also has problems dealing wither her replacement Paulina Porizkova who is considerably more attractive.I am not sure about the fantasy sequences with what I guess to be an Earthwoman. There was enough interesting characters besides her sister  a woman who runs a bridal store Laila Robins a stripper Frances Fisher and an adolescent tomboy named Ed Dale Shuger who is into selfmutilation  that they could have kept it real.";

I'm sure that it may be hard for some women to succeed in the business world but this movie goes about it in a selfpiteous and irritating way.The movie concerns a young lawyer named Eve who is frustrated every minute of every day because she has to fit a certain mold 'play ball' so to speak to compete in order to further her own career. She is in line for a judgeship so with every fiber of femininity she is overly frustrated. So competitive is Eve that when she sees another woman in the ladies room putting on the same color lipstick she throws hers in the trash.Eve seems to use sex as a punctuation mark as affirmation that women like sex too. She has a strange affair with an executive Clancy Brown who likes to perform their sexual circus tricks in his office he seems to get off on being caught. In an elevator one day she picks up a woman and begins a brief affair with her before being told 'I'm not ready for this kind of relationship'.Eve always seems to be cracking up and escapes into sexual fantasies involving bondage at the hands of lip smacking males. She fantasizes that she is being instructed by an older woman to express herself sexually and open up.Another problem Eve has a sister Madelyn who lives in the country and compulsively shoplifts. Madelyn's shoplifting is giving Eve fits because she's afraid that it will cause as scandal and this is not the kind of black eye her career needs. The contrast between Eve and Madelyn are so obvious that you can see it written on the page  Eve is a career woman Madelyn is a student Eve dresses in power suits while Madelyn dresses casually.Tilda Swinton whom I have adored in films like 'The Ballad of Little Jo' and 'Orlando' got on my nerves in the first half hour of the film. She's suppose to be strong willed and always fighting for what she wants but all I saw was a frustrated tinderbox a pouty irritating woman who would be better off if she would just settle down and have a little decaf.".

Unfortunately her favorite slave is falling in love with her. This movie directed by two women is an interesting and inspiring study about fatal love sex dependence seduction and sensibility.There are not many dialogues and much action involved but many silent sequences and erotic moments that are standing on their own. The colors settings and photography are lush and stimulating and sometimes appear like an MTV video clip setting of a 1980's Duran Duran George Michael or Madonna pop song. There are also many literature influences involved. Based on the Leopold von SacherMasoch drama Venus in Furs there are also scenes or names taken from Marquis de Sade's Justine and The 120 days of Sodom and Octave Mirbeau's The garden of delight.As the directors try to give different view points from the domina her maid and two slaves the story is a bit difficult to follow sometimes and in some moments because of the lack of any tempo simply boring. But at least this movie could have been an important influence on Adrian Lyne's box selling hit 9 12 weeks which was produced one year later.For the movie buffs amongst you the dialogue coach of this production was Sandra Nettelbeck later becoming a movie director Drei Sterne. The stylish settings were produced by Xenia Katzenstein who was playing Frau Sommer in a wellknow German TV coffee advert series in the seventies Jacobs Kroenung  a rather conservative role model.

	schema:reviewBody "Verfhrung Die grausame Frau or Seduction The Cruel Woman is a West German Germanlanguage film from 1985 so this one already had its 30th anniversary two years ago. The two writers and directors here are Elfi Mikesch and Monika Treut and I am almost sure that if males had made this film then some selfproclaimed feminists would call it sexist or so but I guess this way it is fine. Anyway the movie runs for 1.5 hours roughly and stars Mechthild Gromann as the main character and this casting decision as well as the one regarding Udo Kier is one of the main reasons why I did not give this film an even lower rating. Gromann that many probably know from Tatort Mnster recently is perfect for the part and honestly and her voice sounded back then already just like it sounds today as if she smokes 50 cigarettes each day. As for the story it is all about sex sadism and masochism even if it is never really graphic and more about verbal expressions really. Nonetheless I fail to see an artistic side really in here but people who like films like this more than I do in general or even those who have a connection to the SM scene may see this movie as something more special and accurate. I guess there must be a reason why this one is still relatively known today several decades later at least here in Germany. Of course it is not famous or anything but it also has not disappeared into complete oblivion. The baity title may also have something to do with that. All in all I guess you can see it as a compliment that there are many other old films out there dealing with similar subjects and that I really disliked those and did not hate this one here as much. But this does not mean I enjoyed the watch or that I would recommend it. Thumbsdown overall here. Watch something else instead as this movie may be cruel but it will most likely not seduce you.".

The tango scene the Ferrari scene the pseudocourtroom scene are excellent.  Pacino is wholly believable and although at first he seems overly gruff and nasty we grow to sympathize with himespecially when that twerp Randy insults him cutthroatstyle at Thanksgiving.  It's obvious that while Slade acts like he doesn't care his repetitious hooha response makes it obvious he does. My favorite line comes during the Ferrari scene I was laughing so hard when the cop left failing to realize Slade is blind. As Slade careens down the street at 70 mph Charlie yells You're going to get us killed! Slade answers Can you blame me? I'm blind! On that note Pacino succeeds marvellously in portraying a blind man.  We never doubt for a second that he does in fact live in total darkness. Yet others like the cop probably the spectators in the restaurant in the tango scene don't realize it.  Ironically enough Slade acts as though he doesn't want to be treated as the proverbial blind man who needs a cane and a guiding arm.  However in the final scene he emerges with a neverbeforeseen pair of dark glasses after which follows the charismatic speech.  I wonder was this to throw them off guard??This movie is a modern classic.  Some find it too long but I enjoyed every minute and didn't acutely notice the 2 12 hrs gone by.  A wonderful film that I recommend to all.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Scent of a Woman is the kind of film that many would think belongs to a bygone era.  While it is frank and contemporary without sugar coating it illustrates the value of character over glitz and how small acts can have long lasting consequences.The film pits two characters who are diametrical opposites.  Al Pacino plays the world weary retired Army Lt. Colonel who through a stupid accident looses his sight and his way of life.  Chris Donnelly is a young prep school kid on a scholarship whose way of life may be coming to an end owing to the acts of richer kids at the exclusive prep school who pull a stupid stunt.The blind Lt. Colonel needs an escort so that he can go to NYC and have a rip roaring time before he makes a fateful decision.  The poor preppy needs to earn a few bucks to travel and is in desperate need of some advice on how to get through his crisis at school.The interplay between the two characters is mind boggling.  It is more riveting than the best Grisham novel.Both characters are asked to make life and death decisions that call for them to reach deep into their inner core.  The right decision is unhappily the tougher decision to make.Two terrific scenes that are not to be missed.  The first is in the New York ballroom where the blind Lt. Colonel teaches the actress Miss Anwar to dance the tango.  It is so smooth and dramatic that even a couch potato is tempted to reach for the Yellow Pages in search of dance lessons. The second and most profound is the speech that Al Pacino makes in defense of Chris Donnelly at the prep school disciplinary hearing.  It has to go down as one of the great orations of all times.The Scent of a Woman is very satisfying on many levels.  The character development is superb dialogue terrific glamorous locations and a story line that requires the characters to show themselves to be the people they really are.  The film has a lot of funny lines and great drama.  This film is almost a 10 out of 10.".

It's nice to know the Academy finally came to their senses and awarded him a Best Actor Oscar for this landmark role.  This is one of his most memorable performances and I'm sure when people think Pacino they think about his portrayal of the blind Colonel Slade.  Hoo ha!The movie itself is not technically great.  Very good but not great.  The plot is quite predictable and driven via patented Hollywood devices.  The courtroom climax contains one of Pacino's most powerful monologues. However its outcome is melodramatic.Personally I thought the whole idea of Pacino being more perceptive of the world than any man or woman with perfect eyesight was farfetched and sometimes more implausible than stunning.  I'm sure there are blind men in the world who ARE in fact very perceptive to what goes on in the world but fewif anywho can recall a whole history triggered simply by the sound of one's voice.  How is he able to tell Chris O'Donnell has pimples?  He's not handicapped by blindness this guy has psychic powers!  He doesn't need sight!  I do have to say that some of the most memorable lines come from this movie. Pacino says some original and wildly funny monologues involving subject matter I cannot discuss in this message.  And of course there's the timeless quote  Hoo ha!  Which later became a Pacino trademark.Scent of a Woman is a somewhat flawed but effective and entertaining film.  It's a mustsee for Pacino fans everywhere!  It's not everyday you can catch a performance this powerful!My score  8 out of 10".

This week on TV were Al Pacino's movies S1m0ne The Merchant of Venice Cruising and finally Scent of a Woman. Of those four movies Scent of a Woman probably isn't the best choice but for Pacino fans answer is definitely positive. And not only for his fans. I just don't understand those people who cannot recognize great acting when they see it. Can you imagine how hard it must be to act a blind man? His performance as Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade is so powerful that this is one my favorite performances I have ever seen along with Brando Nicholson Dean and Depp. Pacino simply blown me off. My favorite scene is in a hotel room when he's trying to kill himself and when he says I'm in a dark here. For a while I didn't breathe at all that effect Pacino left on me. I'm his big fan and the Academy gave him Oscar for this role but I dare to say that he should have won the golden statue long before that Godfather Serpico Dog Day Afternoon Scarface .... But good things comes to those who wait. I don't even won't to talk about the movie only about Pacino. I'll only say that I didn't like the last scene when everybody applause him in the school so American happy ending. Also lots of people aren't familiar with the fact that this is remake of Dino Risi's Profumo di donna which is excellent film. And also I will explain my grade of the whole movie. 8 for the movie 10 for the Pacino  910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Movies often have lines that become part of our culture.  The line from this one is hooha! I don't know why for sure Pacino says that.  He does though and it's great.  Whenever I ask anyone about this movie those who have seen it 99 of the time answer with a hearty hooha!As for the performances  Pacino I dare say gave his best performance ever.  It was also the riskiest.  We're not supposed to like him but we do. We can tell he doesn't think that Charlie is a moron.  We can tell that he likes him in fact as a son.   It strikes us as sad though.  We can sense that this man has always been lonely.  But then he lost his sight because of his mere stupidity and fondness for booze.  He became even more lonely and sarcastic.  Mean in fact but funny.  I was laughing my ss off when he drove the Fararri yelling hooha! at every turn.  Charlie has what Slade attempted to achieve his whole life integrity.  As he says Slade did stuff just to do stuff.  Charlie does it because he means it.  Chris O'Donnell as Charlie Simms is good.  Albeit a bit understated.  As I said before Pacino is masterful.  The actor who played the rich boy George is funny too.When I first saw this I thought the ending ruined it.  It seems a bit trite and cliche ridden but the final speech is good. Brilliant in fact.  Pacino's character comes to his own realizations and ultimately his climax in the speech.  Brilliantly acted by Pacino I may add.  He takes several stupid lines in the speech and makes them forceful.This is a good movie.  Great really.  It ranks on my top 10 of all time.  Number 1 being Saving Private Ryan.  If you want to see what Academy voters are swayed by see Unforgiven.  If you want to see a masterful movie that contains one of what I consider to be the best performance by an actor everthe real best being Charles Sheen in Major League 2see Scent of a Woman.   The script does have its errors.  The time duration is often unclear.  Slade tells Charlie that his gun is not a gun but a weapon or a piece.  Seconds later Charlie asks for it and Slade refers to it as his gun.  Just little stuff like that are the reasons why the Academy didn't give it their vote.  I don't care about that though.  See it.  Remember the two best syllables in the world are....oh wait.  I can't print that.  If you've seen the movie you get the joke.".

It strikes us as sad though.  We can sense that this man has always been lonely.  But then he lost his sight because of his mere stupidity and fondness for booze.  He became even more lonely and sarcastic.  Mean in fact but funny.  I was laughing my ss off when he drove the Fararri yelling hooha! at every turn.  Charlie has what Slade attempted to achieve his whole life integrity.  As he says Slade did stuff just to do stuff.  Charlie does it because he means it.  Chris O'Donnell as Charlie Simms is good.  Albeit a bit understated.  As I said before Pacino is masterful.  The actor who played the rich boy George is funny too.When I first saw this I thought the ending ruined it.  It seems a bit trite and cliche ridden but the final speech is good. Brilliant in fact.  Pacino's character comes to his own realizations and ultimately his climax in the speech.  Brilliantly acted by Pacino I may add.  He takes several stupid lines in the speech and makes them forceful.This is a good movie.  Great really.  It ranks on my top 10 of all time.  Number 1 being Saving Private Ryan.  If you want to see what Academy voters are swayed by see Unforgiven.  If you want to see a masterful movie that contains one of what I consider to be the best performance by an actor everthe real best being Charles Sheen in Major League 2see Scent of a Woman.   The script does have its errors.  The time duration is often unclear.  Slade tells Charlie that his gun is not a gun but a weapon or a piece.  Seconds later Charlie asks for it and Slade refers to it as his gun.  Just little stuff like that are the reasons why the Academy didn't give it their vote.  I don't care about that though.  See it.  Remember the two best syllables in the world are....oh wait.  I can't print that.  If you've seen the movie you get the joke.";

He is terrific!  Every time we watch the movie we spend at least two days going Oorah! I like prep school movies and I have two movies where Chris O'Donnell Circle of Friends Charlie Simms is in a prep school. I guess it goes with his type. I like the part of  Charlie who is doing the best he can with the weekend he has to face. One of the most difficult things for people is to feel is useless. That is how Lt. Co. Frank Slade feels. He also has a cynicism about life that in a sense is funny because of its irony.  He meets Charlie and has everything planned out.  The Colonel has extremely good taste.  Meeting young Charlie who is in a very difficult situation the outspoken Lt. Col. found a reason to live and to feel useful again even enjoying the smell of the perfume of Charlie's teacher.  I did not see the 1974 Italian film PROFUMO DI DONNA but would love to see the performance of the late Vittorio Gassman one of the most well known actor of the Italian Theater and Cinema.

The film entertains your darkest notions and tops your depth of grief and then somehow elevates you to find hope amidst our consciously blind existence. At first I had a problem with Pacino's performance. I thought Al was definitely overacting.  He's playing a man who is consciously suicidal a man suffering the loss of his dependence. He seems preoccupied in fulfilling a sexual desire but what he really yearns for is the acceptance of a woman now that he's been injured.  However even beyond his glorified apparition of woman what he presently needs is someone anyone who will listen. He needs someone he can bark orders at like in the past. Some babe in the woods he can bemuse and corrupt amidst the decadence of Freak Show Central' his personal nickname for New York City. In this contrived situation he finds life again and with these considerations Pacino's bravura performance is forgivable.  Pacino ironically switches energies with O'Donnell's character being the Colonel's high energy defuses Charlie's depressed low energy.  The Colonel is psyched for his weekend's desperate romp A little tour of pleasures' he says. Given this distinction in performances Charlie should have been the suicidal one the defeated one because O'Donnell walks around this film like a deer caught in the headlights and there really isn't anything inspiring or motivating about him. It would have been an awesome acting exercise to have a young actor go against Pacino and realistically attempt to change his character's suicidal mission granted his whole outlook on life yet what we have is a quick resolution that is very intense but not very intellectual. In the end this movie somehow manages to conduct all it's emotional payoffs thus rendering the viewer at the mercy of what may seem bathos. Many have criticized the film as negotiating Hollywood Plot A with Plot B or C. However the Colonel realizes his biggest failure in life was in his interpersonal relationships. He learns that sometimes having friends can be a stronger and more important bond than family a point well taken. Sometimes when a film comes together after all the pre and post production the result can be undeniably charming and this film manages to soar above its foundations those manifested in the most basic of premises of melodrama. Scent Of A Woman' does inevitably work and it's a very heartwarming film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Al Pacino is undoubtedly one of the finest actors of his generation and his performance as retired Army Colonel Frank Slade in Scent of a Woman finally earned him his long overdue Academy Award for Best Actor however in my opinion it is far from his greatest role though it is certainly a memorable one.My problem with this film is that for me it's an example of Pacino's dominating screen presence preserving a movie that would otherwise have been mediocre at best. The basic premise of the film is fairly dull. A young prep student called Charlie takes a job aiding a blind lonely retired colonel over thanksgiving weekend. The weekend turns out to be considerably more eventful than he anticipated with the Colonel taking him first class to New York for one final bourbonsoaked hurrah before intending to end his own life. When they head out to the city I expected there to be some good and perhaps amusing scenes where these two completely mismatched characters one bitter world weary and cynical the other innocent and naive really get at one another and to be fair there are a couple of excellent moments. The tango scene in which the Colonel dances with a complete stranger in a classy New York restaurant is truly captivating and another where he and Charlie test drive a Ferrari around some Brooklyn backstreets is also entertaining however if a blind man were to drive and drift a Ferrari at over 70mph in real life there would likely be some very severe consequences. These moments are few and far between however and with a runtime of 2  hours the film does begin to drag.Al Pacino has faced up to and bettered some outstanding actors in his career think Johnny Depp in Donnie Brasco or even De Niro in Heat but casting him alongside Chris O'Donnell was a big mistake. It's the cinematic equivalent of feeding a lamb to a TRex. Pacino simply devours him in every scene he literally walks all over him. O'Donnell's non performance as Charlie is just flat bland empty clichd and tepid to the point of irritation and pretty much undermines everything good Pacino brings to the film.Visually Pacino does an excellent impression of a blind man to the point where many characters in the film understandably and believably don't even notice. Admittedly he isn't given the best script to work with but he still manages a couple of excellent monologues most notably in one of the final scenes of the film which brings me on to another failing of this picture.The subplot which involves Charlie facing expulsion as a result of refusing to grass up his peers over a particularly spectacular prank involving the headmaster just seemed trivial and insignificant and completely undeserving of Pacino's glorious tirade about integrity and 'facing the music' which should have really been a highlight of the film. You watch this scene admire it and realise there was far too little of it in the preceding 2 hours.In conclusion had Pacino not received the Oscar for Best Actor at some point in his career it would have been a travesty and an outrage it's just unfortunate he received it for this role. He was so much better as Michael Corleone in The Godfather or as excon antihero Carlito Brigante in Carlito's Way or even as the overbearing scenery chewing crack snorting gangster icon Tony Montana in Scarface. These are the roles I remember him by and more importantly they are vastly superior pieces of Cinema. Scent of a Woman by comparison is a mess. The plot is uninspired and boring the script weak the characters stereotypical. I've often felt that Al Pacino has an uncanny ability to make poor films average and average films brilliant and the former is certainly the case here. The film Two for the Money is another great example of this. A film about sports bettors with Matthew McConaughey that would have certainly been diabolical and possibly never even released were it not for Pacino's participation. His somehow makes it watchable... perhaps even.......interesting. Those who are new to his work I envy you please watch the other great films I mentioned above before resorting to this. Disregard the Oscar. His ability to draw you into a scene and light up a film or even just one casual line of dialogue makes him the greatest actor of his generation and consequently my favourite actor of all time. It's for this reason ONLY that I give this film the 6 stars that it probably doesn't deserve.".

And all these meanings are concentrated in the tango Al Pacino dances in the restaurant.Al Pacino shows once again an incredible talent and I believe his secret are his eyes. This movie he acts with his eyes...quite amazing because eyesight is exactly what his character has recently lost. Scent of a woman is one of those movies one has to see several times not because it's too complicated but because it seems to be new and different every time you see it.

And all these meanings are concentrated in the tango Al Pacino dances in the restaurant.Al Pacino shows once again an incredible talent and I believe his secret are his eyes. This movie he acts with his eyes...quite amazing because eyesight is exactly what his character has recently lost. Scent of a woman is one of those movies one has to see several times not because it's too complicated but because it seems to be new and different every time you see it. Once at the age of 18 and then again after 5 years...It's the same plot the same story but something seems different new...and that is YOU!

	schema:reviewBody "This is an extraordinary film. I can't think of enough adjectives to praise Scent of a Woman. You can watch it with high expectations and you will feel pleased.SPOILERS Col. Lt. Slade is a man angered with life and has infinite bitterness towards his pyyiscal disability. The man knows how to give himself a good life but it seems that it just doesn't fills him. In an exquisite way Lt. Slade reveals that his passions are traveling Tango women and cars. It may sound superficial that life's about that in fact it's not but Frank Slade displays a feeling of tenderness and liberation when doing them. The Tango scene speaks by itself and it's one of the most wonderful moments in the film. Also check the Porsche action sequence. It's fun and intense.His depression is very deep that he even considers committing suicide.After Lt. Slade meets Charlie his point of view towards life changes as the young man teaches him that life is worth to live even if you are physically disabled. Lt. Slade realizes that he is a man blessed with many gifts and he can see through people's feelings. In my opinion the best moment in the movie is the powerful scene where Lt. Slade comes in defense of Charlie against Bert's directors and the honorable table. Obviously Charlie is a victim of bourgeoisy unfairness is against him because he's a loyal honest and humild school mate. Mr. Trask and George Willis's father take advantage on the naive student and when Mr. Trask is about to recommend Charlie's expel from Bert Frank Slade enters aided by Manny and sits next to Charlie as his tutor. Slade gives a powerful intense and moving speech. When Mr. Trask yells to Lt. Slade that he's out of order Frank starts his memorable speech. Let me refresh your mind by writing itOut of order I show you out of order. You don't know what out of order is Mr. Trask. I'd show you but I'm too old I'm too tired I'm too fin' blind. If I were the man I was five years ago I'd take a FLAMETHROWER to this place! Out of order? Who the hell do you think you're talking' to? I've been around you know? There was a time I could see. And I have seen. Boys like these younger than these their arms torn out their legs ripped off. But there isn't nothing' like the sight of an amputated spirit. There is no prosthetic for that. You think you're merely sending this splendid foot soldier back home to Oregon with his tail between his legs but I say you are... executin' his soul! And why? Because he's not a Bairdman. Bairdmen. You hurt this boy you're gonna be Baird bums the lot of ya. And Harry Jimmy Trent wherever you are out there FYOU TOO!  IMDB  Memorable quotes.You need to watch the movie to feel the whole experience. Scent of a Woman is a movie that masterfully displays drama comedy sadness and makes you feel positive towards everything for a moment.ACTING. Pacino's performance is WONDERFUL. No wonder why he got the Oscar for Best Actor. He has the charm to make the audience laugh cry and really feel his pain. You either love or get annoyed by his character at the beginning as he's very sarcastic cold and mean sometimes. As the movie evolves you totally feel symphaty for him and you can't help but ask for more of the character's personality. A delightful performance period. Hands down to Mr. Al Pacino.Chris O'Donnell Charlie Simms gives also a wonderful performance. The young man looked mature for a role of this difficulty. His innocence and decision were totally believed. When his dramatic abilities are required he delivers perfectly. When he has to deliver a decent performance when Mr. Pacino steals the scene because of his huge acting capacity he delivers and never gets opaqued or dulled by Pacino. In my opinion it's O'Donnell's best role to date.DIRECTION. Martin Brest's direction is very stylish with the Hollywoodesque technique but it has a feeling. The movie looks beautiful and it's cinematography makes the movie look attractive for the eye. Brest knew how to create a powerful drama with the necessary touch of comedy. Scent of a Woman is an easy watch that will active all your emotions. Great job Mr. Brest. Check out also Gabrielle Anwar's brief appearance. She surely enlightens the screen with her extreme beautiness. Wow what a woman. The ending will also leave you satisfied.This is one of those movies that you can watch 1000 times and you don't get bored. There's always something new to find on it.1010. An important and sometimes overlooked by the Gen. X film. Recommended FOR EVERYONE. It will move and provoke on you an internal reflexion of how you act towards life and it's burdens.".

	schema:reviewBody "Al Pacino won his first and only Oscar for Scent of a Woman in 1992 and he deserved it far more for Glengarry Glen Ross released the same year. Although he yells a lot in both pictures the overthetop screaming was justified by the character in Glengarry Glen Ross in Scent of a Woman his Lt. Col. Frank Slade comes across as a gross caricature sort of like Robert De Niro in This Boy's Life. Both terrific actors made some mistakes in the 1990s This was Pacino's largest in my opinion.First of all like De Niro in This Boy's Life Pacino's fake accent is constantly varying from scene to scene. He's supposed to be from the south and has that southern twang in his voice and pronounces words lak dis y'know. In fact he says y'know a lot in this movie. The problem is that the accent comes and goes sometimes Pacino's got it downpat and at other times we feel as though he's playing another character. The end speech in particular careens from Louisiana speech patterns to New York City y'know.The movie starts off fair enough but it's so sappy and oozing with cheesy sentimentality that by its finale I felt as if I'd seen enough and wanted to turn on something else.Because basically I've seen something just like this before. It was called Dead Poet's Society and it followed the same formula and carried the same sentimental goo as Scent of a Woman. Chris O'Donnell delivers the best performance of his career and outstages Pacino. But the movie  clocking in at nearly three hours!  really falls apart in the last act.Yes it's nice to feel refreshed by cinema. Frank Capra got away with this endless times  just look at the final speech by Jimmy Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. The problem is that it's out of place awkward and unrealistic in Scent of a Woman a movie that otherwise proposes it is very real. Pacino rants for about five minutes straight as if he's reading his lines from Witty Catchphrases People Will Remember for Years to Come For Dummies. Overall Martin Brest has made far better character pieces just look at Midnight Run and that was a comedy! and although Scent of a Woman is NOT a horrible film by any means I do believe it's quite overrated and too sappy at times to be altogether memorable. It's okay and worth watching now and again if it happens to come on television but don't expect the masterpiece some people have made it out to be. It's really quite average and follows a formula that's been followed far too many times over the years.".

	schema:reviewBody "Maybe you can detect the downward sloping trend in the reviews from 1999 to 2007 here. A few years later people will view this piece as a relic and open it only for academic purposes. That's right this is a classic but time can easily wash away the cheap spirit embodied in this film. Therefore I might be the last one to comment on this outdated film here. But to pay my respect for the wealth and effort that was squandered on this production and my laborious 2 hours straining myself from smashing the screen I'll write something anyway.The reviews render Al Pacino's acting worthy of an Oscar but I have to argue otherwise. Sometimes the stress of the sentence sounds strange like he suddenly remembered the next word is the point he roared so he jumped abruptly from a chastising to a explosion leaving the audience perplexed and uncomfortable. Someone says he is passionate sometimes he forget the boundary between Lt. Slade and himself. That is a highest accolade invented for actors because only the VIP class actors can walk in and out characters' inner world with ease. And I won't deny the sense of sincerity that sometimes drifts out casually Al Pacino should take the credit for this but he doesn't deserve the Oscar because his talent is blocked by a braggart screenplay writer. The movie was a product of 1992 we should respect flaws in the technique of camera angles and editing the way we respect a old man for walking slow and saying gibberish. But the huge paragraphs in the scene in which Lt. Slade contradicts the headmaster about his decision to expel Charles I think the whole paragraph about right path wrong path can be spared because it sounds like an old men's annoyingly didactic speech. His fury suits perfectly in the plot but the effect will definitely be more stunning if he didn't go on and on for 1500 words. I wanted to cry in my palm because according to a ancient movie theory it you take out all the fantastic lines the movie is still tasty then it's a good movie. A Scent of Woman without all the breathdrawing lines is more barren than a dessert which is why it deserves to be left in the dust and wither in time.I'll recommend this movie to my uncle who is going through a midlife crisis but definitely not to anyone who still believe in hope love future and dream. If you are a shallow person that has faith in lust and pompous bragging and empty shell of wealth this is the movie to go. I believe it's your fault if all your family hate you and seem embarrassed when you show up Lieutenant and I believe it's your fault if you are trying to shoot yourself knowing it will jeopardize a sweet boy that pity you and take care of you all the way. The police will doubt if Charles murder you for your wealth and that still can't explain why you has a grasp on so huge amount of money to enjoy such luxury. A good man would give the money to the Rosie's for they live such a humble life with you sitting on hundreds of bucks and Mrs Rosie still firmly believe that you are sweet in the heart. Shame on you Lieutenant.It's not a good movie for Saturday night's fun but it's a great movie to gnaw your fingers at because it's your weekend assignment and scratch a few words about and get it over with. I must mourn for my precious 2 hours for I could have watched Schindler's List with it.".

Adapted from the Giovanni Arpino novel and 1974 Italian film Profumo Di Donna this overlong picture directed by Martin Brest is unrestrained overreaching and hamfisted. Filmed in autumnal colors brackish reds and browns it doesn't even look good.

'Alexander I'm going to rest in a park.' 'No wait I take the camera we can shoot a scene there!' That said the film lacks for me the frivolous and intuitive from the original Godard though it does strikes gold once in a while. The affair of only two seconds was beautiful. At the staircase there is an intimate conversation between a man and Anita G.. Next second while having dinner a woman asks the man 'Is she a redhead?' The most interesting thing about the film is that it pauses history for a second this is the life of an ordinary but adventurous woman in the sixties in Germany.If this film wasn't so excessively experimental and there were 'regular' ideas intertwined it could have been a classic. Now for me is it is just one of the Godardlike films. It's a shame that Alexandra would only play in one other film also from her brother while her pleasure in acting is evident here. Alexander got a career as a critic started a film school Ulm Institut fr Filmgestaltung and made A LOT of shorts. At this point Kluge is in his eighties. I rate it 710 mostly for courage.".

As I watched it my first thoughts were that it had a lot of the French New Wave or was just heavily part of the European Art CinemaI wasn't very sure when it had been made. The documentary broken approach seemed interesting and completely burst that bubble of the typical cinematic experience were as a viewer I was almost pushed to be part of.I really appreciate what films like this did to filmmaking starting with the very purpose and artistic value of films and their contraposition to the common entertaining commercial product films soon became after they were introduced into an industry. These films were necessary to go back to the origins of film and its true essence. Many films of this era abandoned the classic ways of making films and that's how they got closer to the truth of film. I think movies like The Bicycle Thief 1948 or The 400 Blows 1959 or Kes 1969 achieved to capture life in a very honest way. But I feel soon this achievement got corrupted became a concept and lost its way and awareness. It led to films that broke all the typical rules of filmmaking and spoke of certain societies and real sociopolitical situations but in my humble opinion I believe they failed to capture life despite of how spontaneous and realistic they tried to be. They created rules from their own antirules approach and I feel there was just too much ego and ambition in all this. I believe film is not really about characters stories music places situations dialogs etc. not even about all of them put together as it is so commonly believed. Film is much more than that. It captures times and truth in an unique way. And comparing this very idealistic definition of films and the influence of European Art Cinemaand every other movement of that timeis where my opinion about Yesterday Girl comes from. I feel since this kind of films are very authorial Alexander Kluge just like maybe Ingmar Bergman when he made Summer with Monika 1953 was struggling between what the audience expected and what his inspiration was telling him to do especially considering this was his first fulllength feature. But despite of all this which is only ideas that have little to do with the film itself I think this film is a mustsee because if you somehow manage to see beyond a few devised attractions here and there like the shots of people talking to the camera sudden cuts alternate editing with images that contrast against the emotional narrative of the main scene that in my opinion still have a sort of beauty and awareness you might see a substantial beauty and poetry especially towards the final scenes.

	schema:reviewBody "Though rarely shown and hardly available this is one of the most remarkable films about the concentration camp of Auschwitz ever made. Shot as early as 1947 partly on location at the camp even featuring former inmates among the actors and using original languages OSTATNI ETAP is a kind of firsthand reenactment and gives for the most part a very convincing gripping and realistic portrait of what life was like at the camp. The film is well directed and stagedoccasionally using dramatic compositions and lightning to a striking effect. It is actually no less impressive as any thencontemporary film by Roberto Rossellini and other of the neorealist school. The whole nowfamiliar iconography of Holocaust cinema is already there probably for the first time copied in hundreds of movies to come. Andrzej Munk's more stylized PASAZERKA is clearly influenced by the OSTATNI ETAP as both films are set in a woman's camp and feature sadistic female SSguards.However due to historical circumstances there are many aspects in the film which have later been more or less dropped or at least received lesser attention. The role of women as both victims and perpetrators is at the center of the film and large space is given to show the cruelty of Kapos block elders women with a black triangle implicating Antisocials and criminals and SScollaborating and egoistic inmates as well. The concept of primary Jewish suffering at Auschwitz now at the core of the narrative is deemphasized and the Jews are presented as just one of many peoples f.e. Russians and French are shown interned and murdered there. There is a more explicit focus on communists and Poles being victimized as well as a clear sympathy for Stalin and the Red Army which also shows in the rather unconvincing melodramatic final scene when the heroine facing execution holds an accusing speech against their henchmen while soviet planes appear in the sky like in a lastminuterescue. A final title claims the highly exaggerated number of 4.5 Mio victims at Auschwitz a number that was corrected only decades later in 1990.The portrayal of the SS is effective but pretty clichridden and the stereotypes presented here have become stock ingredients of the genre  such as fat ugly stupid and vain Nazis with scars on their faces and Iron Crosses on their fancy uniforms cynically dancing waltzes and drinking champagne in their free time stiff cigarettesmokingwehavewaystomakeyoutalktortureofficers and IlseKochlike SS women.Overall OSTATNI ETAP is both an exceptionable document and a wellmade film which beats SCHINDLER'S LIST by far. It is a pity that this film has become so obscure.".

The film is well directed and stagedoccasionally using dramatic compositions and lightning to a striking effect. It is actually no less impressive as any thencontemporary film by Roberto Rossellini and other of the neorealist school. The whole nowfamiliar iconography of Holocaust cinema is already there probably for the first time copied in hundreds of movies to come. Andrzej Munk's more stylized PASAZERKA is clearly influenced by the OSTATNI ETAP as both films are set in a woman's camp and feature sadistic female SSguards.However due to historical circumstances there are many aspects in the film which have later been more or less dropped or at least received lesser attention. The role of women as both victims and perpetrators is at the center of the film and large space is given to show the cruelty of Kapos block elders women with a black triangle implicating Antisocials and criminals and SScollaborating and egoistic inmates as well. The concept of primary Jewish suffering at Auschwitz now at the core of the narrative is deemphasized and the Jews are presented as just one of many peoples f.e. Russians and French are shown interned and murdered there. There is a more explicit focus on communists and Poles being victimized as well as a clear sympathy for Stalin and the Red Army which also shows in the rather unconvincing melodramatic final scene when the heroine facing execution holds an accusing speech against their henchmen while soviet planes appear in the sky like in a lastminuterescue. A final title claims the highly exaggerated number of 4.5 Mio victims at Auschwitz a number that was corrected only decades later in 1990.The portrayal of the SS is effective but pretty clichridden and the stereotypes presented here have become stock ingredients of the genre  such as fat ugly stupid and vain Nazis with scars on their faces and Iron Crosses on their fancy uniforms cynically dancing waltzes and drinking champagne in their free time stiff cigarettesmokingwehavewaystomakeyoutalktortureofficers and IlseKochlike SS women.Overall OSTATNI ETAP is both an exceptionable document and a wellmade film which beats SCHINDLER'S LIST by far. It is a pity that this film has become so obscure.";

	schema:reviewBody "Propaganda??? Think about it  who was calling the shots in Poland in 1947? And which country of all WW2 principals was portrayed in the most positive light in this film? The fact is that this script had to be approved by the Russians and had it been critical of them in any way it would have never seen the light of the projector. Pretty convenient considering the hundreds of thousands of Polish women that were raped by the Red Army or the way Stalin let Germany level Warsaw! Propaganda aside this is a remarkable and historic film! First off it was released just 2 years after the end of the war. Secondly it was the first film  in the world  to address the atrocities of the Holocaust head on! Yes 1946's The Stranger did give it a nod but this film went full frontal atrocity! Thirdly this was the first film to be shot within AuschwitzBirkenau. Finally the film was directed by Wanada Jakubowska who was in fact interned at AB and the script depicts her experiences. Suffice to say this is a very genuine film  almost to the point of being a docudrama.The one big problem with this classic is that totally suffers from 1947 Western European technology  especially the camera and film  which coupled with the Neorealistic direction makes the shots overly dark and difficult to perceive. Additionally I found the story arc a little hard to follow at times that may have been a cultural thing?.In the end this 1947 Polish film started Cinema's discussion about AB  the icon of the holocaust  and that is a fact that does not get it's proper! 810 with a big bonus for historical significance".

People from all over Europe including France Hungry Poland and Russia were caged and killed at this camp in Nazioccupied Poland. Some were imprisoned for political reasons and others for simply being a Pole or a Jew. The story is based on the actual experiences of the director Wanda Jakubowska and was shot on location just three years after the war which gives it a feeling of practically being a recreation of the atrocity.Although we get to know a group of women one that stands out is Martha Weiss. She is a young Jewish woman that is spared the same fate as her family because she ends up working for the Germans as an interpreter. Those who have a skill useful to the Nazis are spared leaving the camp though the smoke of the chimney. Martha and her friends make the best of their grim situation and are courageous in their acts of defiance.With their survival threatened not all of the prisoners are quite so noble. Some of the prisoners work as assistants for the guards to help them do their dirty work. In return they get a few extra comforts and their own deaths are delayed.The Last Stage captures the feeling of what it was like at Auschwitz which is at times surreal with an orchestra of prisoners playing classical music out in the open air while the other prisoners are abused and degraded by their captors.Ostatni Etap is a classic Polish movie in Poland it is in the top 20 of all time box office hits of Polish cinema. The Last Stage depicts a disturbing part of history but it is better to know what really happened during World War II than it is to pretend it never did which is why I would recommend everyone to watch this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Palermo oder Wolfsburg or also known as Palermo or Wolfsburg is a coproduction between West Germany and Switzerland from 1980 so this film had its 35th anniversary last year. The dominant languages fittingly with the title in here are German and Italian. The director is Werner Schroeter and he is also one of the writers here. Lead actor is Nicola Zarbo and he never played in a film again before or after that and while I did not think he was too bad I also was not really impressed by his performance. This film runs for almost three hours and with such a runtime it is definitely among Schroeter's longest works not just among his more known films. And with such a duration there is of course also a big supporting cast. It includes names you may have seen in Rainer Werner Fassbinder films such as Harry Baer and Magdalena Montezuma but also Otto Sander for example who received a German Film Award nomination for his performance here. He mostly shines in the last third of a film which is basically a courtroom drama with Sander playing the main prosecutor. This is also where the film is at its most serious as it is about murder. The first 2 hours were no light material at all but I still felt they were lighter than the last hour. After having watched some of Schroeter's stuff I must say that this is definitely among those films from the director that I liked more than most others. But the number of stars I gave it still tells you that I am not really a fan of the director. I just felt this one here was less theatrical and actually worked on many occasions as a work you can watch at a screen. Other works from the filmmakers basically feel like theater recordings and make little sense from a cinematic perspective. But this one here still drags a lot and has many lengths and the acting never felt really too convincing to me unfortunately. At under two hours I may have given it a thumbsup but at this actual runtime I really cannot recommend the watch. Watch something else instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "Autobahnraser or Porta Westfalica or A2 Racer is a German movie from 2004 so this one is already way over a decade old. The director is Canadian filmmaker Michael Keusch who is mostly known for his collaborations with Steven Seagal. The script of this one is by Kulzer and Weigel and looking at their bodies of work it is not too surprising this did not turn out very well. It is slightly shorter than 1.5 hours and the cast here features a whole lot of actors and actresses who were mostly known back then and are now for their performances in German daily soaps. So yeah you basically know what to expect now. And those cast members who did not appear in the likes of GZSZ or Marienhof do not have exactly great films in their body of work. And as the title is not exactly promising either sounds like a Manta movie I was expecting the worst of the worst. It did not turn out that bad really. The film's strength is that it does not really take itself seriously at all and as a consequence some scenes were actually fun to watch. Yes the cast wasn't good but at least the girls were kinda hot and this actually applies to almost all of those with more than 10 seconds screen time. The story about car racing and the incompetent police trying to stop them is of course as absurd as it gets and it is never working out from an authentic perspective. But like I already wrote in the title this one can actually be appreciated as a bit of a guilty pleasure movie. But honestly this is the only approach really and that's why I give it a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

Its above all a praise for a life close to nature and enchants with its depiction of the nomad family life and breathtaking landscape views. The story of the heroine of the movie a little girl is quietly told in a manner that Hollywood productions have almost exclusively unlearned. Movies don't need to cost 80 million dollars to be a lasting memory. This little movie has an odd strength to it probably drawing it from the old Mongolian culture it themes to depict.".

	onyx:emotionText "Its a beautiful quiet movie about the scenic Mongolian nomad life. It very well befits as but not only as a children movie as it doesn't contain any violence or sexual hints. Its above all a praise for a life close to nature and enchants with its depiction of the nomad family life and breathtaking landscape views. The story of the heroine of the movie a little girl is quietly told in a manner that Hollywood productions have almost exclusively unlearned. Movies don't need to cost 80 million dollars to be a lasting memory. This little movie has an odd strength to it probably drawing it from the old Mongolian culture it themes to depict.";

There are no actors in this film just simple people.

Very probably nonprofessional actors how could the small children act?. I saw it twice in two days and on second viewing one can appreciate its subtle construction how small details pave the way for slight plot twists more going on under the surface than it originally looks like. For instance the reason behind the father's reluctance the mixing of dogs and wolves the people's economic conditions the potentially dangerous presence of vultures in the background and so on all of which get to play a part at some later stage.

	schema:headline " Spending time with the Batchuluun family in the Mongolian steppes  a simple endearing family story";
	schema:reviewBody "Off the bat the film title Cave of the Yellow Dog is poetically applied it could have been The Adventures of Nansal and Zochor. You'd notice the little dog that 5year old Nansal found is not exactly 'yellow' hence need not wonder about its color  simply be an 'invisible guest' to the everyday living of the Batchuluun family of five. Namely our little 'heroine' Nansal Nansa eldest of the three children mama Buyandulam Daramdadi and papa Urjindorj little sister Nansalmaa and baby brother Batbayar. There's also an older woman Teserenpuntsag Ish reminds me of grandmothers with sage and 'caringness' her ageold wisdom felt as she told Nansal 'folkloric' tale and asked her if one can have one grain of rice rest on the top of a needle. Impossible little Nansal answered her own curiosity about life after death. That's how hard it is to become another person in the next life. It may seem the film is at its own leisurely pace absolutely no hurriedness. Everything so naturally happens. There is dramatic moments of suspense brief as it may will there be danger? When I heard Mama's heeded words to Nansal about her little brother I can see she's quite distraught and distracted by Zochor being left behind. What an ominouslooking flock of vultures.It's fascinating to watch the ritual of moving which is a Batchuluun family activity where everyone chips in. Filmmaker Byambasuren Davaa The Story of the Weeping Camel 2003 artistically shows us the integral process of dismantling the portable tent yurt they live in spoke by spoke. Looking at the tent site from above focus of the square slot insertions in the top ring for each rod  it takes concerted effort indeed. The girls rolling up the rugs packing off the little furnishings they have even active little brother has a hand. Mama also has to round up the herd of sheep. Papa yoking up the cows to five carts full. Writerdirectorcoproducer Davaa knows how to convey the nuance and cultural sensibility of the Mongolian nomads. Little things and family togetherness sure mean a lot.The editing language how the story was told optimizes closeup's naturelandscape scenes vs. dialog. The implied plot progression with words heard off screen followed with facial expressions on screen especially Nansal's emotions be it joyous or sad come through lucid. For example the ending treatment  you'll like the way it's presented. It's not obvious  what we saw moments ago and what we get to see eventually suggests what may have happened in between  the outcome of things yet so fluidly natural. An effective cinematic storytelling. Heartwarmingly' we'd smile at how cleverly the expectation fulfills. Filmmaker Davaa is gentle and creative full of patience and humanity. She has a charming way of delivering an endearing human story putting us at ease to accept the flow of things. This may not have the high drama of Hollywood's The Yearling 1946 the fun and solid companionship in My Dog Skip 1999 the collie star in Lassie Come Home 1943 or the child acting genius in the Swedish My Life as A Dog 1985  but the premise of a little girl and her beloved stray dog somehow has an intrinsic mix of family values and parentchild lovingness irresistible. The film is of German production hence the title aka  Hhle Des Gelben Hundes Die.112606 'Previous life. Next life. Present life.' Hints of philosophical drifts in Davaa's second 'docunarrative'  Still thinking about Cave of the Yellow Dog. At one point in the film What were you in your previous life? little Nansa asked her mother. Remembering the beginning scene we see from afar Nansa and her father burying their family dog. She is inquisitive and papa said to her that 'no one really dies just become something else in the next life.' We're fortunate to be able to follow along with Mongolian filmmaker Davaa and her film crew from Germany capturing the family spirits of this fivemember unit. They are not actors but truly the Batchuluun family. Cinematography is remarkably beautiful delivering the Mongolian grassy plains and vast sky. Reminds me of Close to Eden 1991 a Russian film also with Mongolian landscapes and nomadic life. And the music is wonderful at times have strains liken to Philip Glass as in filmmaker Godfrey Reggio's cinematic montage pieces. There's a peacefulness to it all  seeing nature and humanity so integrally coexist. If you'd like to spend some 'quiet' nonstressful time at the movies try Cave of the Yellow Dog. Check out the official site 'caveoftheyellowdog.co.uk'. From 'Director's Notes' we can gain insights to how Davaa came to create her film and the thoughts behind the stories she wanted to tell including the tale about the fable of the Yellow Dog.".

Even though Cave stands well enough on its own.The Cave of the Yellow Dog centers around Nansaa A little girl in a family of five nomadic Mongolians. Her father is a sheepherder while mom helps with the care taking and feeding of her her family. One day Nasaa comes across a small dog hiding in a cave which she quickly names Zachor means Spot and takes home altough her father is most displeased about it From then on the film centers mostly on the three children in the household and Nasaa's relationship with the dog. This film is pure simplicity in terms of plot and is mostly about people living in a basic if not normal world. Far from the everyday ratrace of most people's lives.Those of you who are fans of gorgeous lush cinematography won't be able to find fault with this film. The landscapes portrayed in Cave are of the Mongolian Highlands and are amongst't the most beautiful ever captured on film. I was constantly blown away by each successive shot. I really can't go on enough about how awesome the cinematography and landscapes are in this film. It really has to be seen to be believed.The acting is especially well done especially when you factor in the extremely Young age of the three children in the film god knows how long it took for the director to capture many of the scenes. Mom and Dad as the film never really lets you know their names also did great jobs in portraying the lives of nomadic peoples.The score is almost as beautiful as the landscapes featured in the film. The music features traditional sounding oriental flute and violin music which sounds very melancholy and heartwrenching.My only reservation is that I think a lot of people will find this movie boring as it has a very slow pacing. And now there is no action or explosions in it. The film actually looks very low budget as if it was shot on a digital camera. But why it may lack a huge budget this movie has a big heart as well as a very relevant political message.So if a good family story is your kind of thing or your interested in seeing achingly beautifully filmed shots of the Mongolian Highlands or if you just want to bring home a movie your significant other won't complain about absolutely see this film.My rating 9 out of 10 Worth Owning.".

I too remember life with 15 milking cows in the East of France and even earlier on minding grazing cows somewhere in open spaces as if time would stand still and i'd never grow older than 10! But here the story is seen from the young children eyes their loving and concerned parents and older people who seem beyond concerns and more resigned to the grandeur of life. Some comments speak much of symbols in this story. Yes they are but only if you want to take notice of them else let yourself go with the gentle tide of the story. It needn't to be too intellectual unless you enjoy the extra. I hate giving points but feel that most would enjoy this work. MB".

I've met noone else who's seen AND liked it a lot. That's why I'm so glad that the lowest rating for this film on this website is 7! It's about a little girl who lives with her family in Mongolia and how she finds a little dog in a cave. She names the dog Zachor. Unfortunately her father has heard tales about dogs that work with wolves to kill cattle and sheep. When he finds the dog he thinks that he works with the wolves. Nansaa the girl must do something! Sure there's not much excitement or anything like that but it's not particularly boring! I recommend this to people who would like something new subtitled films it's in Mongolian with English subtitles dogs and not too much humour there's a little but not much which I like. Enjoy!  P.S With all the new normal kid's films such as Open Season and Barnyard and even the Shrek films with basically the same storyline it's nice especially for people who enjoy calm films to have something like this! I wish they would make these kind of films more often!".

	schema:headline " Sublime return to Cinema and the Source";
	schema:reviewBody "Its not often I am moved enough to write a review for a film. This is not because of a hardening of my heart but rather because of the lack of 'cinema' and 'film' out there and the subsequent plethora of 'movies' and pernicious 'entertainment'. Of around the 250 'films' I see a year maybe one catches my heart and tugs it to such an extent that I cannot but write something about it. Accordingly it is not I who is doing the writing but the film that writes through me through its power its force and its essence. The Cave of the Yellow Dog is one such film and having just been mesmerized by it I cannot believe it has taken me almost a decade to discover it but from the other perspective I am overjoyed that I did finally discover it. Perhaps the reason for my discovering it is that I am in Kazakhstan teaching and learning! and was curious as to the cinema around the region. The other reason is that I am in the energy capital of the country Atyrau a washed out hole of a town infected by the rape of the earth and the desire for greed by ignorant oilers and the like most of whom come from the west North America and Europe and are the complete and utter antithesis of the Mongol family being filmed in TCOTYD. In spite of Atyrau's status as the new Houston it is possibly the most cobbled together hotchpotch of buildings and roads that I have ever seen in a life thus far of travelling and thinking. 'Spiritually unsympathetic' to coin a phrase by the Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky comes to mind and that's being generous. The earth around the city is to all intents and purposes dead. Nothing grows on it it is after all a huge building site primed for construction as the barrels roll out and the money rolls in. The water table has been plumbed to the point of surface saturation whenever it rains the great Ural river has been infected with the disease of man which he calls progress. It is all rather bleak and grim. And then you have the great glass castles of the oilers themselves monuments to the fallen Tengizchevron Mobil Exxon and all the others ignorant violators who have clubbed together to do this place over. The pain of the earth is tangible it's blood being sucked by these vampiric monstrous outsiders all rationalising their actions in terms of bringing 'civilization' to an otherwise 'backward' place. And so to The Cave of the Yellow Dog which reminded me  reminded the great self that is not 'me' but the great souled 'I' that man is a perversion of the human man is the human minus the humus the soil the land. I need not go into statistics of soil degradation of deforestation of the deliberate desiccation of the soul for the sake of pathetic costumes and pitiful masks for the sake of cosmetic appearances. What The Cave of the Yellow Dog has as a film is depth but it is a lightness of depth not a profundity and it is this lightness that drew me in from the very first scene. The simplicity of it all yet within a deep complexity of a family eking out a harmonious existence on the great Mongolian steppe is overwhelming.There is within this film a searing soulfulness these are not children being exploited for making movies these are simply children being filmed as they are. It is wonderful. The animals as they are the family as they are the land as it is. Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful! And that is to say nothing of all the beautiful things that are made by loving hands and not machines their clothes their furniture their yurt itself.The family play themselves the word play itself being operative here as there is no work no toil or coarse superfluous labour as we have come to know it in the west but simply endeavor and the play of song and dance. Everything done here is essential and of the essence. The music too is quite sublime and will draw you out of your manufactured identity into a wider more spacious self that you perhaps never knew was there.Words cannot do it justice. It is a film like the great steppe itself which cannot be explicated but can only be lived or at the next best watched with an open heart. It made me think of how people have lost their way as human beings living with the earth and not against it and how in the west the handmade has also become a commodity like time and space like being and experience itself. The photography and the land is exquisite the patience of the people involved evident but then patience is no big deal when you are one with the land. In Atyrau sadly there is no oneness little harmony left as the new younger and more seduced civilization enters the sauna of need greed and fear all the while sucking the life right out of them.Civilization is a slaughterhouse but here on the great steppe in the cave of the yellow dog civilization is nothing and it is this nothingness if attended to sensitively and intelligently enough that will bend your soul back into shape.".

And that is to say nothing of all the beautiful things that are made by loving hands and not machines their clothes their furniture their yurt itself.The family play themselves the word play itself being operative here as there is no work no toil or coarse superfluous labour as we have come to know it in the west but simply endeavor and the play of song and dance. Everything done here is essential and of the essence. The music too is quite sublime and will draw you out of your manufactured identity into a wider more spacious self that you perhaps never knew was there.Words cannot do it justice. It is a film like the great steppe itself which cannot be explicated but can only be lived or at the next best watched with an open heart. It made me think of how people have lost their way as human beings living with the earth and not against it and how in the west the handmade has also become a commodity like time and space like being and experience itself. The photography and the land is exquisite the patience of the people involved evident but then patience is no big deal when you are one with the land. In Atyrau sadly there is no oneness little harmony left as the new younger and more seduced civilization enters the sauna of need greed and fear all the while sucking the life right out of them.Civilization is a slaughterhouse but here on the great steppe in the cave of the yellow dog civilization is nothing and it is this nothingness if attended to sensitively and intelligently enough that will bend your soul back into shape.";

The little girl Nansal found a little puppy in a cave when taking the dungs for her mother. Nansal and the little dog soon built a strong relationship with each other. She took the dog home but her father didn't allow her to have a pet. The family was suffering some economic hardship as the wolves attacked and killed some sheep of their herd. The father worried that the dog as being found in wildlife would have been born with some wolf trail and would decimate their livestock later. The twist of the story happens when the family moved to another region and left the little puppy behind. However the father soon realized that his youngest son crawled out of the basket in the cart and left behind. He rushed back to the old place to find him. After being left behind the little boy was unaware of the danger of vultures and approached them. However the little puppy did come and scared the vultures away and hereby saved the little boy on time. After that the father finally accepted to allow Nansal to keep her puppy with her. The movie is a documentarystyle movie with full of details of typical lifestyle of nomadic people. The old Mongolian folk songs were sung by the mother as lullaby for her son. The folk story that were told about The cave of the yellow dog by the grandma to Nansal. The nomadic living style of Mongolian people as the move to better place for their livestock. The traditional belief of nomadic Mongolian as they keep a little Buddha statue in their tent and worship it as well as their ancestors. People can also find in the movie the economic hardship of traditional Mongolian people who have to choose between sticking with the traditional nomadic living style or moving to city.".

The movie about a small Nomad family who live in the grasslands of the Mongolia.The story follows when a young girl named Nansal returns home for summer vacation. Soon she finds a strayed puppy in a nearby cave and brings it to the home. But her father is against the idea of keeping it around. So Nansal hides it from him and provides required facilities. As the dog was raised in wild it finds hard to fit in the human surrounded condition. After some incident the dog will be left behind by the family but his heroic effort makes them to realize his worthiness.It was a dog movie but the dog did not exactly ruled the movie. They showed it just as a small part of the story which comes now and then more like a reality. Actually it was told from the girl Nansal's perspective. Her little adventure in the summer. There was a story where an old woman tell to the girl it was really good a meaningful proverb.The family in the movie was a real nomad family. They were not professional actors but they gave the best performance. We can't call it a performance they just executed what they do in their daily life but this time in front of a camera that's all. And the director and his crew captured it in the camera very well. They also captured the beauty of grassland of Mongolia.Due to this movie I came to know a little about the people called Nomad. It was more like a documentary than a regular cinema. The place where the movie shot was breathtaking. A perfect art movie from all the angles. A good relief movie and gives a watching satisfaction if you are fading up watching plenty of commercial movies.".

Unlike her previous film THE STORY OF THE WEEPING CAMEL which was also a very good movie THE CAVE OF THE YELLOW DOG is polished and professional. And most importantly it tells a story in a compact and focused manner. It is a tale of a bucolic nomadic lifestyle in Mongolia during a time of change. This idyllic live is challenged by neighbors moving to cities windmill power plastic bowls a motorcycle photographs and other trappings of the industrial world. They are confronted by the borders of modern nations which have little tolerance for nomads who cross borders where once there were none. They are even prompted to vote by an impersonal loudspeaker mounted on a speeding jeep. The irony is that nation building is a constant threat to nomads around the globe. The family is well aware of the benefits of civilization. Their oldest daughter goes to school and their youngest daughter would like to live in the city because People can pee inside their houses there. Byamsuren Davaa says that one purpose of the film is to present a way of life on film. She certainly does this and in a rather objective manner mostly because industrial film making does not fit the agrarian schedule of daily reincarnation. Best line from the film You're not supposed to play with Buddha. The Left Elbow Index considers seven variables in filmacting production sets artistry plot film continuity dialogue and character developmenton a scale of 10 for very good 5 for average and 1 for needs help. The artistry plot and film continuity are above average with good use of color scenes balancing nature and change over time and the seamless use of animals. Dried dung sheep and survival skills are part and parcel of agrarian wealthare are so presented. Lighting and camera angles are excellent. Acting is average the family is a real family not professionals as are the production sets most of which are exterior. The dialogue is functional keeping in mind that the wind and the music are part of the dialogue. Character development is not a factor except that the audience gets to know each character better as the film progresses. The characters however do not change. The LEI average rating for this film is 7.14 raised to 9.0 when equated with the IMDb scale. While watching THE STORY OF THE WEEPING CAMEL one wonders how things would work out for the the little camel one is not part of the action. However with THE CAVE OF THE YELLOW DOG Byambasuren Daava seduces one into wanting to be more than a dispassionate observer. Perhaps an old poem by Ogden Nash explains In Tibet there lives a llamaHas no papa had no mama Has no wife and had not chillen' Has not use for penicillinIf you watch the Philco mama I think I'll go and join that llama. I don't think I want to go to Tibet but Mongolia would sure be a nice change. I highly recommend this film.".

As they get to know each other Pauline is pulled into the fantasy world of Royals and scandal that Juliet has written. However as the two fall deeper and deeper into the characters they have created their relationship becomes ever more intense and their parents step in to separate them. Facing a geographical separation the two plot to take revenge on the adults who seek to split them up.At the time of release I remember thinking that this was an unusual film for Peter Jackson to have made given that he was more of a gore merchant as I was aware. Watching it not it still feels like a strange film for him to have done but now it is for different reasons  that is that he has made one of the biggest trilogies of all time etc! Ignoring his previous and later works this is a great little film and it acts as a showcase for Jackson as it shows he can be imaginative and also sensitive when required  certainly coming to this on the back of Bad Taste I had low expectations on how he would do it but he did it. The true story is adapted from Pauline's diaries and while it must be impossible to see how they saw the world the fantastic fantasy worlds we see here are better than the probably quite repressed world they had in mind  from this film I saw the two as being more insular and self defensive than the elaborate fantasy scenes would suggest. The film did well to depict their relationship immediately having worrying signs but being the sort of thing kids do  and the killing hinted at by the film's opening is brutal and unpleasant  we are never allowed to side with these people.The direction is great creating normal domestic scenes with the same confidence as it uses full size plastic models within the fantasy sequences.The cast also do well in particular two great lead performances. Naturally Winslet gets all the kudos for her character is ott at times and spins wildly emotionally  a hard role to carry off but she does it very well and showed great promise even if she looks too old for the role in my opinion. Lynskey impressed me much more as her role was more controlled and was delivered a lot better by an actress who looked like a shy embarrassed little girl. Both were great for different reasons and they are a big reason this film works so well. Support from the likes of O'Connor Kent and a few other well known faces are also good but there is never a question about their role within the film  they are supporting the main two.Overall I imagine this film will get a audience boost now as lots of LOTR fans go trawling through Jackson's back catalogue to see what else he has done boy are they in for a surprise! and I'm glad more people will see it.The direction is great and it delivers a complex story in a colourful and fanciful manner but the main praise should go to the two lead actresses who deal with really difficult characters and do so in a confident and believable manner  even if the material means that many of us will want to find what they did abhorrent.".

Look closer and stay with it and you will see what amazing things she has done with this character. It's a remarkable achievement unlike any other acting I've seen in any film of this kind which is to say a true life crime thriller.Heavenly Creatures is and I say this with absolute certainty the best true life crime thriller ever made. Because instead of trying to be a classic thriller with cheap tricks Peter Jackson gets you inside the twisted minds of these two girls and whether you hate them in the end or not you completely understand why these girls did what they did...and that it was doomed from the start.

	schema:reviewBody "Heavenly Creatures based on a true story is written directed and produced by Peter Jackson of Lord of the Rings fame. This film captivates catching you off guard.Jackson sets the audience up in the beginning by focusing on the tranquil predictable world of 1950s Christchurch New Zealand. Before long the peaceful world is exposed for what it is repressed. Two teenage girls Juliet and Pauline befriend each other at a private girl's school. They find out they have a lot in common. Sharing a world of fantasy and make believe leads to an insane reversal. Their fantasy world becomes their reality.Once they cross that line their otherwise superficial conventional world is turned upside down. All the repressed dysfunction surfaces. Ironically Juliet's mother is a psychotherapist who doesn't see her daughter's neurosis becoming a psychosis. Eventually Pauline and Juliet go off the deep end drowning in their make believe world. By the end of the film they do the unthinkable.Kate Winslet is superb as Juliet. The rest of the cast is outstanding. Peter Jackson does a masterful job of capturing the essence of 1950s religious repression in New Zealand. It could be England or American in the 1950s. Heavenly Creatures will appeal to anyone who enjoys psychological twists and turns.".

No doubt we'll be seeing some polemical do gooder film maker with zero talent making a movie where anyone who gets murdered by the gay girls probably asked for it because they were a rabid homophobeThat was my abstract opinion of HEAVENLY CREATURES when it was released to some critical acclaim ten years ago  with much of the acclaim going to writerdirector Peter Jackson whose previous gory horror comedies I'd enjoyed . Yeah the guy was talented I remember thinking  but in a liberal climate we'd no doubt be hearing a myriad of excuses via the film for the girls crime and it was this attitude that stopped me from watching the movie until it was broadcast on BBC 2 tonight I was fooling myself if I thought Jackson was going to make a bad movie . This is another piece of heart melting  intelligent movie making from the Kiwi genius and I'm sorry for doubting Jackson for a moment . What Jackson has done has made a movie where it's difficult to think of the two protagonists as  lesbian lovers   Pauline Reiper and Juliet Hulme are two teenagers who love each other full stop and the screenplay doesn't once make any excuses for anything that happens  we're not supposed to feel disgusted by their relationship  we're not supposed to feel that they are victims in any way and we're not supposed to feel that a conservative  homophobic society is to blame for what happened . Jackson deserves much credit for making an amoral movie without an agenda  it's up to the free thinking audience to make up their own minds on the case. Take for example the murder of Mrs Rieper who kindly takes the girls to a tea house then for a walk in the countryside . It's difficult not to notice that if she'd been an uncaring cruel dragon with absolutely no conscience the girls wouldn't have had an opportunity to murder the woman .It's also a movie that captures the spirit of being a teenager in love . When for whatever reason you have to say goodbye to your first love it's the end of the world . You'll do anything to stop it happening  ANYTHING  and you won't forgive anyone who caused it to happen . Fantasy sequences similar to the ones shown here are also a staple diet of the teenage mind and if you disagree with me you're either being dishonest or you're under twelve years of age . Believe me this movie reminded me  perhaps a little too much  of my own teenage angst Jackson also deserves credit for his casting Melanie Lynskey and  A then totally unknown  Kate Winslet as Pauline and Juliet . Neither of them can be described as strikingly attractive and you do have to worry who we would have got instead if this was a Hollywood production  but they play the star crossed lovers with absolute conviction  as indeed do the rest of the castHEAVENLY CREATURES is beautiful  haunting  thoughtful and incisive . With the exception of Martin Scorsese I rate Peter Jackson as the world's greatest living film maker and HEAVENLY CREATURES is the first movie that showed the true greatness Jackson is capable of".

	schema:reviewBody "Heavenly Creatures is a stunning film surprisingly coming from the goremaestro Peter Jackson. It follows two girls Juliet Hulme and Pauline Rieper who start talking to each other in a P.E. lesson. Over the days their friendship progresses until they become good friends and spend time with each other discussing actors listening to records and playing dressup. The acting from Winslet and Lynesky is absolutely terrific from the beginning Lynesky playing a moody young girl and Winslet playing the happy inventive young lady who is a dab hand a clay modelling and painting. As the film continues Juliet and Pauline's friendship becomes more and more stronger as they begin to spend practically every minute of every day with each other. Sarah Peirse give a fine performance as Hilda Hulme Pauline's mother who by this time in the movie has become more than a little concerned about the bonding of the two girls. The ending is unforgettable. It is brutal and shocking however the minutes leading up to the end are beautiful complete with a spinetingling haunting choir music soundtrack. This movie is a beautiful moving experience which should leave you tearful by the end.".

	onyx:emotionText "Heavenly Creatures is a stunning film surprisingly coming from the goremaestro Peter Jackson. It follows two girls Juliet Hulme and Pauline Rieper who start talking to each other in a P.E. lesson. Over the days their friendship progresses until they become good friends and spend time with each other discussing actors listening to records and playing dressup. The acting from Winslet and Lynesky is absolutely terrific from the beginning Lynesky playing a moody young girl and Winslet playing the happy inventive young lady who is a dab hand a clay modelling and painting. As the film continues Juliet and Pauline's friendship becomes more and more stronger as they begin to spend practically every minute of every day with each other. Sarah Peirse give a fine performance as Hilda Hulme Pauline's mother who by this time in the movie has become more than a little concerned about the bonding of the two girls. The ending is unforgettable. It is brutal and shocking however the minutes leading up to the end are beautiful complete with a spinetingling haunting choir music soundtrack. This movie is a beautiful moving experience which should leave you tearful by the end.";

	schema:reviewBody "The next time I write in this diary mother will be dead. How odd yet how pleasing.This early writing and directorial effort by Peter Jackson and starring a young Kate Winslet is an odd one to pin down. Especially odd since it's based on a true story which I didn't know until the film was over. It's about the intense friendship between two girls living in New Zealand. One is sullen and withdrawn the other a wealthy transplant from England is outspoken and draws attention with her very presence. Both are intelligent imaginative and share a similar casual darkness in their personalities.As their friendship blooms and grows more and more intense their parents this being set in the 50's begin to suspect an unwholesome aspect to their relationship. When the threat of separation arises the girls swiftly and resolutely settle on a grisly solution to their forced division murder.The movie shifts in tone often from a sort of coming of age story to the fanciful world of the girls' imaginations to their rage and heartbreak at their parents. Kate Winslet was pretty good but you could tell that she was still finding her way and confidence as an actress. I found the plot to be rather dull at the start but it grew more interesting as it continued on to a rather abrupt ending.Interesting is a good word to use describe Heavenly Creatures as a whole. It held my attention even during the parts where I was a little less than entertained. It's unflinchingly dark in some aspects and innocent and childlike in others. I'd recommend it to most just based on the fact that it's something different and there's merit in that. It's wellmade also I just found my interest fluctuating too often to give the movie a higher score.And how does Kate Winslet look almost exactly the same today as she did in 1994? Now that's a topic that's interesting enough to make a movie about.".

Earlier in 1994 I had taken a chance on a movie called Momma's Boys with Jamie Lee Curtis and it was absolutely horrible.  But this time the whim paid off.The movie is edited and directed with a touch of genius.  The opening scene is a preview of the climatic scene in the movie.  Good Fellas also used this technique to create more suspense when the scene is repeated in the normal flow of the movie.  The direction and editing mirrors the mental state of the two girls that nearly become one. Kate Winslet's tremendous emotional depth appeals to those of us who are afflicted with the malady of hypersensitivity. The other girl whose name I forget does rather disappear in her presence but Winslet's character is supposed to be the driving force and Winslet like all great actors makes the performers around her shine. Because Winslet is the leader of the pair it is disturbing when the lesser character leads them to do the most unthinkable  matricide. The victim of the girls is the most tolerant of the four parents which creates even more shock when the crime occurs. I was more unhappy with Winslet's character's parents because they don't seem to give a whit for their girl.  Feeling alone the two girls find family with each other but they take it a bit too deep.  They escape into a shared fantasy land where all people become moving golden statues. It is very surreal with Mario Lanza being the golden hero of the dream world and Orson Welles the claymation villain.This movie took me to another world in a different way than I had previously experienced with any movie. I loved it.  To me it is a 10 out of 10.".

Cowriterdirector Peter Jackson of The Lord of the Rings fame crafts a highlydisturbing motion picture about two teenaged girls Melanie Lynsky and Kate Winslet in the role that put her on the cinematic map who have a highly potent relationship that is based on their love for literature and their love for a conjuredup fantasy world. Their intense friendship borders the line on a deep obsession as the two become inseparable. Their parents believe that lesbianism may be part of the partnership. Even though there are dream sequences and undertones aplenty to point to that the girls' friendship does not go that way in real life. As others try to separate them for good the girls come up with a devious plan to destroy who they feel is the major culprit Lynskey's mother played by Kirsti Ferry. The movie goes into a dark place and its somewhat sweet candycoating tries to hide the fact that this was a truly major incident in a time and place where things like this just did not occur. Jackson was going for something like Peter Weir's equally disturbing Picnic at Hanging Rock but ends up creating a film that runs rings around that disappointing work. Jackson's smart direction just enhances a really intelligent Oscarnominated screenplay. Kate Winslet does truly steal the show from Lynskey who was meant to be the real focal point of the production. A good film that would lead to even better works for the major players involved. 4 stars out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "Heavenly Creatures may be the best film I've seen so far from Peter Jackson even after having gone through the Lord of the Rings King Kong even DeadAlive. His film is loaded with so much that it's hard to classify it as one specific thing and its psychological complexities make it something special. One way to describe the picture is that it's about the stirring friendshipcumrelationship of Pauline Melanie Lynskey and Juliet Kate Winslet in 1950s New Zealand. Another way to describe it is showing the other side the much darker side of a coming of age story where youth have to come to terms with realities with horrific results. And even another way is that it's another in a big line of independent films that work on the relationship between fantasy and reality or rather the practical need for abstractions to try and not get too close to the mundane and then the all too hard to accept realities around the characters.But there's another way to describe it too that I like best and that also marks it as something even more special than some might realize it's one of those rare sensational takes on what it's like to be in that dreadful cocoon of an age at 14 and 15 when hormones go completely insane parents are more of an enemy and force to be reckoned with than a helpful compassionate side like when younger and at times the world seems like it could end at any moment if something changed for the worse. This is where I think Jackson strikes it hardest and most fulfilling even as the other descriptions are not untrue at all. In this case Juliet and Pauline are at that age and when they first meet they first connect very strongly being outsiders in their class though completely in tune with their fantasy life of romanticized worlds knights an opera singer and some male movie stars. But this becomes complicated more once they first get briefly separated due to Juliet's illness and when they meet again there are suspicions from both sides of the family 'homosexuality' is shown in a closeup shot of the mouth of one of the father's saying it as if it's like the plague and the dysfunctions of Juliet's side end up drawing things to its very tragic end.Along with the substance being at a very high quality of a script that deftly combines the elements of lush fantasy mixing and matching sometimes without discerning through a powerful subjective viewpoint mostly through Pauline there's unexpected scenes that are touching. For example there's a scene where she reluctantly loses her virginity to a boarder and through this she keeps cutting back and forth in her dulled state to clay knights. This is a motif I suppose that is expounded upon alongside the narration from Pauline which adds her subjectivity to a fault. And all the while the objectivity becomes pushed aside or at least is questioned. What is it to be so different from how everyone in this 1950s time views their uncommon bond? Whether they are or aren't lesbian is up for debate it's left ambiguous even when its put upfront in the last twenty minutes. And all the while Jackson directs it stylistically with the same verve he had with his early films though balancing the wild fantasy with the grounded reality he's even playful with it however dark which includes a great tipofthehat to Orson Welles and the Third Man.All the while too the performances by the two leads are stellar. It's actually shocking to see Lynskey not get better roles since as her Pauline is totally defined and made real and at least in some sort of emotional way at times relatable or sympathetic. Winslet meanwhile has one of her best here as the more outward one personalitywise of the two who is even more immersed in the fantasy than Pauline but has a vulnerability that is crushing. Everything combines together then the direction the writing the performances and the actual mixed psychology behind it and it becomes quite memorable. It's not a very easy picture to watch at times and its implications are disturbing but it has more guts and determination to tell its story fullon than many others I can think of. A".

But this becomes complicated more once they first get briefly separated due to Juliet's illness and when they meet again there are suspicions from both sides of the family 'homosexuality' is shown in a closeup shot of the mouth of one of the father's saying it as if it's like the plague and the dysfunctions of Juliet's side end up drawing things to its very tragic end.Along with the substance being at a very high quality of a script that deftly combines the elements of lush fantasy mixing and matching sometimes without discerning through a powerful subjective viewpoint mostly through Pauline there's unexpected scenes that are touching. For example there's a scene where she reluctantly loses her virginity to a boarder and through this she keeps cutting back and forth in her dulled state to clay knights. This is a motif I suppose that is expounded upon alongside the narration from Pauline which adds her subjectivity to a fault. And all the while the objectivity becomes pushed aside or at least is questioned. What is it to be so different from how everyone in this 1950s time views their uncommon bond? Whether they are or aren't lesbian is up for debate it's left ambiguous even when its put upfront in the last twenty minutes. And all the while Jackson directs it stylistically with the same verve he had with his early films though balancing the wild fantasy with the grounded reality he's even playful with it however dark which includes a great tipofthehat to Orson Welles and the Third Man.All the while too the performances by the two leads are stellar. It's actually shocking to see Lynskey not get better roles since as her Pauline is totally defined and made real and at least in some sort of emotional way at times relatable or sympathetic. Winslet meanwhile has one of her best here as the more outward one personalitywise of the two who is even more immersed in the fantasy than Pauline but has a vulnerability that is crushing. Everything combines together then the direction the writing the performances and the actual mixed psychology behind it and it becomes quite memorable. It's not a very easy picture to watch at times and its implications are disturbing but it has more guts and determination to tell its story fullon than many others I can think of. A";

I have read that a lot of people were initially put off by the premise of an intense loving relationship between two teenage girls but it should be noted that their relationship if sexual at all is sexual in a purely symbolic way. If nothing else Jackson has made a stupendous achievement of making a film about this relationship and completely preventing any sense of eroticism from creeping up. The movie tells the shocking true story of two teenage girls who crushed the skull of one of their mothers with a rock and what led them to commit such a heinous crime. My understanding is that the story is told with a great deal of creative liberties but the focus is on a kind of friendship that few people ever find. Two girls with strengths and weaknesses that perfectly complement each other who run through the world at full speed giggling with glee as if unable to understand the pure happiness that they feel when they are together. Soon various events come in the way of their friendship. Melanie Lynskey plays Pauline and Kate Winslet in her first film role plays Juliet who is noticeably horrified when her parents bring up the prospect of leaving the country for a mere three weeks. While separated they write each other elaborate letters describing events that take place in an imaginary world that they have created together. When the separations become longer and more obviously because of parents' misguided ? concerns about a homosexual relationship their efforts to remain together become more and more desperate. As they say never underestimate the power of stupid people in large numbers or even the power and danger of a couple of teenage girls bent on maintaining their friendship. People are dangerous in groups even groups of two I realize just this second that tomorrow morning I have three classes of university students preparing to give final exam presentations in groups of two and three. I hope I haven't made a horrible mistake!!. Complicating matters for Pauline and Juliet are four wildly unhelpful parents. Juliet's mother is distracted by her disintegrating marriage and futile affairs while her professional father is benevolent and professional but both hapless and helpless while Pauline's mother is over controlling and militant about her discipline and her father seems to just want the whole thing to go away. The parents and the children are pulling in opposite directions and they pull harder and harder and harder until finally the rope snaps as it must. There are a number of truly impressive and memorable sections of the film such as the presentation of the imaginary world that Pauline and Juliet have created together particularly the clay characters that populate it. These things make it a movie that is difficult to categorize but easy to remember and they show a sense of visual style that Jackson later went on to develop even further in the Lord of the Rings films and King Kong. Some say that he will never be able to top the Lord of the Rings movies but personally I think he still has a few things up his sleeve. We can hope anyway.Note  it's well known that the real life Juliet has been revealed to be the successful murder mystery novelist Anne Perry which is a perfect ending to her story although I would have expected Pauline to become the writer. Also Melanie Lynksey has had a surprisingly successful acting career appearing in many successful films including a periodic role as the slightly crazy but immensely attractive Rose on 2  Men.".

This is often incorrectly called irony selfreference or the odd construction of reflexivity. I call it 'folding' and it seems to be everywhere and often in rich and engaging forms. Moreover it seem to be a central concern of the Australian performing arts community. I imagine it can be traced back to a single person in the seventies on Bennelong Point.So much of what we have gotten from this tradition has enriched us all not the least of which are the actresses who master folded acting. That's where we get a portrayal of a character and another simultaneous portrayal of an actor portraying that character. Sometimes the 'character' in these two portrayals isn't quite the same. Three mainstream film actresses today can do this. Two are Australian and one is Kate.This is her first film and it is no surprise at all that the filmmaker has chosen to build a structure that is a representation and is about representation. The original true story is about two girls enwrapped in mutual fantasy probably enhanced by the flush of sex whose fantastic adventures get out of hand. From this Jackson reshapes it all. It is now a film about films. Now the girls' fantasy world is a Camelot driven by forces in film. They write. They sculpt characters based on film characters. Those film characters come 'alive' and form a world in which the girls live in parallel with the real world. So far so good.But Jackson goes further. Some of the film prototypes are simple characters Mario Lanzalike. Simple glamour with no pretense or irony. But there is the amazing Orson Welles also. Orson is not pretty he is not direct he is a folded prototype himself. The two worlds conflict and that conflict is reflected in each world. In the Borovnian 'borrow'nian world this is a conflict between two clay figures the Welles and the Lanza the winner getting to bed and impregnate both princesses. In the 'real' world the conflict carries over to the two houses and even within Juliet's house between the bookish metaphysical father and the sexy 'psychologist but touchyfeely' mother.Welles was the one who reinvented the ordinary flat world of film into a melange of folding techniques. The film world since the late forties has been a combination of struggles and syntheses between the forth world of Welles and the simple dramatic stage of Griffith.Even the very young Kate surfs and exploits these levels with aplomb. Even as a teenager she gives us messages from each of these folds  not at precisely the same time as Julianne would later but strongly nonetheless.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 4 Worth watching.".

	schema:headline " This film is Heavenly";
	schema:reviewBody "Years before he would turn his eye to adapting J.R.R. Tolkien's literary masterpiece director Peter Jackson made a critical splash if not a commercial one with his film Heavenly Creatures. The film brought to screen a real life event in 1954 New Zealand where two girls committed matricide when the possibly of being separated from each other was inevitable. While it may not be as flashy and crowdpleasing as the Lord of the Rings trilogy Jackson's skill as a filmmaker is on display with Heavenly Creatures and proves he can work outside of the fantasyaction genre.Early in the film we are introduced to the characters of Pauline Rieper Melanie Lynskey and Juliet Hulme Kate Winslet in her first major acting role two girls who meet at the girl's school they both attend in Christchurch New Zealand in 1953. The two quickly discover they have much in common childhood illnesses that prevent them from participating in physical activities a love of the arts especially literature and the opinion that Mario Lanza is the world's greatest tenor. As their friendship blossoms the two develop a fantasy realm entitled The 4th World where the great creators go after they die. They also begin writing an elaborate fantasy novel generating elaborate backstories for their characters and shortly find themselves referring to each other by names from their fantasy stories. When Juliet contracts tuberculosis and is quarantined from the general population Pauline writes to her as both her real self and her imaginary character. As time passes the girls begin to fantasize that their fictional world exists populated by lifesize versions of the clay sculptures they have created for their stories. The closeness of the two doesn't go unnoticed by their respective parents with Juliet's father Clive Merrison beginning to suspect that the relationship between them is becoming unhealthy read homosexual. The parents begin to attempt to separate the two but the girls have become almost incapable of functioning without the other. Pauline comes to the conclusion that after Juliet is intended to move to South Africa that she must remove the obstacle that prevents her from staying with her friend her mother.Heavenly Creatures is very much a story of two isolated outsiders finding a kindred soul in the world and quickly building their entire existence around the other. Pauline is a frumpy slightly homely girl who is known to scowl and put herself in the corner of a room. Juliet is much more outgoing and contemptuous of authority correcting her teachers and performing a different lesson than the one assigned. But their commonalties outdistance their differences. Pauline has a bad leg Juliet problematic lungs so they spend their excercise hour sitting on the bench talking to each other dreaming up their fantasy world. Juliet was separated from her parents for much of her young childhood Pauline's parents must focus on running a boarding house. Never before have they found another person so in line with what they think and feel and are naturally drawn to each other. But their relationship is not exactly right they disappear into their fantasies envisioning themselves as princesses but their imaginings begin to crowd out the real world which they find too cold and uncaring. It is easy to see why the two form their bond but it is also easy to see that they take it too far. Unable to cope with an existence without the other this clouds everything around them. At the same time Heavenly Creatures is a tale of parents that are unaware or unconcerned about their children's needs. When Juliet is quarantined to the hospital her parents go on a multiweek trip to England where her father a respected professor can attend a conference. Pauline's parents try to block out her growing sexuality including an interest shown by a boy who is staying at her parent's home.The film is based in part on diaries kept in 1953 and 1954 by Pauline. She relates in cheerful and excited tones the approaching event that the two decided they must undertake when it is obvious that Juliet is leaving the murder of Pauline's mother. They leadup to the event is one of slow building tension as we view two innocents about to perform an act completely lacking in innocence.Jackson displays his affinity for a wild moving camera even here filming many sequences in a style not typical of a drama in some cases to relate the freewheeling nature of the girl's flights of fancy and giddy good time while in the other's company. On the acting front both Lynskey and Winslet are standouts. Lynskey portrays Pauline's depth of introversion and opening up with her friend expertly. Winselt produces just the right amount of arrogance and surety to give Juliet the appropriate superior attitude when necessary but eventually this gives way to trepidation as she begins to realize the depth and scope of the act they are preparing to undertake.Heavenly Creatures is a tale of innocence and friendship taken too far pushed beyond the boundaries of normalcy. Juliet and Pauline's sin wasn't homosexuality the film suggests it to some degree but hardly makes it certain it was becoming blind to the world outside of their isolated bubble long after it was too late. For those who found Jackson's Lord of the Rings triptych engrossing they would do well to check out Heavenly Creatures.".

But their relationship is not exactly right they disappear into their fantasies envisioning themselves as princesses but their imaginings begin to crowd out the real world which they find too cold and uncaring. It is easy to see why the two form their bond but it is also easy to see that they take it too far. Unable to cope with an existence without the other this clouds everything around them. At the same time Heavenly Creatures is a tale of parents that are unaware or unconcerned about their children's needs. When Juliet is quarantined to the hospital her parents go on a multiweek trip to England where her father a respected professor can attend a conference. Pauline's parents try to block out her growing sexuality including an interest shown by a boy who is staying at her parent's home.The film is based in part on diaries kept in 1953 and 1954 by Pauline. She relates in cheerful and excited tones the approaching event that the two decided they must undertake when it is obvious that Juliet is leaving the murder of Pauline's mother. They leadup to the event is one of slow building tension as we view two innocents about to perform an act completely lacking in innocence.Jackson displays his affinity for a wild moving camera even here filming many sequences in a style not typical of a drama in some cases to relate the freewheeling nature of the girl's flights of fancy and giddy good time while in the other's company. On the acting front both Lynskey and Winslet are standouts. Lynskey portrays Pauline's depth of introversion and opening up with her friend expertly. Winselt produces just the right amount of arrogance and surety to give Juliet the appropriate superior attitude when necessary but eventually this gives way to trepidation as she begins to realize the depth and scope of the act they are preparing to undertake.Heavenly Creatures is a tale of innocence and friendship taken too far pushed beyond the boundaries of normalcy. Juliet and Pauline's sin wasn't homosexuality the film suggests it to some degree but hardly makes it certain it was becoming blind to the world outside of their isolated bubble long after it was too late. For those who found Jackson's Lord of the Rings triptych engrossing they would do well to check out Heavenly Creatures.";

	schema:reviewBody "POSSIBLE SPOILERS!When i say different i mean different to what Peter Jackson had done before this. He may now be the hottest directorial talent around now with a little trilogy by the name of Lord of the Rings giving him a push in the right direction but before all that he was notorious around the cult circle for his excessively gruesome yet incredibly funny horrorsplatter movies.As entertaining as these movies may be they are not cinematic gold like Lord of the Rings or this gem that he churned out in the early 90's. In fact it was this type of movie that proved to the world that Jackson can be a mature and adult film maker if given the right material another example would be Steven Spielberg and Schindler's List.This film takes place between the years of 1952 and 1954 and focuses on two young schoolgirls that develop a bizarre friendship in which they create a fantasy world that only they know about. When their relationship appears to become something more than just mutural friends their parents try to put and end to it by separating the two ending with tragic results.As with every Peter Jackson movie the film starts off with his usual bravado and energy with the performances played out with his slightly OTT take on the world. There is not a bad performance in this movie and it also displays Jackson's ability for spotting new talent this was Kate Winslet's first big role.However when the relationship starts to take a turn for the worse Jackson shows his talent as a great film maker. The performances become more subtle and eerily precise as the truly shocking reality of what will happen starts to unfold. The leading ladies become more disturbing than any screen psycho to date with the added oomph that they are just children.The ending is the icing on the cake for me and i know that'll sound sick and sadistic to anyone who has had the pleasure of seeing this film but it just proves what a disturbing picture this is. It shows how far too far can go and how strong the relationship was if in the end it would lead to murder to keep them together.This is a movie that is endlessly watchable. Definitely a more mature and adult film than the rest of his cannon apart from LOTR of course and it also showed the start of what would become a truly great talent that would dominate Hollywood ten years later. There are not many films today that can be funny compelling heartbreaking chilling disturbing and beautiful all at the same time but this one pulls it off with effortless ease.55".

I am not a lesbian or a murderer but I enjoy writing and had a few close friends when I was younger that shared my passion.  We created characters and whole worlds and yes even the occassional alter ego.  Watching Heavenly Creatures brought a tear to my eye because I could relate to the close friendship of Juliet Hulme and Pauline Parker.  It also made me cry because of where they ended up and also how unfairly their friendship was viewed by their families.Every time I watch this movie I want to jump into the TV and stop the characters from their heinous actions.  I want the movie and their true lives to end up differently but of course that never will happen.  This is a bittersweet film that is filled with sharp dialogue some of it coming from Pauline Parker's actual journal as well as amazing actors.  I think Melanie Lynsky who plays Pauline has yet to get the recognition she deserves for her awesome acting skills and Kate Winslet is 100 times better in Heavenly Creatures than she was in Titanic the movie for which everyone seems to remember.To sum this up Heavenly Creatures is a unique and incredible film that will tug at your heartstrings while breaking your heart at the same time.".

Kate Winslet is brilliant in her role and so is Melanie Lynskey. It almost makes you pity the real life people they were portraying. I don't know if Jackson was trying to make you have a heart for what these girls did or if he just wanted to share the story from their perspective but it would not have made sense from any other view than the girls. The journals they kept explained their insanity and makes you wonder why they didn't get more time. Only in America I guess. This is a wonderful piece of work.

Heavenly Creatures is a movie that proves it really can.The story is full of fantasy drama friendship and strange elements. The combination of personal drama extraordinary fantasy and suspense thriller keeps you interested.Besides the story itself there are also other factors that makes this movie extremely worth watching. Director Peter Jackson is pulling the strings the whole movie and his direction is like the cherry on the strawberry pie it's an extra 'golden touch' on Heavenly Creatures.And we must not forget the great acting. Sarah Pierse is fine as Mrs Rieper and Clive Merrison is castiron in his role as Mr Hulme. And then there are the two unique leading girls Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet. Lynskey does very well in her very complicated and isolated role as Pauline Rieper but Winslet exceeds everybody with her fantastic compelling and terrifying role as Juliet Hulme.The special effects are really special and contribute to the film's pretensions and also the music does his bit. The movie gives you a little nasty feeling in the stomach but at the end you know that you've just seen a really unique film.To me Heavenly Creatures was a unforgettable watching experience.

	schema:reviewBody "This probably has spoilersso watch out!Peter Jackson is now best known for his Lord of the Rings Trilogy but this movie I believe helped establish him as the right director for that gigantic undertaking. It is creepymaybe because we know that this story really happenedand as we watch the changes in Pauline and Juliet over the course of the movie the girls become more and more frightening. Another distinctly eerie aspect of Jackson's film is the entries taken straight out of Pauline's diary. At first mundane and typical of a teenage girl eventually the diary reflects just how monstrous the girls had becomequotes like it was a perfect day to kill Mother and It seemed like she knew what was coming and wanted it are so sociopathic it is impossible to see the little girl in either child again.I watched the movie as part of my Philosophy Goes to the Movies class and the comments afterward focused on the friendship between the two girls. We asked What went wrong? Obviously something did in their relationshipsomewhere along the way a line was crossed by the two. Jackson does a fine job of immersing the viewer so much in the normal suburban lives of the children that the viewer can't exactly pinpoint when the relationship went murderous. I know many young girls who had the same sort of relationship during their teenage years but none of them became murderers. Jackson never comes and and blatantly tells the viewer what it is that forces the girls to kill he leaves that open to interpretationmaybe it's the antihomosexual constraining society maybe it's the sociopathic nature of the little world they created only for the two of them who knows? Many young children create imaginary worlds and large amounts of adolescents have homosexual tendencies during pubertyyet not all turn out to be killers. It is a tribute to Jackson to not take a stand on exactly what caused the girls to turn to matricidemany other filmmakers would force their opinion on the audienceJackson lets our own psyches try to comprehend the girls' motivations.Heavenly Creatures is a disturbing movieI recommend it to anyone who has only seen Jackson's Ring Trilogy or who enjoys odd human dramas. It is sure to make you shiverespecially when you learn that Juliet is an established author writing none other than murder mysteries in England. For another good scare read her biography and pay special attention to what she learned as a teenager.".

As the reviewer before me has accurately pointed out that 1940 saw the best directors of AustrianGerman cinema gone Robert Von Dassanowsky memorably refers to this period in his book AUSTRIAN CINEMA we cannot equal that fact with a thoroughly hopeless cinema doomed to destructive monstrosity of propaganda. DER POSTMEISTER proves to be one of the exceptions from the propaganda pressure.Although preceded by another screen adaptation and succeeded by a remake Gustav Ucicky's DER POSTMEISTER is a top notch production. Resulting from an indepth knowledge of audiences' expectations Ucicky director of HEIMKEHR proved good rapport with producers Karl Hartl and Erich Von Neusser DER POSTMEISTER set the right tone for the standards of the time at two basic levels. On the one hand it was a correct product of the period Alexander Puschkin's STANCJONNYJ SMOTRITEL was a right Russian literary source within the MolotovRibbentrop Pact later a winner of the Mussolini Cup at the Venice Festival on the other hand the film appeared to be ahead of its time which made it embrace all aesthetic and social aspects. Therefore today DER POSTMEISTER may still be viewed as one of the most important films by movie scholars who attempt at learned approach as well as film freaks who aim at aesthetic viewing experience of high quality silver screen production.The aesthetic value of the movie occurs to be one of its most remarkable features. Full credit to the cinematographer Hans Schneeberger! Combining innovative elements of German Expressionism with the focus on the beautiful the lavish the elaborate sets at St Petersburg the cinematographer employs high lighting and haunting shadows resulting in a stunning effect. Consider the scene while women are sewing the wedding dress for example all the movement of the camera with the 'revealing' image appear to correspond with 'development.' The music score by Willi SchmidtGentner supplies the film with Russian flair and places our subconscious perceptions rightly within the plot. And how is the plot developed? Not that common in 1940 perfectly framed within the opening and closing image of the road in snow partly Russian landscape but partly  the complicated sophisticated story of Dunja Hilde Krahl and the simple story of her father the title postmaster Heinrich George is told through the flashback. Told by one of beautiful Dunja's candidate for a husband one Mitja Hans Holt it appears to be an emotional drama with torments of reflections and moral dilemma something Tolstoy like. Yes indeed the story provides lots of parallels with Tolstoy's heroines and furthermore with countless cinematic heroines who got somehow lost in the labyrinth that life appears to be. Why? Because of family relations and above all other aspects a 'decent' place in society. All the aesthetic glamor however goes with the content thanks to the people who really made this film a lovely viewing experience from the artistic and humane point of view.Most films of the time had female stars being at the same time a sort of their vehicles. In this case DER POSTMEISTER is no exception. Hildegard Kolan known as Hilde Krahl sets her heart on the character of Dunja. She is the film's triumph! Beautiful sophisticated sensual at certain daring moments tragic and yet joyful  sets the tone for an unforgettable tearjerker. Mind you the charming scenes with Dunja's father and the changing attitudes the indicative sensual scenes with Minskij played by Siegfried Breuer known as Zarah Leander's costar in DER WEG INS FREIE the feminine scenes with Elisawetha Ruth Hellberg. Finally she is most memorable at her death scene. Alfred Kunz the costume designer does a wonderfully creative job with Ms Krahl's magnificent wardrobe which adds a certain flair to Dunja's character.The male counterpart performer the title character is Heinrich George as Dunja's loving authoritative naive father. The actor comparable was seriously underrated and considered 'nondesirable' because of his politically 'incorrect' affiliation. Yet he proves to be a skillful artist here supplying the movie with psychological parentchild relations more effectively than many other modern character actors. He combines humor with drama which makes his character so appealing. Who can forget his scene with the horses when he shares his joy of Dunja's letter or his first meeting with Dunja in Petersburg? Criticized by Jrgen Fehling for his dance which meets our humor expectations rather than proper requirements I think his acting method appears to have stood a test of time. In one scene Minskij tries to persuade him to allow Dunja leave for St Petersburg and his attitude so naturally and so funnily changes while a caged bird is chirping in the background. The finale is simply unforgettable how he executes his lines and concludes his character's intentions in a typically Russian locale of the scene  train.I think that the aspect which needs being mentioned is the daring aspect of the movie. It applies not only to the dance of the halfnaked gypsy which would surely not have come out in the Hollywood of the time but the depiction of carnal desire. In one scene with erotic overtones Minskij is depicted as thoroughly crazy with lust and touches Dunja's breasts passionately  something quite rare for the films of the time when love was more romantic than erotic more noble than carnal. Her final reflection in a mirror the ever present symbol of vanity and selfishness can also be interpreted from a self centered erotic perspective though it appears to stand for her confrontation between inner dilemmas and a desperate decision.A melancholic road in snow but above all a price that people pay for everything in life. Regret sorrow reflection...that is usually what is left to a human whose thoughts blend drama with comedy and hopes with disappointments. Classic literature in classic cinema!".

	schema:headline " Mediocre story mostly propaganda";
	schema:reviewBody "Der Postmeister or The Stationmaster is an AustrianGerman coproduction and a Germanlanguage blackandwhite sound film from 1940. The director is Gustav Ucicky and the writer who adapted the short story this is based on was Gerhard Menzel. It runs for roughly 90 minutes. If you see the year mentioned previously you will know that it is from the days of World War II and while it may not be the Nazis' most blatant propaganda film there is clearly an antiSoviet message in here. Some films focused on discrediting Jews some on Americans others on Frenchmen and Brits but this one here is about Soviets. It tells the story of a young woman falling in love with a Soviet nobleman but the longer the film runs the more we find out the real motives the man had and what his character really seems to be like. The title character is the female protagonist's father and it is a bit random I must say as I rarely felt that Heinrich George's father of Gtz character is the true protagonist here. It was much more about Hilde Krahl's character and her story I felt. There is a lot of tragedy involved here but this is also nothing new for films who came out around that time as the Nazis always intended to show us how foreigners' despicable actions lead to death and devastation. I personally must say the story was mediocre at best and the acting was sometimes okay sometimes not and sometimes even over the top. My overall verdict is thumbs down as the bad outweighed the good. Watch something else instead.".

Cinematography is quite nicely  capturing the atmosphere of everywhere from Hong Kong's skyscrapers to a Thailand jungle pretty cool furthermore some stirring images filmed with camera above the shoulder. Lousy musical score by means of synthesizer by Nemec and isn't composed by Ennio Morricone. The film is produced in middling budget by Erwin C Dietrich  habitual director and producer of softcores and Jesus Franco's usual financier.The film was made in the wake of Wild GeeseAndrew McLagen with Burton Moore and Richard Harris and Wild Geese IIPeter Hunt with Scott Glenn Edward Fox Barbara Carrerawhich depended in their all star cast.

The mission meets an unexpected turns and twists when they're betrayed. Meanwhile they find a Catholic priestAlan Collins or Luciano Pigozzi the Italian Peter Lorreruling a mission in middle of jungle. The jungle countrymen are submitted to druglords and the Reds Jemeres . This fastpaced film packs adventures largescale blowuproutine plot and lots of action for the most part. Cheesy scenes about a car races throughout a tunnel under construction with embarrassing scale models such the director previously made in his film Car crash1980 but contains a better scenario on the bridge explosions and over the burning installations with helicopter scenes. Cinematography is quite nicely  capturing the atmosphere of everywhere from Hong Kong's skyscrapers to a Thailand jungle pretty cool furthermore some stirring images filmed with camera above the shoulder. Lousy musical score by means of synthesizer by Nemec and isn't composed by Ennio Morricone. The film is produced in middling budget by Erwin C Dietrich  habitual director and producer of softcores and Jesus Franco's usual financier.The film was made in the wake of Wild GeeseAndrew McLagen with Burton Moore and Richard Harris and Wild Geese IIPeter Hunt with Scott Glenn Edward Fox Barbara Carrerawhich depended in their all star cast. And belongs a trilogy directed by Anthony M DawsonMargheriti formed by Commando Leopard1985 and Der Commander1988 repeating similar actors Collins Kinski and Manfred Lemann technicians and screenwriter Tito Carpi.These junglesetting exploitation films from the 80s will like to action lovers and eurotrash enthusiastic.";

The whole plot is like a formulaic brainless version of The Wild Geese the production values are bad and the action or chase scenes are poorly produced and sometimes utterly ridiculous.

	schema:headline " Derivative Combat Action Thriller with a Load of Whiz Bangs!";
	schema:reviewBody "Horror Castle director Antonio Margheriti's Code Name Wild Geese with Lewis Collins and Lee Van Cleef qualifies as an explosive actionpacked but formulaic military actioneer about hardnosed mercenaries dispatched with the blessings of the DEA to destroy an evil Asian general's opium factory in the Golden Triangle. Predictably complications arise and everybody finds themselves in for a considerably more difficult mission than they were prepared for from the outset. Although it is not related to the 1978 Richard Burton epic The Wild Geese or its tardy sequel Wild Geese II the Tito Tentacles Capri Gianfranco The Last Hunter Couyoumdjian and Michael Lester screenplay clearly borrows elements from the two earlier films but rearranges them so there are enough differences. The rugged cast includes Ernst Borgnine Klaus Kinski Mimsy Farmer Manfred Lehmann and Frank Glaubrecht. Margheriti and cinematographer Peter Baumgartner lensed this actioneer on location in Hong Kong and lush jungles of the Philippines. Some of the action scenes such as a fastpaced car chase through a tunnel under construction and most of the explosions that occur in long shot are done with costsaving miniatures as Margheriti did with his Karen Black  Lee Major's thriller Killer Fish. Code Name Wild Geese is nothing memorable but it is done with a lot of savvy and Kinski's fake elite British accent make it worthwhile especially if you're in the mood for a shoot'em up with no shortage of explosions and a high body count. One of the last scene when our hero attaches a flamethrower to a helicopter skid and burns up everything and everybody at an opium plant gives it an edge.Captain Robin Wesley Lewis Collins of The Final Option is a topnotch mercenary who trains his men under conditions as close to actual combat as he can. Obviously Margheriti and his scenarists pilfered the first scene from the Andrew V. McLaglen thriller ffolks with Roger Moore whose title character keeps his mercenaries on their toes with similar exercises. Wesley is called in by his employer Baldwin Wolfgang Pampel to blow the smithereens out of a opium factory run by a ruthless baldheaded warlord. Fletcher Ernst Borgnine of Marty represents the DEA and Charlton Klaus Kinski of Nosferatu hangs around as backup in case Wesley and his men run into trouble. Before the mission begins Wesley loses his helicopter pilot so he strikes a bargain with the authorities to release Travis Lee Van Cleef of For a Few Dollars More to fly for him.

	onyx:emotionText "Horror Castle director Antonio Margheriti's Code Name Wild Geese with Lewis Collins and Lee Van Cleef qualifies as an explosive actionpacked but formulaic military actioneer about hardnosed mercenaries dispatched with the blessings of the DEA to destroy an evil Asian general's opium factory in the Golden Triangle. Predictably complications arise and everybody finds themselves in for a considerably more difficult mission than they were prepared for from the outset. Although it is not related to the 1978 Richard Burton epic The Wild Geese or its tardy sequel Wild Geese II the Tito Tentacles Capri Gianfranco The Last Hunter Couyoumdjian and Michael Lester screenplay clearly borrows elements from the two earlier films but rearranges them so there are enough differences. The rugged cast includes Ernst Borgnine Klaus Kinski Mimsy Farmer Manfred Lehmann and Frank Glaubrecht. Margheriti and cinematographer Peter Baumgartner lensed this actioneer on location in Hong Kong and lush jungles of the Philippines. Some of the action scenes such as a fastpaced car chase through a tunnel under construction and most of the explosions that occur in long shot are done with costsaving miniatures as Margheriti did with his Karen Black  Lee Major's thriller Killer Fish. Code Name Wild Geese is nothing memorable but it is done with a lot of savvy and Kinski's fake elite British accent make it worthwhile especially if you're in the mood for a shoot'em up with no shortage of explosions and a high body count. One of the last scene when our hero attaches a flamethrower to a helicopter skid and burns up everything and everybody at an opium plant gives it an edge.Captain Robin Wesley Lewis Collins of The Final Option is a topnotch mercenary who trains his men under conditions as close to actual combat as he can. Obviously Margheriti and his scenarists pilfered the first scene from the Andrew V. McLaglen thriller ffolks with Roger Moore whose title character keeps his mercenaries on their toes with similar exercises. Wesley is called in by his employer Baldwin Wolfgang Pampel to blow the smithereens out of a opium factory run by a ruthless baldheaded warlord. Fletcher Ernst Borgnine of Marty represents the DEA and Charlton Klaus Kinski of Nosferatu hangs around as backup in case Wesley and his men run into trouble. Before the mission begins Wesley loses his helicopter pilot so he strikes a bargain with the authorities to release Travis Lee Van Cleef of For a Few Dollars More to fly for him. Travis is an expert chopper pilot who has flown in five wars but wound up in prison for smuggling.Initially everything goes according to plans and our heroes wipe out the opium factory. During the heated combat Travis leaves his post in the helicopter to help the mercenaries and an adversary smashes the fuel tank sets the chopper afire and it blows up.

	schema:reviewBody "If there's one thing I never understood about the art of European trash  exploitation filmmaking it's the concept of dubbing actors that already speak English. Quite often I stumble upon obscure cult movies with great names in the cast like Christopher Lee and Klaus Kinski and yet for some incomprehensible reason their lines and dialogs are dubbed by atrociously articulating voices. I don't get it. It's a privilege to work with these actors as far as I'm concerned so the absolute last thing you do is alter their voices right? Here in Code Name Wild Gees the legendary infamous Klaus Kinski talks with the posh and eloquent voice of a seemingly elderly homosexual. The voices of the other international stars Lee Van Cleef and Ernest Borgnine luckily aren't dubbed. Code Name Wild Geese is a typically early 80's European action movie from the hand of the versatile Italian director Antonio Margheriti. Basically this means it's a nonsensical but tremendously entertaining popcorn flick chockfull of explosions testosteroneoverloaded male characters car  helicopter crashes and an ultrathin storyline set somewhere in the jungle of a dubious problematic country. Margheriti shot three movies like this together with the German producer Erwin C. Dietrich and largely the same casts. I have yet to see The Commander but Commando Leopard is equally good fun. Lewis Collins stars as the leader of a band of macho mercenaries known as the Wild Geese. They're kind of like The ATeam except tougher of course and less inventive with artillery and vehicles. The team is hired by government man Ernest Borgnine to destroy an opium plantation in Burma. Commander Wesley takes the assignment rather personally since his own since died from a drug overdose. Naturally loads of infiltrations doublecrossing collateral damage and violent shootouts ensue. There are plentiful of ridiculously entertaining moments in Code Name Wild Geese most notably a laughably fake chase sequence in which the cars drive sideways in a tunnel! It's really a stupid sight especially since the scene ends with homosexually voiced Kinski saying Isn't that funny?. There are also some very good action sequences and miniature set designs including a freight train explosion and a helicopter blast. Lee Van Cleef stars as a hired pilot who's initially reluctant to join the battle and Margheriti regular Luciano Pigozzi the Italian Peter Lorre plays a priest who provides shelter to the fugitive mercenaries. He also has the hands down coolest sequence when his character is found creepily crucified following a retaliation strike by the opium producers. The dialogs are horribly and actually quite redundant but I guess they needed as much screen time as possible for Ernest Borgnine and Klaus Kinski. Their conversations are truly abominable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here's yet another jungle adventure yarn from Antonio Margheriti following on from his previous Warbeck quartet. While this movie lacks Warbeck it makes up for his absence by having a great exploitation cast to die for. I thoroughly enjoyed this actionpacked adventure yarn which may be cheesy farfetched and predictable but is nonetheless violent and showcases some top actors going through their motions as they struggle for survival in the jungle. Probably the main disappointment is the music which as the credits proudly proclaim is produced on Yamaha keyboards! The film begins with a shootemup in the dark scene. I don't know what relevance it bears to the rest of the film but it starts the move in an actionpacked way so I'll let it pass. We are initially introduced to the characters at a bigwig meeting presided over by the immortal Ernest Borgnine. Why immortal? Well he always seems to keep on making films and never letting his age worry him! Borgnine here is the team leader so his job is to fret behind a desk for the film's course. Sadly he doesn't engage in any of the action in the movie.Pretty soon Margheriti's obsession with miniature effects comes into play during a car chase in which cars fly up the walls of a tunnel. Hilariously these are matchbox models by the look of it and are easily spotted due to the lack of people in the supposed vehicles! Pointless stuff but it's fun anyway. Shortly afterwards our hero Wesley Lewis Collins assembles his team and ventures into the jungle at night. The first action scene is an attack on a village and contains a hilarious moment where a soldier jumps through the roof of a thatched hut and gets a huge spike through his arm! Surely the door would have been a better bet.The film gets better as it goes on and the next action sequence is to steal a helicopter and is very well done. It isn't anything you won't have seen before but there's lots of bloody death and incessant shots of guards tumbling out of guard towers. Oh yeah and around a dozen bad guys get knives thrown into their chests for variety. The film climaxes at around the halfway mark with a successful attack on the enemy base which culminates in our heroes' helicopter being destroyed  big surprise.They then have to make their way on foot to another enemy base and destroy that as well. Along the way they stop briefly at a jungle church ! run by none other than Margheriti's old friend Luciano Pigozzi as the priest. Pigozzi is just one of the familiar faces to reappear from Margheriti's previous movies. The native guy from TIGER JOE is also here. Keep your eyes peeled and you'll see the witch doctor from HUNTERS OF THE GOLDEN COBRA as a prisoner in one brief shot. This goes to show that like with Hammer Studios Margheriti tended to employ the same actors again and again in his films.Well the enemy shows up and Pigozzi gets attacked in the film's most horrific scene enlivened by the quality acting. This is probaby one of Pigozzi's finest moments. Our heroes continue their numble dwindling all the while stopping briefly to blow up a miniature train and unsuccessfully negotiate a minefield. The excellent finale sees an allout assault on the enemy base and a surprise traitor attacking.Lewis Collins is rather bland as the film's hero but not a total loss. He tries to be David Warbeck for a lot of the time but doesn't have the same laidback charm. Spaghetti western icon Lee Van Cleef pops up in one of his last appearances as an excon helicopter pilot and delivers a solid performance as usual. Borgnine's role is limited but he's there for name value alone. Former giallo star Mimsy Farmer is also around as an opium addictturnedgunfighting hero. Finally we have Klaus Kinski doing his patented psycho shtick at one point drilling a corpse with his machine gun and going berserk! Good stuff and a fine actionwar film which is easy on the brain but looks good and has lots of shooting and explosions for those who like them. Personally I found this to be a superior action flick and I recommend it to all.".

I have always thought that  aside from the admittedly seriously impressive Pink Floyd scored explosion par excellence from the finale of Zabriskie Point 1970  once you've seen one explosionwell the others are kind of similar. Which brings me to Codename Wild Geese a film complimented quite a bit on the basis for it having an above average number of explosions. While I fully agree there were a lot of them it didn't change the fact that this was a very formulaic action movie with little interest value overall.This West German production was directed by Italian directorforhire Antonio Margheriti who was also at the helm for the two subsequent films which made up a loose action trilogy namely Commando Leopard 1985 and The Commander 1988. For my money Commando Leopard was the best of the bunch although that could be a result of it being the first of these I saw and so consequently had the most patience for. All films feature Lewis Collins in the star role as a tough commando team leader who quite impressively manages to navigate through the entire runtime of all three movies with a face like fizz. In this one he leads a group of mercenaries who are hired by the DEA to take out an opium production operation in the southeast Asian jungle. The rest of the cast is pretty good on paper with Ernest Borgnine as a shady DEA boss Lee Van Cleef pitches up as a helicopter pilot Klaus Kinski replete with upper class English accent plays a sneaky associate of Collins' and Italian genre regular Mimsy Farmer is also on hand as a civilian caught up in the middle of the conflict. Despite the promising nature of the cast they aren't given anything very interesting to work with and so none really register performances that are very memorable at all. But then this film is about explosions not acting I keep on forgetting this.There are other things in it worth at least noting however my favourite scene for example being the car chase early on in the movie where Collins drives his car along the side of a wall while driving down a tunnel in an attempt to escape a tailgater  this is a genuinely inspired bit of nonsense which I definitely enjoyed. Later on we also have a helicopter with attached flamethrower which isn't as interesting as it sounds but it does sound great I have to say. And there also was a scene where a missionary is crucified which was at the very least quite distinctive and memorable. But mainly this one really has to be recommended for those of you with a high tolerance for machine gun shooting explosions junglebased antics explosions Lewis Collins looking constipated explosions and scenes with explosions.".

You'd think a movie with a legendary cast filled with personal favorites Borgnine Van Cleef Farmer and Kinski produced by a legendary German producer Erwin C. Dietrich and helmed by legendary Italian director Antonio Margheriti and filmed in very scenic locations the results would be well... legendary.Sadly that is not the case. It's not that Codename Wildgeese is bad but it doesn't live up to the promise of its cast and crew.Kind of going along in the vein of The Dogs of War 1980 The Dirty Dozen 1967 the original Inglorious Bastards 1978 and the Eye of the Eagle series the first one in 1986 and the other two both 1989 and in true Italian exploitation fashion basically fashioning an unrelated variant on The Wild Geese 1978 Codename is about a group of men led by Wesley Lewis Collins who invade the Golden Triangle the border of Burma Laos and Thailand apparently to destroy the opium factories of a Burmese warlord. They are hired by DEA agent Fletcher Borgnine and his associate Charlton Kinski for the crazy moreimpossiblethanimpossible mission that you'd have to be downright insane to even consider considering.It certainly seems dangerous as the next hour or so consists of people shooting machine guns guys in brown uniforms falling off guard towers all manner of blowups including many exploding huts and Mimsy Farmer shows up as the token woman and also the token reporter that got trapped by the evildoers who put her in a cage. After a few more blowups and maybe a doublecross or two the movie ends.The problem is there is littletono character development. Even with a vast array of tools at your disposal to involve viewers in your movie if you don't know who the characters are or anything about them the moviegoer begins to lose interest because you don't really care about their fate. So I would say Codename Wildgeese falls prey to Lone Tiger syndrome that is just because you have a great cast doesn't mean your movie is going to be good. That being said there are some cool aspects such as a helicopter with a flamethrower attached to it and some of Margheriti's classic miniature work best exemplified in an early chase sequence when Collins' car is speeding through a tunnel and then he cuts the wheel to the right and shockingly drives along the side wall of the tunnel! It's moments like this when Codename comes alive but they are few and far between.As an avid Italian horror movie fan I'm much more familiar with Margheriti's Castle of Blood 1964 Cannibal Apocalypse 1980 which does have some actionwar elements The Long Hair of Death 1964 The Virgin of Nuremberg 1963 Seven Dead in the Cat's Eye 1973 Web of the Spider 1971 also with Kinski and while not technically a horror movie the ultimate classic Yor Hunter from the Future 1983 a must see. Of his 80's action output that I have seen it seems the finest is The Last Hunter 1980...so see that if you want entertaining Margheriti action at its best.For more insanity please visit comeuppancereviews.com".

	schema:headline " Powerful Drama From Ingmar Bergman";
	schema:reviewBody "Writerdirector Ingmar Bergman examines the strained relationship between a mother and daughter in Autumn Sonata' starring Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullmann.  Eva Ullmann has not seen her mother Charlotte Bergman in seven years a successful concert pianist Charlotte has spent a good portion of her life on the road but after losing her longtime companion Leonardo Eva invites her to come to the parsonage where she and her minister husband Viktor Halvar Bjork live for an extended visit. Charlotte accepts but soon after her arrival old wounds and feelings begin to surface and the film becomes an intimate character study of the lifelong dysfunctional relationship between Charlotte and Eva during which director Bergman intricately examines the causes and effects of all that has passed between them during their lives.  It's an indepth look at the emotional damage human beings are capable of inflicting upon one another and how fragile the line between love and hate becomes when subjected to incessant neglect by even one of the parties involved.  As the story unfolds and the principals bare their souls at last revealing a lifetime's worth of repressed feelings it becomes an emotionally devastating experience for the audience as well for there is much contained within the dynamics of this situation that most viewers will be able to identify with and relate to within their own lives. Ingmar Bergman is a Master of presenting life as it truly is reality and portraying it on the screen is his domain and throughout his career he has veritably created almost a genre of his own in doing so.  With a microscope of his own design he scrutinizes the basic instincts of the human condition what makes people tick and how and why they relate to one another as they do.  Much of what he presents is startling and always emotionally involving because he penetrates so deeply and succinctly into the heart of the matter as he demonstrates so superlatively with this film. His methods and style are unique his talent unequivocal many others have attempted to capture the essence of that which Bergman has perfected but few have succeeded.  Interestingly enough Liv Ullmann is one who as a director has probably come the closest to achieving that classic sense' of Bergman with her films Private Confessions' and Faithless' both of which were written by Bergman. In her role as Eva Ullmann gives one of the best performances of her career for which she should have at least been nominated for an Oscar that she was not is nothing less than a gross injustice.  She so skillfully conveys the depth and complexities of her character and the differing emotional levels to which Eva is subjected that it creates a lasting impression and makes her someone with whom it is easy for the audience to sympathize.  It makes you realize upon reflection what a truly gifted actress Ullmann is.  And as good as Ullmann's performance here is it is equaled though not I would say surpassed by Ingrid Bergman's portrayal in her final theatrical appearance of Charlotte and in a renewal of faith that there is some justice in the world after all she received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress for it.  In retrospect it seems somehow inevitable that the two Bergmans came together at last though it's somewhat lamentable that their career paths did not cross sooner.  There is some consolation however in the fact that when they did finally join forces the result was such a powerful memorable film. The supporting cast includes Lena Nyman Helena Gunnar Bjornstrand Paul Erland Josephson Josef and Linn Ullmann Eva as a child.  An intelligent thought provoking and emotionally wrenching film highlighted by outstanding performances and beautifully photographed by Sven Nykvist Autumn Sonata' is an example of filmmaking at it's best it's a lasting tribute not only to the immense talents of Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullmann but to Ingrid Bergman one of the most beautiful and gifted actresses ever to grace the silver screen.  I rate this one 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the very best Ingmar Bergman films I have seen and therefore one of the very best films.Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman are simply amazing together as a mother and daughter combination from hell.

	schema:reviewBody "What makes a movie perfect is not only the intensity of emotion you feel when seeing it and it's not only the seamless matching of technique and artistry it is the truth of feeling conveyed and the unrelenting attention to the details of the crafts of writing acting and directing making certain that those details work together to create meaning  a view of life and whatever forces are behind life that are as varied contradictory and complete as a living being. It is this that Bergman managed to accomplish with AUTUMN SONATA. The hyperbolic use of the word 'perfect' too often spontaneously tossed out as a result of confused and mawkish sentimentality just as one Liv Ulmann's interpretation of a Chopin prelude is described as mawkish in the film has a right to be used in the case of this work. There are no demons or angels in this movie. There are a collection of remarkably real characters whose actions and their motivations are fully explained by themselves in dialog that is explicit and direct but not delivered as an artificial way of getting across the creator's judgment on his characters. Ingrid Bergman in what is doubtlessly the finest performance of her career portrays a mother who has neglected her children all her life and is confronted by this fact by her grown daughter whose adoration as a child has turned into an apparently irreversible hatred. There is no forgiveness is a line uttered by Liv Ulmann after summarizing the crimes of her mother's neglect and the results of that neglect. And yet the character's contradictory feelings are clearly seen in the moments when her need for vengeful expression of her pain has faded away. The daughter who has condemned her mother quite honestly wants to keep trying to resolve the conflict to heal the gaping wounds in her heart and in her sister's heart  a sister who arguably has been physically crippled by the cold withdrawl of her mother's feelings and her mother's competitive need to be the leading female character in everyone's life. Ingrid Bergman's character though seen as a villain in the emotional eyes of her daughter comes across as complex as Ulmann's. She has an awareness of her crimes of neglect but remains helpless by choice and by need to confront them within herself and make amends to resolve them. Her own childhood is the reason. The isolation that she felt instead of inspiring her to not repeat the mistake with her own children took the course of isolation of seeking praise from the outside of being the central character in the lives of people around her. Her insatiable hunger for love from others though remains forever unsatisfied. Her selfishness even though she is painfully aware of it is something which she has learned how to hide from herself. Her methods of physical distance or the perfection of her work as a pianist has for all her adult life successfully obfuscated her pain   until an allnight exposing of the naked truths of hurt and distrust that are thrust upon her by her daughter.    Anyone with a mother or father can find identification with the characters in AUTUMN SONATA as long as they can tolerate the pain of the truth that lies at the center of their alltoohuman needs and the hurtful action that those needs have caused.".

It is considered to be Ingrid Bergman's film and she is phenomenal as a talented and world renowned pianist who had never been a good mother to her two daughters. It is much easier to make the whole world happy then your own child. One can be a brilliant artist and read the minds of the other great minds easily but the hearts and souls of one's own blood and flesh would be the unsolved mystery. I think the film was very personal for both Bergmans in their only work together. It is amazing how bravely they explore the themes and events that could've and did occurred in their own lives. For me though the film belongs to Liv Ullmann the greatest actress I've seen the best Ingmar Bergman's actress.I was riveted to Liv's face I'd never seen the face like hers. She played a plain daughter to the brilliant mother and she was supposed to look and feel awkward and gawky comparing to her mother but her face was like a magnet her eyes  like two deep blue lakes. If ever the saying the eyes are the soul's mirror is true it is about Liv's eyes. There are kindness tenderness strength and something even more attractive than beauty itself in them  the goodness of her soul. Dostoyevsky said once that human face has to mean something  I always think of his words when I see performance of my favorite actress ever Liv Ullmann.".

	schema:reviewBody "Autumn Sonata is more transparent and direct than his other films. It deals with the tension between a neglected daughter and selfcentred mother with his poetic style but also with a personal familiarity that makes the whole film hit a slightly different nerve. I know people who've had to cope with similar circumstances and their experiences were represented boldly without the watering down or trivialisation that you'd expect from something from the past 15 years.There is one quite brief scene in this film that makes the whole thing worth watching multiple times. I count it as some of Ingmar Bergman's best writing.Eva plays for her professional pianist mother Charlotte one of Chopin's preludes she had been practicing for some time. Whilst playing her mistakes and stiffness sets a tense tone as Charlotte is a critical and inconsiderate nightmare of a mother who at any minute would burst out with a cutting criticism. She instead begins a monologue about Chopin's music blending together her experiences of playing his piano music as well as the emotions he evokes. Chopin's emotional strength is not sentimental she says. It's far more credibly affecting than music designed to be manipulative. This begins the downward spiral of the two characters' immediate relationship. It speaks to each of the characters their style of playing representative of their emotional makeup. Charlotte's aversion or ignorance towards affection is displayed clearly. It also plays on another level which I found the most resounding. Bergman's films always deal with heavy emotions but they are never sentimental. They never dress emotions up to be more affecting for the audience than they are for the characters. This honesty in the way he makes films is explored in Charlotte's speech I see him speaking to us saying that he tries hard not to be fake. Not to manipulate us in cheap ways that don't exist in the real world.Bergman is a great director. Autumn Sonata reminded me that at the heart of his talent is his powerful writing. I don't think we'll see a finer writer and director for actresses for a long time to come.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before she was an international star of incomparable charisma and beauty and even before Ingmar Bergman became a legendary director of films bleak and intense Ingrid Bergman played in the Swedish cinema. So it is entirely apropos that someday Bergman might direct Bergman. Ingrid plays Charlotte a concert pianist who has upon the recent death of her longtime lover Leonardo returned to her native land to visit her daughter Eva Liv Ullmann whom she hasn't seen for seven years and her husband Viktor Halvar Bjork who is a minister. Ullmann is frumpish in specs with her hair up and her dress loose and illfitting. She is Ingrid's nerdish daughter who has been throughout her life entirely overshadowed by her glamorous mother. Eva has an unpleasant surprise for mom. Her other daughter Helena Lena Nyman who suffers from a crippling disease perhaps muscular dystrophy is on hand. Eva didn't tell her mother that Helena was now living with them. She says she didn't tell her because she knew that if she had Charlotte would not have come. And so we can guess that there are issues that will come out issues between mother and daughter that have been festering for decades.I got goose bumps seeing Ingrid Bergman as an elderly woman and seeing the smooth graceful style again the elegant presence a hint of the old gestures the sly glances the tentative smiles... It was really wonderful and at the same time disconcerting to examine her face Sven Nykvist's intense close ups expose every inch of skin and sigh and remember and understand the effect of the passing years. Ingrid is elegant but she has been robbed of her beauty so now we are able to see her character unfortunately Ingmar's script allows little of the real Ingrid Bergman to appear. Hers is not a pleasant part to play. She is an entirely selfish and selfcentered woman who has put her career before her family but is unaware of what she has done. Eva seizes this opportunity to punish her mother by dredging up the neglect of her childhood to throw it in her mother's face which perhaps explains why Charlotte hasn't been home in seven years. The sheer cold hatred that Eva expresses is enough to make the devil himself cringe. After a bit one begins to feel sorry for Charlotte despite her failures as a mother to have a daughter so unforgiving and so hateful.Liv Ullmann is rather startling in this portrayal with her penetrating eyes her hard Neandethalish forehead the severe specs and the uncompromising tone of her voice. Charlotte is ashamed and begs for forgiveness and tries to defend herself but it is no use. Eva is too strong for her. This is one of the more intense scenes in cinema and one not easily watched. Meanwhile in the upstairs bedroom and then in the hallway and down the staircase Helena has heard them arguing and is pulling her crippled body over the floor desperately trying to reach them. She cries out Mama! Mama! but is not heard.Viewers might want to pick sides between mother and daughter to say which is the more at fault. Indeed it is hard to say who Bergman himself found more at fault. Perhaps there is no fault only human weakness and stupidity. Such scenes are usually followed by a greater understanding forgiveness and a willingness to start anew. However although Charlotte wants that it is not clear in Bergman's script that anything good will come of what has happened. Charlotte leaves the minister returns to looking at his wife having overheard the argument about which he has said nothing and Eva writes a letter to her mother. It is not clear whether she wants to patch things up or to gain another opportunity to pick her mother to pieces. The viewer is left to decide.Perhaps the best scene in the film is the one that follows dinner the night of Charlotte's arrival in which Eva plays the piano a Chopin prelude. She has worked hard on it and hopes to please her mother. Alas her play is not so good. After all the mother is a genius the daughter only the daughter of a genius. Charlotte sits down next to Eva and takes the keys to gently demonstrate how the piece should be played. We see and feel at once the inadequacy of the daughter in her mother's eyes. It is a great scene filmed with a tight focus on the faces of the two women. When Eva turns to stare at her mother who is of course playing brilliantly with great finesse and touch the expression on Eva's face held for many long seconds is unforgettable.Not to second guess the master but I would have liked to have seen the entire movie played in this a more subtle key than that which followed. However when it comes to dysfunction and disease Ingmar Bergman is unrestrained.Ingrid Bergman was nominated for an academy award for best actress in this her last feature film she had already been diagnosed with cancer but lost out to Jane Fonda in Coming Home 1978.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

	onyx:emotionText "Before she was an international star of incomparable charisma and beauty and even before Ingmar Bergman became a legendary director of films bleak and intense Ingrid Bergman played in the Swedish cinema. So it is entirely apropos that someday Bergman might direct Bergman. Ingrid plays Charlotte a concert pianist who has upon the recent death of her longtime lover Leonardo returned to her native land to visit her daughter Eva Liv Ullmann whom she hasn't seen for seven years and her husband Viktor Halvar Bjork who is a minister. Ullmann is frumpish in specs with her hair up and her dress loose and illfitting. She is Ingrid's nerdish daughter who has been throughout her life entirely overshadowed by her glamorous mother. Eva has an unpleasant surprise for mom. Her other daughter Helena Lena Nyman who suffers from a crippling disease perhaps muscular dystrophy is on hand. Eva didn't tell her mother that Helena was now living with them. She says she didn't tell her because she knew that if she had Charlotte would not have come.

You then carry it always.This film has one such scene. It involves a Chopin Prelude.Chopin's work is unlike any other composer's it is designed to be played in a way that deviates from the expected with the passion coming not from the notes per se but the space between them and between them and us that when filled affects the placement of the notes in time ever so slightly.This particular prelude can range from one that haunts to one that accuses. I've heard all sorts of different passions depending on who plays and how rich they are as humans. There is nothing in all the world like the many ways this can be filled and the impact it can have when taken seriously.The scene in question is superficially simple the daughter plays the piece rather poorly followed by the mother much more expertly. But the pianist who actually plays Laretei really knows his way around this world and was expertly directed by Bergman. Watch the scene and you'll hear the piece played by Eva in a way that expertly expresses the damage perverted love and sly literateness of her character. Then we have a speech from her Mom about wrestling with it about being emotional but not mawkish feeling not being sentimentality pain and not reverie to be calm clear and harsh to not show the hurt to be restrained.And then she plays and does everything she says not to. Everything. Rather than hinting at yogic control of immense suffering she creates the reverse notion. Rather than phrasing in the small she does it in the large with hesitations not anticipations.

She watches her mother go through this feeling the metapain of her mother the pain of not knowing why her pain isn't genuine and tapping the metapain for the performance. It's an exploitation of cluelessness. Eva recognizes this and it scrambles her soul without her really knowing why. It is a few minutes of the most concentrated emotion you may ever experience in film. Everything that follows is annotation including Eva's awareness and Charlotte's noting of Leonardo's remark to her a sense of reality is a matter of talent.'I've watched a few thousand films many about music.

She has bored Ingrid so much that the cameraman was the only person left to talk to at the end.If your idea of fun is to watch a mother and a daughter confront their inner demons and their troubled past as some critics would probably put it then you'll enjoy this piece of crap. A soap opera nothing more but with better dialog. Except that this time around the acting is worse than usual. Liv is unconvincing screaming and tampertantrums do not necessarily good acting make. Ingrid is a little better but she completely destroys the illusion she creates of being a good actress when we hear her speaking English in 34 scenes. It is when we hear English spoken here that we get a glimpse into how much worse Bergman films would sound if they were in a language we could understand. As it is Bergman quite wisely hides behind Swedish he could have easily made more Englishspeaking movies. When we hear Ingrid in Swedish we don't notice how silly some of the dialog really is. I mean it's still silly but not as silly as when you can actually understand it directly.This oppressive overwrought drama has all the Bergman traits flashbacks marathon dialogs marathon monologues reddishbrown colours that dominate unresolved issues between family members shouting misery wretchedness  and even a crippled person this time. I've always considered it a very cheap dramatic shtick to put a crippled person into the story sort of under the motto if I can't get 'em to cry with the other stuff surely a cripple will get the tears rolling. Check out the truly pathetic scene when Lena is crawling on the floor shouting Mama!. I mean it's so damn manipulative that it can only work with uncritical or inexperienced viewers.Plotwise Bergman really lays on the misery. Not only is Liv scarred for life by her mother's cold behaviour but she also has a cripple sister. And her health has been worsening steadily for years. And Liv thinks about suicide. And she and her husband couldn't have children for a long time. And if you think that was enough for Bergman you're wrong you see Liv eventually gave birth to a son but alas he's dead. And he was just a child of course when he died. Of course. So basically the only disaster Bergman didn't include was the sky falling on everyone's collective heads.I found it rather pretentious you can't have an honest Bergman review without this word how Bergman keeps throwing in all those names of classical composers and their works. It's sort of his way of saying see? I listen to classical music and these are my favourite pieces of it. As if anyone cares what he listens to. You're an educated cultured exNazi we get it.There is an endless scene with Liv and Ingrid that lasts about 20 minutes if I'm not mistaken. If you survive that you can watch any of his other movies. Except The Silence that will test even the most boredomimmune viewer. The melodious softasabird'sbeak Swedish language lends audio beauty to this visual feast. The sound coming out of these actors' mouths are like music to my ears...If you are unhappy with Autumn Sonata which you must be just google Vjetropev Bergman Spoofs and this will lead you to my video clips with the vastly improved movie. Have fun.".

As it is the proceedings is much like an overly exaggerated stageplay where the audience is plied with layers of thick emotions of 'hidden' pain and guilt and nearhysteria just so their minds wouldn't think and the eyes wouldn't stray from the sheer heftiness of things. Audience introspection is minimized and deemed unnecessary. And many of the revelations are closer to the rantings of spoilt children and adults throwing the proceedings between Eva and her mother into the ilks of richspoiltbrats who have the luxury of indulging each other in their own selfloathing.The result is while you admire the actors performance the viewer is kept distant from the 'staged' characters these actors are directed to play. It is akin to watching an indulgent family quarreling amongst themselves but feeling neither sympathy nor empathy but merely curious at the childishly 'dramatic' behavior of these players.The sometimes disjointed flow subtracts rather than add. The most obvious 'subtraction' is near the end where the matriarch played by a wonderful Ingrid Bergman in her swan song 'leaves suddenly'. We are told this but we do not witness this very important departure. Given the overwrought interactions between mother and daughters and the situation that was set up just prior to this 'leaving' there would have been very telling interactions amongst them during the 'leaving'. The matriarch certainly did not disappear quietly into the morning light.In the relatively short 95 mins or so I felt I have just watched a stage play where the focus is on highlighting the skills of the stage and 'staged' actors rather than on the collective strength of a wellscripted and welldirected play. It rarely felt like a movie. I would hesitate to call it 'pretentious' mainly because of the fine acting. In the hands of less able actors such a staged script would fall square into pretentiousness.I am not familiar with Ingmar Bergman's movies  perhaps this is his 'style'. Would recommend Autumn Sonata as a 'study' of dated scripting and movieplay making but not as an engaging movie. Maybe it once was engaging but not today nor likely in the future.".

The cinematography is minimalist when it comes to motions of the camera exquisite when it comes to color and the unforgettable closeup figural compositions .I understand that some might criticize that this film is melodramatic what makes it compelling is it doesn't use cheap tricks to provoke emotion in the viewer it uses brilliant dialog and outstanding pacing to draw the viewer in. Once started it is the character interactions that draw you in more than anything.Bergmann makes us feel for these characters despite their flaws and portrays the utter tragedy of people unable to change or reconcile themselves much like in real life relationships.He knows how to push our buttons as humans but doesn't do it to give us nightmares but to expand our understanding of the human dilemma. This is one of a handful of films that I've watched out of hundreds of classics that has truly moved me emotionally. Another poster said that this movie isn't gender specific I agree entirely and argue that this film deals with universal truths between offspring and parent not just mother and daughter issues or the problem of divorce or abandonment. Sure there are directors that can shock you or give you nightmares or make you cry Gaspar Noe Lukas Moodysson Lilia 4 Ever as two examples. This is different but I can't place my finger on exactly what... I can get the sense that Lars von Trier's pursuit of somewhat melodramatic plots in movies like Breaking the Waves might have some roots in Bergman's work".

	schema:reviewBody "Autumn Sonata as it is stated on the commentary on the DVD plays like a real sonata where it starts slow builds to a high peak and then descends in its finale. If the film might not be one of Bergman's most striking or overwhelming feats visually his script provides for its stars some of their best work. In some circles the combination of Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullmann might be comparable to the incredible stature of Pacino and De Niro in Heat you almost might think who will top who in their given role going into it. While some have put more credit to the late Ingrid for her role as Charlotte the absentee piano master mother and she does deserve as much credit here as she does for her more wellknown work from the 40s Ullmann as usual connects so strongly and passionately with the material that it could rank as one of her very best in her collaboration with Mr. Bergman. And there is per usual with the director's work this need to tell this story of these characters who are damaged and in a disconnected pain with one another that is hidden until it finally has to come pouring out with an everlasting effect on both sides. If Strindberg did Lifetime this would be it.But what's interesting as well as comparatively with the bulk of the film slightly underwhelming are a couple of the early scenes as the mother talks to herself of course as in theater for the audience's benefit and the subtle touches of the already felt strain in the motherdaughter relationship. There are some words from Ullmann's husband as well but his function in the film is more as sorrowful observer. Also there is the most devastating character of the ill girl Lena who has become worse over the years. Then in the middle of the night the confrontation and really confessional from daughter to mother comes out and it is really the kind of despairingly bitter but completely honest drama that could only be palatable from this director from these actors who believe in the characters this much.While there are many a sad crushing moment in these twenty to thirty minutes of this hidden terrible lot of anguish from the daughter to the stunned and crushed mother maybe my favorite scene of the film is also one of the subtler ones and tells a great deal about their relationship. Bergman shows her daughter how to play a Chopin piece after she plays it in a way that isn't totally emotionally correct for her. Both times the piece is played the camera stays totally on the one listening to the other playing and each actress says so much without saying anything at all Bergman with disconcerting judging eyes and minor expressions and then Ullmann who looks on complacently still almost numb to what is going on. And the musical piece itself has a level of significance considering its maybe one of the only pieces of music heard in an otherwise dialogcentric picture that adds some weight to the material.If it might not be as exceptional as for example Bergman's Scenes From a Marriage it may be because Bergman is aiming a little smaller and with a more concentrated shorter view of these people in 90 minutes. But even if it isn't one of his very best films it is one of his more memorable ones at sticking a totally theatrical tone with the script while also keeping tight enclosing closeups on his actors. And probably a few of the points must go to the players themselves whom have a challenge in the way of their characters not having at all a simple 'heartoheart' and without an ending that makes everything clear. Autumn Sonata shows heartbroken characters and it's not as easy to take as a runofthemill drama or play.".

Ingrid Bergman is truly a great actress! Infact the entire cast was incredible! The scenes between the mother and daughter absolutely blew me away I've never seen that kind of emotion acted out to such perfection.This is one of the few PERFECT movies I have ever seen. I recommend this film wholeheartedly!";

But they look to the wrong places all throughout the movie. Autumn Sonata sometimes gets lost in the shuffle of the many other Bergman masterpieces such as Wild Strawberries and The Seventh Seal. However this along with Scenes from a Marriage are his most deep and heartfelt films. A Masterpiece in every sense of the word. One that must be experienced with your whole heart and will have you grabbing your seat as the letter is read at the end of the movie. Liv Ullman is rivaled in this film only by her other performances. And Ingrid Bergman is devastating in her only Ingmar Bergman role.".

	schema:headline " Another charming film from the master Willi Forst...";
	schema:reviewBody "Decades ago I discovered by accident Masquerade In Vienna 1934 aka Maskerade. Possibly the finest film made about the charm that once was old Austria. Forst was first an actor and then grew into a writer director and producer. He stayed in Germany during the thirties and did not help the Nazis. As far as I could tell he tried to celebrate the charm of his childhood memories of Austria. As the years went by he grew as a storyteller and in my opinion ranks alongside other polished stylist of graceful cinema Ernst Lubitsch and Max Ophuls. As for the story of this particular film let me use this description... SPOILERS This German crime drama was based on a true story. WillI Forst stars as a poverty stricken Italian glazier Vincenzo Peruggia who falls in love with French hotel maid Mathilde played by Trude von Molo. Struck by the girl's resemblance to Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa he manages to steal the painting from the Louvre in hopes of impressing his sweetheart. But when the girl proves to be a fickle sort the crestfallen hero confesses his crime and is carted off to jail. Unwilling to admit that he'd been led astray by a woman Forst claims that he stole the Mona Lisa to restore it to his native Italy and as a result is hailed as a national hero! Raub der Mona Lisa was distributed in the U.S. by RKO Radio under the title The Theft of the Mona Lisa. One reviewer put it this way... DER Raub der Mona Lisa The Theft of the Mona Lisaa moving picture with an original plot idea! The reaction of the critic is to rush out and call a meeting of earnest thanksgiving for this unique gift of the gods. Not that there are not plenty of novel ideas displayed in the making of films. Actors occasionally have a few and directors are overstuffed with them. But if a scenario writer proposes an original theme it has to go through the mill of the scenario conferences the objections of the production managers the revisions of the director and the demands of the leading players. So it usually comes out squashed back into one of the old formulas. All the more credit to the Superfilm that they let Walter Reisch's manuscript get through so completely intact.For in this Mona Lisa film the hero is no hero at all and the heroine is anything but that. The chief male figure is a sympathetic but very weak and sentimental young man while the female is attractive but quite coldhearted. And there is no lingering embrace to close the picturethe hero gets a jail sentence and the heroine a nice stinging moral slap in the face.In detail the story is this A young Italian glazier living in Paris is commissioned to set glass over the Mona Lisa and is fascinated by the picture. A new maid in the house opposite him has a very strong resemblance to the woman of the painting and the youth falls in love with her. The girl is interested in him as she believes him to be a rich young artist but drops him immediately she finds out his real position in life. In order to do something to impress her he steals the Mona Lisa from the Louvre. But she does not believe that he is the thief and goes away with a traveling salesman. Although the police are up in the air about the robbery an agent sent by an American millionaire to buy the painting ferrets out the thief and makes him a stupendous offer for the picture. But he turns it down and sets out on a crazy journey to Italy with the painting strapped to a hurdygurdy. He offers the picture to a dealer in Florence for a paltry sum but the American agent who has been following him now notifies the police and he is arrested. The girl learns from the papers that he really did steal the painting for her and appears in the court room hoping to be made the center of interest by his confession. But when the youth does speak he states that his reason for the theft was to be revenged on Napoleon who had stolen so many works of art from Italy. Although the judges have to sentence him the Italians believe and make a hero of him. And the girl is left completely out of it her vanity deeply wounded.And how charmingly Gezy von Bolvary the director of Zwei Herzen im Dreiviertel Takt has set this story onto the screen! It is always light and pictorial the dangerous moments of sentimentality are skillfully avoided. For the connoisseur of film technique there are innumerable delicate touches. Willi Forst whom you will probably remember from Bolvary's earlier pictures was by no means ideal for the Italian but his pleasing quality and his sense of the picturesque keep the part discreetly within the frame. And Trude von Molo brings all the beauty that was needed for the Mona Lisa's double.".

The two main characters who are brothers make their way to a Japanese Buddhist Monastery to escape their lives and their troubles. The trip to the Monastery is great. However once at the Monastery the film slows down too much. Too many shots of people banging drums in ritualistic bliss. Thankfully the film soon picks up again with main characters gaining new perspectives on life.  Throughout the film cemeteries homeless people and ravens are referenced leaving the viewer to figure some things out on their own. If you like funny semideep movies with no effects or explosions you may really dig this.

However education about Buddhism is required I think for real appreciation of the film's layers of story telling. The independent film feeling was really charming. Ochsenknecht and Wohler work well as a comic team. The monastery scenes were fascinating and fun. There is a whole self consciousness of the play as a play that I really liked. It seemed more like small alternative theater than film at times. I don't think this could be a commercial hit simply because it takes a certain level of education and understanding of philosophy to get many of the jokes. The small audience with whom I saw the film were split down the middle. Half of them seemed as delighted as I was. Half seemed bored and restless. The German speakers near me were laughing as often and as loudly as I was. My own education in Buddhist practices was a major source of my appreciation for the film I think. Well worth seeing if you can find it.".

	schema:reviewBody "To live is to suffer says brother Gustav blissfully. Buddha's first noble truth.Enlightenment Guaranteed a German Zen comedy is an amazing film that succeeds on several levels as an insight into Buddhist philosophy and practice as the maturing process of two brothers and as a look at the hectic world of Tokyo Japan. I won't guarantee you'll be enlightened but I'm sure you'll be entertained.Shot with digital video the film revolves around two brothers Gustav Gustav Peter Whler a single Feng Shui consultant and Uwe Uwe Ochsenknecht a salesman whose wife and children have just left him. After his brother's marital breakup Gustav reluctantly takes Uwe with him to the Sojiji Soin Father Temple a Zen monastery in Monzen outside of Tokyo.Their adventures in Tokyo are funny and touching. One time they get lost and cannot find their way back to their hotel. Another time they run out of money and are bilked by a singing ATM machine in a hilarious sequence. Finally they end up sleeping in cardboard boxes then in a tent next to a railroad train. The two are thoroughly spent when they finally arrive at Monzen. There is a stunning contrast between the frenetic pace of Tokyo and the serene setting of the monastery.The brothers have to get used to getting up at 430 A.M. taking cold baths running cleaning rags across the floor and the elaborate unwrapping of eating utensils. Roles are reversed to a certain extent as Gustav buckles under pressure while the uninitiated Uwe merely along for the ride proves surprisingly adaptable to the rigors of monastery life. The two brothers gradually lose control of their lives and learn to live in the present. As the Abbot of Monzen explains enlightenment is not the achievement of something but the absence of something. In Uwe's case it might be the absence of attachment to the circumstances of his life.Enlightenment Guaranteed is a celebration of the act of looking within ourselves to unravel the mysteries of who we really are. The clanging of the various chimes and gongs the beating of the drums and the meditation rituals of the Buddhist monks create an atmosphere of calm and spirituality that left me with a feeling of joy.".

	schema:headline " A first steps into Buddhism";
	schema:reviewBody "Enlightenment Guaranteed is a German movie that was directed by Doris Drrie. The genre of this film is drama and comedy. The main characters of this movie are two German brothers Uwe and Gustav who spend some time in the Japanese Buddhist monastery at Monzen. Prior to this trip one of the brothers Gustav was actually a follower of Buddhism and originally he wanted to visit this monastery alone. However his brother Uwe faced serious family problem when his wife left him and took all their 4 children with her. Being upset and angry at his wife Uwe persuaded Gustav to take him to the trip to the Buddhist monastery and that is how their story began. First of all we can clearly identify main Buddhist notion through this movie. All of their personal problems that they face in Germany along with the hardships faced in Japan such as getting lost and losing all belongings shows the Buddha's teaching that life is a suffering. Gustav as a person more familiar with this religion understands this idea and tries to comfort his brother during these hard times. All of the problems that they faced actually made it possible for them to better understand the Buddhist ideas. Furthermore one of the good features of these movie is the detailed demonstration of the life of the monastic community the sangha. Almost half of the movie is devoted to the life in the monastery of two brothers where we can see the daily routine of all monks. When two main characters share their fears and problems with the monk viewers also are able to see some of the Buddhist ideas. The interesting point is that the advices given by the monk can actually relate to all people even who are not familiar with Buddhism. With regard to the production of this movie one of the interesting features is that it looks like a documentary film. All of the actors in this movie play characters with their own name that is why viewers have a feeling that everything happened is based on the real events. In addition the montage of the movie resembles documentary because some of the shots added were video fragments that two brothers have recorded during this trip. Some of the fragments resembles a personal diary or sometimes an interview that makes the movie a little bit special. However one of the things that may disappoint viewers is the duration of the movie. It seems like the story line was extended on purpose and some of the scenes included have no meaning in the movie that is why viewers can get bored while watching this film.  In conclusion this movie can help people who are not familiar with Buddhism to become acquainted with it as this movie introduces one of the main teachings of Buddha that life is a suffering and it successfully shows the life of the sangha in the monastery. This can be counted as a first step in learning about the religion. Even though the resemblance with documentary film makes Enlightenment Guaranteed unique for that time the duration of the film and the development of the story line makes this movie less interesting. I evaluate this movie as 810.".

	onyx:emotionText "Enlightenment Guaranteed is a German movie that was directed by Doris Drrie. The genre of this film is drama and comedy. The main characters of this movie are two German brothers Uwe and Gustav who spend some time in the Japanese Buddhist monastery at Monzen. Prior to this trip one of the brothers Gustav was actually a follower of Buddhism and originally he wanted to visit this monastery alone. However his brother Uwe faced serious family problem when his wife left him and took all their 4 children with her. Being upset and angry at his wife Uwe persuaded Gustav to take him to the trip to the Buddhist monastery and that is how their story began. First of all we can clearly identify main Buddhist notion through this movie. All of their personal problems that they face in Germany along with the hardships faced in Japan such as getting lost and losing all belongings shows the Buddha's teaching that life is a suffering. Gustav as a person more familiar with this religion understands this idea and tries to comfort his brother during these hard times. All of the problems that they faced actually made it possible for them to better understand the Buddhist ideas. Furthermore one of the good features of these movie is the detailed demonstration of the life of the monastic community the sangha. Almost half of the movie is devoted to the life in the monastery of two brothers where we can see the daily routine of all monks. When two main characters share their fears and problems with the monk viewers also are able to see some of the Buddhist ideas. The interesting point is that the advices given by the monk can actually relate to all people even who are not familiar with Buddhism. With regard to the production of this movie one of the interesting features is that it looks like a documentary film. All of the actors in this movie play characters with their own name that is why viewers have a feeling that everything happened is based on the real events. In addition the montage of the movie resembles documentary because some of the shots added were video fragments that two brothers have recorded during this trip. Some of the fragments resembles a personal diary or sometimes an interview that makes the movie a little bit special. However one of the things that may disappoint viewers is the duration of the movie. It seems like the story line was extended on purpose and some of the scenes included have no meaning in the movie that is why viewers can get bored while watching this film.  In conclusion this movie can help people who are not familiar with Buddhism to become acquainted with it as this movie introduces one of the main teachings of Buddha that life is a suffering and it successfully shows the life of the sangha in the monastery. This can be counted as a first step in learning about the religion. Even though the resemblance with documentary film makes Enlightenment Guaranteed unique for that time the duration of the film and the development of the story line makes this movie less interesting.

	schema:reviewBody "Enlightenment Guaranteed is the movie filmed by a director Doris Dorrie. It tells the viewers a story of two brothers who at a first sight live usual life in Germany. One of them Gustav tries to follow Zen and practices some meditation. At the hard time of their lives both of them go to the monastic temple opposite to Tokyo to seek enlightenment. The author of the movie emphasizes the illusion that westerns see in trying to reach for real Zen and enlightenment.The way Gustav saw Zen Buddhism before going to the temple and after differs. For him at first Zen was more of an illusion to escape the reality of his life. He tried to fill in his life with different kinds of typical Buddhist things that he could find or easily follow. He read about Zen tried to meditate he even had a sandbox to calm him down. He has been shown more a fanatic of a popular mainstream to help him deal with stress. His brother Uwe on the other hand was mocking Gustav for his interest in it. Yet during his hardship he begged him to take him to the temple as well. Even on their way to the temple Uwe was reading Gustav's book on Zen Buddhism and saying some of the key concepts of it about suffering illusion meditation and idea of 'self' or 'noself'. There were no particular Sanskrit names for all these concepts yet they have been illustrated in the way it would be perceived by the usual Western. The pilgrimage to the temple and the life with the monastic community was for them the source to find the inner peace. Yet for both of them it came differently. The film shows how hard both of them to bear the monastic life within the monks. At some point of the movie Gustav even says And then I think to stay cool Gustav. You came here to find inner peace. The monastic life has been shown with great details yet realistic because of the struggles that alienated Gustav and Uwe go through. They have to wake up at 430 AM clean the temple participate in the practices and meditations eat by the rules and repeat the cycle over and over again. The movie seems to be very accurate in this sense. It shows the small details which are a part of Zen monastic life they procedures before they are allowed to eat the way the take chopsticks and even the method of shock during the meditation to achieve satorienlightenment. Both of them do find this trip significant though Gustav finally accepts him as being gay and Uwe seems to be ready to let go the situation that happened with his wife Petra. The sangha community did not help to become truly spiritually enlightened but they did for sure found the peace and courage to come back to their lives and fight or meditate through the struggles. As Gustav said crying about his talk with Abbot He said that I could make mistakes and he'd still care for me. The movie is anthropological unique and very visual. By the usage of different filming techniques or not using them it did not felt like a film or a documentary it felt like an honest diary. In this sense it is phenomenal in showing the inner side of the monastic community the struggle a 'new' monk can go through and the way Zen Buddhism can be seen by the Western people.".

	schema:headline " quite interesting but sometimes boring";
	schema:reviewBody "I have watched a documentary movie named Enlightenment Guaranteed by Doris Dorrie. At the first sight I thought that this movie was produced by the students of any film academy because I was not familiar with German cinematograph before. Only after doing some research I realized that the cast consists of quite famous actors in Germany. I believe that my fist assumption appeared due to the reason that the beginning of the movie was boring. Generally speaking a small number of dialogues makes the viewer bored and does not involve him in the course of the movie. Moreover slow development of the story also forces to turn the movie off as soon as possible. I would like to watch more about the process of coming to the enlightenment rather than family dramas or drunk adventures in Japan.  Speaking about the essence of the film I can say that it was pretty interesting. A typical story of rivalry between two brothers makes each person to see him or herself in the place of main character. The younger one have always tried to be perfect compared to elder because of the fictional and selfimposed complex that parents love one child more than another. Against the backdrop of that complex brotherhood relationships were strained enough and the younger brother Gustav decided to turn to religion. However I think that it was just a tool as he still had bad habits and anger towards his brother Uve while the true Buddhist trying to get good karma and increase merit tries to completely clean the mind of bad things. Gustav was going to go to the trip to Japanese monastery named Mon Zen when the Uve's wife leaved him. After a number of absurd circumstances both brothers went to Japan as they believed that Uve will get distracted from the problems in his personal life. On the contrary he started to hate her wife more and more and on the day of arrival they went to a bar and as a result got lost in the large metropolis without money. However they were lucky to meet a countrywoman in a completely foreign country who helped the brothers to reunite and reach the monastery.  Uve always disregarded Buddhism and laughed at Gustav but when he met so many problems in one moment he began to see the meaning in the Buddha's words and other sutras. If Gustav was aware of monastery life then for Uve it was something new and confusing because monks have completely different lifestyle. Brothers were immersed in the search of who they really are meditated read sutras and so on. But surprisingly Uve made much greater progress that Gustav. I believe that this happened because he focused on the real problems inner thoughts and attempts to understand himself while his brother though about physical pain and was not motivated at all. Moreover in my opinion for Gustav Buddhism is more a lifestyle and instruction set about how to live while for Uve is like a rescue. In conclusion I think that this movie is really good and understandable regardless the shooting quality and directing work. Many concepts such as Four Noble Truth and sungha were explained by simple words and on the real life examples that might help us. In addition there was a drop of humor and drama that diversified the film a little bit. What I liked most is that each viewer might see himself or his problems like cheating of Gustav's wife divorce or again drunk problems. In addition some scenes shot in the form of video diary caused interest inside of me.".

	schema:headline " A comedy worth watching";
	schema:reviewBody "In Enlightenment Guaranteed 1999 a German director Dorris Dorrie showcases the story about the adventures of two brothers with different attitudes and characters on their way to and during their stay at the Japanese Monzen monastery. Uwe  a downtoearth somewhat pessimistic and impulsive salesman is contrasted to his sibling Gustav who at first appears as a calm peaceful meditation practitioner devoted to Zen Buddhism. It follows however that both of them are undergoing middleage crisis while selfcentered Uwe uncompassionate towards his wife and children feels anxious after being left by his family Gustav's life is not as smooth sailing as it may seem as well. In pursuit of finding himself he plans the trip to Zen monastery not far away from Tokyo and after numerous pleadings of Uwe resolves to take his brother with him as well. But once they come to the Japanese capital the brothers face unpredictable circumstances. Left without a penny in their pockets they get lost in the Japanese megapolis but finally figure out a way to get to the monastery where their path to the enlightenment begins...From the opening scene of the film the director made the Buddhist context of the film quite clear while depicting children singing about shining lanterns. Some peculiar Buddhist features can be well observed throughout the movie for instance when the heroes engage in dialogue about existence of no self anatman central to Buddhist philosophy. The primary role ascribed to meditation in this movie sheds light on peculiarities of Zen Buddhism for example. The First Noble Truth recited by Gustav at the beginning is especially relevant for this movie. Uwe engages in repetitive thoughts about the reasons why his wife had left him while Gustav is excessively afraid of notmaking mistakes. When they get in trouble in Japan the episodes are shown when the heroes of the movie feel desperate once they have to sleep in the boxes on the street for instance. They seem to be attached to the material comfort they had which is natural for people like them. But once they are deprived of this comfort they start suffering which is an accompanying component of life according to the First Noble Truth. This movie is a truly useful insight not only to Buddhism but into the life and culture in Japan in general. Busy streets of Tokyo are contrasted to the calm monastic atmosphere. But what is common among all Japanese is the strong discipline. It is so inherent to Japanese culture that it is highly observed in shops and restaurants and also in the monastery. Probably this explains why Uwe and Gustav needed a long time to accustom to certain monastic practices which are alien to their ordinary life. Nonetheless they proved to be hardworking and by the end of their monastic adventure were so internalized that they even engaged in collecting alms. Although the elements and concepts of Buddhism are well represented in the story this is not to say that Buddhism is an overarching and dominating theme of the movie. Instead it can be viewed as a helpful tool accompanying the main characters on the way to the enlightenment. Enlightenment in this context should not be perceived as the Buddhist awakening which one attains while striving to Buddhahood. Instead for the heroes of this movie enlightenment is something personal that is acquired as a result of selfinvestigation and meditation it refers to their ability to become free from previous attachments and fears as well as enables the brothers to look at their lives through a completely new prism. Such understanding of enlightenment might reflect how certain Buddhist notions are viewed from the Western perspective. The work done by film crew is especially worth noting. Notwithstanding its modest budget this movie has successfully combined the elements of comedy that kept the spectator appealing to main characters with elements of documentary which made the movie appear more realistic. The transformation which Gustav and Uwe have undergone on their way to enlightenment is so welldelivered that viewers cannot but feel sympathetic towards these two brothers. Overall this fascinating movie with its nave and attractive characters might barely leave someone indifferent. While it remains doubtful whether one as a viewer can be guaranteed enlightenment it is certainly true that some food for thought and a pleasant spending of time are definitely guaranteed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Very recently actor Gustav Peter Whler had his 60th birthday so I decided to rewatch his possibly most known work Erleuchtung garantiert or Enlightenment Guaranteed is a 105minute live action film from Germany. It was written and directed by Doris Drrie one of Germany's most known female filmmakers for quite a while already. The two main characters in here are portrayed by Uwe Ochsenknecht and GustavPeter Whler and they have the same first names in this film as they do in real life and this also applies to everybody else acting in this movie including Ochsenknecht's sons. Anica Dobra and Heiner Lauterbach are also somewhat known at least here in Germany and they play supporting roles. Lauterbach and Ochsenknecht starred in one of Drrie's most known works in the 1980s Mnner... which was her big breakthrough. I must say I was not a big fan of that one and I am a bit undecided on Drrie. There are works from her that I did not enjoy at all but there are also films that I ended up liking. This one here is definitely one of the latter. It is probably my favorite film from her.I may be a bit biased as I always thought Asia especially Japan was such a fascinating country but I guess Drrie shares my opinion here as she made more films that are set in Japan in the last decades. Actually her most recent work Gre aus Fukushima is one of these as well. And while I thought that this one was an absolutely disastrous watch I must say that all she did wrong in her new project is what she did 100 right in her old project from 1999 here. The main reason for this is Gustav Peter Whler who is just tremendous in here and delivers a careerbest performance. I don't know why he is not enjoying a bigger career but maybe it was just that the character he plays here was perfect for him and not only because the actor is actually a homosexual himself. He made this film work almost on his own. His troubles early on his struggling his path to happiness and finally his comingout. It all worked so well with the approach Whler gave his character and I cannot believe he did not get any awards recognition for his portrayal. Next to him Ochsenknecht looked pretty bland at times but this was just because Whler was so amazing. Ochsenknecht who I don't believe is the most talented actor also did a good job here and was a positive surprise for sure. He started off mediocre but the longer the film went the better he became.This is also true about the movie in general. It was okay early on but needed a while to become really great. Maybe this was intended as it is a parallel to the main characters' state of mind and how they are finally getting on the right path in the last 45 minutes especially Whler's character. It rang very true to me on several occasions and there were many stunningly beautiful shots in here. One of them would be the tent on the tennis court which shows that no matter how absurd it may seem it's all about the harmony and there was a lot of harmony in this final shot with the two protagonists. There are many great quotes and memorable scenes from earlier on as well. I personally am a huge fan of Lost in Translation and if you like Asiathemed films like I do then this one here is exactly the right choice. Or maybe also this can give you a decent idea if you currently feel a bit without direction in your life. I highly recommend the watch. One of Germany's very best from the 1990s and criminally underseen.".

It is probably my favorite film from her.I may be a bit biased as I always thought Asia especially Japan was such a fascinating country but I guess Drrie shares my opinion here as she made more films that are set in Japan in the last decades. Actually her most recent work Gre aus Fukushima is one of these as well. And while I thought that this one was an absolutely disastrous watch I must say that all she did wrong in her new project is what she did 100 right in her old project from 1999 here. The main reason for this is Gustav Peter Whler who is just tremendous in here and delivers a careerbest performance. I don't know why he is not enjoying a bigger career but maybe it was just that the character he plays here was perfect for him and not only because the actor is actually a homosexual himself. He made this film work almost on his own. His troubles early on his struggling his path to happiness and finally his comingout. It all worked so well with the approach Whler gave his character and I cannot believe he did not get any awards recognition for his portrayal. Next to him Ochsenknecht looked pretty bland at times but this was just because Whler was so amazing. Ochsenknecht who I don't believe is the most talented actor also did a good job here and was a positive surprise for sure. He started off mediocre but the longer the film went the better he became.This is also true about the movie in general. It was okay early on but needed a while to become really great. Maybe this was intended as it is a parallel to the main characters' state of mind and how they are finally getting on the right path in the last 45 minutes especially Whler's character. It rang very true to me on several occasions and there were many stunningly beautiful shots in here. One of them would be the tent on the tennis court which shows that no matter how absurd it may seem it's all about the harmony and there was a lot of harmony in this final shot with the two protagonists. There are many great quotes and memorable scenes from earlier on as well. I personally am a huge fan of Lost in Translation and if you like Asiathemed films like I do then this one here is exactly the right choice. Or maybe also this can give you a decent idea if you currently feel a bit without direction in your life. I highly recommend the watch. One of Germany's very best from the 1990s and criminally underseen.";

	schema:reviewBody "Enlightenment Guaranteed is a feelgood comedy in the grand tradition of so many feelgood comedies  it is neither funny nor does it make the viewer feel any better for having seen it.  I have read some reviews that say it is profound and edgy but I believe those reviewers have mistaken nonEnglish dialogue for depth and the stunningly bad handheld video cinematography for artistic purity.Uwe is a kitchen salesman in Munich who likes his sleep and who loves his kids and has a very Western outlook on life.  His brother Gustav is a Feng Shui consultant who structures his life around Zen meditation.  When Uwe's wife leaves with the kids Gustav takes him along on a trip to Japan to the Monzen monastery near Tokyo.Actually the first hour where the brothers lose all their money and can't find their hotel and wander around lost in Tokyo is fairly amusing.  The brothers don't speak Japanese and the locals don't speak German.  The only way they can communicate is in English which neither the brothers nor most of the locals have a firm grasp of.  Especially funny is when Gustav is forced into singing a Germanlanguage version of the disco hit I Will Survive for train fare.But then the brothers eventually find the monastery and the film grinds to a halt.  I guess the audience is supposed to be surprised that the rigid Westerner Uwe is more openminded and better able to adapt to monasticism than the newagey Gustav.  Knowing as I do that Zen is about being connected rather than being detached from reality that plot twist was not shocking to me.  And seeing them perform the same rituals over and over again wasn't enlightening or meditative it was simply numbing.  And there are too many missed avenues of exploration.  For instance both brothers drive their wives away by making their wives do all the work at home they never discuss this topic and it fades away in the first half of the film.  Instead they keep chanting cleaning and making meaningless video diaries ad nauseum.Some people say when praising this film that no Hollywood movie factory would ever make something like this.

	schema:reviewBody "Before I start this review let the words of German director Jorg Buttgereit explain his intentions 'Welcome to a trip into the mind of a serial killer. When Franz Rodekirchen and I sat down to write the script for Schramm we had seen a lot of socalled 'serial killer' moviesit seemed to us that these films were more about some police guys who try to quit smoking because their wife had left them. In the end they hunt the killer down put him in jail and the world is savedSo fk all the police stories. We couldn't afford to rent a police car anyway. So we started concentrating totally on Schramm  the man the loner and his guilt looking for love in a world so far away.' True to his word Jorg Buttgereit does indeed 'fk all the police stories' and concentrate on the lonely emotionally fragile and somewhat psychotic Lothar Schramm Florian Koerner von Gustorf a man living alone in a small flat opposite a prostitute Monika M whom he lusts after. But Schramm isn't too good at malefemale relations indulging himself with a bizarre blowup doll rather than make advances towards his true love. Schramm's problems lie directly in his sexuality killing female victims and putting them in sexual positions for him to photograph and use for his own personal gratification. Schramm punishes himself for his crimes at one point hammering a nail into his foreskin because of the frustration and sexual inadequacy that often provokes him. He dreams of a literal vagina dentata a monstrous toothed female genitalia that crawls in his bed on slippery tentacles towards his crotch. Schramm truly is scared of women the castration scenario quite literal in his head and his rage seems to be stemmed from this. But amongst all of the disturbing imagery and violent rage Schramm dreams of the beach of being a little boy again and of the prostitute who lives over the hall from him.The film is told within a fractured timeline jumping back and forth between the present where a fallen Schramm lays dying and Schramm's past murders. The film is full of disturbing images and hardhitting gore but more interestingly a story of unrequited love. At times it is a hard film to watch with von Gustorf giving a remarkable performance that seems to defy acting conventions giving Lothar Schramm an earthy realistic edge that would be more suited to documentary. The visual style is one of a talented filmmaker with very little money  lots of imaginative movements and angles but with a raw amateurish edge that only serves to heighten the dark edgy world of Lothar Schramm.Bizarrely about half way through the film takes a unique and frightening jump completely out of the narrative to show a man shooting himself in the head outside Schramm's flat as the crew film on supposedly witnessing an unplanned suicide. Although staged this sequence suggests it is snuff and its pure incompatibility with the film takes you completely out of the narrative for a few seconds wondering just what the hell is going on.Buttgereit best known for his super 8mm feature Nekromantik has constructed a unique and powerful film that deals with human feelings and frailties whilst maintaining enough nastiness to please horror fans and a certain arthouse pretension that invites analysis into its narrative and imagery. Not for the fainthearted or those unfamiliar with Buttgereit's work Schramm proves to be a thoughtful intelligent film where not all is what it seems.At only 60 minutes long Schramm won't take too much out of your day but it will stay with you for weeks afterwards leaving indelible images in your head that you wish you could shake off. Like Schramm you might feel a little dirty after watching it but ultimately you'll feel rewarded.".

It uses all of the same themes as his other movies nudity sex mutilation violence killings death but it's more successful with it than usual making this an artistic successful one as well as an powerful one that is being effective with its themes.The movie gives us a real look inside the head of a serial killerrapistnecrophiliac. We see his weird fantasies of extreme violence and sex but we also see his fantasies of how he truly wants to be. The movie doesn't present its main character as a deranged psycho but more as a man who can't help being the way he is. He's struggling with it himself at points but in the end he just can't help being the man that he is. With self mutilation he tries to fight the feelings and punish himself for the deeds he has done but it's all in vein.Yes it's a quite odd movie due to its themes and the way it's being brought to the screen. Jrg Buttgereit often picks the artistic approach and uses some symbolism and metaphors. For this movie he obviously got inspired by Luis Buuel's work. Jrg Buttgereit is like the German Luis Buuel and Takashi Miike though not all of his movies work out as well as this one does.It shows the world as a dirty place. Not only with it's extreme violence or people living in it but also with its almost depressing settings. The main characters apartment looks like it's an outdated '70's bachelor shack in the middle of a bad and poor neighborhood.It's a movie that works on so many levels with its themes and with the story it tries to tell. Jrg Buttgereit always aspires all of his movies to be like this but not all of his work works out as well and successful as this one does though.910httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Jrg Buttgereit is like the German Luis Buuel and Takashi Miike though not all of his movies work out as well as this one does.It shows the world as a dirty place. Not only with it's extreme violence or people living in it but also with its almost depressing settings. The main characters apartment looks like it's an outdated '70's bachelor shack in the middle of a bad and poor neighborhood.It's a movie that works on so many levels with its themes and with the story it tries to tell. Jrg Buttgereit always aspires all of his movies to be like this but not all of his work works out as well and successful as this one does though.910httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com";

Schramm is about a serial killer who through his own nightmarish faults has fallen off a ladder and has knocked himself out. You don't know if he's seriously hurt or just out cold. In the meantime you're shown flashbacks of some of his recent days murdering freaking out and masturbating. Three things that I would say the average maniac killer does on a consistent basis. Schramm seems to have a couple loves in his life one being running and two being his next door prostitute neighbor. And unfortunately for him his mind makes him see awful things that are related to these passions. Anyways Schramm plays out in a artsy way that I thought really worked. And at around an hour long the movie plays out very well. I actually felt for his character a little bit even though he'd probably kill me in a split second if I rang his doorbell. Well after asking me if I'd like something to drink.Schramm was pretty violent pretty disturbing and pretty cool. It's definitely one of the stranger flicks on serial killers I've ever seen and also one of the best.

Lothar Schramm is a solitary and quiet individual who lives in a small apartment complex. The story takes place in a series of flashbacktype shots that are Lothar's memories as he lay dying after a painting accident. Schramm is infatuated with his next door neighbor Monika M of NEKROMANTIK 2 fame who is a prostitute but poor Lothar just can't get the nerve up to act on it. They have a strange friendship which seems to be one of if not the only highlight of Lothar's pitiful lifeother than murder. The entire film is based around Schramm's feelings of isolation loneliness and selfloathing  and the film's style is appropriately downbeat. Gone is the typical bit of dark humor that punctuates Buttgereit's other works. This is a strong film that is not intended for all audiences but is highly recommended to those that can handle stronger material. Not an extremely gory film but there are definitely some rough scenes  1 in particular that will have all the guys squirming. Definitely worth a look especially for Buttgereit fans. 8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the first film I've seen of Buttgereit's and it's mercifully short. Only 65 minutes long.  And if it's any indicator of NEKROMANTIK or DER TODESKING then I think I'll give them a pass too.Two Jesus freaks call up Schramm wanting him to convert.  He invites them in to sit down.  Schramm then comes up from behind and slits the guy's throat and then kills the girl who's with the guy with a hammer.  He then photographs their dead bodies in various poses and likes to put lipstick on them.Schramm also has bizarre sexual fantasies like hammering nails into his dick having sex with his dead female victim and having sex with a plastic blowup vagina.As Schramm repaints the bloodsplattered wall in his apartment he slips and falls killing himself.  The camera lingers on his paint soaked body with the little splatter of blood dripping down into the white paint.  And that's about it.The DVD extras include some early Buttgereit student films he shot back in the 80s trailers for NEKROMANTIK I  II and DER TODESKING.  There's also a documentary on the making of SCHRAMM that's about half as long as the film itself.Some press reviews have compared this to HENRY PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER but I think that they should all get their heads examined because this one doesn't even come close.

	onyx:emotionText "This is the first film I've seen of Buttgereit's and it's mercifully short. Only 65 minutes long.  And if it's any indicator of NEKROMANTIK or DER TODESKING then I think I'll give them a pass too.Two Jesus freaks call up Schramm wanting him to convert.  He invites them in to sit down.  Schramm then comes up from behind and slits the guy's throat and then kills the girl who's with the guy with a hammer.  He then photographs their dead bodies in various poses and likes to put lipstick on them.Schramm also has bizarre sexual fantasies like hammering nails into his dick having sex with his dead female victim and having sex with a plastic blowup vagina.As Schramm repaints the bloodsplattered wall in his apartment he slips and falls killing himself.  The camera lingers on his paint soaked body with the little splatter of blood dripping down into the white paint.  And that's about it.The DVD extras include some early Buttgereit student films he shot back in the 80s trailers for NEKROMANTIK I  II and DER TODESKING.  There's also a documentary on the making of SCHRAMM that's about half as long as the film itself.Some press reviews have compared this to HENRY PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER but I think that they should all get their heads examined because this one doesn't even come close.  It's too arty and boring for that although it doesn't sink into the kind of silliness that a Nick Zedd film would stoop down to.  3 out of 10";

	schema:reviewBody "It wasn't until after my second viewing of this video that it occurred to me maybe this was meant to be a comedy of sorts albeit very black I haven't seen Mr. Buttgereit's other work. The title character Lothar Schramm falls off a ladder in his apartment while painting his wall and dies a news article informs us he was the lipstick murderer. We never actually see him murder anyone except a couple of hapless missionaries who barge into his place bent on saving his soul it turns out to be their blood on the wall that he's later painting. Lothar's only contact with the real world is his job as a taxi driver thanks Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro for establishing permanently that cab drivers are potential homicidal maniacs and his somewhat strained relationship with a neighboring prostitute. Instead of having a pimp for protection she keeps Lothar and his cab standing by while entertaining clients in a mansion. His is mostly a fantasy life and as per Lynch's Eraserhead it's not always clear what's meant to be hallucination or maybe an alternate universe. He wears a leg brace after waking up one morning to discover his leg cut off but still in the bed with him he reacts in his usual comatose manner poking at the stub of his thigh rather as Graham Chapman did with Eric Idle in Monty Python's Meaning of Life so we're inclined to think he's hallucinating yet later it's the braced leg becoming detached again that seems to make him fall off the ladder. In some of the film's many insert shots that may be his memory andor fantasy he's shown manipulating unconscious or dead women in various ways applying lipstick to one tying another's hands behind her back spreading another's legs but in real life he's reduced to masturbating with a plastic inflatable female torso which as a good German he dutifully rinses afterward. In what amounts to the film's only dramatic sequence he and the prostitute go to a restaurant and eat some very unappetizinglooking stuff it's when Germans started getting away from good ol' bratwurst and beer that their downfall began when she holds up some money it makes him think of her with a john then go back to his apartment where he spikes her drink renders her unconscious gradually undresses her while snapping pictures and indulges in the kind of gutter talk he'd never say to her faceyet she wakes up the next morning not having been murdered. In a kind of ironic epilogue after he dies she goes without him to another tryst in the mansion and winds up bound and gagged in a chair suggesting she may die not due to his presence but to his absence. I'm happy to report this is not another cinematic whore with a heart of gold when Lothar tells her about a dream he had that apparently is significant to him she blows it off with some inane remark.All right you may be wondering what is it about all this that strikes you as comedic? Well the background music for one thing especially the moody cello solos contrasting with the drab little lumpenreality of Lothar's life. The best comedy that I've seen is about coping with frustrations of various kinds Lothar's life is one long frustration. Oddly there's no sexual activity on screen or anything particularly erotic which may be frustrating for some viewers. One gathers from Lothar's reveries he was once a runner or at least aspired towards it. His deadpan reaction to everything that happens or seems to even when some kind of toothed vaginamonster appears conjures up Buster Keaton. There's an ostensibly pointless scene showing Lothar and the prostitute walking home past a guy sitting on the sidewalk on whom the camera lingers until he produces a revolver and blows his brains out then a big handsilhouette appears on the screen several times as though Mr. Buttgereit then a young wiseass under thirty is daring us to take it seriously. Finally in a foggy postmortem sequence that may be the afterlife or the now nude Lothar's fantasy of it a young blond dude wearing a shawl appears and takes a vicious swipe at the cameraa kind of final celestial Eff you? ....I guess it's obligatory to respond to the famous scene of Lothar driving nails through his foreskin. As a nongay circumcised man I had never seen one of those so there was some novelty value to it. I doubt it's the most queazeinducing thing you'll ever see in a movie it's hard to beat the shot of the guy pounding a piece of metal into his leg in Tetsuo or more recently the eyeball scene in Hostel ...If I could hark back for a moment to the scene of the missionaries getting murdered not to pick on this movie in particular but this is about the umpteenth time in cinema where we have one killer and two or more victims and while the killer is busy with the first victim the second victim just sits or stands there screaming or staring or crying instead ofoh I don't knowmaybe running away or maybe trying to help the first victim by attacking the killer or something. We've all heard of the fight or flight response in situations of great stress? Well what's more stressful than seeing someone getting murdered right in front or one? To borrow an example from real life when Jack Kennedy got shot in Dallas we all saw on the Zapruder film how Jackie tried to haul ass out of the car.... But then an awful lot of psycho killer flicks would've needed to be rewritten....".

Of course not everything in it is. But some of the scenes in Schramm have such wonderful cinematography that really hard to imagine that it's such a low budget film. Buttgereit really has a great artistic style.Many people think that the film is just another gore film from the guy who made Nekromantic well I can tell them that they're wrong. This film is not something you would see for gore and blood. Even there are a few really nasty scenes which are really nasty.Now the music is one of the best highlights of the movie it really has a special atmosphere a very dark and weird atmosphere too. And if you get the 2disc DVD you get the movie soundtrack on a CD which I personally recommend.Not for the general horror fan but defiantly for any Buttgereit fans. Some would say that the movie is a little slow but I don't agree. Watch it twice.".

As with NEKROMANTIK its sequel and DER TODESKING this one here deals with the typical stuff like violence sex mutilation and murder. This one here also comes across more like an art film than just some cheap directtovideo horror film. This one manages to work once again because the director clearly has talent and makes you realize it even if you might be turned off by the subject matter.This one here clocks in at just 66minutes so there's really no fat or scenes that are just dragged out for no reason. I really thought the director did a fine job at getting us into the mind of this killer and you can tell what a messed up person he is. I thought the relationship with the neighbor who just happens to be a hooker was quite believable and in a strange way you care for both of them. Both von Gustorf and Monika are good in their roles and this certainly helps.SCHRAMM certainly isn't a movie that's going to appeal to everyone as there's a lot of blood some really graphic violence and of course some bizarre sexual stuff.

It only runs for slightly over an hour. Then again he has also made short films so maybe not even this is a good aspect. If you know Buttgereit you know what to expect. Lack of story bad acting and everything the movie does is follow up on one disgusting scene with the next one. It doesn't matter if it's sexual violent or sexist. There is nothing wrong with that if you manage to constrict a convincing story about these displays like Tarantino does for example all the time but Buttgereit does not and he simply has no talent as a filmmaker at all. This is a repulsive film from start to finish. It is kinda interesting to see some cast members' names such as Xaver Schwarzenberger or lead actor Florian Koerner von Gustorf and what direction their careers took in the 20 years after this film here. Quite a good chance that this is the worst career effort by many people in here. Unless they starred in other Buttgereit films. Highly not recommended.".

Lack of story bad acting and everything the movie does is follow up on one disgusting scene with the next one. It doesn't matter if it's sexual violent or sexist. There is nothing wrong with that if you manage to constrict a convincing story about these displays like Tarantino does for example all the time but Buttgereit does not and he simply has no talent as a filmmaker at all. This is a repulsive film from start to finish. It is kinda interesting to see some cast members' names such as Xaver Schwarzenberger or lead actor Florian Koerner von Gustorf and what direction their careers took in the 20 years after this film here. Quite a good chance that this is the worst career effort by many people in here. Unless they starred in other Buttgereit films. Highly not recommended.";

	schema:reviewBody "Schramm is a movie that really impressed me. It's one of those rare movies that stand above the typical serial killer movie. I would say that it definitely belongs to the best within the genre.It's not a movie with a typical story line. Instead we are dragged in to Lothar Schramm's mad mind. The soundtrack the grain of the film the camerawork it all adds to a grim and disturbed feeling of madness and desolation.SpoilersLothar Schramm is a very lonely man. On one hand he is quite modest charming and even protective in his normal contact with his befriended neighbor a prostitute. Secretly though he lusts for her but he can't find a normal way to make it work. So when he gets the chance he abuses her but without her knowing about it. Still she comes off pretty well as other people get brutally slaughtered by him. His only way to get intimacy is with the dead or unconscious. And for sure he is not left cold by this as multiple scenes make very clear that he is struggling with himself big time. He also punishes himself and it is one brilliantly painful graphic scene.. very well done! for what he is for what he does.There is quite some metaphorical stuff. For example the cutoff and the fake leg. My idea of that is that he sees himself as not capable to have both legs firmly on the ground. He is in a way handicapped he is loosing control and it shows through the image of the leg. At the end it kills him. Lothar Schramm really fears female intimacy and it's IMO the fear of being emotionally castrated which is shown in his hallucinations of the teethed vagina.  End of spoilersThis whole movie is not linear in time line. This only adds more to the madness of it. It is also a movie in which repressed sexuality and frustration have the constant overtone. Lust frustration and to a lesser extent but definitely there rage. Schramms repressed sexuality seeps through in the whole movie and I found this to be really strong and impressive. Jrg Buttgereit did a brilliant job in sucking us in to the deranged world of a sad and lonely but also very disturbed and dangerous madman. This film is definitely not for everyone! What I do like about it other people might totally dislike. The fact that it's not really a story for example at least not in the way most plots are worked out. It's more a series of events scrambled up. It's not as much a normal film but more an experience. It also has an amateuristic feel to it which you may dislike but which I think works perfectly for Schramm. It's never polished it never just shines in cinematic perfection it has no ambitions in being anything even close to a Hollywood production. Instead it is raw very raw. It's grainy gritty uncomfortable. And wow did I like it!".

This wasn't a gore feast of an angry guy running around killing people. This was a very lonely man who felt bad for what he did and without a word he expressed how guilty he was and the mental anguish he felt for what he was doing.

I find in a lot of scary movies they just can't quite grab me on that one.

This movie is almost in the vein of Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer but it is much more graphic and poetic then Henry could ever imagine. Now I had read ALOT about this movie as I am a big Jorg Buttgereit fan so I knew what the movie was about and how it was going to end and blah blah blah. But when I actually bought a copy of it and sat down and watched it I was completely blown away. It wasnt ANYTHING what I thought it was going to be and I mean that in an extremely good way!
