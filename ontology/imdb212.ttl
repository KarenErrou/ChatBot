But my second reason for loving this film is far more personal.  As a teenager growing up in Hollywood during the early 1980s I knew nothing about Wim Wenders or film history but friends guided me to this film because of the soundtrack and the images at the end inside an RV wandering aimlessly in Hollywood.  This is as far as I know the first film to use either X or Joe Ely in the soundtrack.  It also captures a lost city with amazing precision almost every shot at the end contains some nostalgic element from Tiny Naylor's drivein to the Parisian Room from Schwab's Pharmacy to the white smog in Laurel Canyon.

The value of this tends to decrease in the face of the fact that we never really get to know the characters in the first place. So this story seems to play like an everextending observation into enigmas where each answer is really a question like the cinematic equivalent of the Jeopardy! game show.There are moments of true beauty there's no denying that. But the beauty comes in the cinematography the silences  not in the dialogue. The multiple cinematographers create a nice feel together a fantastic series of images. The State of Things is almost always worth looking at just not always engaging to fully experience. The ending is somewhat of a curiosity. Neither particularly disastrous nor completely convincing.

This one of the most beautifully shot movie in black and white I've seen and it helps to set the overall atmosphere of the film. The cast is great and the story flows right along.

This one of the most beautifully shot movie in black and white I've seen and it helps to set the overall atmosphere of the film. The cast is great and the story flows right along.

First be it known that I am a big fan of Wenders which is the entire reason why I should seek out The State of Things and purchase it on DVD.It was an enormous disappointment. First the acting is a disgrace almost from start to finish across almost the entire cast. I except the children. Not just bad in the sense that I wished they could do better but bad in the sense of obvious errors even an amateur should not make mugging for the camera flat tone banal delivery etc.. This is odd for a Wenders film so it is not surprising to learn he borrowed the cast from another production.Second the music is annoyingly underdeveloped and cheesy in pseudoporno mode. Third Wenders lays on the meaning so thick and heavy that it takes no great intelligence to get the point... when there is one. And finally the plot is full of pointless moments scenes extended long past their best before date and inanities.As a fan of Wenders none of this surprises me! That is because my love for his filmmaking is predicated on his ability to take risks real risks risks that can lead to a complete failure... and they regularly do! This also allows him to make utterly divine films like Wings of Desire and Paris Texas. The End of Violence and Until The End of The world flawed though they are remain among my favourite celluloid experiences. Others still manage to be far more interesting than this effort Lisbon Story Alice in the Cities The American Friend even Land of Plenty and Faraway So Close. Once you've seen all those other films you might want to grab this one but only for one reason......the cinematography! Henri Alekan's work is as always truly divine. And completely wasted on this film which I can only begrudgingly give three stars two for his work and one for the finale which contains 30 seconds of REAL filmmaking.".

If The State Of Things is to set some standards for the rest of his film creations I think I'll stop trying to understand him. The reason for borrowing this film on DVD from the local library was the director's name and that it has been honored with The Golden Lion at Venice Film Festival. Even though I expected it to be a strange story special a study in pictures and with little dialogue and by all means avant garde I didn't think the quality of main elements would be this poor. The music mirrors the time era but is totally over exposed and annoying all the way from the start. Then there's the acting and the banal way the actor's deliver their lines. Artificial. What's the intention? With a scenography and costumes that looks like an early 80's parody over something in between Plan 9 From Outer Space and Flash Gordon it's more than enough to make it difficult whether if one should laugh or cry or simply get disillusioned. The conclusion is that Wenders was declared a genius at the time and that he also had some more or less fanatic fans in the jury at the Venice Film Festival. Yes he was odd and different but that alone does not make this film brilliant. It says more about the state of minds of the director and the members of the jury mentioned. It's absolutely not interesting.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1981 Raoul Ruiz made a little film called Territory  a group of people lost in a landscape where without the signifiers of story or a map to guide them we saw how they fell apart in all sorts of hierarchies and explanatory dogmas. The allegory was about us and the stories we make up. A central image was a map as a series of heads within heads minds within minds  where the world starts. I've written a comment on IMDb.At that time Wenders was waiting for money to come together for the Hammett film he was going to do for Coppola floundering. Somehow he arranged to borrow Ruiz' cast  crew from that film to make this one in Portugal about the frustration. I had in fact marked this to see soon after Territory but other things intervened I never took much to Wenders so it was kind of forgotten.As I return to it I find many of the same pros and cons of the man. First the spin on Ruiz playful referential. The same people lost in a landscape but as they find their way to an abandoned seaside resort we realize they're actors in a film. They ran out of film to shoot with and have to wait as phonecalls are being made and the American producer is sought out. This lets Wenders capture the Hammett frustration  he shows a languishing with nothing to do.More important though without thesignifiers of story and images to mark time real life opens for these people who now have to be themselves and not in a film. The German director in a speech says that 'stories are only found inside stories real life is where there are no more stories' a banal aphorism like the French were doing years before  the obvious side of Wenders.With nothing to do we see how they're all embroiled in stories of their choosing how they keep trying to imprint meaning it's what we all do foisting concept on things to explain existence. A log smashes through a window and the director has to quote from a book how it's a sign of evil it cannot be just a log brought by the wind. Another one is awed that the ocean indicated on a globe is in fact what's right out his window  the real thing has been there all this time. A woman says that she's glad they're not filming says it to the camera as she has her picture taken.Ruiz would soon have all this in a magical timeflow images of mind from inside of it Wenders is looking for the ground beneath images that gives rise to them  the most difficult thing. So we have a second shift to now a Wenders film purely about the search and what better place to unfold than Hollywood? We fly to the place that gives rise to images and drive around looking for the producer in ultimate control of them.This was a great choice  now we can have just the city the coming and going of things through the eyes. So what real life does he find beneath the stories?A wandering around town looking for someone the wandering as life. Some expertly photographed atmospheres of streets but it numbs. Still the same lack of satisfaction so long as we depend on something out there to happen outside of us.So an emptiness but emptiness for Wenders is modern monotony instead of vital in the Buddhist understanding lucid receptive to things. It's what he missed again in his Ozu film after this. This isn't Zen as people sometimes say Zen would be to see mundane life as the open ground of possibility this merely records confines of unfulfillment aimless driving around to cheat death.Someone could say this all perfectly captures a malaise we know too well. But it does so as a coffeetable book about it with cinematic time unspooled as only a style to hang around in. There's talk about Bogart films a theater plays the Searchers  it fits nicely with that cinematic culture built by the French around reference but it seems small stuff. And even so what can be the use of saying life is aimless? The finale with trying to spot unseen gunshots with a camera is difficult to watch filming trying to see where death swoops from and the last breath as image. This because it could have been powerful  I think of the end of The Passenger. But how sophomoric it looks how film school ish in its reach of a great matter. Still it's better to confront this and decide than never to contemplate the thing.".

But it does so as a coffeetable book about it with cinematic time unspooled as only a style to hang around in. There's talk about Bogart films a theater plays the Searchers  it fits nicely with that cinematic culture built by the French around reference but it seems small stuff. And even so what can be the use of saying life is aimless? The finale with trying to spot unseen gunshots with a camera is difficult to watch filming trying to see where death swoops from and the last breath as image. This because it could have been powerful  I think of the end of The Passenger. But how sophomoric it looks how film school ish in its reach of a great matter. Still it's better to confront this and decide than never to contemplate the thing.";

I had never heard of it and would not have come across it if I hadn't attended a multiweek festival of the films of director Wim Wenders at the IFC theater in New York at which the director appeared several times for interviews and Q  A sessions.The State of Things should be seen by anyone who loves or even likes movies. I purposely say movies rather than film because you don't have to be a certified cinaste to appreciate it. Plain old popcornmunching movie lovers will enjoy it as well. Mr. Wenders BTW seems to be both. No contradiction there.Details of the plot can be found in other reviews but in summary an international cast and crew shooting a movie off of the coast of Portugal is left high and dry by the producer when they learn that there is not enough money available to continue the project. The director hasn't been able to reach the producer by phone so he flies to L.A. to talk to him and try to find out what's going on. This is where the plot thickens and you will have to see the movie to learn how it unfolds. Besides extolling the merits of the movie itself the ensemble cast and the director my main motivation for writing this review is to praise the outstanding performance of Allen Goorwitz aka Allen Garfield as the errant producer. Mr. Goorwitz is listed first in the acting credits on IMDb but he doesn't appear until about 45 minutes before the film ends and he is in every scene until the credits roll. It is well worth the wait. His portrayal of the character is a priceless tourdeforce.This extraordinary character actor began his career learning his craft at The Actors Studio in New York where he studied with Lee Strasberg and Elia Kazan. With those credits it is not surprising that he turned out to be one of those actors who doesn't look like he's acting a description usually associated with big name Method Actors such as Marlon Brando and James Dean.If you are a movie lover who has ever yearned for a film that has something different while still being very accessible and not too artsy put The State of Things at or near the top of your list. You will have to search for it but your efforts will be amply rewarded.".

	schema:reviewBody "We purchased this movie because we learned that Gilda starred in it right before her death. I had wanted to introduce my daughter to Gilda's interesting style of humor and since she loves Gene Wilder so much we watch Young Frankenstein twice a week at least she instantly loved this one as well.At first the plot line is terribly hard to fathom and I had to watch it several times to catch all the straggling ends. However once you understand what's really happening the story within the story within the story then you can really begin to enjoy the subtle jokes the attention to detail in the sets and costumes the excellent performances by one and all. Of course Gene and Gilda are enchanting together and she shines in her role as only she could do. Dom DeLuise played the GreatAunt perfectly but my favorite in the movie was Jonathan Pryce whose performance was exceptional. My granddaughter's favorite part of the movie is Gilda and Dom's singing and dancing to Ball in the Jack. We have to play that part over and over for her so she can dance with them.Haunted Honeymoon is worth watching several times and worth returning to often.".

Naturally as you get older you see things with different eyes and what I remembered as a scary tale of Werewolves is actually a rather sweet funny and hugely entertaining trip down memory lane.It's tragic to think that this was Gilda Rander's before she tragically lost her life but she gives a sparkling performance and bounced of husband Gene Wilder beautifully.It's a great little tail of Werewolves deception Transvestism and jealousy.I have never been able to decide who's the funniest whether it's Aunt Kate or Rachel both are so much fun Rachel played by Ann Way is a joy especially when she's bashing poor Pfister about she's a diminutive terror.The music is really nice the whole way through it's so dramatic it fits in great with the film real 80's Chiller feel to it.I am stunned by the bad reviews that surround this film to me it's just a bundle of fun. Take Dom LeLuise's performance for what it is hugely over the top but truly funny.Best scene has to be Eagle Rock which is a show stopper I love it Gilda had gorgeous legs. You can't help but smile watching it.What happens to Larry's old girlfriend Susan where does she go?? Was the Werewolf talking to Susan in the Wine Cellar don't know.I grew up on this film and I still love it sure it's daft but it doesn't try to be anything else.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gene Wilder was back at the triple threat in 1986. Writing directing and starring in Haunted Honeymoon with wife Gilda Radner and Dom DeLuise Wilder was at his best. It's funny to watch interviews of Wilder during the filming of Haunted Honeymoon in which he expresses with exasperation that he is finished directing and wonders if all the work is worth it. This is funny because the film was his best funniest most coherent final product out of all of his directing projects. Much more under control Haunted Honeymoon was the hilarious comedic masterpiece I always hoped Gene Wilder was capable of.Larry Abbot Gene Wilder and Vickie Pearle Gilda Radner are on top of the world as the stars of the hit radio program Manhattan Mystery Theater. The pair is also engaged to be married adding to their overall joy about life. As the nuptials loom Larry takes Vicki back to his Aunt Kate's Dom DeLuise castle that he grew up in. As his eccentric family members descend upon the castle his Uncle decides Larry needs to be cured of his frequent bursts of fear. Larry's Uncle Dr. Paul Abbot Paul L. Smith decides that the only way to cure Larry of his disposition is by scaring him to death. The family bands together by forming tricks and scares to spook Larry all the while Aunt Kate is convinced that one of her family members has turned into a werewolf. Excusing her belief as thoughts from a senile woman many nefarious instances are ignored and overlooked due to the family's scheme. Are all the instances the result of the lighthearted attempts of his family to cure Larry's fear or is something more devious going on?The opening scene at the castle is a great precursor to what the audience is in for at the castle. This great scene full of wonderful establishing shots of the exterior of the castle is followed by an equally great scene in which Larry and Vicki are seen performing their radio show and answering questions from reporters. The chemistry between Gene Wilder and Gilda Radner was as apparent as it was genuine as the reallife married couple played a doting couple that was to be wed. One of the things this film did the best was the sounds. Both the sound effects for the radio show seen on screen and the sounds of horror reminiscent of the earliest days in the genre were extraordinary. The comedic writing was exceptional in this film and toned down enough to appreciate it opposite of Wilder's earlier directorial efforts. There were some great gags in the film my favorite being Wilder acting out the upper body while his butler acted the lower body in the basement scene being questioned by the police. Dom DeLuise was brilliant in this film as Aunt Kate and remains beautifully in character playing a woman through the entire film. This was the first time I had noticed him in a film before and was not disappointed. I wish there had been a bit more substance to the part of Gilda Radner as I would have enjoyed more from her but the film in all of its parts was wonderful. I am so thrilled that Wilder calmed down in the director's chair as I believed he had potential in the role but was deeply disappointed by his previous attempts. The ensemble of friends was perfect for such a fun film. You really get the idea that the principles spent a lot of time together offcamera which only added to the greatness we saw oncamera. It was also pretty magical to see Gene Wilder and Gilda Radner acting together as husband and wife to be. Their marriage ending in the untimely death of Radner was short so this memento of the film is a treasure for fans of both. Haunted Honeymoon would be the last film Wilder would direct so as the saying goes he saved the best for last.".

However the engagement to Vickie has set a screw loose in Larry's head  he often can't control himself onair. The shows sponsor Charlie Lou Hirsch is about to fire him when Larry's psychiatrist Brother Dr. Paul Abbot Paul L. Smith assures Charlie that he can cure Larry by literally scaring the condition out of him when the entire Abbot family meet up together at their large ancestral mansion to celebrate Larry's engagement. As the guests begin to arrive strange things start to happen Larry's Aunt Kate Dom DeLuise talks of a Werewolf a family member Roger AshtonGriffiths is murdered shortly after being told the contents of rich Aunt Kate's will Larry begins to start seeing ghosts  quickly discovers not everything is as it appears...Staring cowritten  directed by Gene Wilder this is one tragic mess of a film just about a complete failure on almost every level. The script by Wilder  Terence Marsh is supposed to pay homage to the old dark haunted house mysteries from the 30's like The Cat and the Canary 1939 among others. Unfortunately it also tries to mix other genres as well comedy musical  horror quite simply it doesn't work in the slightest. The comedy elements are so unfunny I couldn't believe it I did not laugh once during this film. It tries far too hard with all out slapstick comedy sound effects  sequences which probably looked OK on paper but ended up being far from OK in the finished product. Scenes of Wilder trying to pass a dead body off as a living person by dancing with it in front of two idiotic cops Billy J. Mitchell  R. J. Bell is embarrassing to watch or a scene in which Wilder is sitting on top of a stuffed moose head hiding from a snake is just dumb  Dom Deluise in drag as Aunt Kate is a truly hideous  laugh free image. Not one single moment of supposed comedy in Haunted Honeymoon worked for me the jokes are far too drawn out  predictable. The mystery elements are better but are all but lost amongst the lame attempts at humour  nothing is explained the killer is revealed but how he achieved certain things are unclear like them walking down a wall  those crazy mirror effects. There is even a brief musical interlude as Vickie  Aunt Kate perform a little number once again it just comes across as embarrassing to watch. I also hated the ending it makes a mockery of everything that precedes it  is just lazy  clichd. One area in which Haunted Honeymoon does succeed is with it's good atmosphere the period production design  sets are excellent  really capture the feel of those old horror mysteries. The cinematography  special effects are good  generally speaking Haunted Honeymoon is very well made with that Hollywood polish about it. The acting is pretty bad by all involved including Wilder whom I usually like perhaps he was more concerned about behindthecamera activities as director rather than acting in front of it Dom Deluise is highly annoying  irritating as Aunt Kate. As far as I'm concerned Haunted Honeymoon is a complete failure as either a horror mystery or a comedy  I just can't see what sort of film goer this would appeal too  enjoy it. Haunted Honeymoon was Wilder's last directorial effort to date which says it all really you have been forewarned!".

Well I hadn't actually watched it for nearly 20 years what a fantastically funny film! I particularly loved the scene where Gene Wilder in in the basement with the dead body legs hanging out and the cops think the legs are Gene's. I thought I was going to have a heart attack there and then the tears were rolling down my cheeks. Its a great film with a couple of real scary moments too! Highly recommended as with all Gene Wilder films. I only found out recently that Gilda Radner died shortly after filming this movie. She was Gene's wife in the movie and in real life.".

He's heading home with fiance Radner where the greedy family awaits and family matriarch Dom de Luise fears for her life. It's another road to the old dark house where every clich dating back to the silent era is used to create chills and laughter.

Radner is likable perky and untraditionally attractive. Why Mel Brooks or Woody Allen never grabbed her up is a mystery in itself.

But he is also the frothy sort of artist who is at his best when firmly grounded by the restraint of a hardnosed directorand for HAUNTED HONEYMOON he had no such restraints. He was writer director and star and the result is way too much froth and not nearly enough substance.The premise of the film is clever a parody of the spookycomedies of the 1940s and 1950s that were popularized by the likes of Red Skelton Abbot and Costello and Crosby and Hope. Two radio stars Wilder and Radner have become engaged and they rush off to the groom's ancestral home for the wedding... and promptly encounter everything from cobras in the closet to werewolves in the winecellar. And the script and production values are often quite amusing with repeated references to James Whale's 1930s classic THE OLD DARK HOUSE and even the score borrows a few phrases from I've Written A Letter To Daddy from WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? But the plot goes no where and not even the stars of the film can save it.Which brings us to why the film is nonetheless worth watching. Wilder is excessive to say the least but his failings here are as director and writer as a performer he manages quite well. And his costar is the late and much missed Gilda Radner. Sadly Radner never found her place on the big screen before her untimely death and HAUNTED HONEYMOON is no exception Wilder doesn't seem to know how best to display her talents. But even so there are moments when she illuminates the film to a remarkable comic degree giving the viewer a glimpse of what might have been if the role had been more carefully tailored to her talents. And then there is Dom DeLuise who offers a hilarious throwaway performance in drag as Aunt Kate... And when Gilda and Dom join forces to perform the old Vaudeville song Ballin' the Jack the result is pure movie magic.Unfortunately though it isn't enough. The story is just too weak too many of the oneliners fall flat too often cast members who might have given great comic performances are neglected. I'll give it three stars... one each for Wilder Radner and DeLuise. But I'm erring on the generous side. Incidentally this film is not to be confused with a Robert YoungConstance Cummings effort of the 1930s also entitled HAUNTED HONEYMOON and based on the play and novel by mystery author Dorothy Sayersa very good film by the way which sad to say has never been released to the home market.Gary F.

	schema:headline " Fun combination of horror and comedy. I wish the movie had more laughs in it though.";
	schema:reviewBody "It's amazing that a movie with such a concept and people involved wasn't more fun to watch. The movie seriously lacked some good laughs at times and I feel that the movie in its core had far more potential.It's obvious that Gene Wilder wanted to make a Mel Brooks kind of movie. The movie definitely has the same atmosphere and ideas as Young Frankenstein. Unfortunately its not as good and it shows how much quality Mel Brooks actually has to have the skill to have simple predictable and silly humor and still make an hilarious and classic movie with it.The humor in this movie is just as absurd and predictable and unfortunately it just doesn't always work out.The story is totally uninteresting and just serves as an excuse to put as many crazy characters as possible into the movie. It's a weird looking bunch with Dom DeLuise playing a woman! Could be me but I thought the sight of him was pretty darn hilarious! Halve of the time I didn't even bother to wanted to know what the story was all about it was that absurd really!The movie of course also features Gene Wilder but unfortunately he hasn't given himself better material and dialog to work with. So it's hardly his best or most comical role. The movie further more also features Jonathan Pryce in one of his earlier movie roles.Quite frankly I don't understand who the movie has such a bad reputation. I mean the movie is not all that bad. Yes you have to like these sort of movies Mel Brookstype of humor movies but I've seen far worse genre movies receiving far better criticism. It just doesn't seem really fair.The special effects are definitely acceptable for its genre and year it was made in. So was its makeup and its entire professional visual look.If you like these type of movies its very well worth seeing though it's definitely not the best movie in its genre that is around.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	onyx:emotionText "It's amazing that a movie with such a concept and people involved wasn't more fun to watch. The movie seriously lacked some good laughs at times and I feel that the movie in its core had far more potential.It's obvious that Gene Wilder wanted to make a Mel Brooks kind of movie. The movie definitely has the same atmosphere and ideas as Young Frankenstein. Unfortunately its not as good and it shows how much quality Mel Brooks actually has to have the skill to have simple predictable and silly humor and still make an hilarious and classic movie with it.The humor in this movie is just as absurd and predictable and unfortunately it just doesn't always work out.The story is totally uninteresting and just serves as an excuse to put as many crazy characters as possible into the movie. It's a weird looking bunch with Dom DeLuise playing a woman! Could be me but I thought the sight of him was pretty darn hilarious! Halve of the time I didn't even bother to wanted to know what the story was all about it was that absurd really!The movie of course also features Gene Wilder but unfortunately he hasn't given himself better material and dialog to work with. So it's hardly his best or most comical role. The movie further more also features Jonathan Pryce in one of his earlier movie roles.Quite frankly I don't understand who the movie has such a bad reputation. I mean the movie is not all that bad.

Kelly Brook has certainly come on since her days presenting the Big Breakfast that's for sure. Her acting isn't out of the Meryl Streep school but she managed to carry the role fairly convincingly. Billy Zane was actually excellent as the paranoid and obsessed arrogant husband and Juan Pablo Di Pace was also good as the young Brazilian or Spanish love rival. The main problem with the film is the script. It is seriously flawed mainly due to the fact that the whole thing is based on the idea of a voodoo curse which Juan Pablo's ex imposes on him. The whole voodoo thing is totally unnecessary and actually inhibits the film's attempt at desertisland realism. Without it the film would have been much better. A jealous husband and a sexy young Brazilian boathand eyeing up his wife is story enough. The small twist at the end is sort of predictable but a nice touch anyway. The film could have done with a few more such twists and thought.Our score of 510 is about as much as we could muster on a wet Monday evening. The locations and cinematography were exotic and the sexy scenes were well sexy. Kelly is a lovely looking girl and my wife said Juan Pablo isn't bad either!".

To provide shelter and food for his wife. Who just can not be thankful for his selfsacrifice. Ironically this way he's away from home more AND stressful when he comes back with his mind full of doubts from the time he was away! So he's kind of pushing his wife away patting the way for the cabana boy. Wonderful metaphor of today's competitive lifestyle alienated unthankful housewifes and opportunist cabana boys!Three  racist pessimistic and extreme... or clever and VERY observant.PS. Why the totally unnecessary Voodoomumbojumbo side plot?".

To provide shelter and food for his wife. Who just can not be thankful for his selfsacrifice. Ironically this way he's away from home more AND stressful when he comes back with his mind full of doubts from the time he was away! So he's kind of pushing his wife away patting the way for the cabana boy. Wonderful metaphor of today's competitive lifestyle alienated unthankful housewifes and opportunist cabana boys!Three  racist pessimistic and extreme... or clever and VERY observant.PS. Why the totally unnecessary Voodoomumbojumbo side plot?";

'Three' is described as a steamy erotic thriller guaranteed to create an atmosphere so tense you can barely swallow for fear whilst at the same time it is full of hot performances with lavish sexual tension on the screen.This is what we are led to believe by the studio.Alas like so many promises in life I fear these comments are a well intentioned attempt to try and hide the truth of the matter.And the truth of the matter is really very simple.The truth is printed on the front cover of the DVD where the crafty devils at the studio placed a rather attractive picture of the lead lady on the front cover of the DVD along with the words Kelly finally exposes all. This I believe is a far better description of the true merits of the movie.If like me you rented this film because you heard on the grapevine that Kelly Brook was actually filmed in the buff then I feel you represent the vast majority of aficionados of this rather delightful film and let's be honest the storyline is ropey as hell and the acting poor and the characters are dislikeable. But does this matter? Not a jot.The film moves along at a fair pace the location is fabulous and Kelly Brook is stunning. And to be honest it is a very big plus of this film that not once did I feel the need to fast forward to the more juicy scenes where Ms Brook really comes into her own as the lead lady.To try and wrap this film up as a thriller was unnecessary and really detracted from the film itself . We all know the real reason why anybody would rent this film and to this end the movie does its job perfectly.All in all this film was not great but hey we all know what we wanted and we got it. Can you really ask for anything more?".

A wealthy older man Jack played by Billy Zane  looking mighty fine and his beautiful wife Jenny along with some friends of theirs have rented a nice cruiser for some fun time out on the ocean.During the outing there's friction between Manuel a crew member and the wealthy businessman Jack.The boat catches on fire and sinks and we see beautiful Jenny struggling ashore. Manuel also makes it to the island.At first the two are on the island together and we quickly see how resourceful Manuel is when he gets the two of them to throw together a shelter plus he makes a spear and catches fish.Then Jenny's husband Jack shows up.It's plain both men want this woman and friction begins early.Jack isn't nearly as resourceful as Manuel and Jenny begins to feel she's hooked her wagon to the wrong horse.Tensions continue to build between the two men the ratio of violence increasing each time.I was disappointed however regarding who survives and who doesn't.".

Well things don't go well after that because the girlfriend puts a curse on him.They are now out on the ocean and there is an accident and one of the couple and Di Pace are the only survivors stranded on a tiny island with no way out. Tension begin to arise because of an attraction that is brewing between Pace and Brook. In the background the exgirlfriend is influencing the dynamics among the three individuals by using her voodoo powers. It all ends up with a final showdown between the parties I liked the premise of the story. It had good acting. Billy Zane is always a solid performer albeit little bit over the top. Kelly Brook and Di Pace both unknown to me did their part well. My problem with this movie is that the director or the person who wrote the script seemed unsure whether this movie should be a supernatural story or a thriller. I suppose the movie can be both but if that was the case the movie was not well executed for that purpose.I also had problem with Billy Zane's character in that we don't know whether his behavior is influenced by voodoo or whether it was innate within him. As you can see the script should have been rewritten to flesh out those important details.Overall a decent movie. I was going to give it a 4 but I am instead going to give it a 5. In retrospect it is not a bad movie. It is OK as a video movie but nothing else.".

	schema:reviewBody "After a voodooinspired disaster at sea three survivors wash up on a deserted island. The three survivors are unfortunately played by Kelly Brook Billy Zane and Juan Pablo Di Pace. Unfortunate because none of the three can act. Of course Brook wasn't hired because someone was under the impression she was her generation's Katharine Hepburn. She's just here to fill out a bikini which she does admirably. Sadly the script does in fact call for her to speak and every time she does the movie suffers terribly. Remarkably though hers is not the worst acting performance in this hideous movie. That dubious distinction goes to Zane who is laughably atrocious. For a guy who once had some semblance of a legitimate acting career this is quite a nadir. The third wheel Di Pace is for good reason an anonymous nobody. He has no talent whatsoever his horrible delivery of dialogue at least provides some chuckles. Our trio of terrible performers play a trio of terrible characters. Brook and Zane play a spoiled rich couple. She's an airhead bimbo he's an insufferable jerk. Di Pace plays a guy who works on a boat bringing insufferable rich jerks beer. He is rather insufferable himself and sadly for him never learned that you don't hit women who know voodoo. You don't sympathize with any of the three characters you certainly don't root for any of them. Forget hoping they get off the island you just wish they'd die so the movie could be over. It's only 90 minutes long but it seems absolutely interminable. There are only two things even remotely worthwhile about the movie both of which are located directly beneath Brook's neck. Lousy story lousy acting some of the worst dialogue ever written. No intrigue whatsoever. Which of the two jerks on the island will the bimbo end up with? Who cares? All attempts to build drama and tension fail miserably. This is a clear candidate for any list of the worst movies ever made.".

I guess that just goes to show you what good writing acting and directing can do because the movie is a very well done suspenseful thriller.One of the greatest assets to the film and at least for me what made it stand out from the crowd aside from what I've already mentioned is the incredible Kelly Brook. I looked her up on IMDb before I started watching the movie and wasn't really that impressed with her photos here. But boy does she look different in this movie. After watching countless Hollywood films where the lead actress is so horrendously skinny that she looks like she never went through puberty seeing Kelly Brook here in this movie with all her parts completely natural is really a sight for sore eyes. This woman's body is a gift to the world. It's seriously been so long since I've seen such a naturally beautifully figured woman that I'd forgotten how amazing they truly are. Those babies are real buddy and there's nothing like the real thing. I would also say that some credit goes to the director for shooting her in such a fantastic way as to showcase her amazing form. Seriously every scene with her in it is like a great moving work of art she's just absolutely stunning. Spending the movie just watching her walk around is enough of a reason to check this film out.So especially if you're a guy who appreciates the wonders of the natural female form I would highly recommend this film to you.".

Maybe he found an air pocket under water and ran around on sharp sea shells possibly the baggies covering Zane's feet slipped off just before he reappears. Ignore the voodoo and incongruities. If a Bic pen can survive so can a cigarette lighter. Mr. Raffill and his crew especially photographer Tony Imi skillfully present pretty scenes in a luscious location. The women and Pablo Di Pace are incredibly beautiful but the star attraction is absolutely Brook. Her wardrobe consists mainly of a white bikini and a big sheer green shawl. She fits and fills the screen quite nicely. Brook never stops titillating and never has to try.

What once was a nearly 3 hour epic was reduced to an incomprehensible 90 minutes. Nevertheless the fairly large scope of the film manages to break through and the striking production design and visuals even on a poor print in a less than satisfactory DVD transfer somewhat make up for a severely truncated screenplay. A wellspoken English narration does help to tie the loose ends together.

It is immediately apparent that it's origins are not Hollywood because the great spectacle is secondary to the characters who have more depth and detail than is customary in these films. The severely truncated English version does not show the opening sequence of young Rhual  a young Henri Vidal at his hunkiest embarking from the backwater of Gallia Narbonensis to seek his fortune in the capital city. On entering Rome he immediately becomes part of the Roman underclass and makes his way by performing as an amateur gladiator at banquets of the wealthy. On his way to an engagement he stops for a night swim and encounters a beautiful girl in a private garden. This romantic encounter is beautifully filmed as in moonlight and will leave lasting impressions. Not only is the story of these two lovers fully developed but every character including the minor ones are depicted with enough detail to establish their characters. The film has a complex plot involving backstabbing treacherous patricians secret Christians in the army a teenage bully and killer Franco Interlenghi and a gentle saint Sebastian played by Massimo Girotti in an unforgettable scene of martyrdom. Roman justice is seen at an impressive trial where all the innocent are implicated and sentenced to execution. The arena scenes are sufficiently grim and will keep viewers attentive until the film's rousing close. Hopefully this great classic will be restored and reissued with subtitles or an alternate English language track.".

The movie is to me sort of like a confrontation of opposites there's the rich jaded girl Tasmin and the naive innocent one Mona. Tasmin represents the experienced girl who sees life as a canvas to act out her fantasies in while Mona seems to live life more directly and literally. This creates the tension between the two and leads to the dramatic ending which seems somewhat abrupt considering the magical realism of the rest of the movie. I highly recommend this movie it is one that immerses you completely if you allow it to. The acting is exceptional especially the leads so natural that it doesn't seem like acting at all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Boring should not be the first word to pop into your mind when trying to describe a lesbian comingofage drama with a 21yearold Emily Blunt as one of the leads but sadly that is the case with My Summer Of Love. It's not just that Heavenly Creatures did this sort of thing much better a decade earlier I also saw another movie recently Trap For Cinderella 2013 which also does a better job of presenting a similar relationship. The main problem may be that Natalie Press' character is not very appealing while Emily Blunt's character is not exotic enough. Another problem is the director's occasional pseudocinemaverit style with amateurishlooking camera zoomins and outs. There IS a surprise at the end however for those who stick with the movie. And Emily Blunt in one of her first roles is captivating no offense to Natalie Press who acts naturally enough but you can see why Blunt became a big star and Press did not  there is a difference in their screen magnetism levels.  out of 4.".

First of all there is zero chemistry between the two main characters. At least a minimum of that would be fair to expect now that they are supposed to not just become friends  despite of two totally different personalities  but a romantic couple. Like in the movie Adele there is absolutely no explanation as to how they become attracted to each other  they are just suddenly making love from one frame to the next. The whole buildup is skipped. And apart from that there are just way too many plot holes and unrealistic scenes. E.g. Mona goes on a trip with her new friend without knowing where they are going  yet she did bring a bikini for their swim! How was that possible? Is she a fortuneteller? Also her friend brought a bikini  even though it seems unplanned that they went for that swim. As there were nobody else around and they did not plan the swim  they would have done it in the nude and voila  there you would have the missing buildup. Instead we get a quick fullybikiniclothed kiss. That's all. Heterosexual girls also kiss thus this is nowhere near any lesbian approach. And what made her brother turn Christian? Nobody knows. Yes he explains how he saw the light etc. but the individual lifeturning event that triggered his sudden clergy is just added to the way too many unanswered questions. The whole movie seems plot less just moving from one pathetic boring silly unrealistic scene to the next. The shortfalls are so many and so obvious that the unusually high rating of this movie  even from critics  is just incredible.".

On previous occasions I had the opportunity but the subject matter I had found to be off putting. This film is an arthouse masterpiece displaying an unusual relationship between a working class girl living in a dull rural town and an upper class private school girl. The film is capturing as you watch their relationship develop towards an ending which is perfectly summed up as bitter sweet. The lead performances are excellent and Paddy Considine is outstanding as the reformed alcoholic turned Christian. This film deserves to be seen by many and warrants much of the praise it gained.

As in 'Last Resort' Russianborn Pavlikovski paints an enticingly skewed picture of Britain that rings true in spite of its aberrence and gets good performances out of his cast especially Paddy Considine as the brother of one of the girls who could certainly have used more screentime though his costars Nathalie Press and Emily Blunt are also good. The film steers clear of clich and has some dryly funny dialogue but what it lacks is a sense of time as a continuum it feels like a semirandom sampling of its characters' lives and although there is a clear plot it's hidden in the background apparent only later. In some ways this is also true to life but it also means that the film remains lowkey right up to the moment of its suddenly dramatic conclusion. Pavlikovski also seems surprisingly keen on static location shots before we see the characters inside of a house we always see the house from outsidewhich jars slightly given the film's general artistic merits. Distinctive and wellworth watching 'My Summer of Love' isn't quite a great film but it is an interesting effort from a director committed to representing life in the ways that Hollywood never does.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie in Albany NY USA and I thought it was great. I admit I went because the two young girls were super hot and lesbians are always sexy. But watching it I really got to like the people in the story. It's not really a sexy movie but it's a very good drama about people.Mona the working class girl is so sexy and yet so vulnerable. She has no idea she's a beauty or that she's stronger and more creative than the people around her. She thinks that being sophisticated means smoking and drinking and acting bored all the time. So when she meets Tamsin she is instantly captivated!Tamsin is spoiled and rich used to being adored. When the rough but very sexy young working girl looks up at her with innocent admiration cruel and shallow Tamsin thinks it might be amusing just to get her going for a bit. But pleasure soon leads to passion out of control. Both girls in this movie are superb wonderful actresses. Mona could seem dim but we get how smart she could be if she just woke up to the phony side of Tamsin. Tamsin could seem evil but we get how lies and make believe are the only way she can get attention. It's a lovely film with only a couple of tiny flaws. I thought it was too easy for Mona's boyfriend to be just a selfish fat lout. It's the kind of thing you always see in lesbian films like the girl needs an excuse to find love with another woman. Why need an excuse? Also I would have liked just a bit more on Tamsin's family  do they know what she really is? Do they care? Just a hint or something at the end. My theory about why American audiences didn't like this movie is about culture but not just that Americans are dumb. Americans when they watch British movies expect to see dukes and duchesses aristocrats Jane Austen elegance. Just a couple of teens smoking and drinking doesn't look British to us.You can't say Americans don't like British movies but if you look at GOSFORD PARK and compare it to MY SUMMER OF LOVE you can see what I mean. I hated GOSFORD PARK thought it was paper thin and sentimental but it gave Americans the England they want  aristocrats servants luxury scandal.See what I mean?".

Then she meets Tamsin Emily Blunt a kindred spirit despite being outrageously posh who's rusticated from her private girls' school and whose neglectful parents let her have the run of their magnificent Tudor family home. Mona explains that her name is actually Lisa but her habit of complaining got her the nickname Moaner Lisa from her brother back in the days when he had a sense of humor. Tamsin's enigmatic response is simply to drawl I've studied the original. But as I said you do not have to be Lesbian to enjoy this wonderful film. Many people go through life asking themselves who they are? Where do they live and what do they believe in.".

Mona explains that her name is actually Lisa but her habit of complaining got her the nickname Moaner Lisa from her brother back in the days when he had a sense of humor. Tamsin's enigmatic response is simply to drawl I've studied the original. But as I said you do not have to be Lesbian to enjoy this wonderful film. Many people go through life asking themselves who they are? Where do they live and what do they believe in.";

When we first meet them Tamsin tells Mona she has been expelled from school. As a rich girl bored and with nothing to do Tamsin accepts Mona as a pretty object but we know from the beginning nothing is going to come about their love for one another. Rather it appears that love is what Mona feels for the rich girl not the other way around.Paul Pavlikowsky's take on the Helen Cross' novel makes for an interesting film that on the surface seems to be an idyllic love between two teen age girls when in reality no one seems to see the cruelty that Tamsin exerts in the more naive Mona. Tamsin lies about a sister without no shame that same sister appears at the last moment in the film to ask Mona to return what she perceives as a stolen blouse humiliating Mona even more. After all Tamsin is going back to yet another school for rich girls while Mona has to stay in the small village with a broken heart that will not heal. Tamsin in retrospect is a cool and calculating young woman who has no scruples or much less feels remorse for leading Mona to believe they will stay together forever.The third main character of the story is the enigmatic Phil Mona's brother. He does a complete change by joining an evangelical sect and he has left the pub go out of business. Phil is another troubled soul that has no problem at the end renouncing his ties to the religious group that has taken over his pub and his life. While Phil seems to care for his sister Mona he is a distant man in spite of his newly found religiosity. Where he should have been kind and loving he grows distant and into himself.The three main characters in My Summer of Love are well drawn. Natalie Press gives a fine account of Mona the more naive of the two girls. She is an unsophisticated girl who has no social graces and is completely dazzled by the more savvy Tamsin. Emily Blunt a beautiful young actress is perfect as Tamsin a manipulator who will have Mona believe that she truly cares for her when in reality she is only amusing herself while confined to the summer house in the country. Paddy Considine does a good job as the sullen Phil the man who finds religion and then abandons it.The film under the fine direction of Mr. Pavlikowsky needs the viewer's attention to see the nuances under the story unfolding in front us.".

Two relatively unknown actors have been coaxed by Director Paul Pavlikovsky to bring us performances that are so vibrant and unique that we remain glued to the screen throughout. At the film's world premiere at the Edinburgh International Film Festival I asked Pavlikovsky and his leading ladies Natalie Press and Emily Blunt whether the screenplay was scripted or a combination of script and improvisation. They enthused about his 'mad' techniques and 'riffing' performances until 'little gems of dialogue' appeared and were worth keeping. Some dialogue is from their original script but when I asked if that meant some was improvised he said that improvisation often results in clichs which is the opposite of what they were trying to achieve. In the search for 'gems of dialogue' some of the scenes would be workshopped beforehand but with a certain amount of leeway to see what worked when they were actually shot.Spoilers The ending of the film leaves quite a few questions including ones about the nature of the girls' love for each other and how 'real' it was. In the postpremiere QA Emily Blunt suggested that 'Tamsin is more emotive' in the way she expresses her love whereas Mona has more of an earthy innocence. This idea that there can be many equally valid forms of true love is perhaps as intellectually challenging as the film gets although we are left to feel Blunt suggests that both of the characters survive the experience and become strong. Nathalie Press revealed that an alternate perhaps more crowd pleasing ending had also been shot but discarded.".

I understand that this is based on a novel that I haven't read and I only mean this as a comment on the movie. Heavenly Creatures is one of my favourite movies and I was anticipating this movie because I thought that it would present a similar examination of the suffocatingly intense friendship that adolescent girls sometimes form. In this respect it sort of succeeded but as the relationship grew more intense it seemed pretty clear that certain power dynamics were at work and I thought that this seemed so obvious that the result should not have been surprising at all. This underscored what I felt was the emotional superficiality of the film. The other huge disappointment was the many BLATANT parallels with Heavenly Creatures which beg a comparison with Heavenly Creatures although the latter is far superior. Even down to Tasmin's love of Edith Piaf which seems just as exotic and captivating to Mona as Juliet's love of MArio Lanza seems to Pauline in Heavenly Creatures. My Summer of Love is like a much less emotionally devastating Heavenly Creatures. The religious aspect is interesting and at least added an original dimension to the film but mostly the film illustrated the shortcomings that Heavenly Creatures could have fallen victim to and thankfully did not. If I had not seen Heavenly Creatures My Summer of Love could have been a great summer film but it was too similar and inferior to Heavenly Creatures for me to really enjoy it.".

And they were so shallow...they didn't know each other! A little depth never hurt anyone! I've seen many good lesbian flicks that I would love to enjoy over and over again...this movie however I would LOVE to forget! On a better note the movie did have some good scenery! The landscape was beautiful! And I could laugh over some parts because they were so stupid and I could not believe they put them in the movie! If you're looking for a movie that gives you warm fuzzy feelings or is excitingly interesting ....this is not it! Move on!".

	schema:reviewBody "The idyllic England countryside two girls kissing then falling in love how can you possibly go wrong? My Summer of Love stars Nathalie Press and Emily Blunt as two teenagers who fall for one another. It tries to take an interesting delicate subject and make it into an interesting film. Mona is a Yorkshire native lower in social class than the older Tamsin who is home due to an expulsion from boarding school at her family's lush country estate. Mona lives with her older brother Philip Paddy Considine a hell raiser who has recently found Jesus.On an excursion into the hills above her home She meets the equestrian Tasmin and later visits her newfound friend at her bequest. Tamsin quickly reveals that she has an anorexic sister who starved herself to death then cries. The two girls soon find themselves listening to old records dancing and finally going back into the natural beauty that surrounds them. As promised they kiss swim then presumably fall in love. They take drugs and promise one another that they won't be able to live without the other. Then while still on drugs they make a foray into town making a spectacle of themselves for the towns people. Two practical jokes serve to bond the girls together.Phil locks his sister in her room who stages a fake suicide attempt. After she teases him he slaps her loosing his cool and kicks all of his congregation out of his house. Mona tells him that she is in love packs her bags and heads for Tasmin's only to find out that Tasmin was only playing a joke you see her sister is actually alive and she was making that up as well as misrepresenting her true feelings for Mona confessing that  It was just a game. They swim again but this time Mona is furious and nearly strangles Tasmin to death. She walks away furious fade out.The formal qualities of the film seem formidable at first with the exception in my opinion of the sudden zooms which Polikowski demonstrates in the beginning and continues to use for faux substance whenever he can. A device like that. in my opinion should be used to accentuate substance rather then try to create it. If there is no substance to begin with then the sudden zoom becomes only another affectation in the filmmaker's arsenal. Dancer in the Dark was able to use this technique as a device successfully but that film was pouring with emotion while this film constantly suffers from lack of it.The main problem that My Summer of Love runs into is not surprisingly its premise A well to do English teenager tricks a younger girl into falling in love with her then breaks her heart A better if more predictable turn of events would have it that something or someone conspires to destroy the love that the two females feel for one another. This one turning point is however is still not enough in my opinion to render a great film. Saddled with a work for adaptation Polikowski perhaps felt constrained by the existing narrative or more probably saw no existing defect in it at all.In striving for some minimalist story aesthetic Polikowski leaves us short. The shots are too short the scenes are too short and so are the acts. We want to be taken to the end of the line with this film and we certainly are not. The problem as in so many films that begin with interesting material is the story they finally decide to tell.".

Yeah the hair blowing in the wind doesn't do it for me anymore.Girls dancing in underwear. Straps falling off girl's blouse. Ugh seriously I never danced with my friends in our underwear. And straps are pretty annoying when they fall down. Pick them up skank! By now this movie reminds me of every man's wet dream.Nude female silhouette by the window. Yawn.The smoking. Ugh. Enough already. I'll stop here.This movie tries to be sexy but doesn't quite succeed.

I have a high humour threshold and have to admit that 'From Bejing With Love' meets my expectations.The living room scene where Siu Kam played by Anita Yuen tries to shoot Ling Ling Chai played by Stephen Chow is extremely funny. She was greeted by a reverse shot by the gun. Ling Ling Chai heard the gunshot and turns around to explain to her that the gun shoots the opposite direction. While Ling Ling Chai is testing the gun's silencer Siu Kam points the gun towards herself and shoots Ling Ling Chai again. To our surprise she gets shot again. Ling Ling Chai explains that the gun's bullet alternates every shot. Looking defeated and injured Siu Kam runs comically into the toilet with both her arms badly wounded.Another scene worth mentioning is when Ling Ling Chai enters the bathroom while Siu Kam is wrapped in a towel. Ling Ling Chai with a smoking pipe and two iron balls resting on his palm looks cool. In the early days of Chinese gangsterism a stereotyped powerful boss usually rotates two iron balls on a palm. The angry Siu Kam tells him to close the bathroom door. Ling Ling Chai closes the door but he is still inside the bathroom. Siu Kam shouts him to get out and close the door.Towards the end of the movie Ling Ling Chai was in a party function and tries to take a glass of wine from the waiter's platter. However someone took it before he has the chance. Then Ling Ling Chai and the waiter looks at the platter waiting for a miracle to happen. This is actually a parody of the famous Guinness beer commercial endorsed by George Lam.Made in 1994 this movie is still a classic. With several notable comical 'nonsense' scenes and the funny scene of 'extinguish cigarette butt on a hand' that was repeated in Shaolin Soccer 2001.Mao points 910".

For the first roughly 23 of the movie I was literally rolling out of my seat laughing with this film's ontarget brilliant skewerings of spy film cliches.  As much as I hate to say it though at the 23 point the film begins to lose its focus.  It starts to concentrate too heavily on creating the Bond mood and consequently ends up being far too serious.  Up until that point though it was really something special. The only other qualm I have is that it is far far too violent.  You have fingers getting sliced off a man getting glass shoved into his face necks being slashed etc.  Heck just as the movie is building its comedic potential a minor character gets brutally stabbed in the head.  Had this been done in an overthetop manner it could have been very funny like the Black Knight scene in Holy Grail.  But they instead opted for a hyperrealistic look that when introduced into a heavily comedic environment presents an uncomfortable clash of styles and makes the often startling violence uniquely disturbing and grotesque. Still if you can overlook its flaws this is definitely a movie worth seeing.".

After the board of directors on the television show decide that he's the one for the job and is slated to run the gauntlet live on T.V. He has to survive for a few hours running a specially designated route from an unknown location in the middle of the city back to the television studio. All the while he's being filmed and followed by a television camera crew. Five hunters are chosen out of thousands of applicants to chase and terminate the runner. Will he win the Prize of Peril? Watch it and find out!A few years later Hollywood decided to remake it as the Running Man. The producers of that film decided not to read the Stephen King book and took only a couple of the characters names from that novel and mixed it with this film. It's a real hoot to see how much the Producers of the Running Man took from this French film. Their are scenes from this movie that are exactly the same as in the Running Man. They even have a final confrontation between contestant and host as in said picture. I encourage you as a movie buff to go out and seek a copy of this film on video.It may be dubbed and the picture quality is not that great but it's a fun and exciting film. I highly recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Running Man a book originally written by Stephen King under a pseudonym 'Richard Bachman' has achieved some cult standing thanks to the 1987 action packed Schwarzenegger bicep flexer. Its easy to place Prize of Peril within the 'ripoff' category as it's not uncommon to see 80's European cinema recreate their own low budget exploitation takes on Hollywoods big hitters. But to do that with Prize would be a mistake as this was released in 1984 three years BEFORE the chainsaw wielding ice skating fireball that is the Running Man we all know.Although cast mainly with Italian actors Prize was actually directed by Frenchman Yves Boisset and shot on location in France and the former Yugoslavia. Although not actually credited to be an adaptation of the original novella by Stephen King it's difficult to believe that his work was not in some way an inspiration for the movie.The plot set in the future tells of a game show where the contestants are witted out against a team of trained bounty hunters who are set out to dispose of them for the blood thirsty TV audiences that watch the show religiously. The aim for the contestants is to reach the finish line alive! Our hero unlike his predecessors turns the fight on the bounty hunters! Much to the shock and dismay of the audience.The pace of the movie is well set action mixed with intrigue keeps you watching and you quickly feel admiration for the struggling hero played by Gerard Lanvin as he blunders his way through everything that's thrown at him. A far more interesting character is portrayed by Lanvin than we witness with Arnie's character in the 1987 film 'The Running Man'. The overtones of the movie are more sinister and the comment on society stronger than the American attempt although the budget is hardly comparable. Sadly this is illustrated most obviously by the distinct lack of imagination for set design. Unless we are supposed to believe this is set in the near future then the overwhelming 1980's look the movie has throughout is definitely a negative.However the budget should not be a deterrence to what is in whole a very watchable and well made film. Not as glamorised nor as violent as 'The Running Man' but overall a more educated and engrossing movie. Still has its flaws but its worth a watch.".

This is the most fundamental question which any viewer might be compelled to ask while watching Le Prix Du Danger. This Yves Boisset film questions the role of TV especially the notion which accuses TV of legitimizing senseless violence in the name of entertainment. The role of violence and its impact on human lives has also been discussed in this film. A man is the worst enemy of another man in all spheres where money is involved. This assertion seems to be true as a lucky contestant has to beat killers hell bent on killing him. There are huge financial rewards to be obtained if the contestant is able to escape unhurt in a deadly game of life and death. One might say that poverty drives some reckless souls to sacrifice their lives for money. It is also interesting to learn about the reasons which drive ordinary people to become killers. With excellent performances by all leading actors namely Michel Piccoli Marie France Pisier Grard Lanvin and Bruno Cremer Le Prix Du Danger is an important film with concern for existential problems which have always troubled humanity. It is directed by Yves Boisset who has helmed many thrillers in France.".

Nothing is held back and not should it be. The horror here is not graphic closeups but the shocking disregard for life that leads to the slaughter of newborn babies with machetes the abject impotence of the UN and how tribal loyalties can turn the closest of friends into murderers.For those who have lived in Africa as i have what is portrayed here is all too real.

This goes beyond those stories and tells you what really happened....even if it is only a small glimpse at the bigger picture.I saw Hotel Rwanda and I thought it was a brilliant film but I also thought that it was a tad bit Americanised which is fine I suppose it gave the public what it usually wants...a good story but with a bit of a love story at it's centre which I thought detracted from the story of the genocide. This one has a definite European or even Canadian filmmaking feel to it. Hotel Rwanda also didn't show you everything...this is not a spoiler but a warning be prepared to see everything CatonJones doesn't leave anything to the imagination.I was also disappointed though I suppose not all that surprised when I heard that this film had gotten a distributor in every country but the US. All you Americans reading this...appeal to whatever power you have to to get this film screened in a theatre near you. You are missing out on not only a cinematic gem but a little piece of history.

John Hurt is fantastic in the role of a suffered Catholic priest that dedicated his life to the people of this poor country and Hugh Dancy is also amazing with an excellent interpretation. There are magnificent lines but I personally was moved when Joe asks Christopher how much pain can a human being take when he sees the mother being killed by machete strikes with her baby son by one killer of the militia. The questions about God's role the children ask Father Christopher are also great. The feelings of Rachel about the differences between the situation in Bosnia and in Rwanda are very sincere and the sacrifice of Christopher is something very beautiful in this film.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1994 800000 people were killed in Rwanda. During this time a school comes under siege. How far would you go to help save lives? The atrocities in Rwanda went somewhat unnoticed as the world watched and winced before changing their TV channels. The UN blundered while describing the events as acts of genocide as opposed to the genocide it so clearly was. John Hurt and Hugh Dancy star in this powerful and touching story of hope fear and humanity.Set in the Ecole Technique Officielle ETO a high school in Kigali John Hurt plays Christopher a priest who has seen his share of tribulations and clings to what hope he has left while Joe Hugh Dancy is embroiled in the horrors that unravel at the school as the hope he had begins to slide.Michael Caton Jones is a director who has previously delved deeply into relationships in 'This Boy's Life' and 'City by the Sea'. In Shooting Dogs his exposition of humanity is excellently portrayed in what essentially has the make up of a Hollywood horror story. As the Hutu's seize power Tutsi's and their supporters gradually come under fire as the school is besieged and machetes dictate who lives and dies.Despite the characters being fictionalized the events took place and what we are presented with is a powerful and truly disturbing picture as no punches are pulled and the true terrors exposed. This acts both as a wakeup call and homage to those who died and those who survived the atrocities.Father Christopher played by John Hurt is the lynch pin in this nightmarish scenario. Having been weathered by a life of strain his last strands of hope are fading as the chaos descends upon his school. As usual Hurt's performances stretch beyond impeccable to a level of authenticity one could only expect from someone who was actually there. As with Joe whose childlike naivety is broken down gradually until he becomes a shadow of his former self contrasting Christopher. The director uses a young Tutsi girl Maria Claire HopeAshley to introduce and somewhat narrate the proceedings as an unsteady UNlaced serenity is transformed into a time of fear and suffering. The title comes from the fact the UN were killing dogs that fed on decomposing bodies but could never fire shots against those wielding machetes. This is a flawless film in its delivery and character portrayal. The cast and crew were made up of survivors and those linked closely to the events so the film has already had the authenticity in its bones. Hotel Rwanda approached the subject matter from a different angle a story about heroism. This film shares the same theme but it is the basic approach that sharpens the emotions and the human elements that set it apart from other films of this nature.From the playful opening scenes to the carnage that ensues the audience cannot help but be enthralled and engrossed by man's potential for good and totally disgusted by his potential for evil.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shooting Dogs 2005 Many people will compare this to last years Hotel Rwanda and say that much of it is just the same thing again and naturally they will claim it to be less a film than its predecessor. However let me state now this is the movie that 'Hotel Rwanda' wanted to be was too timid to be absolutely needed to be and wasn't. I had a problem with 'Hotel Rwanda.' My problem? It didn't do the true events justice and was too toned down. Shooting Dogs does not shy away from the violence it embraces it and serves it to us as it needed to be. Far too many people know far too little about the Rwandan Genocide because they were too busy watching the OJ Simpson trial. And far too many Americans are unaware of the role their government played in it. They could have stopped it by admitting it was genocide. Instead they danced the verbal line and vetoed the UN.Here is a rare film that could have had marginal acting and with any other plot been a stinker and yet because of its powerful message would have gotten a pass from me. Thankfully everything is in the right place. John Hurt does a great job as Father Christopher and Hugh Dancy is fantastic as Joe a young idealistic teacher at the old priest's school. The extras many of whom were survivors of the genocide are all very credible as well. Another thing is that this movie was actually shot in Rwanda. This provides that old voodoo of location that Werner Herzog is so fond of. The school and the city are not and should not be backgrounds. They are characters in their own right.As mentioned the film does not shy away from violence. The violence is horrifying while still not being horror show gory. There is not necessarily much blood here but there is hacking. Even without the deaths on screen it still went further than 'Hotel Rwanda' did by showing the bodies everywhere all the time and was not afraid to show the hacked bodies of children and even show them dying. Some might say this is too macabre. To those people I say wake up to the ways of the world. Stand up and take notice and stop your moaning. If you ignore it happens then you do nothing productive in preventing it. The film also does something that most films don't do today  show the church in a positive light. This is not a Christian themed movie or anything like that but it is a film of love. And the priest loves the people in his school and so says he that even though his children do wrong God still loves them and so he suffers with them.The horror of the Rwandan Genocide is on full display in 'Shooting Dogs.' And while I have hacked on 'Hotel Rwanda' in this review it is a movie that I still admired very much. It made a compromise according to its makers so that it could be seen by younger viewers. This is admirable but sometimes when you compromise you weaken your product and this is what I feel happened. 'Shooting Dogs' picks up the slack and you really should see both films along with a third 'Sometimes in April.' This movie is deeply affecting and has a deeply important message. There is love everywhere in the world even in chaos. Often you don't realize it is there until conflict arises. 'Shooting Dogs' is one of the best movies of the year and its unfortunate that so few have seen it.44".

This true story needed to be told and for us to hear it.

The shocking story of the massacres in Rwanda is told in a setting that is both personal and global.Great acting a fine script and good pace... a level of craftsmanship worthy of the magnitude of the subject of this film.On rare occasions a story is so shattering it needs only to be toned down for audiences to take it all in. This true story needed to be told and for us to hear it. Hopefully after seeing this movie you will not be as pessimistic about the future of Central Africa as I've become.The closing credits are well worth sticking around for.";

I don't know if there is an answer but for the record I've found that being 24 years old this film appeals to me more than Hotel Rwanda did. I think this is largely because it focuses on the save the world mentality of youth when things are not really that easy to explain or resolve. It also offers some light moments and comic relief that ease the burden of such an unpleasant true story. However friends of mine who are over 40 years old and who perhaps relate more to the businessmanfatherhusband character of Don Cheadle in Hotel disagree.Despite all that the people I know who work in Africa and even parts of Rwanda have said Shooting Dogs is a much truer portrayal of the way things really were at that time and that many Rwanadan natives don't share such a pleasant view of the Don Cheadle reallife man.I think if it moves you to be a better person and stop genocide somewhere in the world it shouldn't really matter which film is better. For me Shooting Dogs will never leave my heart or my mind.".

	schema:headline " A late homage to the Rwandan Tutsis";
	schema:reviewBody "I have just watched this film on DVD it was a bit of a scandal that in the UK it was shown in very few cinemas and for a short period and read the user comments so won't repeat points already made. I have a personal interest as I witnessed the aftermath of another Hutu on Tutsi massacre some hours after it happened in Burundi just over ten years after the events of 1994. The film is excellently and movingly made. Certainly it was better than Hotel Rwanda which would have been improved if made on location in Rwanda like Shooting Dogs instead of South Africa. Unlike the users comments the film DOES not make too much heavy weather of blaming the UN. Do your users want troops under UN command NOT to follow their UN mandate and act on their own volition? What would people's reactions have been if the UN troops had opened fire on the Hutus? White troops from the former colonizing country Belgium using high powered assault rifles on black people with machetes? And the film made a very incisive point through the words of the hardbitten BBC woman reporter who admitted she wasn't moved to tears when she saw murdered Rwandan women unlike in Bosnia 'where she could have been my mother' but here 'she was just another dead African'. Somehow I don't think a USmade film could have been so honest  ie not hypocritical  about white people's reactions to dead Africans. Nor does it overdemonise the Hutus  there have been cases of Tutsis massacring Hutus after all. I think in the end this is a moving homage if a little late to a people that almost disappeared from the face of the earth. The end credits showing laughing happy Rwandan members of the crew who had suffered terrible horrors and family losses are a tribute to the human spirit particularly the spirit of Africans who suffer so much and should make us be more grateful than we are for having been born in countries where these things don't happen...I don't say can't happen because as we know it happened in Europe in former Yugoslavia not so long ago.".

	schema:headline " This film should be mandatory viewing for anyone over the age of 15";
	schema:reviewBody "The civil war and genocide of 1994 in Rwanda remains one of the major unknown catastrophes of recent times despite the European colonial mistakes that were mostly responsible for it. In just a few months the majority Hutu population slaughtered almost a million of the minority Tutsi people in an act of barbarianism practically beyond comprehension. Although the world was well aware of what was going on with an UN contingent present in the country from the very beginning we did nothing to stop this horrendous atrocity from happening. In fact when the possibility arose that Western people could be at risk we simply cut all links and ran hiding behind sanctions and rhetoric as the Tutsis were slaughtered. Of course the complexities of intervening in a civil war meant that rash action had a very real possibility of inflaming the situation with a not insignificant number of countries neighbouring Rwanda less than enamoured of the Tutsis themselves. Nevertheless our inactivity remains as a black stain on the conscience of the West particularly the UN. Shooting Dogs shows us a very human perspective of what we allowed to happen.It starts with the relatively calm and peaceful lives of Joe Hugh Dancy and Father Christopher John Hurt the former a GAP student teaching in the Rwandan capital the latter a Roman Catholic priest. Joe is a well off young man trying to give something back to the world while Christopher is an established expat and someone who has seen a little of what can happen during a coup d'etat. They run a school and church in a compound guarded by UN troops who are observing the recently formed system of rule whereby power is shared between the Tutsis and the Hutus. In the school the predominantly Tutsi students have little to worry them and there is no sense of us and them the groundsman Roland is a Hutu and everyone seems perfectly at ease with him... And then the Hutu Rwandan president is killed when his plane is shot down.Building up to this we have the occasional moment of concern. Some consensus is happening whereby all Tutsi homes have to be identified. Hutu politicians are making ominous noises. Hutu children think nothing of throwing stones at a 'cockroach' Tutsi and the captain in charge of the Belgian troops of the UN Dominique Horwitz seems nervous about the situation particularly his mandate for when he can engage the enemy he is only to fire if fired upon and if he wants to use his heavy machine guns he requires written confirmation from the Secretary General of the UN...What happens next is the stuff of nightmares. Shooting Dogs offers little explanation of why the massacre occurred although there are allusions to the previous Tutsi dominance of many years where the Hutus were little more than slaves. Regardless with the death of the President the Hutu people rise up as one and begin to slaughter their Tutsi brethren. It makes for grim viewing though nothing we see is particularly gratuitous. In fact the calmness of the Hutus as they go about their genocide is far more disturbing than the savageness one might have expected. Added to this are the transparent attempts at duplicity by a Hutu minister which indicate there is more than mere racist opportunism at work.Within a day the Hutus are all up in arms called by national radio to destroy the supposed Tutsi aggressor. With nowhere to go many of the Tutsis are slaughtered. Some make it to UN controlled bases where in the case of this film Father Christopher insists they are given shelter... but how long can Capitaine Delon remain in position with his troops especially after the Tutsi Prime Minister is slaughtered along with her UN guard...? The meat of the film concerns Joe and Christopher's attempts to impose some sort of order on their chaotic surroundings. They achieve tiny miracles to fuel their hope and that of the people around them finding some medicine for a sick child for example. But their every success is instantly dashed as the Hutus gather around the school simply biding their time till the inevitable UN pull out. The monstrous carnival spirit of the Hutus is particularly abhorrent as they sing and dance in anticipation of the slaughter blowing whistles and waving their weapons in the air.We the audience are left in little doubts as to what is going to happen and the slow realisation that dawns on Joe and Christopher is almost as painful for us as it is for them. Based on a true account shot on location and staffed by many survivors of the massacres Shooting Dogs pulls few punches. From a woman hacked to death while clutching her new born child to the mere second's hesitation before the Hutu man buries his machete to silence the baby this movie chills and saddens in ways far beyond any fictional horror. The fact that it grieves more than it sickens is thanks to the low key direction and mostly restrained performances throughout. Neither Hurt Dancy or anyone else allows themselves to cut lose into monologues instead they try to contain their emotions so that no one else might see the fear they feel until finally we have the great question that the two men must answer do they stay or do they go when the troops finally leave? To stay is to die at the blade of a machete. To go is to suffer the awesome burden of the survivor. But at least you will survive to tell the rest of us what went on...This tragedy happened it was reported to us and we read it yet we simply tut tutted and turned to the sport section of our newspapers. Now with films like Hotel Rwanda and Shooting Dogs we are finally being shown just what we ignored. It should practically be compulsory for us to view it.".

	schema:reviewBody "More than 800000 Rwandans were systematically killed over the summer of 1994 most of them Tutsi and propeace Hutu. This film is about the experiences of a young man Hugh Dancy serving as an intern at a technical school in Rwanda. The school encapsulated in fences is run by a Catholic priest John Hurt and serves as a temporary base for a UN military contingent led by the rigid Belgian colonel Dominique Horwitz.What we witness is the increasing pressure of rag tag militias outside the fence on the mostly Tutsi students and staff at the school. The assassination of the Hutu president is blamed by the radio and newspapers on militant Tutsi. Even a sensible young Hutu an aide to Hurt comes to believe the prevalent interpretation of events. Hate fills the air. Americans should be familiar with this sort of thing by now.The Tutsi refugees flood the school grounds justifiably terrified. The militia outside are cheerfully hacking people to death with machetes including women holding babies. Ten Belgian UN soldiers are murdered. No one is safe. The tension grows so great that the Catholic priest twice uses a word we don't often associate with Catholic priests. In my opinion it's a better movie that the similar and highly lauded Hotel Rwanda. I'll just add a couple of observations.The usual format for a story like this is that it's told through the eyes of heroic whites who come to the aid of Africans or AfricanAmericans. You'll find that template here. I didn't find it condescending or offensive. The African performers have plenty of screen time in important parts the whites don't succeed in saving the blacks and this is a movie about a small part of the tribal warfare a kind of microcosm of the whole. It could have been about the political situation instead of the effects of the killing on a single community but that would have been a different and far more complicated film.There are dead bodies in abundance and pools of blood but they aren't trivialized by being made more shocking than they need to be. Nobody's head rolls across the floor. The violence is almost all in medium shot and partially hidden by objects or shrubbery.We see the militias angrily attacking their victims and at the same time cheering and inevitably some of the street riots in American cities come to mind. But any such comparison is unjust. The violence in Rwanda was wholesale and deadly leading to the deaths of about 20 of the population. Besides there is little reason to feel superior on racial grounds. A good deal of footage exists of white people dutifully wiping out other white people on ethnic grounds.The role of the media isn't really made clear enough in the film. The role of the media is often underplayed in the interpretation of historical events. As Will Rogers said All I know is what I read in the newspaper. But again the focus of the film is not on explanations but on consequences. The consequences are so clearly tragic that we really don't need the lugubrious sound track to cue us about our emotions.The international community was caught unprepared and uncertain whether to interfere and if to interfere how to do it? If we don't intervene what do we wind up with  white guilt? The United States was particularly recalcitrant. The memory of our humanitarian efforts in Somalia was all too vivid. The use of the word genocide was prohibited by spokesmen in Washington long after it became clear that that was precisely what was taking place. See if you acknowledge that what's going on is actually genocide how can you possibly justify inaction? It's a tragic story and a saddening one but not a cheap one. It doesn't cast the Hutu as benighted savages and the Tutsi as heroic selfsacrificing heroes.In a way that's the central problem with the events we're shown. There were so few heroes.".

	schema:reviewBody "This the first movie about Tutsi slaughter that i've watched I usually watch documentaries about this terrible point in history. John Hurt is magnificent in this role. In fact magnificent is too little an adjective to describe his portrayal of Christopher. This film isn't about the true gore of the genocide but more about the anxiety the impending doom. With the Hutu looming on the outskirts of the school grounds you truly feel how trapped and defenseless the Tutsi were. I liked how they didn't exploit what happened there! Its an excellent movie and made me cry. I wasn't too happy with the unspoken feelings at the end of the movie however. I really thought the teacher should've begged Mari's forgiveness for leaving her behind but he never did. It was obvious she felt no animosity towards him though.".

In fact magnificent is too little an adjective to describe his portrayal of Christopher. This film isn't about the true gore of the genocide but more about the anxiety the impending doom.

	schema:headline " A Strong Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Shooting Dogs is a movie based on the true story of two dedicated mens and their will to help several Rwandans during the conflicts between the Hutu and Tutsi tribes in 1994. Michael CatonJones director of Rob Roy tells the story of Christopher a priest John Hurt and Joe a English teacher Hugh Dancy and their commitment to the Rwandans refugees surrounded by a dangerous group in a school. Their mission is to do their best that they can to save everyone's life.For those who doesn't know the conflicts between these tribes here's a short summary. In 1994 the power was controlled by the Hutu tribe. In the same year a peace process was in development and the UN was sent to Rwanda to assure that peace would be assured. But the president of Rwanda died in a plane crash and the Hutu started a military coup persecuting all the Tutsi. A genocide happened in only a few months and UN forces couldn't do anything because their orders was to evacuate all the foreigners living in the country and only shoot if they were attached. Thousands of Tutsi were killed during this dark period.In the movie the main characters are trapped in a school along with a Captain Dominique Horwitz and the UN soldiers and thousands of refugees including many Joe's students such as Marie ClareHope Ashitey. UN Forces can only impeach the Hutu entrance in the school and that disturbs the priest and Joe because outside of the school and the church walls there are many killings happening in front of them and no one can't do a single thing to stop it. In one of the most emblematic scenes of the movie after returning of a dangerous trip to get some medicine for a sick baby the priest is warned by the Captain that the dogs must be killed because they were eating the decomposing bodies of the victims. The father replies to the Captain The dogs were shooting at you? No so you can't shoot the dogs because you have to follow with your mission and your mission is only shoot if the other side shoot you. That's why the title Shooting Dogs.It's a very strong and powerful movie sometimes sentimental but quite controversial. I watched because I wanted to see a different point of view on the same subject of movies like Sometimes in April Hotel Rwanda and the documentary Shake Hands with the devil the Journey of Romeo Dallaire all of them are accounts of the genocide in Rwanda. All great movies very similar to each other. The main difference here is that we seen the point of view of white characters. An English teacher an English priest an french captain and a BBC reporter are some of the persons involved in the tragic events. We seen their different reactions to all the deaths the desperate ways to help people or to criticize and compare kinds of genocide like the BBC reporter played by Nicola Walker tells to Joe. Depending on your social and personal views you might hate her character when she says to Joe that the killing of people in Bosnia was more serious and shocking than the killing of just Africans. This scene emphasize many hypocritical behavior of well established countries. Sad but truth.The director made a wonderful job here leaving a soft movie in the beginning with some light and funny moments and then like a dramatic symphony he was adding more dark moments creating tension in every time that Joe or the priest went on searching a person they know or the medicine for the baby. John Hurt has another good moment in his career with this movie playing the helpful warm man of faith whose help is needed in every possible situation a courageous man. Hugh Dancy once again proved to be a great actor. He's in comedies such as Ella Enchanted and in dramas like Shooting Dogs. Even when the movie is bad such as Evening is great to see that someone is doing a nice job. Here playing the young and idealist teacher who fears that his life's in danger but he's still wants to help everybody because it's the right to do and since he was a fortunate child who had everything he wanted he wants to share his joy and experience to the less fortunate Rwandans. It's an outstanding movie that didn't had the attention that it needed by time of its release in cinemas. But TV and DVD will help to spread its message. 1010".

John Hurt and Hugh Dancy both deserve awards for their performances.It was quite a violent film but it was not gratuitous or particularly graphic. It was necessary.My 'favourite' scene is where Christopher goes to the convent as he has every Monday for 12 years only to find the nuns brutally raped and murdered. This spoke volumes to me and made me seriously question how I view the world. To think that anybody could do that to another human being forced me to remove my rose tinted glasses and face up to the fact that the world is a hideous and ugly place sometimes.I greatly admired the character of father Christopher because in spite of all he had seen he was still able to love those who had committed such wrongs. This is a lesson in itself and I believe that he was right in saying that God loves us all but he doesn't have to like our choices. It gave me a small bit of comfort to believe that God was there suffering with every one of the million dead.The saddest part of the film however is realising that although this is a dramatised version we are watching it was somebody's reality. The 2500 people who were murdered at ETO would have been left just how it was portrayed in the film battered and broken.The real life stories at the end are fascinating in themselves it is amazing to see how much people can live through such as the man who hid in the cess pit or the man who hid under his murdered relatives in order to survive.It really puts everything in perspective.".

Although I could allow myself to imagine what it might have been like to be there I wasn't made to feel that way by the film itself.Secondly was the whole 'Blighty' thing. I am British myself and cringe when I see these clich character traits of ours portrayed on the screen.Hugh Dancy who played Joe Connor stank. I mean badly in a Keanu Reeves sort of way. He imparted a real hoorayHenry feel which was not contained by Michael CatonJones whose Scandal is an excellent film. I know Joe's character was supposed to be like this but... it left me feeling a little repulsed.John Hurt gave a good performance why wouldn't he. Of note I think was the performance by Dominique Horwitz who played Captain Charles Delon. His role was the most authentic and I felt real empathy towards him.Back to the 'Blighty' thing. for those who don't know Blighty is a term used by the British to mean Britain home but in a very empirical way Yes from the moment Joe uttered the line but Kigali's that way mate I knew I was in for a rough time. This was quickly followed by the cheeky chappy BBC cameraman's line Oi where's my fking beer? Oh Lord. Then Joe on the payphone in Kigali listen mum this is what rush hour in Kigali sounds like... I expected Jamie Oliver to roll up on a scooter with a basket of fresh fruit and veg Oi Oi! What's going'on 'ere then? On the dog and bone to yer old ma? Caaamm over mine later I'll cook us up a Ruby wiv deez fresh Rwandan veggies... Ta ta! And off he rolls on his 'Mod' scooter. But that didn't happen.Yes then the whole emotional scene between Joe and the BBC girl she was good though Nicola Walker where he talks about his reasons for being in Rwanda how he is just trying to say 'thanks' for his privileged upbringing. Again I know this was his character but you can't help feeling old Hugh would be exactly the same sort of selfcongratulatory type in real life! The Christian thing  well one of the central characters is a priest so there's no getting away from it but... your main characters carry your theme your message and what was that in this film? Be a good Christian tame the savages. A bit dubious in this day and age... a bit neoChristian actually.What else... oh the music. From the get go it's 'you will be sad here  cue music' you will be very sad here  cue music.' Don't burden me with sorrowful music without first allowing me to create a deep connection with the characters  basics of filmmaking surely? The music is good it's just its use that is at fault.The cinematography was wonderful by Ivan Strasburg. That guy has worked on a lot of great films over the years and he has done a superb job of photographing this movie. It reminded me in places of Satyajit Ray's photographer Subrata Mitra. Very good.So yes overall an engaging work but flawed in various ways. If the subject interests you see Raoul Peck's Sometimes in April a very good film. All the character's are Rwanadan and played by a great cast. The directing is far superior to Shooting Dogs and it doesn't have that liberal guilt feeling about it. It's more African. It stars Idris Elba who has an excellent presence.".

Then it jumps to the story as told through the eyes of a young idealistic NEWCOMER a young teacher who doesn't take life or the situation too seriously. As he and the driver approach a roadblock he plays around with his drivers I.D. not realizing that this is a serious moment and that if the driver can't identify himself as being of the right tribe to the soldiers they'll be killed. And thats how he treats the unfolding story of chaos and unfolding around him. Suddenly realizes that every Rawandan including his driver is involved and that the Europeans soldiers and tourists cannot and will not help. The media cameras cannot stop machete's and there's too many machete wielding militiamen too shoot. the title comes from the armies captain saying he's going to shoot the dogs eating the deadbodies around his compound but won't shoot the Militiamen that are killing people around the compound. Mainly because they haven't fired at the soldiers yet. Finally he realizes the hopelessness of the situation and the guy who tells the evacuation team that he wants to give up his seat for one of the intended victims flees with his tail inbetween his legs rather than face immanent death with the school kids he's promised not to leave behind.It's more of character study and a come to Jesus moment for one character than a story about the genocide in RAWANDA. This movie didn't have to take place in RAWANDA it could have taken place any one of the Genocidal hell holes going around this world at any given time.".

The story was strong but besides Hurt the cast was pretty weak especially Darcy with his annoying little head shakes and all. A remarkable story of a people that were tragically deserted by the larger world. In all 800000 were killed in just 100 days.

	schema:reviewBody "Beyond the Gates aka Shooting Dogs is a shattering truelife drama set during the Rwandan genocide of 1994  a holocaust in which over 800000 unarmed Tutsis were brutally massacred by their gun and machetetoting Hutu neighbors simply for being different. This harrowing and heartbreaking film focuses on a Catholic priest and a young American teacher who find themselves caught up in a human tragedy of unimaginable proportions when a large group of terrified Tutsis flee to the school for safety and protection a comforting but as it turns out utterly impotent U.N. peacekeeping force has also set up shop there.Comparisons to the earlier betterknown Hotel Rwanda are as an inevitable as they are irrelevant for Beyond the Gates is a searing and unforgettable movie in its own right filled with indelible imagery and pulsepounding suspense. The brilliant screenplay by David Wolstencroft based on the book by Richard Alwyn and David Belton focuses as much on the moral dilemma taking place within the souls of the two white men as it does on the unspeakable tragedy occurring in the world outside. Both men utterly powerless in the face of such a monumental event are forced to question whether the religious dogma that they espouse so readily in times of peace has any real efficacy or relevance in times when the very fabric of humanity seems to be coming apart at the seams. Director Michael CatonJones has provided scene after scene in which characters  both major and minor  are forced to reexamine their commitment to themselves the people around them and the belief systems they've adopted to get themselves through life. The movie also points out just how shamefully the outside world acted in turning a blind eye to what was happening in that country refusing to step in at any point to try and bring the situation under control and then proffering lame excuses to justify its inaction once it was all over.With many actual survivors of the holocaust working both behind the camera as technical assistants and in front of it as extras and minor characters the film brilliantly recreates the events with devastating immediacy and accuracy the movie was also filmed at the actual locations where the incidents themselves took place greatly enhancing its verisimilitude. Moreover John Hurt as the priest and Hugh Dancy as the teacher deliver soulsearing gutwrenching performances that get to the heart of what it truly means to be one's brother's keeper.Acts of such unmitigated savagery and brutality especially when conducted on this massive a scale are so incomprehensible in their horror that it would be virtually impossible for any single work of art to successfully grasp them. But by personalizing the issues and placing the events within the context of a series of universally identifiable moral dilemmas the makers of this extraordinarily fine film have perhaps come as close as is humanly possible to achieving that end. Don't miss it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The genocide in Rwanda is news to few if anyone these days. Films about it such as Hotel Rwanda an excellent film I would add are not really news either. However last night I had the great honor of watching a film on just this subject that slipped through the fingers of American cinema. Beyond the Gates is quite honestly one of the best films I have ever seen.The film centers around two men from the UK rather than on certain Rwandans as we would expect. One is Joe Hugh Dancy a young man from the UK who has come to Rwanda because he feels he can do some good maybe somehow make a difference. He is full of youthful energy compassion belief in his ability to do something to make Rwanda a better place and most importantly complete naivet as to what is really going on around him. The other is Father Christopher John Hurt an old Catholic priest whose face weathered and worn by the pain injustice and brokenness he has witnessed in the world belies the profound Catholic faith and hope in the cross of Christ that make him so powerful a character. Both men live and teach at the Ecole Technique Officielle a secondary school for Rwandans which is protected by an entourage of Belgian UN peacekeeping soldiers.As Dancy points out in a special features interview the film is different in that it doesn't just thrust you into the horror of the genocide. Rather it begins much as Dancy's own character does from complete naivety evolving slowly into total realization of the atrocities being committed quite literally just Beyond the Gates of the ETO. While there is a long and bloody history of tribal warring between the Hutus and Tutsis the film opens in a time of relative peace. Our first glimpse of the conflict comes in a scene where Joe is outside the gates and comes across several Hutu men taking a census of the all of the Tutsis in the area. Shortly thereafter the news comes through that the Rwandan President has been killed and a Hutu uprising ensues. That night the gates of the ETO are pressed hard by some 2500 Tutsis seeking refuge in the gated school grounds and protection from the more than adequately armed UN stationed there.Over the course of the rest of the film the genocide begins to unfold in all its ugly hatred. We first begin to see it as Joe makes a number of trips outside the gates. The first is to pick up a father and his daughter Marie a girl who has grown up to fast faced with the hell around her yet who is still trying to make sense of it all particularly from a Christian worldview one of his students. On his way to their house his fears mount as he is stopped at a roadblock by Hutu men with machetes steeped in crimson and they are only compounded when he finds the house empty. However this time his fears are abated when he returns to the ETO to find them safely there having taken a back road. Another trip finds Joe at another roadblock stopped by a Hutu man whose clothes are saturated red blood still dripping from his machete a broad smile across his face. This man had been with them at the ETO a friend. With each passing trip the death toll rises the reality of the genocide slices deeper into the minds of Joe and viewer alike.I'll not go into more details of the events so as to not give away too much of the plot but the point is an ugly beast has reared its head...slowly terribly mercilessly and with great power. Christopher though well accustomed to this ethnic strife through years of service in Rwanda witnesses all new levels of human depravity leaving him to utter in shock I've not seen this before.This is a profoundly moving and powerful film. It is despite a few Hollywood hiccups of cheesy portrayals of Christianity in fact a genuinely deep and faithful film. Christ is truly present here. There is a scene where Joe tries haphazardly to explain the idea of the Real Presence in the Eucharist to a young and confused though very curious Rwandan boy...unfortunately the scene is actually one of the cheesy moments...but it nevertheless ushers into the viewers conscience this idea of the presence of Christ even as these people walk and live and die in hell on earth. The most powerful scene in the film comes near the end and while I refuse to spoil it for you know that it makes a profound statement about just that fact...the reality of the Real Presence of Christ in even the darkest and most horrid of places.Beyond the Gates is sweepingly thought provoking. From grappling with one of the timeless human questions 'How can a loving God let such terrible things happen to His people?' to challenging the unwillingness of the UN to act instead hiding behind debates over phraseology Acts of Genocide vs Genocides etc. even as gross human rights atrocities are committed literally right before their eyes to even the apathy and ignorance of whites Americans and Europeans to the situation one cannot help but just sit as the credits roll...convicted shamed appalled truly touched...in a way only an exceptionally good and very rare film can manage. I read critiques that it was too focused on the whites rather than the Rwandan people...but I think that they missed the whole point that the director was shooting for. This film is meant to shock us and call us to action. There are similar conflicts going on all over Africa even as I write. Who will we be this time? Father Christopher...or God forbid and quite literally so will we echo the impotence of the UN? from my blog at httpworthyourattention.blogspot.com".

Along the way the peasant hero encounters a full spectrum of Italian regional types from all social strata and holding   political opinions of every stripe.  A long scene on board a train forces many such folk into close proximity and is memorable for its humor and densely packed sociological observation this uneasy coalition of people who barely speak the same language reminds the viewer of Italy's continuing fragility as a nation.  After many picaresque episodes 1860 resolves with an extended and exciting battle.  The style of the film is an interesting eclectic and fairly successful mix of techniques learned from the likes of Eisenstein quick cuts and odd angles abound Westerns of the Raoul Walsh variety All Quiet on the Western Front.  1860 is also one of a very small batch of movies from Thirties Italy that are easily available on tape in the US and though somewhat dated is definitely worth a look.".

Soso Third entry in Torrente series starred by the most grotesque detective and well played by the onemanshow Santiago Segura  he is a real private dick  a poster child for police corruption . Featuring politically incorrect private detective Torrente  he is a macho man  lazy  rude  sex maniac  drunkard  Athletic fan  caring only about protecting and serving himself . He is a Bad Santa of the police force  a peculiar and fatty man  being a El Fari fan  too . Despite that  he still manages to get the job done . Torrente follows the exploits of Jose Luis Torrente  a piggy and uneducated man acting for his own selfish purports . In previous outings Torrente was rejected from police duty and he returned to private investigation . Later on  the botcher exdirty private eye forms a new band of underdogs Xavier Deltell Jose Luis Barragn  El Risitas  Jimmy Barnatn  Caa Brava  among others to carry out a security mission to protect a known person  the beautiful woman Giannina Ricci Yvonne Sci . Torrente gets involved in the middle of a nasty's plot schemed by a mobster Fabio Testi  owner an illegal multinational called Petronosa . As we find our antihero in a delicate situation but he can count on to help him some people  as junkie Josito Jose Mota and his equally freak friends .This is 3 installment and acceptable sequel in Torrente series . These films are made to entertain  and this movie  especially for a good time and a nice entertainment . Torrente is a decent and unapologetic dark comedy with great special effects  dirty humor  it has several funny and hilarious scenes and quite successful action scenes with persecution  car crashes and many other things . The picture contains thrills  noisy action  tongueincheek  grotesque situations and above all  humor . Although there are also nudism  badmouthed language  bad taste jokes and profanities . Torrente 3 is written directed  produced and stars Segura whose production house Amiguetes Entertainment produced the film  UIP holds Spanish distribution rights . The screenplay is absurd as well as crazy  just what makes laugh a lot  that the character Torrente a very slutty  clumsy  sexist  Machista  extremerightwing  on a real person is despicable  being not adequate  but this is a film that satirizes all this and that just means he's a pathetic character  though he also has his unsettling charms . This third Torrente grossed enough success at box office  however Torrente  El Brazo Tonto De Ley set box office records in its day took 707000 and Torrente 2 grossed more than 22 million in 2001 . The film contains many cameos of famous people familiar faces such as Tony Leblanc  Enrique Villen  Enrique Sarasola  Jose Luis Barragan  Carlos Latre  Jimmy Barnatan  popular footballers  of course  El Fari  and several others . Many of them famous from Cuore magazines . And cameos of famous filmmakers such as John Landis Oliver Stone and Guillermo del Toro . The cameos are very amusing and fun and there are lots of laughters and jokes . The movie contains a colorful and adequate cinematography by Unax Mendia . Thrilling as well as appropriate musical score . The film takes advantage of impressive special effects  especially on its final part when takes place a breathtaking chase among cars  including  bound and leaps vehicles and expensive crashes . In fact  this Torrente was Nominated Goya Best Special Effects to Antonio Molina and Ferran Piquer . Santiago Segura dares to make films with total entertainment and bemusement . And Torrente  is pure eschatological fun  it is 100 and some minutes of fun and laughters . It is a commendable effort by Santiago Segura to make a film like this . Few directors are able to achieve results as Torrente  the biggest boxoffice in Spain until 8 Apellidos Vascos. This film will not disappoint Santiago Segura fans.The first instalment was Torrente El Brazo Tonto De La Ley  being followed by Torrente 2 Mission in Marbella with Juanito Navarro  Jose Luis Lopez Vazquez  Paloma Cela  Santi Millan  Jose Mota  Pablo Carbonel among others  Torrente 3 El Protector in which the horrendous Spanish detective becomes a bodyguard  Torrente 4 Lethal crisis with Kiko Rivera  Javier Gutirrez . And finally Torrente V  Misin Eurovegas has a good cast as Alec Baldwin  Anna Simon  Neus Asensi  Carlos Areces  Chus Lampreave and many others . The movies were written by directed by and starred popular Spanish comediandirector Santiago Segura and is getting the remake treatment from New Line Cinema  all of them were produced by Andres Vicente Gomez who exec produced the Academy Awardwinning Belle Epoque .".

Only a few gags are worth Futbol Club Barcelona one is wonderful! and veryvery bad taste in the initial and final scenes. Santiago how could you do that to us? Thanks for showing us cameos of John Landis Oliver Stone and Guillermo del Toro though I don't remember having seen Guillermo there. I still am a Santiago fan and I truly believe he can do a lot but looks like Torrente's epoch is over. Come on surprise us again!".

Fortunately these days where there's a will there's usually a way which means I am now able to fill you in on the details about this sick flick from Japan which has gotten so many censors' knickers in a twist.In a nutshell Grotesque is director Kji Shiraishi's reply to horror filmmakers in the West who in recent years have been claiming 'torture porn' as their own concept when in fact the genre was practically invented by the Japanese can anyone say Nikkatsu? Or hows about Guinea Pig?. By ramping up the violence in his film to neverbeforeseen levels of nastiness Shiraishi is basically flipping the bird to all the Eli Roth's of the world and screaming 'Follow that if you dare!!!'The story for want of a better word sees a young couple Aki and Kazuo Tsugumi Nagasawa and Hiroaki Kawatsure abducted by a lunatic brilliantly played by stonyfaced Shigeo sako who sexually abuses and physically tortures people in order to get his jollies apparently this sicko can only be sexually satisfied by observing his victims' will to survive.For starters the psycho pushes a large nail to the back of Aki's throat through a hole in his ballgag! and inserts another into his abdomen then both Aki and Kazuo are stripped and sexually stimulated to... ahem... completion cue lots of sticky bodily fluids. This doesn't seem to do the trick for their captor so out comes the chainsaw and off come the fingers which are used to make a pretty pair of necklaces. Kazuo also gets her nipples and an arm removed as punishment for screaming out.Aki is then asked if he would die to save Kazuo and replies that he would this results in our loony breaking out some more tools and saying the one thing no man ever wants to hear first I will hammer some nails into your nuts. Ouch!!! A spot of nut hammering and a little penis pruning later and it's mission accomplished for the maniac who is so thrilled by Aki's willing sacrifice that he spares his life nurses the pair back to health and promises to set them free.Oooh! The little liar he has no intention of letting them go having devised a further challenge for Akione which he hopes will result in an even more satisfying climax.Whilst Grotesque is admittedly little more than an excuse to show 73 minutes of amazingly harsh and realistic scenes of sadistic torture at least until the surprisingly comical OTT final which is like something straight out of a Peter Jackson style splatterfest it achieves its purpose with aplomb providing a relentlessly gruelling experience for those of us who like to test our limits you may have seen equally repellent scenes in other films but its unlikely that you'll have seen as many in a single film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Grotesque 2009  out of 4Extremely graphic depraved and vile film from Japan about teenagers Kazuo Hiroaki Kawatsure and Aki Tsugumi Nagasawa who are on their first date when they're kidnapped by a sadistic surgeon Shigeo Osako who takes them back to his house ties them up and begins to torture them. As a lifelong horror fan it seems every few one two or three new movies cause a stir but when you finally get around to watching them it's clear that it was all hype and they're usually disappointing. Over the past few weeks I had heard a lot of GROTESQUE and I must say that director Koji Shiraishi has made a very brutal film that lives up to everything that has been said about it. The movie is a vile piece of trash but there's no question that it's wellmade and certainly effective. I guess you could say that this is Japan's answer to American series like SAW and HOSTEL but those films don't have anything on this. The torture scenes as you'd expect are extremely graphic in detail so I'd say that 98 of people out there aren't going to be able to stomach them. I'm a pretty jaded horror fan and I've seen some incredibly brutal films but this here would certainly rank right near the top. The sexual violence in the film includes an incredibly humiliating situation where the girl is raped in a way that I won't ruin here but it's certainly one of the most unpleasant things you're going to see. The torture devices include a chainsaw eye gouging and a couple scenes to the male anatomy that is going to have male viewers turning their heads like children. At just 75minutes the film really doesn't waste any time building up a story or trying the stretch out the characters. In all honesty this is a good thing because a film like this doesn't need any boring backstory and in fact the worst thing about the movie is the one flashback introduction to the two teens. The performances by the three actors are extremely good and very believable. Both victims really make you feel the pain they're going through and Osako is so cold and chilling that he's certainly a character you'll never get out of your mind. GROTESQUE is thankfully going to appeal to very few people and it's hard to recommend except to those who want to see how far you can be pushed with violence and torture. It's hard to stomach but it's effective.".

Both victims really make you feel the pain they're going through and Osako is so cold and chilling that he's certainly a character you'll never get out of your mind. GROTESQUE is thankfully going to appeal to very few people and it's hard to recommend except to those who want to see how far you can be pushed with violence and torture. It's hard to stomach but it's effective.";

Anyways the film was quite well shot and the acting for what it was  was good. All and all the production values are great. I wouldn't say gore wise this overtops anything else that is out there especially from Japan thinks Ichi the killer but it is as full on as it can go.what turned me of was that the movie is very mean spirited and has no other feature than to show the torture and brutality inflicted on our two victims. The story is very basic even for a slasher with very minimal exposition. Two people are kidnapped and tortured in full on ways  that's it I didn't learn anything here nor did i come away entertained so one has to ask why was it made  who was the director thinking this would please audience wise. The film is at the very edge as far as a film can show and if that is the sole purpose then congrats to the film makers but this isn't my type of film and i doubt it would be a repeated view for many sane people out there. This is a one time watch if that and only if you are curious about it.With no real contexts all you are left with is graphic torture after another and if that is all that entertains you when you watch a film..well....i am frankly a bit scared of you. I don't mind the occasional torture scene liking films such as Hostel Texas Chainsaw Inside High Tension Martyrs Frontiers and the Saw franchise but for all there faults they all give you some story breathing room between the torture scenes production some meaning and actually entertain. If being locked in the same room for and hour and 15 minutes while you watch the most extreme close ups of sadistic torture without anything else to it thrills you then maybe this movie is for you.I am trying to stress i am not opposed to gore i am personally just opposed to gore alone with no other meaning besides thrilling those sickos that like this stuff and revolting everyone else  simply to revolt. That's not filmmaking to me.For me there is no redeeming factors to this movie besides some production value and the debate it will create around censorship and going to far in film. Regardless of the film just being mean spirit the film is actually just a bad film. If your curious due to it being a banned film in 2009 i can't believe a film is banned in this day and age or just like a bit of gore than seek it out and have a look but i don't think this is a film that many will sincerely enjoy and watch again. The only merit here may be to other film makers regarding the production value and Japanese horror theater but to the casual viewer there is nothing here for you  but it doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to watch it.".

With a lot of torture throughout this film it can also be called a modern variant of the infamous Guinea Pigfilm series especially the first two movies being Devil's Experiment and Flower of Flesh and Blood which Grotesque seems to pay a homage to.Like other films like Ichi the Killer and MurderSetPieces this film was said to be available in Norway with an 18rating only to get banned later by Medietilsynet the Norwegian answer to MPAA. Even on the Danish DVD I have it clearly says that this film is banned both in Norway and the UK.In the UK this film is banned by BBFC because this film has minimal narrative or character development and features more humiliation brutality and sadism.Absolutely NOT for weak stomach and any viewer under the age of 18.So can you manage to stomach through this Japanese hell of a movie which is even worse than Hostel and Saw altogether?".

	schema:reviewBody "For years I have watched some of the most graphic intense and disturbing movies that I can find. This isn't because I'm some twisted weirdo or anything but because I'm an allencompassing cinephile that can and has given 10 star ratings to movies from Beauty And The Beast to Antichrist. To truly love all that film has to offer you have to understand all that film has to offer.When you watch extreme cinema you have to know that the violence and imagery is if used correctly serving a purpose which is usually to heighten your senses of pity disgust sympathy repulsion etc. Also it's best if the film has some sort of purpose Salo is a metaphor for how the upperclass treats and exploits those that they deem below them Hostel is a satire on the image of the ugly American that has been experienced by other countries and I could keep going.This brings me to this film Grotesque. Without ruining the film it does that on its own I will say that there is only the slightest bit of backstory which is lazily done and seems it might have been an afterthought and no attempt at putting any of this within context. Bottom line a guy abducts a couple and brutally tortures them. That's it. No point no reason no character development nothing.Not only that it's a technically flawed film as well. The cinematography is horrible handheld zoomins overdone color filters and an overall poor job. It doesn't help that the majority of the film is very dark and shot on digital video so you get that annoying video blur whenever the camera moves. In terms of writing for the most part there isn't any. When the film finally gets to a point when the characters are saying something other than Please stop! or Why are you doing this?! they act in a way that makes absolutely no sense. People that would have gone through what they went would never ever show the signs of acceptance or gullibility that they do. They would be hardened or almost catatonic. If that's not enough the finale radically shifts the tone for seemingly a cheap laugh in a movie that hasn't earned or even tried to get that reaction at any time beforehand.Whenever I see someone review a film with this level of violence and knock it even if I think it's great I understand. These type of films are not everyone's cup of tea. When they say it was just pointless violence however I usually check out of the movie and assume they did the same with the movie. With Grotesque I guarantee I never check out of the film. I stuck with it. I assumed there would eventually be a twist or revelation that would give this film a reason to exist. I assumed wrong.".

The plot although tenuous is so disturbing and nihilistic that I felt I had to take a shower after the film. We have 3 characters in this film and almost the entire running length takes place in a dark dank underlit torture room reminiscent to a naziexperiment chamber. I give this film a 710 for the sheer nastiness and how relentless the film is in depicting the pain and suffering of the two young youths abducted. This film has guts and guts is what you will see. I am not surprised the Nick Cage thought this was a snuff film because for the life of me this felt so bloody real. After the film I was so disturbed and depressed that I couldn't walk home alone. This hasn't happened since the original Halloween for me but I was just a kid than. If you couldn't handle Human Centipede Serbian film or the Antichrist than stay far away from this one.

	schema:reviewBody "Gurotesuku isn't easy to watch. But today's anesthetized horror generation demand such movies. Flicks like Hostel Saw and 'insert tortureporn flick of your choice here' have lost their original edge and this has led directors to dream up new and ever more macabre ways to shock and sicken just to stand out from the crowd. The best film I've seen that fits this 'genre' over the last few years is 'Martyrs' and while I wouldn't credit Gurotesuku as being at quite the same level it does seem to achieve something given appropriate interpretation and invention that many viewers seem to have missed.On the face of it this just seems to be an opportunity to torture and maim an innocent couple with very little motivation for engaging the viewer in a story or character development but as a psychological study of the human mind it is a potentially terrifying hour and a half that if viewed in the right way deserves far more credit than it will inevitably get.The story summarises as thus a couple venture out on their first date and after getting on fairly well though it's obvious that the guy has far more affection for the girl they are knockedout by an unknown assailant and wake up chained to surgicalstyle beds where they undergo some extremely horrific torture for what turns out to be quite a legitimate reason psychologically speaking by the aforementioned perpetrator. The general point is that the assailant has never known love and therefore decides to torture those who dare to experience it by finding out how far they are willing to go to protect the subject of their emotions.What follows and in particular the 'hospital' scene is a traumatic rollercoaster of 'would you wouldn't you' dilemmas that could surely leave anyone who watches the movie asking how far THEY would actually go to protect a loved one. I highlight the hospital scene because it seems quite clear that the aggressor is frustrated at the fact that love could perhaps indeed lead someone to volunteer unthinkable pain onto themselves in order to protect another. And in such a situation dangling a carrot of hope in front of them only to whip it away again would surely be a fitting way to break one's spirit.The fact that this transgression and the general tone of the movie will be missed by many is testament to the fact that American cinema has prepared viewers for a far more linear and characterbased analysis than this and engaging the masses in this way will obviously ultimately lead to a very nichemarket appeal.Despite an annoyingly redundant scene at the end of the film those who claim to appreciate this category of disturbing cinema and who are willing or daring enough to immerse themselves in the sickening extremities of human nature will be disturbed horrified and unsettled by Gurotesuku and considering these three adjectives are arguably the most soughtafter by hardcore horror aficionados it's difficult to argue that it doesn't succeed.".

We know the killer is a doctor I can't recall which kind and the couple works together. That's all we know. On top of that there's not much of a story either. The couple gets tortured by a psychotic killer who gets sexually excited through torturing people. Whatever happened to plot development?The violence is stupid pointless and in the ending scene completely ridiculous. If all you care about is seeing people go through extreme pain go and watch this movie because that's all that's there. Most people I've heard try to justify the violence in this movie say something like BUT DIS IS LUV STURRY ND IT HAZ DEEPIR MEENING. If you've actually been paying attention to the little information you've been given in the beginning of the movie you wouldn't think there's a deeper meaning at all. Even if it was truly a deeper meaning that doesn't make it good. The point of the violence is to show what some people will go through for another out of love. The topic of love isn't original after it's been brought up countless times in all forms of art for thousands of years.If you care about a movie having substance or not wasting time out of your life you will never get back don't watch this movie.

Watching people getting brutally killed particularly those who were just there for the bulk of the movie then.... the end after some silly fx does nothing for me except feeling a little dirty for watching this piece of trash.If you a fan of Devils rejects Vacancy and the like check it out but if you are like me a little and like at least a little mental stimulation with your gore fix skip this one.".

The new wave snuff films or rebirth of 70's uber violent films are just not my taste... this movie is a prime example of these pointless torture movies While in context the aspect of torture in a horror film i.e. Saw Hellraiser Texas chainsaw the original etc... works great because it's bad people getting their come uppence or just a cautionary of the cruelty of man but this film is just a fictionalized snuff film with no story what so ever. Watching people getting brutally killed particularly those who were just there for the bulk of the movie then.... the end after some silly fx does nothing for me except feeling a little dirty for watching this piece of trash.If you a fan of Devils rejects Vacancy and the like check it out but if you are like me a little and like at least a little mental stimulation with your gore fix skip this one.";

The story revolves around a man and a woman who are captured by a sadistic fucktard right after their first date. It turns out to be one of the sickest love stories I've seen Vital taking 1st place. The plot provides a lot of twists and turns as one would expect from a Japanese horror flickobviously excluding the guinea pig films and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The acting is very good and you actually care about the characters which makes watching them suffer so much more effective. Its also a step more gruesome in the torture department compared to Saw or other American films or that nature and it also deliberately and explicitly sexualises violence the. It is mostly a horror film but the love story subplot is quite interesting maybe even the main focus of the film.slight spoiler I also have to mention that there is a ridiculously hilarious scene near the end where a decapitated head bites a guys neck and its really out of place and that made it even more funny.It delivers the violence and gore but the plot is also interesting on its own so it doesn't really matter if you're watching because you want gore or because you like Asian horror.If you like something different or just more torture this should be a satisfactory watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Could Kji Shiraishi be a new Takashi Miike? He's already made 4 film this year and appears to attract controversy for the type of extreme 'splatter' movies he makes. Most notorious at the moment is this little slice of horror entitled 'Grotesque'. The BBFC have already banned it but that doesn't really mean anything anymore does it? Does it? Or does it?? What Kji Shiraishi appears to be doing here is attempting to outdo Eli Roth's dreadful 'Hostel' movies. A sort of 'who can make the grisliest horror movie' trip. Well he certainly succeeds in terms of outright horror and includes scenes that American filmmakers won't go near... specifically a scene which includes sexual assault. Note that as I write this movie is not available outside of Japan and the DVD has no subtitles so It's possible I've missed some intricate subtleties of the plot. Oh no wait! There isn't one HAH HAHAHAHA!Ahem. So what's the rumpus? A serial killer kidnaps a young couple and ties them up and tortures them. That's the story well more of a basis for torture to be honest. The film includes scenes of Nihon nipplesucking and nipple cutting chainsaw choppiness or rather choppenis testiclenailing vicious stabbings and gutspilling goading. The effects are okay sometimes laughable and the ending is hilarious. Tongue firmly in cheek Mr Shiraishi? It's a pity I didn't understand the dialogue the girl AV actress Nagasawa Tsugumi has a final speech which is obviously crucial and could go some way to justifying the violence. Or could it? Anyway it's bad but not that bad.The horror isn't very cringeworthy where as some of the effects are and it certainly doesn't justify being banned. For what it's worth duration is 1hour 13mins I believe someone should give it a decent DVD release in the future in Holland definitely. If you're a fan of horror you should see it. It you work for the BBFC you should sleep with it. Well worth a watch.".

And as with the legendary British Board Of Film Censors onslaught on horror movies in 1984 this will of course make it a much more sought after movie now than if they'd left it well alone. Its 2009 today and most folks with minor internet savvy will quite easily be able to obtain a perfect copy for a fee or for free as opposed to the underthecounter grainy bootlegs of years long past. So Englands banning of any movie these days has little effect on those that really want to see it anyway. Now on to the movie itself...For anyone to say they enjoyed this film Id have to ask them a few questions about their mindset. Don't get me wrong I definitely don't think it should have been given a UK ban but its really not something you'd want to sit down to with some popcorn and a quiet night in with your partner. For all its hype however and I was taken with some apprehension before I watched it parts of it aren't as bad as you might expect. For example the eye gouging scene is much less shocking IMO than Dalis Un Chien Andalou which was made 80 years ago in 1929. This is mainly because the camera doesn't actually let you see what happens  just the aftermath even thats not so bad. Other things like the sexual assault finish off excuse the pun with something that a bawdy anime cartoon would be proud of  liquid overkill in the extreme lol. Not to mention that even though there's graphic violence all over the screen the victimiser only lifts the female victims top up not her skirt and I asked myself could this be because of Japans aversion to pubic hair? Other things just don't make a lot of sense either no I don't mean the plot for example if this kind of torture was dealt out on any human being I would imagine they'd either bleed to death long before these sorry pair passed away or their reactions to the violence would have been much more extreme. And the females end made me laugh out loud  no really I mean literally wait for that one. The main part of the film then fades into both the couples lives ebbing away to the tune of Land of Hope and Glory  and I couldn't help but have another chuckle at this.So is it worth seeing? Id probably say yes. But heres how you approach it Imagine you're a special effects judge and take the movie as a collection of special effects you want to review. Then give your mark for the quality of each scene within. Thats how I saw the film. Not as a story of any value as it doesn't really have any plot but as a vehicle for showing what a good effects team can achieve with a few pounds of latex and a bucket of fake blood. And Id certainly like to see a Making Of documentary to learn how they did some of the scenes within. But in the meantime Im sure over the last few days and in more to come Google will have quite a lot of UK users searching Grotesque to see what all the fuss is about. Such is the enquiring human nature when you ban something.".

And the females end made me laugh out loud  no really I mean literally wait for that one. The main part of the film then fades into both the couples lives ebbing away to the tune of Land of Hope and Glory  and I couldn't help but have another chuckle at this.So is it worth seeing? Id probably say yes. But heres how you approach it Imagine you're a special effects judge and take the movie as a collection of special effects you want to review. Then give your mark for the quality of each scene within. Thats how I saw the film. Not as a story of any value as it doesn't really have any plot but as a vehicle for showing what a good effects team can achieve with a few pounds of latex and a bucket of fake blood. And Id certainly like to see a Making Of documentary to learn how they did some of the scenes within. But in the meantime Im sure over the last few days and in more to come Google will have quite a lot of UK users searching Grotesque to see what all the fuss is about. Such is the enquiring human nature when you ban something.";

When the couple regain consciousness they find themselves in a small room ball gagged  tied to rotating tables.

Hell I will openly admit the only reason I bothered to track a copy down  watch it was because it had been banned  not because I wanted to watch it to be brutally honest I don't really have a problem with the film  I personally would have no problem with this being made available to adults who want to see it but I don't work at the BBFC the British film censor board so it wasn't up to me... Anyway what we have here is a film almost totally devoid of any meaningful narrative or plot  an increasingly boring conveyor belt of sadism humiliation  torture as some guy we never find out who he is or his name gets sexually turned on by watching other people suffer  try to survive  cope with horrible injuries he inflicts upon them. That's it really. The majority of Gurotesuku has a minimalist documentary feel about it as it focuses completely on one aspect in a voyeuristic way but then the makers pull a bizarre ending out of the blue that seems to contradict the deadly serious harsh realistic brutality that preceded it with a silly dark comedic end that involved a flying severed living head  motives for the killer that amount to him smelling which felt like it was more suited to The Evil Dead 1982 than a film attempting to come across as snuff. At only 73 minutes it's short it does have some impact because of the brutality of it although I don't really know who it would appeal to it's certainly not a film you would sit down with your mates  watch unless you have weird mates. Not worth the notoriety that the recent BBFC ban will undoubtedly give it to be honest this is just a Saw or Hostel film without any of the plot or character development or sophistication.Although well made there's a lot of quick edits  shaky handheld camera movement which gets annoying. Despite what you may hear Gurotesuku isn't that extreme it's just that it's unrelenting  it's torture scene after torture scene without any chance to take a breather between them  I didn't think any one particular moment was any more graphic or disturbing than anything from the aforementioned Saw or Hostel films. There's some blood splatter needles are stuck into people hands are cut off with a chainsaw severed fingers are seen an arm is chopped off a head is chopped off a woman has her nipples cut off with scissors someones guts are pulled out  this guy hammers nails into his victims testicles that isn't overly graphic but the mere thought of it will send shivers down any mans spine  he also cuts his penis off which again isn't actually shown due to a well placed sheet but it's clear what is happening. The special effects are pretty good actually although for such a modern film that is expected. The constant juxtaposition of classical elegant music on the soundtrack that conflicted with the vile nastiness of the torture on screen got a little boring  repetitive by the end.Gurotesuku actually reminded me of the Guinea Pig Japanese series of films  in particular Guinea Pig Devil's Experiment 1985  Guinea Pig Flowers of Flesh and Blood 1985 both of which were also pseudo snuff films supposedly showing real torture  murder. The acting is quite good although the spoken dialogue is Japanese it's quite intense  the actor's do a decent job.Gurotesuku is a film which will now be sought after  become notorious for nothing more than a bunch of people saying it should be banned in the UK for no good reason as far as I can see  quite frankly it doesn't really deserve the publicity since it's not that good  has no real story artistic value or social relevance beyond two people being tortured  eventually murdered.".

This movie gives you a shirt only to rip it away and steal your dignity! The gore is extreme and very disturbing probably too much for most. I give this movie a 9 for being so disturbing and not a 10 because movies like salo and beautiful girl hunter set a high bar by being more aesthetically artistic and enjoyable to watch while this one seem void of aesthetics and hard to watch!!!

	schema:reviewBody "Grotesque is a challenge of the visual senses horror for the visually challenged where at one point at to stop then resumed viewing it later. The plot is simple yet from the doctor's crazed point of view the premise is rather intriguing. A young innocent couple who are going steady I guess after dining out are kidnapped by this brilliant maniacal surgeon who has them tied up in his basement what have you and tortures the living f..k out of them. His reasons are for his own sick entertainment to see how much they can endure or hold out before they give up and accept the inescapable fate of death. Also he wants to test their love against each other. I'm not gonna tell you what he does to em' but it's a lot to take. I'll leave that to the imagination of us sick ones to conjurer thoughts and images. For some of you you'll be screaming for a re watch of Audition or even Hostel which would come as a relief as it would a comedy after trying to get through this. This is a movie you don't undermine for it's shocking violence where each sick torturous act out shocks the last some torturous methods mirroring the ones in Daddy's Little Girl and don't think for a second cause of it's 73 minute running time that it lessens the amount of horror you expect to see. You don't get away that easy. Actually in it's early part I was actually disappointed as awaiting the real moments of shocking violence where I guess my expectations were fading or I was dubious but with the buzz of that chainsaw sounding I was quickly corrected. It's a film really for the toughest of the senses. I'm not kidding. I'm never been so unnerved or discomforted by a film such as this truly my heart was beating a lot through this intense view. This unsettling view isn't helped when the actors don't overact. They put just the right amount of acting into their believable characters. One shocking tease to the film involves a scene which at first you don't think is a dream which for one victim counts as a double whammy of a downer. This whole merciless film has nasty intentions a lot of people will find it repellent where the stronger ones will see the view through. The burial scene of our ill fated lovers at the end was memorably bizarre it's actually the strongest image of the film I can't get out of my head. But with all I've said what it all boils down to is a movie almost wholly based on torture saved for two scenes. This doesn't constitute for good horror but for it's qualities to shock unnerve and intensify I must praise this nasty piece of horror for what is despite it's degrading or immoral themes upon two human beings. God forbid this one spawns a sequel I for one don't think I could stomach it.".

It's a film really for the toughest of the senses. I'm not kidding. I'm never been so unnerved or discomforted by a film such as this truly my heart was beating a lot through this intense view. This unsettling view isn't helped when the actors don't overact. They put just the right amount of acting into their believable characters. One shocking tease to the film involves a scene which at first you don't think is a dream which for one victim counts as a double whammy of a downer. This whole merciless film has nasty intentions a lot of people will find it repellent where the stronger ones will see the view through. The burial scene of our ill fated lovers at the end was memorably bizarre it's actually the strongest image of the film I can't get out of my head. But with all I've said what it all boils down to is a movie almost wholly based on torture saved for two scenes. This doesn't constitute for good horror but for it's qualities to shock unnerve and intensify I must praise this nasty piece of horror for what is despite it's degrading or immoral themes upon two human beings. God forbid this one spawns a sequel I for one don't think I could stomach it.";

In such a situation all one can do is to keep looking at one's watch pretend that there is nothing wrong and above all else don't get involved.When it was announced that SCENES FROM A MALL would pair Bette Midler and Woody Allen together as a bickering couple who spend the day at the mall I couldn't help but smile. Bette and Woody married what a great idea. They both seem so different yet so perfect together. And to their credit they do have great chemistry here. They click. And they are certainly convincing as a couple with a whole boat load of marital issues. Maybe too convincing. What could have been an amusing thread of a story if interwoven into a larger tapestry becomes instead a tiresome ordeal. Woody and Bette argue and bicker and insult and break up and kiss and make up and argue and bicker and insult some more. Their daylong excursion to the mall to do Christmas shopping becomes an extended primal therapy session. Despite the best efforts of the two stars what begins as an amusing domestic comedy rapidly become just plain annoying. The fault lies with writerdirector Paul Mazursky whose films  good bad or indifferent  seldom have a strong focus and tend to ramble shamelessly. It is a style of filmmaking that in theory tries to represent realism but in practice it violates the conventions of what we accept as film reality  reelity so to speak. Mazursky's films always tend to look and feel like rehearsals not a finished production.This film has it assets. Woody and Bette of course. And the recreation of a California mall mostly filmed on a New York soundstage is quite convincing though how many malls feature ballroom dancing?. SCENES FROM A MALL looks right and is acted just right but in the end this trip to the mall wears you out leaving you just wanting to go home.".

	schema:headline " more like an absurdist play than a movie...but still enjoyable";
	schema:reviewBody "Now I remember when Scenes From A Mall first came out it got absolutely atrocious reviews.  I wasn't old enough to see it then but I loved the idea of a movie with two of my comedy heroes Woody Allen and Bette Midler.  In fact I had almost forgotten about this movie until I read a review of the newest Woody Allen movie Small Time Crooks in which the reviewer said that Allen hadn't had as good chemistry as he had with Tracey Ullman with another actress since Scenes From A Mall.  So I went out and found the movie and the reviewer was definitely correct.  The two stars have masterful chemistry although it's almost ridiculous to believe Woody Allen and Bette Midler would be together but then again isn't that it in most of his movies.  I mean does anyone believe he could have gone to bed with Mira Sorvino Julia Roberts Juliette Lewis Elisabeth Shue I mean even Judy Davis is a big stretch.  Well whatever.  The problem I had with the movie is that it is more like an absurdist play than a real movie.  This married couple go to the mall on their anniversary and both reveal they have had affairs.  The film is believable except for the wild and sudden reactions that Bette Midler's character has to Allen's revelations.  She knees him in the groin and screams at him.  Now nobody enjoys Bette Midler's antics more than I do think the phone call scene in Ruthless People but I just didn't buy it.  It was like Bette Midler was dying to have moments of big ballsy comedy inserted into a more serious film.  Then of course they make up which isn't very believable either nor is it funny.  Then she reveals her affair and Allen overreacts. At this point I was like in disbelief that anyone would expect us to swallow such a hackneyed and predictable reaction and story set up.  Of course they're more fighting and an annoying mime hello? they stole it from tootsie and lots of garish on again off again reactions.  Gee I wonder what happens at the end? It's not a hard one to predict folks.  It was perfectly enjoyable though but when you think about it in your head you realize it's really not such a with it piece of work. The movie reminded me of Midler's more recent film That Old Feeling where she again overreacts with big screaming fights that are supposed to be hysterical.  The couple in that movie also go do an on again off again thing with lots of screaming in between.  Like I said they're both enjoyable and Midler radiates charm but why does she keep saying yes to this terrible st?  She's a good actress and she should be doing better comedy's not this terrible lowbrow material hello Drowning Mona was beyond embarrasing its already the worst film of the year.  All in all scenes from a mall is worth it for the great chemistry between the two stars and its pretty cute. But why anyone would think that we would enjoy seeing Woody Allen in a ponytail is beyond me.".

Midler and Allen go to a mall somewhere in L.A. for a wedding anniversary while they are there Allen confesses to Midler that he has been having an affair with another woman. Midler then wants to file for a divorce but soon confesses to Allen that she has had an affair with another man. It is not a bad storyline but it just drags and leads to nowhere.

In the midst of all this a life shared for years is crumbling down as Nick is not the only one with a secret. The movie being interesting as it is has its flaws. The dynamic between Deb Midler and Nick is sometimes unbearable as it shifts drastically from one side to another. They are both on two separate rollercoasters and it's can be annoying. Perhaps the most charming feature is its neverending symbolism. Every little thing can be interpreted as many different things in the movie and I don't think the movie should be taken in as it is.

You already filmed it with a secondrate crew in just the past couple of days? What the hell is wrong with you?!I can understand it if Paul Mazursky wasn't as successful as one would think with this film because he didn't want to make the screwball comedy that everyone would expect but what is so pathetic about this is that there are many moments where the film truly does believe it is being funny such as the scenes with the irritating mime.Like most modern marriages after about half an hour you might really want to reconsider your vows with this film because although it starts blandly enough you still feel that you can expect the laughs to start piling up but they never ever do. Not once. Bette and Woody aren't even very good. What do they have with which to work? They can't spark off of one another in spite of generally giving as much as they can to these twodimensional characters.Overall this is quite an unnecessary film a contrived effort to cash in but with no juices at all except the anticipation of having Bette and Woody in the same film. It's almost unbelievable how bad it is. I understand if one does not trust the almost unanimous bashing this film gets until one actually sees it because I am guilty of this.

It's basically about a couple who are celebrating there 16th wedding anniversary and while they are out shopping Allen's character admits to finishing an affair the day before. After threatening divorce his wife also admits to an affair so the long relationship is in turmoil whilst still shopping in the mall. Woody Allen has definitely got something for this troubled relationship concept even when he hasn't written or directed the film himself. I did enjoy the chemistry between both of the characters and there banter was amusing in parts but the storyline was a bit silly for me. For such a loving couple I don't know why they chose to tell each other such a deep secret in the mall especially with a dinner planned for later on that day. Anyway it's a silly romantic comedy which is mostly based in the mall hence the title which goes a bit over the top after a while.RoundUp Well I have now completed my Woody Allen season and it really does feel like I have watched a really long film based around troubled relationships and infidelity with a New York backdrop. None of his earlier projects are anywhere near Blue Jasmine which is also based around a troubled relationship but it's Cate Blanchett that made that movie brilliant. Most of the movies with Mia Farrow were quite dull but the films with Diane Keaton were much better. He's not the most versatile writersdirectors and his comedy is warped and not that humorous but I'm sure that he entertains a certain type of audience which I'm certainly not a part of.Budget 3million Worldwide Gross 10millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there Woody Allen movies about a couple who are celebrating there 16th anniversary and admit to infidelity whilst shopping in a mall. 310".

	schema:headline " Decent film with expected editing problems";
	schema:reviewBody "Ellie Christina Ricci and her brother Jimmy Jesse Eisenberg are on their way home when they get into a car accident. While trying to help the other driver out of an overturned vehicle the other driver is attacked by what Jimmy swears was a huge manlike wolf. Both Jimmy and Ellie end up scratched and possibly bitten by the creature. When they begin noticing strange physical effects and behaviorincluding both of them suddenly becoming more assertive sociallythey begin to wonder if a werewolf has bitten them. If so will they turn into werewolves too? Cursed had a notoriously difficult time making it to the screen. It began production in 2002 then went through four major shoots with 90 of the material being tossed out at one point. Major characters played by major actorsincluding Freddie Prinze Jr. and Skeet Ulrichwere in and out of the film. Director Wes Craven even ended up abandoning the film altogether when Dimension Films chairman Bob Weinstein demanded a PG13 cut rather than Craven's initial R. Someone else did the final PG13 cut. As should be expected these events appear to have harmed the film.As the theatrical release stands chunks of the film appear to be missing. For example we see Jimmy and Ellie both pretty convinced that they're werewolves shortly after Jimmy first begins researching the symptoms and Ellie thinks he's being ridiculous. The transition is not convincing there seems to be exposition missing. There are a number of such choppy non sequitur moments. The film doesn't flow very well.The most obvious material to be cutduring and after attack scenessurely hurt the film as well although part of the problem with these scenes may have been Craven's fault. Like too many recent films attack scenes are shot blurry cut way too fast and they're often too dark. Part of the idea might have been to make the CGI less obvious but I'd rather have obvious CGI than incoherent scenes.One final flaw was that the werewolf material in the film wasn't handled very clearly. Whether this was yet another editing problem or a script problem from screenwriter Kevin Williamson is difficult to say but the film's werewolf rules are never well explained. For example it's never quite clear why the werewolf would want to attack people again and why they wouldn't just be fullfledged lycanthropes the first time. Although this makes a bit more sense later in the film werewolf rules are still implied that are never explained but needed to be.But there are a number of positive aspects to the film. Craven shows that he hasn't lost his love of postmodernist reference and theatrical wall breaking the performances are good occasionally the film is suspenseful the car crash near the beginning is especially well done and Williamson's story overall is intriguing in that Cursed is really a somewhat traditional thriller in which characters just happen to be werewolves.Craven opens the film at a carnival which is obviously theatrical and quickly presents a psychic performer who happens to be a real psychic taking her job seriously rather than just providing entertainment. The parallel is to Craven as a horror filmmaker which may often be seen as just an entertainer instead of a real illusionist approaching the job with serious intentions. Then he quickly takes us to a club Tinsel that's a veritable Madame Tussauds with a Hollywood theme complete with full detailed sets. There are numerous horror references in the club including to Craven's own work such as A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984. This emphasizes the artificiality of cinema in a way similar to the real film in a film conceit of Craven's New Nightmare 1994. To push this theatrical wall breaking further many sets such as the interior of Jimmy and Ellie's house are lit and shot so as to emphasize their artificialityalmost as if the film were being made on the displays at the Tinsel club. Craven also has a number of characters working in the entertainment industry and like New Nightmare has celebrities playing themselves. As a humorous jab at filmic selfreference and comments about his use of the same in previous films especially Scream 1996 a pivotal scene near Cursed's false climax is shot in a very artificiallooking hall of mirrors and this is also literally reminiscent of a number of other horror films including The Exorcist II The Heretic 1977 Dr. Giggles 1992 and The Haunting 1999.The fact that Williamson has really constructed a thriller and it just appears to be a werewolf film is a kind of latefilm twist that provides another level of wall breaking. It's a clever idea that has some similarities to Williamson's I Know What You Did Last Summer 1997 script which continually flirted with the gray area between thrillers and slasher flicks. Williamson also spends time exploring the dramatic consequences of Ellie and Jimmy's newfound power.However given the final result at least with the cut I watched these more intellectual touches from Craven and Williamson may have ended up being too hip for the film which Dimension apparently wanted to sell as a more bythenumbers horror flick geared to pull in younger teens and a surprising amount of preteens in the showing I attended. I'm not usually one to complain about the existence of PG13 or even tamer horror as I do not think that gore language etc. are necessary for a good film. It's not that I dislike gore but I love the first three Universal Frankenstein films say as much as I love the Evil Dead series Romero's zombie films or any of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre films and certainly more than I like say Andreas Schnaas' work which has the gore but not much else. But when the result of studios pushing for PG13 results in such an apparent botchjob I have to add my voice to the protesters.".

It began production in 2002 then went through four major shoots with 90 of the material being tossed out at one point. Major characters played by major actorsincluding Freddie Prinze Jr. and Skeet Ulrichwere in and out of the film. Director Wes Craven even ended up abandoning the film altogether when Dimension Films chairman Bob Weinstein demanded a PG13 cut rather than Craven's initial R. Someone else did the final PG13 cut. As should be expected these events appear to have harmed the film.As the theatrical release stands chunks of the film appear to be missing. For example we see Jimmy and Ellie both pretty convinced that they're werewolves shortly after Jimmy first begins researching the symptoms and Ellie thinks he's being ridiculous. The transition is not convincing there seems to be exposition missing. There are a number of such choppy non sequitur moments. The film doesn't flow very well.The most obvious material to be cutduring and after attack scenessurely hurt the film as well although part of the problem with these scenes may have been Craven's fault. Like too many recent films attack scenes are shot blurry cut way too fast and they're often too dark. Part of the idea might have been to make the CGI less obvious but I'd rather have obvious CGI than incoherent scenes.One final flaw was that the werewolf material in the film wasn't handled very clearly. Whether this was yet another editing problem or a script problem from screenwriter Kevin Williamson is difficult to say but the film's werewolf rules are never well explained. For example it's never quite clear why the werewolf would want to attack people again and why they wouldn't just be fullfledged lycanthropes the first time. Although this makes a bit more sense later in the film werewolf rules are still implied that are never explained but needed to be.But there are a number of positive aspects to the film. Craven shows that he hasn't lost his love of postmodernist reference and theatrical wall breaking the performances are good occasionally the film is suspenseful the car crash near the beginning is especially well done and Williamson's story overall is intriguing in that Cursed is really a somewhat traditional thriller in which characters just happen to be werewolves.Craven opens the film at a carnival which is obviously theatrical and quickly presents a psychic performer who happens to be a real psychic taking her job seriously rather than just providing entertainment. The parallel is to Craven as a horror filmmaker which may often be seen as just an entertainer instead of a real illusionist approaching the job with serious intentions. Then he quickly takes us to a club Tinsel that's a veritable Madame Tussauds with a Hollywood theme complete with full detailed sets. There are numerous horror references in the club including to Craven's own work such as A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984. This emphasizes the artificiality of cinema in a way similar to the real film in a film conceit of Craven's New Nightmare 1994. To push this theatrical wall breaking further many sets such as the interior of Jimmy and Ellie's house are lit and shot so as to emphasize their artificialityalmost as if the film were being made on the displays at the Tinsel club. Craven also has a number of characters working in the entertainment industry and like New Nightmare has celebrities playing themselves. As a humorous jab at filmic selfreference and comments about his use of the same in previous films especially Scream 1996 a pivotal scene near Cursed's false climax is shot in a very artificiallooking hall of mirrors and this is also literally reminiscent of a number of other horror films including The Exorcist II The Heretic 1977 Dr. Giggles 1992 and The Haunting 1999.The fact that Williamson has really constructed a thriller and it just appears to be a werewolf film is a kind of latefilm twist that provides another level of wall breaking. It's a clever idea that has some similarities to Williamson's I Know What You Did Last Summer 1997 script which continually flirted with the gray area between thrillers and slasher flicks. Williamson also spends time exploring the dramatic consequences of Ellie and Jimmy's newfound power.However given the final result at least with the cut I watched these more intellectual touches from Craven and Williamson may have ended up being too hip for the film which Dimension apparently wanted to sell as a more bythenumbers horror flick geared to pull in younger teens and a surprising amount of preteens in the showing I attended. I'm not usually one to complain about the existence of PG13 or even tamer horror as I do not think that gore language etc. are necessary for a good film. It's not that I dislike gore but I love the first three Universal Frankenstein films say as much as I love the Evil Dead series Romero's zombie films or any of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre films and certainly more than I like say Andreas Schnaas' work which has the gore but not much else. But when the result of studios pushing for PG13 results in such an apparent botchjob I have to add my voice to the protesters.";

I should have known after reshoots and delay upon delay of the film's release It should have come out last November that this would not be another masterpiece in the works. Though I tried to keep my hopes up the results of this recombination are mixed at best.Christina Ricci Monster and Jessie Eisenberg Roger Dodger star as siblings who are attacked by a mysterious animal in the Hollywood hills while trying to pull a woman from a wrecked car. Both are wounded by this animal and as the days go by they begin to change. Eisenberg is most convincing as the younger brother who researches the animal that attacked them. He believes they were infected by a werewolf. The rest of the film chronicles their changes and quest to find the beast who infected them.Aside from Ricci and Eisenberg the cast mainly consists of a smorgasbord of television actors mostly from the WB. And I'm not sure that I'd call what they were doing acting. It seemed they mostly showed up and had a good time. Which can work as long as the audience is enjoying it too. However I found myself groaning at much of the dialogue and wincing during emotional moments.The film is slow to take off but does pick up the pace in the middle before falling off again towards the end. The computer graphics already look dated and the werewolf makeup is most definitely sub par. A word to filmmakers everywhere if you can't make a werewolf transformation look convincing then don't show it at all. There's a lot to be said for implication.Though there are several scenes where something pops up in the frame to make you jump in your seat nothing haunts you as you leave the theater. There's no fear of bad dreams here.Overall the geniuses behind one of the classic fright films of the 90s and possibly of all time did not bring their best work into this decade. I hate to say it but Wes Craven seems to be suffering from his own curse  the loss of fright.For a smarter more imaginative take on the werewolf theme check out Ginger Snaps or Dog Soldiers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ellie and kid brother Jimmy are driving home late one night through the Hollywood Hills when something huge and monstrous crosses their path. One nasty road accident later the annoyingly whiny female passenger of the car they just hit is dragged off into the woods by a mostly unseen creature which rips the woman to shreds  and good riddance. Ellie and Jimmy do not escape unscathed themselves. The creature has mildly injured them both and soon brother and sister are experiencing heightened senses and suffering the Mark of the Beast on the palm of their hands. For Jimmy it's a blessing in disguise as he returns to high school and battles the school bully. For Ellie it's the first step on the path towards discovering who the real monster is and the suspects are numerous. Will she and her brother discover the identity of the beast in time to save themselves from the curse? Or will they too become full fledged werewolves at the next full moon?Cursed doesn't take itself very seriously as a horror film or as a comedy. It seems to be trying to decide which it wanted to be and hadn't made up its mind in time for the closing credits. There are a few genuine laughs to be found throughout and some nifty references to the bygone days of Universal Creature Features but for the most part this is a silly airbrushed effort filled with Beautiful People acting stupidly. I should have considered myself warned when I saw Scott Baio's name in the opening credits. The werewolf itself has a few good scenes but I was kind of disappointed to see the legendary Rick Baker's name in the credits and then find myself face to face with a CGI beast later on. And what was Christina Ricci doing in this? Did she lose a bet with Wes Craven or something?This film might have fared better in the 80s but it seems somewhat lifeless and unimaginative these days. I'm just glad I had a free pass otherwise I would be feeling profoundly ripped off right about now.".

One nasty road accident later the annoyingly whiny female passenger of the car they just hit is dragged off into the woods by a mostly unseen creature which rips the woman to shreds  and good riddance. Ellie and Jimmy do not escape unscathed themselves. The creature has mildly injured them both and soon brother and sister are experiencing heightened senses and suffering the Mark of the Beast on the palm of their hands. For Jimmy it's a blessing in disguise as he returns to high school and battles the school bully. For Ellie it's the first step on the path towards discovering who the real monster is and the suspects are numerous. Will she and her brother discover the identity of the beast in time to save themselves from the curse? Or will they too become full fledged werewolves at the next full moon?Cursed doesn't take itself very seriously as a horror film or as a comedy. It seems to be trying to decide which it wanted to be and hadn't made up its mind in time for the closing credits. There are a few genuine laughs to be found throughout and some nifty references to the bygone days of Universal Creature Features but for the most part this is a silly airbrushed effort filled with Beautiful People acting stupidly. I should have considered myself warned when I saw Scott Baio's name in the opening credits. The werewolf itself has a few good scenes but I was kind of disappointed to see the legendary Rick Baker's name in the credits and then find myself face to face with a CGI beast later on. And what was Christina Ricci doing in this? Did she lose a bet with Wes Craven or something?This film might have fared better in the 80s but it seems somewhat lifeless and unimaginative these days. I'm just glad I had a free pass otherwise I would be feeling profoundly ripped off right about now.";

	schema:reviewBody "I've been waiting to see Cursed for a very long time probably more than a year since the first time I heard about it. I expected a great movie with Wes Craven at the helm why wouldn't it be a great film? I went to the opening day matine showing and this is how I sum it up.Cursed fails to capture the audience's attention for a few main reasons. First and foremost it follows too much standardized formula and fails to think outside the box. Watching Cursed you can almost predict exactly what will happen and when it will happen. The script could have been improved with a few minor changes which would have changed the entire direction of the film. Instead you have an ATypical werewolf film with the protagonists fighting to save them selves from the curse. Sorry folks this story has been done in other horror films more times than I can count and not just in werewolf films! One element I didn't care for was when the brother Jimmy suggests being a werewolf could be cool. This is exactly where the story should have gone from that point onwards. But as quickly as he says being a werewolf could be cool he falls back to the standard gotta kill the head werewolf and end this curse attitude. The movie would have been better if Jimmy had welcomed his curse. Had that one change in plot occurred the story could have gone off in several darker and more interesting plot lines. I can't fault the CGI effects for a change. I am strong opponent of CGI technology as the effects usually look awful.In Cursed the effects are better than normal although they are still no where near the traditional An American Werewolf in London makeup and prosthetics quality. I did enjoy the humor in the film. Cursed does offer several very funny moments and a few corny ones too. Without the humor the movie would have been an utter waste of time. The humor helps detract from the poor plot line which you can tell was attempting to be clever like Scream but failing miserably. I wonder if Wes Craven was even on the set when this film was made. It seemed to lack of the trademark qualities of a Craven film. Whatever the case may be it is obvious he did not do his research in what makes a great werewolf film.Werewolf films to be effective must have several good transformation scenes graphic mauling and mutilations and an innocent protagonist who is seduced by the curse. Cursed really has none of these qualities. Overall I did enjoy the film but I also expected the movie would fail to wow me which it did. It seems to me that the problems with Cursed were mostly script and plot related. Don't expect to be scared but try to have a little fun with what it is. Remember werewolf movies are almost never scary...especially if they throw in a happy ending!".

	schema:reviewBody "Cursed huh? Well that appropriately describes what a lot of moviegoers did when the final credits started to roll. This has to be one of the most irrelevant insignificant movies to come along in quite a while. There's not a single thing I can recommend about this movie. Not a single thing. It offers absolutely nothing new or original to the werewolf genre. Why even bother? The acting is bad the special effects are unimpressive I couldn't have cared less about any of the characters or their relationships... seriously is there a less appealing screen couple than Pacey from Dawson's Creek and Christina Ricci? Wooo look at Pacey! He's got a neatly trimmed beard! He's all grown up now! Whatever. All he did was spit out some cheesy lines about how Ricci who he'd been dating for all of two months was the one for him and he really wanted to make it work and BLAH BLAH BLAH! WHO CARES?!?!?!?! I just wanted to punch the guy in the face. Repeatedly. Until my knuckles bled. I couldn't care less if I never see this guy in another movie ever again.If you're gonna have characters that I couldn't be less interested in then please try to have a somewhat interesting story with a few good scares. Oh you couldn't do that for this movie? Well believe me I could tell. The scariest thing about Cursed is Christina Ricci's bulbous forehead. Were those CGI werewolves actually supposed to be scary? Heck if that's what werewolves were really like then I'd have pretty good chances if I had to go up against one.And was it completely impossible to have a semblance of a story? You call those plot twists? Folks no one over the age of 5 will be surprised at who the main werewolf is. The story is so nonexistent that it gives me a headache trying to figure out why. Did Kevin Williamson even try when writing this script? It's as if he asked himself How can I make this as clichd as possible and then ran with it. In case you forgot Craven and Williamson teamed up on Scream which was a very original clever and entertaining movie. What in the world has happened since then? How were these two movies written by the same guy? If nothing else you've gotta at least love the irony in the fact that Cursed is exactly the kind of teen horror movie that Scream poked fun at.It's pretty sad that Corey Feldman couldn't even keep his name attached to this film his scenes were cut but it's even sadder that this movie would've actually been better by having Feldman in it. Ouch. I think that's the true hallmark of a movie's failure. If someone tells you Man you should've kept Feldman's scenes in there it would've helped then you need to do some serious soul searching before attempting another movie.Cursed tries to take a Scream approach and not take itself too seriously but man that doesn't mean it had to be a complete joke. I admit that I laughed a few times but most of the time I was laughing it was because what I was witnessing was just so stupid. Let me ask you something  if you're in the bathroom and you friend is in the stall making weird noises and you think he or she is sick do you go OPEN THE STALL DOOR???? NO! Nobody does that! You may ask if the person's all right but you don't put your ear to the stall and then open it unless you're just a freak. Sigh.The most genuinely funny thing in the movie is Scott Baio's cameo as Scott Baio. The running joke is that he's supposed to be the third guest on The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn behind Ashton Kutcher and Carrot Top. But even this is pretty sad since Kilborn's been gone from the show for a few months now. Way to stay on top of things guys! Looks like somebody has his finger directly on the pulse of today's pop culture! I can't think of a single person to recommend this to. Not even the biggest werewolf movie fan. But I can recommend they change the tagline. Here's my suggestion A Werewolf Movie That Really Bites. There I just wrote something more clever than anything found in the script of Cursed and I wasn't given a 40 million budget to do it.THE GIST You've been warned so if you pay money to see Cursed then you've got nobody to blame but yourself. I tried to tell you. Cursed is nothing but a bad madefortheWB movie and I can say without flinching or smirking that Michael Par's Bad Moon is a better werewolf movie than this toilet log. If that doesn't tell you everything you need to know then there's nothing else I can say.Rating 2 out 5".

I just wanted to punch the guy in the face. Repeatedly. Until my knuckles bled. I couldn't care less if I never see this guy in another movie ever again.If you're gonna have characters that I couldn't be less interested in then please try to have a somewhat interesting story with a few good scares. Oh you couldn't do that for this movie? Well believe me I could tell. The scariest thing about Cursed is Christina Ricci's bulbous forehead. Were those CGI werewolves actually supposed to be scary? Heck if that's what werewolves were really like then I'd have pretty good chances if I had to go up against one.And was it completely impossible to have a semblance of a story? You call those plot twists? Folks no one over the age of 5 will be surprised at who the main werewolf is. The story is so nonexistent that it gives me a headache trying to figure out why. Did Kevin Williamson even try when writing this script? It's as if he asked himself How can I make this as clichd as possible and then ran with it. In case you forgot Craven and Williamson teamed up on Scream which was a very original clever and entertaining movie. What in the world has happened since then? How were these two movies written by the same guy? If nothing else you've gotta at least love the irony in the fact that Cursed is exactly the kind of teen horror movie that Scream poked fun at.It's pretty sad that Corey Feldman couldn't even keep his name attached to this film his scenes were cut but it's even sadder that this movie would've actually been better by having Feldman in it. Ouch. I think that's the true hallmark of a movie's failure. If someone tells you Man you should've kept Feldman's scenes in there it would've helped then you need to do some serious soul searching before attempting another movie.Cursed tries to take a Scream approach and not take itself too seriously but man that doesn't mean it had to be a complete joke. I admit that I laughed a few times but most of the time I was laughing it was because what I was witnessing was just so stupid. Let me ask you something  if you're in the bathroom and you friend is in the stall making weird noises and you think he or she is sick do you go OPEN THE STALL DOOR???? NO! Nobody does that! You may ask if the person's all right but you don't put your ear to the stall and then open it unless you're just a freak. Sigh.The most genuinely funny thing in the movie is Scott Baio's cameo as Scott Baio. The running joke is that he's supposed to be the third guest on The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn behind Ashton Kutcher and Carrot Top. But even this is pretty sad since Kilborn's been gone from the show for a few months now. Way to stay on top of things guys! Looks like somebody has his finger directly on the pulse of today's pop culture! I can't think of a single person to recommend this to. Not even the biggest werewolf movie fan. But I can recommend they change the tagline. Here's my suggestion A Werewolf Movie That Really Bites. There I just wrote something more clever than anything found in the script of Cursed and I wasn't given a 40 million budget to do it.THE GIST You've been warned so if you pay money to see Cursed then you've got nobody to blame but yourself. I tried to tell you. Cursed is nothing but a bad madefortheWB movie and I can say without flinching or smirking that Michael Par's Bad Moon is a better werewolf movie than this toilet log. If that doesn't tell you everything you need to know then there's nothing else I can say.Rating 2 out 5";

	schema:reviewBody "Before I get to the review I think it should be noted that Corey Feldman was supposed to be in this movie but his scenes were cut. Normally that information would bode well for a movie but not in this case. All you really need to know about this movie is that after seeing it you'll be left wondering how bad Feldman's scenes must have been that they weren't good enough to make it into this pile of garbage.This movie is a less clever version of Scream with a video game werewolf tossed in. The only thing worse than the plot twists are the ridiculous cgi effects.spoilersThe movie begins with the over done scene involving teenagers at a carnival encountering a fortune teller who sees blood in their futures. This particular fortune teller seems to deal in the immediate future because less than 5 minutes later the girl who's palm was read is in a car accident with Christina Ricci that results in her being killed by the werewolf. Here is the first CGI nightmare when her lower torso is ripped off and her digital remains crawl around on the ground in an attempt to gross out anyone afraid of Adobe Photoshop.The story revolves around Christina Ricci who works for the Craig Kilborne show why? and her wimpy brother who has the jimmies for the class hottie that happens to be dating the guy who always picks on him. Believe it or not word is that this movie has been years in the making which is the best explanation one can come up with as to why the writers chose to have Ricci work for the Craig Kilborne show it's cancelled now you tard. The only thing lamer than that would have been if she worked for Carson Daily. Although seeing that metrosexual get killed by a werewolf might have given the moviegoers something to cheer about.The other main character who is obviously the werewolf is Joshua Jackson aka Pacey from Dawson's Creek or the guy from that horrible Skulls movie. They try to sell Pacey as a playa who is ready to settle down with Ricci but gets foiled by all of the hot women hitting on him at parties and what not. Oh yeah and he might be the werewolf.The rest of the ride to the final battle isn't worth analyzing but I will say that one especially horrible scene involves a female werewolf flipping the digitized bird to Ricci after she insults her hair and skin.From here we get to the last scene were Pacey comes to convince Ricci that they can be happy together as werewolves and she rejects him on cue so he decides to kill her. Surprisingly though she kills him instead. Surprising if you missed the entire movie because you thought you were at Shark Boy and Lava Girl and wore 3D glasses the whole time that is.Needless to say immediately after chopping off Pacey's head Ricci and her brother walk outside and the hot girl is suddenly there and just happens to like the brother and makes out with him in the yard. Then he walks her home with her gay friend and Ricci makes a joke about having to stay home and spend all night cleaning the house. ha ha. Oh yeah too bad she just decapitated her boyfriend 2 minutes ago and his murdered carcass is laying on the kitchen floor.So basically the camera cuts away to the credits and it's considered a happy ending. This seems impossible for the characters who have just had to face the fact that they live in a world were werewolves can come at night and kill you. I mean once you reach that point wouldn't pretty much everything else scare you? Hey honey what's that noise outside the window? Oh it's nothing dear oh wait a second...maybe it's not nothing. I forgot WEREWOLVES EXIST.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cursed is another new and horrible excuse for a horror movie from the talentless pen of Kevin Williamson. He proves again that he's the worst thing that could happen to the horrorindustry while director Wes Craven enlarges his list of embarrassingly bad movies that actually started right after his 1977 film The Hills have Eyes. Craven and Williamson's previous collaboration Scream actually is a masterpiece compared with this piece of garbage that messes with the  once marvelous  myth of werewolves. Set in Hollywood and revolving on characters you couldn't feel less connected with this movie feels like another dreadful episode of Dawson's Creek only with a wolf instead of James Vander Beek. All the rest is the same high school popularity contests glamourgirls battling over the same stud and we even have the classic case of siblings looking after each other due to their parents' sudden death! Sigh...I'm a great fan of classic atmospheric werewolftales and witnessing how these legendary creatures are abused here to serve for childish purposes makes me furious. Werewolves don't care for eliminating sexual competition! They don't care about how cute boys look!! There's absolutely no tension in Cursed the script is predictable and the attempts to scare the audience are lame. The gorefactor is weak and the werewolftransformation sequences are downright pitiful. Movies like An American werewolf in London and the Howling are almost 25 years older but the special effects team of Cursed surely could have learned something from them on how making a transformation creepy instead of laughable. Christina Ricci looks yummy in her heroinerole but her boring performance definitely can't make this turkey any more appealing. My humble opinion is that you avoid watching Cursed like you would avoid getting Syphillys! There are good recent movies handling about werewolves like Dog Soilders or the Ginger Snapstrilogy that you can watch instead. Those are good movies mainly because nor Wes Craven nor Kevin Williamson had anything to do with them.".

	schema:reviewBody "Trust me movies don't get much worse than this one. Granted my expectations were pretty low before stepped into the theater but I didn't expect this movie to be THIS bad.First off I didn't know which direction Wes Craven wanted to go. Did he want a certified serious horror piece like the original Nightmare on Elm St. or a spoofyslasher flick like Scream. What you get is something in between and a movie with no direction what so ever. Let me start off with the acting. The acting in this movie was so bad it I wondered if Craven even bothered to yelled out the word cut now and then as the actors muddled through B movie scripted cue cards. But then again you won't see too many Oscar capturing moments when you're faced with riveting thespians like Shannon Elizabeth Mya Potia De Rosi the dude who plays Lex Luther on Smallville and Scott Baio. Yes Charles in Charge himself graces us with his presence playing the character of himself Scott Baio. The movie barely hangs together with a tissue thin plot and riddle with tons of plot holes and continuity problems. The special effects have got to be the worst I've seen in this day in age mixing up some pretty bad CGI and robotic puppeting making the werewolves a just slight step down from the Wacko Jacko makeup job in his Thriller video. The movie contains a few bad jokes some predictable jumpy parts and many scenes plucked straight out of the 1001 Horror Clich guide book. The cherry on top of this complete mess is when the cops have the main werewolf cornered and the victims lure it out with some fat jokes the werewolf jumps out and gives them the the middle finger. Absolutely brilliant.This movie was neither scary funny enjoyable or even tolerable. I wouldn't recommend to anyone over the age of 20 because I felt that it really targets teens with cheap laughs and thrills. The only thing that really scared me is assumption that Craven will be compelled to make a sequel.".

First I will start with the acting Ricci Jackson Eisenberg and even Mya were just right on with their performances and fit their characters well. The Werewolf effects story and histories were all interesting to me and kept me wanting more and more and more. And really I love how it shows Ricci as she starts to fell and act more like a werewolf I think that was really well done. The twist was great the blood and gore was beautiful unrated. When I really love a film I usually don't have a laundry list I unload to the reader I tend to leave that part limited cause I can go on and on and really I don't fell the need to with a film I love. I want you to go and see it yourself keep in mind this is the Unrated version I'm talking about not the rated version. I will be brief about this part though I was going to see it 4 years ago in theaters and I'm so happy I had to wait for the DVD cause the PG13 version is lame and watered down the Unrated version is where its at more fun more blood more action this is where its at.

Becoming a werewolf temporarily got him cool points and the girl. The funniest parts are the scenes between Ellie Ricci and Joanie Greerwho sees Ellie as a rival for Jake the werewolf Jackson.This movie maintains a quirky tone to the end. The special effects overall are okay with the exception of the metamorphosis of Joanie into a werewolf which was a bit cartoonish. The creature makeup was good though.

As they are attempting to help the passenger a wolf grabs the passenger apparently to have a midnight snack. In the process of saving her both Ellie and Jimmy get bitten by the wolf. Jimmy suspects that they were attacked by a werewolf but Ellie is in denial despite the fact that her senses are heightened and all of the guys are giving her some intense looks Including Scott Baio who just seems happy to be in any film these days. Jimmy is just as happy going against the jocks that are messing with him. However good things don't last for long as there are attacks through L.A.The film is loaded with flaws A lot of flat places in the film but the cast does its best to bring it back to life Especially Judy Greer as Ricci's rival who steals what bit of film there is.

	schema:reviewBody "James Riddle Hoffa was probably one of the most enigmatic union leaders in this history of our country. As an important labor organizer during the over the road trucker strikes in the 1930s he accomplished many things that made possible the emergence of the Teamsters Union as a major political force for several decades afterward. At the same time he fell into a trap that bedevils many a fighter who perceives herhimself as a people's champion he convinced himself that he had to fight fire with fire and in the end it devoured him. Secondly Hoffa did not have the money the support or the political sophistication of a Robert Kennedy. This'll finish you in the United States. Despite all our bombast about law and order the country loves its shady political characters charming and slick or the medicine show man witness Clinton Reagan Bush. The awkward and openly coarse need not apply witness Nixon Hoffa Lott. David Mamet understands that and that's why his version of Hoffa's life works. Mamet's Hoffa knows the Kennedy family built their fortune out of rum running to a large extent and he sees no difference between their corruption and his own compromises. At least Hoffa tells himself his own deals with the devil serve something larger then his immediate family they serve the membership of the union. And this was very true which is why a fair number of Teamsters still swear by the name Jimmy Hoffa. Nicholson's snide asides to his betters completely captures the class war basis that motivated the actual man's actions. Anyone who has been through an actual labor dispute and has been witness to the patronizing communications that come through a company eager to crush a union effort knows full well what fired up Jimmy Hoffa even as we turn aside from the path he took.The film succeeds because De Vito Nicholson and Mamet understand what pushed the labor movement forward and they understand its contradictions. Most important they understand why those contradictions overwhelmed a man as gifted as Jimmy Hoffa and this is what makes it better then your average Hollywood drama about labor. Hoffa is a film about working class attitude that gets beneath the usual dismissals of working class concerns and as such deserves respect. The powers that be have every legend about their leadership. It's time the working class was allowed legends about its own once again provided we understand that they are legends and therefore laden with much myth. The very real larger then life qualities of Jimmy Hoffa however make this a film worth more then one critical glance.".

	schema:reviewBody "I would guess that many people find Jack Nicholson as satisfying as I do because like Cary Grant he always seems to play an only slightly refracted version of the same character. Those leaping eyebrows like twin Mount Raniers on his forehead. That toothy grin sardonic and sadistic. Here though he gives all that up and becomes a different and highly energetic Jimmy Hoffa. His lips are tucked in his head held back emphasizing the folds in his neck and he wears an almost constant scowl. His voice too lacks the expected sleazy glissandos of the Nicholson School of Elocution. His speech is clipped fast and full of workingclass grammar. All these rumors are unsubstantuated! He does a great job as Jimmy Hoffa. And Danny DeVito is great as always playing Hoffa's oldtime buddy Bobby Ciaro a clown with a potential for deadly seriousness. Nicholson and DeVito grew up in the same town  Neptune New Jersey  at about the same time and have known each other for years. DeVito claimed to have dated Nicholson's sister. It's pleasing to see the two of them working together.In some ways though the whole may be less than the sum of its parts. The story is a bit like that of The Godfather but without the Mafia mystique. Hoffa starts out good but then  well what? Does he go bad? If so the movie does as good a job of hiding exactly what he did as Hoffa himself did. There is a scene in which he seems to agree to lend money from the Teamster's Pension Fund to a known Italian. But the scene takes place during a faux deer hunt and is played for laughs. While D'Allesandro Armand Assante and Hoffa argue over the terms of the loan a deer walks up unexpectedly and is ignored by everyone until finally DeVito uncorks his automatic and blasts it. When the shots sound everyone hits the dirt. The scene is amusing but it's distracting too. What WAS that agreement exactly? Is it illegal for the President of a labor union to lend money to someone else at a profit? Hoffa claims not.

Hoffa eventually is convicted and goes to jail. But it is never made clear exactly what he was convicted of. Lending money to an Italian? Nicholson plays Hoffa pretty straight. He's not a particularly nice guy but he's clever in the way that an alley cat is clever. Mamet's dialog stays on track. Yet the director DeVito gives him the almost same kind of sentimental treatment that Don Corleone got. I am happy though that the movie spared us scenes in which Hoffa's wife sobs and complains that he's so often away from home that she hardly knows him anymore. Thanks again Mamet. There is a fictional but still unnerving assassination scene at the end. Hoffa and DeVito's bodies are dumped atop one another in the back seat of their car. The car is driven up the ramp of a waiting truck and the truck zooms off down the highway towards its unknown destination. Elegiac music swells on the sound track. The image of the back of the truck recedes and dwindles until it disappears down the highway a setting sun hovering just overhead.Did Hoffa really deserve this Viking's funeral? I don't know. The movie left me with a lot of unanswered questions none of them about the performances. A viewer can't help wondering where Hoffa is now. Part of a building somewhere or an automobile? Or a truck?".

	onyx:emotionText "I would guess that many people find Jack Nicholson as satisfying as I do because like Cary Grant he always seems to play an only slightly refracted version of the same character. Those leaping eyebrows like twin Mount Raniers on his forehead. That toothy grin sardonic and sadistic. Here though he gives all that up and becomes a different and highly energetic Jimmy Hoffa. His lips are tucked in his head held back emphasizing the folds in his neck and he wears an almost constant scowl. His voice too lacks the expected sleazy glissandos of the Nicholson School of Elocution. His speech is clipped fast and full of workingclass grammar. All these rumors are unsubstantuated! He does a great job as Jimmy Hoffa. And Danny DeVito is great as always playing Hoffa's oldtime buddy Bobby Ciaro a clown with a potential for deadly seriousness. Nicholson and DeVito grew up in the same town  Neptune New Jersey  at about the same time and have known each other for years. DeVito claimed to have dated Nicholson's sister. It's pleasing to see the two of them working together.In some ways though the whole may be less than the sum of its parts. The story is a bit like that of The Godfather but without the Mafia mystique. Hoffa starts out good but then  well what? Does he go bad? If so the movie does as good a job of hiding exactly what he did as Hoffa himself did. There is a scene in which he seems to agree to lend money from the Teamster's Pension Fund to a known Italian. But the scene takes place during a faux deer hunt and is played for laughs. While D'Allesandro Armand Assante and Hoffa argue over the terms of the loan a deer walks up unexpectedly and is ignored by everyone until finally DeVito uncorks his automatic and blasts it.

DeVito had high hopes for the film and felt that not only would it be a commercial success but a critical one with awards for cinematography production design and acting.The film failed at the box office and did not garner the awards expected. The reason because the film is a honourable failure. There is a script by David Mamet and although there are some great production values its not consistent. There is a great scene where Hoffa is talking to some people in a corridor of a building with big windows. Through the windows you can see a courtyard with a market going on with people going about in period costume. In a costume drama many other people because of the budgetary concerns would had done it just in a walled corridor.However you have scenes where its obviously done in a film set and some scenes are obviously staged such as the hunting scene.The biggest problem is the film does not address the audience outside of the USA who have little or no idea of who Hoffa was. I heard about him as a college student mainly to do with the fact that this a notorious Union leader who is now supporting some bridge under a highway!During the initial scenes when DeVito's character who is a composite of several real life persons first meets Hoffa I had no idea when the meeting took place. In the 1930s or 40s or the 50s? When Hoffa takes over the Teamster union and wants some people fired why exactly did he want this? Who were this people that he wanted fired? As we do not know this people do we care? What exactly did Hoffa do wrong for him to be imprisoned? Getting a shady ItalianAmerican to make money for you via some loans is not illegal surely at that time unless it was actual money laundering. Wikipedia tells me that it was fraud jury tampering and bribery. The film is called Hoffa yet we know so little about him after viewing the film.The film is told in flashbacks as Hoffa waits for a meeting in a parking lot of a diner. Again we are not told of the time period of this setting which should be the mid 1970s as that is when he disappeared although the ending in this film leave little doubt what happens to Hoffa.Its a well constructed film of a man that divides America but DeVito the director needed Mamet to put more detailed in the script so we have a better idea of who Hoffa was.".

	schema:reviewBody "All too often Jack Nicholson just coasts and plays his stock character. Sometimes it's boring occasionally it's insulting but in Hoffa Nicholson puts aside the sneer and the leer and delivers a knockout performance. Although he doesn't really look that much like the Teamster boss Nicholson captures the man's aura perfectly.   It's more than just nailing the vocal rhythms and inflections or mastering Hoffa's body language you feel Nicholson is conveying the inner man as well.  This is truly a multidimensional interpretation and it's absolutely stunning.Unfortunately the film is an inadequate showcase for Nicholson's talents. The story begins in 1975 on what presumably was the last day of Hoffa's life as he and his pal Bobby Ciaro Danny DeVito wait for some people to show up for a meeting at a Michigan roadhouse.  They wait a long time which allows Bobby to recall many incidents in Hoffa's extraordinary career as a union organizer.There are two problems with this.  First Bobby who's supposed to be something of an enforcer is never credible.  Although he's nearly always in view he never seems to belong.  Perhaps that's because  he's entirely a creation of screenwriter David Mamet.   Barely adequate as a storytelling device Bobby's unfortunate insertion gives rise to the inevitable more serious question how much of this story is true?If you accept Mamet's interpretation Hoffa was a victim of a trusted associate the Government and the Mob but foremost a hero because he fought for the working man.  Fair enough.  But when you watch Hoffa you don't really get a clear sense of why all this was so.  Motivations are largely absent.   The flashbacks pass by but you feel these are merely sketches or outlines often presented without clear context.  Some are believable others seem to be mere speculation still others such as the scenes with Robert Prosky or  the enormous riot sequence implausible.  Was Prosky's character real?   Did so many people actually die?  Ask Bobby because in many ways it's as much his story as Hoffa's but as we know Bobby is pure fiction. Mamet has been quoted as saying audiences look more for drama than for information.  Fine and who'd want to see Ken Burns' take on the Teamsters. But Hoffa for all its huffing and puffing lacks the drama of Paul Schrader's Blue Collar or the better Mob pictures.  Recommended solely for Nicholson's performance.".

While played masterfully Ciaro is ficticious he's most likely an amalgamation of several reallife characters.Secondly the diner scenes where Ciaro is talking to the young truck driver whose rig has broken down.

When the trucker learns that Hoffa himself is sitting in a Cadillac in the parking lot the trucker is insistent that he thank the former union boss personally.  The trucker shoots and kills Hoffa and Ciaro who tries to defend his boss and friend.Thirdly after the shooting a truck pulls up and the Cadillac is driven into the trailer and whisked away.  This contradicts fact in two key areas  1 Only James Riddle Hoffa was reported as disappeared 2 Hoffa was driving a Pontiac Grand Prix which was found parked in the lot.Despite those key flaws the movie's saving grace is the topnotch acting. Nicholson has Hoffa down pat right down to his convincing nasally voice and mannerisms.

Hoffa clearly loved the Teamsters.  Nonetheless he was sent to prison in 1967 his sentence was later commuted by thenUS president Richard Nixon but many saw the conviction as a case of politicians framing a hero of the working man.  One scene where Hoffa and Ciaro are being transported to the prison and are cheered by a long line of supportive truck drivers exemplifies this.Still it's a very good film that suffers from writers taking license with fact. However I can easily recommend it due to Nicholson and DeVitos' powerful performances.".

Many people owe Jimmy Hoffa a great deal of gratitude for the advancements he made for the Working Man. This is often lost today because Jimmy Hoffa ultimately went down and as we all know Americans love a winner. Danny Devito and Jack Nicholson were great. The DVD is well worth its price and contains some great extras including some actual footage of Jimmy Hoffa and Robert Kennedy at the hearings in the late 50's. 9 out of 10 .".

Hoffa did for organized labor what Martin Luther King Jr. did for civil rights. He pioneered it organized it led it and ultimately died for it. Jack Nicholson is dynamite. He really looks like Jimmy Hoffa and he's got him down pat. You feel empathy for him what he has to go thru and the constant devastating betrayals that occur throughout his life by the Mob and the Teamsters. Danny DeVito is good and you feel sorry for him almost as much as you respect him and even fear him. He's tough brash competent and a good shot with a .45 Auto and he loves Hoffa. That is evident early on and doesn't leave you. This movie was made not as a factual piece but more of a testament to his movement and his struggle to fight for his men and get them what they deserve. The ending is very poignant and endearing almost to a fault. If you are interested in finding out what really happened to Hoffa read Contract Killer by William Hoffman and Lake Headley it goes into great detail about his final hours who killed him and most importantly why. The message is simple. What you love can kill you and most men who sacrifice all for a cause end up becoming martyrs to it.".

	schema:reviewBody "To me there are 3 things wrong with this film although they don't make it a bad film...more an incomplete film.1. At best it's a 2dimensional portrait of the man. An extra 710 minutes early in the film could have given us a better understanding of what in his youth made him the scrappy feisty man he became.2. Did he have a family life? You'd hardly know it. We see his wife occasionally but with only one scene of any value. Same for his children...almost nonexistent. A few more minutes could have completed the character sketch.3. I'm no fan of Bobby Kennedy but the portrayal of Kennedy here by Kevin Anderson seemed downright childish to me.Having said that there's a lot of good things about this film. The first perhaps being Danny DeVito's strong portrayal of Hoffa's chief aide over much of a lifetime although the character is fictional. A strong theme of the film is loyalty and DeVito portrays that extremely well.As to Jack Nicholson's performance as Hoffa it's difficult for me to rate. I am old enough to remember Jimmy Hoffa and I see glimpses of Hoffa in Nicholson's performance. But that's always a problem in biographical films of people we actually remember. We can look at Don Ameche's performance as Alexander Graham Bell and accept it rather readily because we don't personally remember Bell. But some of us remember Hoffa and it would be a mistake for Nicholson to do an impression of Hoffa because it would be widely criticized. So he does an admirable job of not letting an impression get in the way of the story.DeVito also directed this film and I have to give him credit for the deft manner in which he handled flashbacks. Generally I think that flashbacks are overused in many films. Here the technique worked very well with very smooth transitions.Of course we don't really know how Hoffa died and disappeared but the ending of this film is an intriguing and nifty explanation. Very well done.If you want to get a sense of Jimmy Hoffa the labor leader this film will accomplish that. If you want a sense of the whole man you'll be a bit disappointed. But the film is an admirable effort.".

	schema:reviewBody "Life made him famous but death turned him into a legend. If it weren't for his mysterious disappearance probably due to his connections with the mob it's doubtful that Jimmy Hoffa the leader of the most powerful union would have been such a deeply rooted figure in American popculture. This posthumous place among the unsolved mysteries of the last century was begging for a movie adaptation and Danny DeVito's turned into quite an interesting biopic but strangely enough it says a lot about the man without saying that much. At the end of the film I knew some of his achievements but the motives the traumas the obsessions what makes a character fascinating were still a mystery. This is not to belittle the film's educational value but I don't think such a complex public figure can be understood if we don't even have some quick glimpses about his past his background and his family. It's as if Danny DeVito sticked with the public image of Hoffa and didn't give us enough to hook our hearts on outside the Teamster business which is a pity because Jack Nicholson made the character and gave him such an aura that it genuinely made me curious about the man. Yet nothing is shared except what he tells his friends the mob the journalists and Bobby Kennedy. I was begging for an intimate moment with his wife not because behind every great men there's a woman but because men do confess to their wives share with them the offtherecord stuff but Hoffa is not in the same caliber than say Oliver Stone's Nixon which is about a no less controversial figure. And I guess I wasn't surprised because I saw the wife in the middle of the film but because she was showed while she was useless plotwise.On the other hand the film tackles its subject in a very serious and entertaining way that I'm asking myself if DeVito or the screenwriters did have enough material to approach the privacy of Hoffa maybe they didn't or maybe they had but they didn't have enough time. The film is more trying to answer to the question of Hoffa's whacking than the typical rise and fall it's more about the way he became an instrument of the mob with a pragmatic view on the ends justifiesthe mean theory but we never see how effective they are for the Teamsters. I learned more about the rights and the struggle of truck drivers from the underrated filmnoir They Drive by Night or the thriller Wages of Fear than Hoffa which is saying a lot because it had to be about trucks too Ebert said that DeVito showed a man who was all about trucks he talked and breathed 'truck' well how about showing these trucks in the first place? The film fails providing insights on the character by focusing too much on the controversy it doesn't help to get enough perspective. Imagine if Nixon was only about the Watergate you wouldn't have known about Nixon AND the Watergate either DeVito's film lacked focus and scope.It's interesting that the film was made in 1992 the same year than another and better biopic Spike Lee's Malcolm X the film is threehour long but takes you from the roots of the leader when he was a smalltime crook to his rise as one charismatic orator. In Hoffa we never see him driving a truck nourishing his heart with socialist ideas and revolting against the system. From the beginning he's like a politician haranguing the comrades. I take it from granted than what he say is true but it's not about belief but empathy the film is not about making Hoffa a good or a bad guy but letting the viewer figuring out. If he was bad enough in the practical meaning to stick with the gangsters when he became powerful it would be interesting to see how he started as an idealistic man and it would make the corruption of his morality more interesting. That's what great biopics are about evolutions and never in Hoffa do we feel that the guy is changing in bad or good it doesn't matter but there's no dynamics whatsoever.And again it's a pity because the performances are good I can't believe Nicholson got a Razzie nomination for this granted it wasn't the best of his career but he did bring some energy and passion in the character. But what lacked was a structure a right choice of episodes that would tell us something about a controversial figure. The film is twohour and fifteen minutes long I wouldn't have minded it being much longer if it could enlighten me on the private face of Jimmy Hoffa we're talking about a character played by Nicholson who's got a great chemistry with his reallife friend Danny DeVito the film had the potential the ambition probably the budget the writing was good but the storytelling not so.Still for what it is it's not wasted time and the film has a solid consistency in it and at least it does something that almost redeems the flaws I mentioned it ends with the best scene the most memorable one. In terms of shock and emotion even though we know the story of Jimmy Hoffa we don't see the ending coming and it did left me puzzled and shocked when I saw it for the first time. The film needed more moments like this but all in all it's a solid drama.".

	schema:headline " An interesting telling of a fascinating story";
	schema:reviewBody "It couldn't be easy to make a film about a man whose story has no ending. But Danny DeVito and David Mamet tackle just that story in Hoffa a biopic about the legendary union leader Jimmy Hoffa. The film chronicle's Hoffa's beginnings and his eventual rise to fame and power in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union a union which eventually became the largest union in the United States. It leads all the way up to Hoffa's disappearance in 1975. The truth behind his disappearance is a mystery but the film provides its own theory on what might have happened. Jimmy Hoffa was arguably one of the most interesting men in America during his glory days and Hoffa does a decent job at telling that story.The film is uniquely told through the eyes of Hoffa's best friend Bobby Ciaro who is played by Danny DeVito who also directs the film in his sometimes straightforward sometimes offbeat style. Telling the story like this makes for an interesting narrative and gives the film a unique sense of style telling the story of one man through the eyes of another. But what Hoffa really tries to accomplish is just telling the story. It focuses on getting all the details right and every important aspect of the story out there for all to see. What the film lacks is a lot of emotion or passion towards the subject matter. It's an exciting film and plenty enticing but it isn't a robust dramatic telling of the life of Jimmy Hoffa. This is more of a well made documentary on Hoffa's life than a biopic.But don't get me wrong. Hoffa does the best it can from a purely storytelling aspect. The story is there and it is alive. It isn't always the most exciting adventure and it drags considerably at times. But it is a high quality film in specific aspects namely acting and writing. It goes without saying but Jack Nicholson's acting is incredible and David Mamet's writing is superb. These are things that we've come to expect from these two gentlemen and Hoffa shows that they care about anything and everything they do. Danny DeVito also does a fine job in his role and the relationship between him and Nicholson is believable and compelling. Mamet's dialogue drives the film home and gives it its slick tongue and witty cadence. The film stands out in these aspects but as a summation of all its parts it is nothing more than an interesting little look into the life of Jimmy Hoffa that we can enjoy as an informational piece rather than a film.I enjoyed Hoffa but it is another of the many films I see that I wouldn't plan on seeing again. It makes for a good one time watch because now I know more about Jimmy Hoffa and the fascinating story that surrounds him. It's always fun to watch Nicholson act his head off and Mamet write himself to death and Hoffa certainly delivers these things. It doesn't go much further than that and it doesn't end up doing much more than hold my attention for a little more than two hours.".

But Danny DeVito and David Mamet tackle just that story in Hoffa a biopic about the legendary union leader Jimmy Hoffa. The film chronicle's Hoffa's beginnings and his eventual rise to fame and power in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union a union which eventually became the largest union in the United States. It leads all the way up to Hoffa's disappearance in 1975. The truth behind his disappearance is a mystery but the film provides its own theory on what might have happened.

	schema:headline " A Skillful Work of Fiction Rooted in Fact Devised with Ingenuity and a Dependable Viewpoint";
	schema:reviewBody "Written with callous virtuosity by Mamet directed with garishly vintage technique by DeVito this hugely underrated passionate powerful film not only portrays Hoffa with the enhanced corporal magnitude of Nicholson who gives a massive thrust of a performance but it also reshuffles the ladder of American heroes as it's recognized nowadays. Several may be uneasily startled This stylistic take on the life and mysterious disappearance of the Teamsters Union leader views Robert Kennedy as seen by Hoffa a bellyaching Harvardeducated welltodo frantic for exposure prepared to use evenhanded ways and biased to catch Hoffa no equal at all for Hoffa in their incensed altercations.In the context of most commercial movies which insist on explaining too much or repeating the obvious Hoffa remains a reasonably detached consideration of the career of a man whose ties to the Mafia not only cost the rankandfile teamsters millions but also set a pattern for corruption that tainted the entire labor movement. It's a quintessentially American story for only here did Big Labor become a big business to rival Big Business.DeVito and the Great Character Development Skeptic neither romanticizie him or try to explore Hoffa outside his own mechanical justification that you have to do it to others before they do it you. Without commentary in very broad strokes they authenticate Hoffa's advancement from minor reformer to bigtime shark powerdealer and mob friend.The movie opens as the edgy dogtired Jimmy convoyed by his committed oddjob guy conjured character Bobby waits in a Cadillac in a Detroit cafeteria lot for a rendezvous with an abiding Mafia accomplice. The reminiscences that are the bulk of the film aren't Jimmy's but the indulgent diligent Bobby's. He worries about Jimmy's state of affairs remembering their first meeting in the Depressed 1930s when one night on the road Jimmy invited himself into his truck and tried to enlist him for the teamsters. Jimmy was then something of an optimist. As the hours drone on in the lot Bobby sequentially recalls his way through Jimmy's career.While Bobby's remembrance is tender this captivating hazy biopic sees all coolly. This gives this forgotten '90s drama an indignantly cynical tone that is generally uncommon in American movies. It compels us to decide for ourselves something that can be infinitely puzzling as well as gratifying. The film proposes there are occasions when one must reason for oneself. It doesn't pose as a docudrama or anything close. It's a skillful work of fiction rooted in fact devised with ingenuity and a dependable viewpoint.DeVito's direction is crammed with overstated kinesics that appear wholeheartedly consistent with Bobby's exceedingly highlighted reminiscences of life with Jimmy. There are numerous striking overhead shots whether it's a scene of Jimmy incarcerated or a panoramic view of union men wrestling scabs. Simultaneously DeVito knows when to use closeups that is to divulge character instead of to intersperse dialogue. When the director shows a recalled explosion and fire they have the massive scope of something recounted in an anecdote told late at night in a favorite dive.It comes as a surprise about midway through to learn that the Teamsters head has a wife and daughter. They appear during a crowd scene. But this film about Jimmy Hoffa has no time to show him meeting his wife dating her marrying her finding their dream house having a kid. That's about as it should be.Does the movie grant that Jimmy was an instrument of organized crime? Not by any means. Nor does it quite maintain that Hoffa would take any advantage he could get anywhere he could to systematize the drivers and pressgang the bosses. He was a union realist but what makes this movie so beguiling is that we can never entirely peep the romanticism that should be in there somewhere no glow of internal principle. Something murky must be driving him on a lonesome ruthless revenge.Nicholson is an actor who can echo virtually anything in his face. His intense volcanic performance is so good as Hoffa because he betrays virtually nothing. When we first see him the corporal embellishments are striking. He's filled with spite not optimism. He organizes for the same reason other guys get in bar fights because it discharges the intense stresses within.The production is plentiful with period particulars consecutively in an enduring procession. The truckers' world distinguishes with the world of control occupied by the insiders The Old World sophistication of the Mafia sociables for instance or the rooms where dominant government men dwell. The movie makes its implicit case for union organizing simply by complementing the cabs and roadstops of the drivers with the world of opportunity.This is an inspired and vibrant piece but is that sufficient? It sharply divided critics but for me it is. Others will have valid protests to the ways the film works. This genuinely absorbing piece reveals DeVito as a sincere filmmaker. He extracts the core guise and pitch for this material. Not every director would've been selfassured enough to purely show us Jimmy Hoffa rather than narrating all about him. This is a movie that finds its impact between the lines in what is unstated.".

Bobby Ciaro DeVito also the director is a fictional character who acts as Hoffa's goffer throughout the film refusing to cooperate with the authorities when soasked calling various mafiosi on his behalf and generally acting as his mouthpiece. We see Hoffa as a dominant figure a lion a leader. But these are deceptive subliminal messages since the whole film is seen from a plexiglass viewpoint. In fact so icy is DeVito's direction that when a riot breaks out at the very beginning we watch from a bird's eye view as the little antlike labourers clash with the police. It is insulting to the intelligence and takes much away from the depth of the film rendering it rather picturesque but unexplained. In fact the entire film is like a museum piece behind velvet ropes that can only be gazed at from a distance but cannot be felt or examined closer  as closer examination would reveal the plotholes and irrationalities of the storyline in the first place. Hoffa is generally treated as an American hero the little guy who stood up for all the other little guys the man who went to prison because the cruel Attorney General Kennedy aptly performed by Kevin Anderson would not allow him to skim a few bucks out of the pension fund for the Union he ran. Indeed Hoffa did go to prison in reallife and was pardoned by President Nixon but the stipulation in the pardon was one which seemed to slip under Hoffa's nose. This and his general troublestirring attitude with Nicholson effortlessly portrays sometimes even looking like a mirrorimage of the reallife counterpart would lead to his demise and mysterious disappearance in 1975. Perhaps had DeVito gone more into the life of the man more into why he had the ambitions he did there is absolutely no explanation for his being the president in fact he just seems to recruit labourers from various locals and then all of a sudden he is Mr. Universe and why he was careless enough to make shady dealings with the Mob. In fact nearly all of the story is mafiabacked but all of the credit is placed on Jimmy's shoulders. It is simply a waste of Nicholson's stellar performance.5.510".

The Film fits the various Eras portrayed perfectly. It's like looking thru a window. The Corruption of Hoffa if you can call it that is slow and gradual and Hoffa's War With Bobby Kennedy is simply fantastic film making Devito didn't want to spoil the scene with words so he used the actual Hoffa Kennedy exchanges word by word word for word. And Nicholson must've studied that footage intently as he captures Hoffa's Every movement and even his eyes down to the rapid movements that Hoffa did. Devito knows his stuff and Proves it here.

	schema:reviewBody "Hoffa is a surprising film which from time to time arises to keep alive the memory of the late Teamster president. Told in flash back form the film ably describes the dramatic rise and fall of the popular labor leader. Indeed with Nickleson's portrayal the viewer is convinced of the confrontational life of the man who became synonymous with the International union. Reenacting the turbulent rise of Hoffa viewers are treated to the fabulous talents of some of the giants of the silver screen. Few could argue that Jack Nicholson as James R. 'Jimmy' Hoffa is nothing short of magical. In addition there is Danny DeVito who as Bobby Ciaro in my opinion steals the show. Further enriching the cast is Armand Assante as Carol D'Allesandro the mob boss who assured Jimmy's rise to power and then later is suspect in the teamster's mysterious disappearance. J.T. Walsh is excellent as Frank Fitzsimmons. The dramatic film superbly encapsulates the early violent trials successful triumphs and eventual tragedy of the great but troubled teamster president. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Hoffa is a story about the rise and fall of Teamster leader James Jimmy Hoffa Jack Nicholson as told by his loyal associate Bobby Ciaro Danny DeVito.Hoffa organized Teamsters from the Great Depression to 1975. The greatest force driving the labor movement Hoffa recruited members by  jumping trucks organizing meetings setting up pickets and even sabotaging businesses. Hoffa fought fire with fire and his tactics and attitude gained him respect and support. Unfortunately this would also contribute to his fall. Hoffa began dealing with the Mafia and investing union funds in their businesses. Concern over the size the violence of the movement and hatred of Hoffa lead U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy Kevin Anderson to attempt to convict him of embezzling union funds. Hoffa humiliated the Kennedy family during the hearings. By 1959 Kennedy guided Congress in passing union limiting legislation and Hoffa was successfully imprisoned under the new laws. After his release Hoffa would meet with the Mafia in an attempt to regain control of the Teamsters. This would be the last time Jimmy Hoffa was ever seen. Written by David Mamet and directed by Danny DeVito the film drives home the absolute determination and dedication Jimmy Hoffa put into the labor movement. He lives and breathes union. His eyes are filled with vengeance not optimism. Willing to do business with the Mafia to advance the cause Hoffa believes he is doing nothing more than the politicians who are trying to stop him. His cause is for a whole class of people not just his family. The director doesn't get into the Kennedy family issues except as they pertain to Hoffa. Little mention is made of their corruption or involvement with the Mafia as this would have been a distraction from the driven Hoffa portrayal. The movie spans from the early 1930s to 1975. The special affects makeup and settings were excellent. The clothes cars guns cigarettes and makeup smoothly transitioned the forty year time frame. Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jimmy Hoffa was awesome the viewer could feel the rage and determination Hoffa felt.The exclusion of other historical events revolving around his disappearance and the speculative ending was disappointing and leaves the viewer with an inaccurate depiction of his disappearance. In reality Jimmy Hoffa's body has never been located and he is only presumed dead.".

The next morning he awakes alone in a dilapidated bedroom and without the securities. He finds the woman and pleads with her to return the stolen securities. When he also threatens her he is knocked unconscious by the saloon owner and dragged to a nearby railroad track. As the crooks strips him of his ID and papers Schiller recovers and struggles with the saloon owner ultimately throwing him into the path of an oncoming train killing him. Schiller flees and as he is about to take his own life sees in a newspaper that he is supposedly dead. The saloon owner's mangled body had been identified as Schiller's. Twenty years pass.

Dedicated to both work and family Mr. Jannings carefully watches his bank's securities and teaches son Philippe De Lacy as August Jr. to play the violin. When a crisis occurs Jannings is the problemsolver. An amazingly punctual and structured man Jannings is reluctant when asked to transport 1000 to Chicago for his bank but goes. On the train Jannings is sitting across from bleached blonde Phyllis Haver as Mayme when the conductor arrives to check passengers' tickets. When Jennings produces his ticket Ms. Haver catches a glimpse of the bank's 1000 securities and is enthralled. She succeeds in seducing Jennings assisted by champagne. He wakes up in a strange bedroom minus both blonde and bucks. Jennings tracks Haver to a saloon and accidentally kills her tough boyfriend Fred Kohler in a struggle...Wracked with guilt over his actions Jannings decides to go along with the story after the criminal's body is mistaken for his own to spare his family embarrassment and scandal. Twenty years pass...Presently Jannings is still estranged from his family. He heavily carries the weight of shame as he works picking up trash in a park. Wandering tramplike he sees grownup son Donald Keith as August Jr. has becomes a successful concert violinist. Jannings manages to attend Mr. Keith's performance. Taught by Jannings young Keith handles the violin expertly shedding a tear when playing one of his father's favorites. Keith does not know his father is alive watching in the audience. Jennings shadows his family when they place flowers on the grave of the eldest sibling who died serving in World War I. During a Christmas snowstorm Jannings encounters son Keith who pities the old tramp with a silver dollar. Keith enters his warm family home as father Jannings walks off into the cold evening alone...Unfortunately The Way of All Flesh is a LOST film but portions of the film have turned up. Two surviving excerpts are from the last act when Jannings is a haggard old tramp. The first part is from a documentary mainly it includes Jannings discovering son Keith. The second part is fortunately the film's emotional closing sequence when Jannings and Keith meet. With the documentary's narration included the available footage forms its own short story and is a good sample of the film's worth. It is available on Fragments Surviving Pieces of Lost Films 2011 released by Flicker Alley and has been shown on Turner Classic Movies TCM. In fact the stellar Jannings performance is the highlight of Fragments...Jannings' performance was one of the two for which he won the first Academy Award as Best Actor. The award was for his roles in both The Way of All Flesh and The Last Command 1928. Due to the former's foray into oversentimentality the award was seen by critics as something better remembered as for the latter film. Comparing Best Picture standings Film Daily placed Way of All Flesh at 4 and Last Command at 3 for their years. The New York Times had the latter at 5 while the former in the earlier year's top ten exact position not given. Some of Oscar's early awards are puzzling but awarding Jannings' still obviously superb characterizations is easy to applaud.

Not even a bright and genuinely hopeful character as that of Kristin Scott Thomas. She ends up drinking we are told...And all is the same and will probably stay the same. A lost hope...A defeat. A pessimistic movie for those who come from there. Though well made with very good solid performances it is unlikely that this movie will be of much interest to nonromanian audiences.

	schema:reviewBody "It is interesting to judge what place 'O vara de neuitat' An Unforgettable Summer plays in the too short cinematography of Lucian Pintilie and to speculate about why he had chosen to make this film in 1994 his second only after the fall of the Communism which had practically silenced for two decades the creative voice of a director who debuted in the 60s and could have become in a different constellation one of the most important creators of the European cinema. While most of his films after 1990 deal either with the Communist era or its repercussions in the process the Romanian call 'transition' this film as well as 'Tertium non datur' made in 2005 his last by now connect with the more remote past of Romania the first half of the 20th century. Both deal with the actions of the Romanian army beyond the borders of today's Romania both happen in remote places and place the moral dilemma of the Romanian officers in the center of the action.There is one more element in the making of this film that is worth mentioning. The film is inspired by a story written in the 50s by a Romanian writer who was then belonging to the Socialist Realism style but later became a political opponent and a refugee. So here we have Pintilie the most famous dissident filmmaker of Romania picking up a story written in the Communist era  maybe in a demonstrative manner that tells in a most authoritative voice that bridges with the past should not be completely blownup.'The Unforgettable Summer' is a antiwar drama on the road open by Kubrick's 'Paths of Glory'. Yet it has also another classical source in the Romanian cinema  Liviu Ciulei's 'Padurea Spanzuratilor' the first Romanian movie to have won a major prize at the Cannes film festival. Pintilie's film with the moral dilemma of the officer hero making eventually the right decision with the major risk for his career and even life has a lot of similarity in theme and form.The cinematographic approach is simple and direct. The film is beautifully filmed with attention to the detail and a fluent story telling. Music also playes a role in the narrative structure the whole action happens between the opening French CanCan music and the closing 'Eine Kleine Nachtmusik' and in the meantime nothing too nice happens. The horror of the violent actions that happen or are suggested to happen on screen is balanced by the innocent view of the child whose story telling leads the action. Here the innocence is also under pressure as in many other films by Pintilie so is the destiny of principal heroine superbly acted by Kristin Scott Thomas who together with her partner on screen Claudiu Bleont give life to the couple of heroes. Her actions cannot cut off sufferings or fix evil they can only postpone by a second the sentences of history. Is it too much is it too little? The open question is left to the viewer to answer.".

One of Lucian Pintilie's more internationally acclaimed films An Unforgettable Summer draws viewers' attention towards the ignominious persecution of ordinary innocent Bulgarian workers by some bad elements of Romanian army. Its wickedness is shown solely from the point of view of a person whose parents' lives were shattered beyond recognition during a turbulent summer when a group of mean Romanian army personnel punished everybody who was not on their side. One should not be shocked to see that some Romanian army officers were depicted not only as philanderers but also as enemies of humanity. It is amidst such a morass that an honest army officer and his wife emerge victorious as they are able to overcome their ethical dilemma by choosing the path to justness. Although An Unforgettable Summer is not a philosophical film per se Lucian Pintilie's film does succeed in highlighting the message that one man's arbitrary logic might lead another man to be despondent to such an extent to even contemplate suicide.".

It is difficult to understand why Lucian Pintilie chose an obscure shortstory published in the early 1950s as subject for his film. The author Petre Dimitriu was at that time a young writer aspiring for recognition by the communist regime. The autobiographical story tries at the same time to vilify the former regime and to prove that the authors father had dissociated himself from that regime. The story was intended to reinforce the author's credentials and to help him become an aclaimed communist writer before his defection to the West. Lucian Pintilie's direction was not able to annihilate the political background of the story. Therefore despite its qualities the film rings like an anachronic revival of the socialist realism of the 1950s.".

The actor who play Norman only gets on ones nerve with his unbearable nervous ticks.

	schema:reviewBody "This is per se an above average film but why in the name of Bog was it made? It's impossible to treat it as a thing unto itself because it is an almost shotforshot remake of an Alfred Hitchcock classic of 1960. You can't watch it without the 1960 film nudging into your consciousness.What does the word credit mean? How can we credit Van Sandt and his associates with anything except deciding to use different actors slightly different sets and color?Anne Heche is attractive but lacks Janet Leigh's stolid determination to become a respectable middleclass woman. And Heche is younger than Leigh who brought to her fruitless attempt to marry and settle down the desperation of a woman facing forty. And Heche doesn't project anxiety the way Leigh did. The scene with the CHP officer looking in her car window illustrates the weakness in the role. In the original the officer asks Is there something wrong? Leigh Of course not. Am I acting as if something were wrong? The officer hesitates before replying Well frankly yes. That exchange is omitted from the remake for the simple reason that Heche isn't nervous enough.The worst change without a doubt is the substitution of Vince Vaughn for Anthony Perkins. It may not be Vaughn's fault. Who could match Perkins in the role? Perkins is twitchy birdlike longnecked cloaked in an externally charming exterior that masks an inner vacuum. His every move eating candy corn with his adam's apple bobbing and every utterance the faint laugh the arid chuckle is spot on. He just can't be improved upon. Vaughn brings to the role the presence of a shorthaired beefy guy who was just discharged as a Lance Corporal from the U. S. Army. To suggest his psychosis all he can do is superimpose a maniacal giggle on top of what appears otherwise a perfectly normal Norman in speech and manner. Unlike the original Norman Vaughn doesn't even stumble over the word fallacy because it resembles phallus. He could be just hanging around the motel waiting to hear about his application for a football scholarship to UCLA.The direction deserves a few comments. I don't see what it adds to the story when we see Norman masturbating while peeping in on Anne Heche. I don't OBJECT to it. I wonder why it's there just as I wonder why the rest of the movie is there.And I suppose in order to impress us with how much color adds to the visual experience Van Sant seems to have missed a bit of Hitchcock's more subtle stuff. Heche is given underwear of all different colors  green pink orange and  mango? Is that a color? If so what the hell color is it? Never mind. The point is that in the original when the traveling camera first peeks through the window of the Phoenix hotel it captures Janet Leigh in bed wearing a pure white half slip and a white bra. Later after she has stolen the money we see her in her underwear again  this time both her slip and bra are black. Tis a small thing but Hitch's own.At that the idea of shooting in color might not have been bad except that the blackandwhite shooting of the original was superb. The color and odd lighting effects in this version turn the ordinary dull and subliminally ominous motel into something that looks like it belongs in the seedier part of Las Vegas.Most of all the 1960 film was shocking in more ways than one. I can remember seeing it in a drivein in San Diego and staring aghast at the screen when it became clear that the central character was actually DEAD  halfway through the movie! Nothing like it had ever been done before.That murder in the shower in both movies was a big improvement over Robert Bloch's original novel by the way in which the author writes something like The murderer then entered the bathroom and cut off her head with a knife. I'm not making that up. Well not entirely. Even here Van Sant's movie gives us excess. There is more blood and more bare flesh. And where Hitchcock closed in first on the blood circling the bathtub drain and dissolved to Marian's blankly open eye then pulled the camera back slowly to reveal her face he rotated his camera from a slight tilt to the proper vertical giving the viewer a sense of not just disbelief at the murder but a dizzying disbelief. Van Sant doesn't tilt his camera a delicate 10 or 20 degrees as Hitchcock did. He practically twirls it on its axis.It won't do to call this a bow to Hitchcock because it's not. It's a pecuniary plundering of Hitchcock's material already ripped off in Psycho I II III IV and Psycho The Beginning Years and Come Into My Parlor Mrs. Bates' Revenge and Hand Me That Knife Would You? The TRUE story of Norman Bates. A rehashing of and grinding away at truly original stuff a crumenal act if not a criminal one. And that's not to mention the many homages in other films especially the French such as the notorious ocean of boredom scenes between Marcel Brulee and Jeanne Gateau in the muchadmired La Mere de la Nuit. Maybe I'd better add that that last sentence is a terrible attempt at a parody of academic critics. And when a chicken's guts grind corn it's a crumenal act. I won't go on except to say these gags shabby as they are are more fun than the movie.So who was it made for? I'd have to guess. Kids who are too young to know about the original and who don't like movies in black and white? Kids who are hoping to see another ordinary slasher movie? Chimpanzees?".

Which is exactly why the casting of him as Norman Bates was a slice of true Hitchcockian genius. Audiences were taken by surprise to put it mildly.That's why this remake does not work even a little bit in spite of trying to be an exact copy. Whereas Anthony Perkins looked like someone you would never think of as being a serial killer Vince Vaughn is easily imaginable as one. He lacks the frail look of Perkins and his acting chops are clearly inferior as well at least in this role honestly  has there ever been an actor who could convey nervousness as genuinely as Anthony Perkins?. While it was a pointless remake to begin with the miscasting of the story's most important character sucks this film down completely.As a side note I feel that Hollywood's propensity for remaking great movies because 'young' people refuse to watch anything that's not filmed in color not only stinks to high heaven of corporate greed but is exceptionally disrespectful to the original work. As for viewers who can't watch black and white  it's their loss. Hopefully they'll mature sometime in the future and no longer require shiny colours to hold their attention. When they do they'll discover that sometimes black and white works far better. With the background muted the story and performances are that much more front and center. And in many cases the mood or atmosphere created through black and white cinematography is just not attainable in colour.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK first of all who in their right mind would remake Hitchcock and second who would do it shot for shot? I admit I had no intention of ever watching this movie for that very reason. The original Psycho is one of my favorite films ever and this just seemed like a degrading photocopy of it. I did watch it because my girlfriend wanted to compare it to the original and we both agreed less than five minutes into this crap that it was awful. First as mentioned they did it shot for shot. Where's originality? Why remake a movie that is almost perfect EXACTLY the way it was done the first time? Why remake such a movie to begin with? If you ARE going to remake something remake something that doesn't work and make it BETTER!Second they used the exact same script from the 1960 version. The dialog no longer works. It works fine and sounds perfect for the 1960 version but seems odd and stilted coming out of modern actors. Why not update the dialog? Hitch didn't write the script you could have rewritten. This film had some very good talent and they were wasted by imitation of the original actors. The actor who played the car salesman seemed like he was just playing John Anderson's performance as the car salesman in the original. All the actors seemed like the only direction they were given was be the characters from the original movie. Vince Vaughn may have seemed a little creepier than Anthony Perkins but in doing so you loose the sympathy you are supposed to have for Norman. Having Norman masturbate while watching Marion undress was going too far and lost the innocence of the character that I think Tony Perkins captured so well in his performance. Viggo Mortensen's accent was annoying and Rita Wilson was far too old to play Caroline. Her lines came off as someone desperate rather than just young and fun like Patricia Hitchcock's performance. The only good thing I saw about the film was that Gus Van Sant was able to open the movie with the shot Hitch had envisioned. Hitch wanted to open with 1 long shot going over Phoenix but couldn't at the time so he had to settle for a series of shots crossdissolved together. This film fulfilled that vision with a helicopter shot going into the window of the hotel. After that though the film became a worthless waste of celluloid. If you are curious about how to destroy a wonderful film watch this but do NOT under any circumstances watch this BEFORE you watch the original. This is a faded photocopy of the original and should never have been greenlit. Stick to the master's film not the imitation.".

Marion's boyfriend was really annoying and weird and I don't see how he could wrestle Vince Vaughn to the ground especially with Vince being so muscular.The actors were a bunch of people basically playing dressup and everyone spoke way too fast. And you could also tell from the first second that Norman is crazy. Marion was dumb to stay at the motel.This film is an insult to the Hitchcock name or at the very least a failed experiment. Gus Van Sant has failed miserably on this one.Do yourself a favour and buy the original where you can enjoy one and a half hours of suspense scares and screeching violins and don't waste your money on trash like this.God bless Hitchcock!110".

In summarythere was basically limited improvement in this 1998 version except probably that it was shot in color and the use of stereo sound.Sad to saythe special effects used could probably be defined just as a minor improvement compared to the 1960 classic but proved obsolete for modern audiences.".

	schema:reviewBody "No matter what other people have said you can't review this movie without comparing it to the original if it existed on it's own it would be a 23 out of 5 film but it is a remake of a 45 out of 5 film and so has standards to live up to and we need to see if it reached those standards. If the film was a reworking or as in Planet of the Apes a reimagining of the original you would be able to look at the film in it's own right only referencing the original. Imagine it this way if someone took the model in the 'Mona Lisa' posed her in a different way and painted her you could only compare the framingconcept etc to the original but if someone just repainted her in the position of the original you would have to compare it totally.That said this film doesn't just fail to be as good as the original it fails spectacularly like it or not the original was one of the best movies ever made the shower scene will never be forgotten the remake was meant to be a celebration of Hitchcock but ended up actually degrading him and his master work.The degrading aspects of this picture were Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche. It's nothing to do with wether they acted better or not it's that the relationship between Norman and Marion in the original was really quite innocent Norman didn't really understand sex he had hardly any contact with the outside world and when he meets beautiful Marion and watches her change you feel that he is partly doing it from fascination as he doesn't really understand sex and his attraction to herthis makes Norman sympathetic and almost an antihero you are on his side because he doesn't fully understand the world and is constantly fighting with himself and his 'Mother'. In the remake that whole dynamic is gone I must admit to Janet Leigh not being my type but she is very attractive and you can see that Anne Heche is really unattractive and so Norman finding 'her' Marion attractive is unbelievable if you add that to Vince Vaughn's Norman masturbating whilst looking at her and you get a Norman that is just waiting for a chance to jack off at any naked woman no matter what she looks like who you feel absolutely no sympathy for they further destroy Norman's innocent nature by putting the porno mags in his room. It destroys a character that we have come to like and feel sorry for it's like remaking 'It's a wonderful life' and having the main character a pimp totally degrading.The only other character that I had problems with was Rita Wilson as Caroline Marion's workmate. In the original when Pat Hitchcock says the line 'he must have noticed my wedding ring' it elicits a response of laughter as she is absolutely kidding herself when Rita says it it just seems plausible as there really isn't any other reason why any man would flirt with Anne Heche over her.I'll admit that I am very biased the original 'Psycho' is my favorite film of all time had the film been a reworking with a different angle then you could have turned these characters on their heads and it would have been perfectly acceptable.Hitch famously thaught the film would be too gory in colour and made it in black and white to lessen it. This also made the film more atmospheric and frightening in it's own way and it gave it a beauty that could never be captured in colour and it is a sad statement about how movies are desensetising the public that people have said how the shower scene was more frightening in colour. n.b before people think 'he can't spell' remember I'm from England and we spell it colourA remake should be just that re made this is a forgery a complete copy and a very bad one at that. I could go on comparing but there is no point almost everything is superior in the original. The only one thing that is better is the performance of Viggo Mortensen as Sam Loomis John Gavin was very flat in the original Hitch called him 'The Stiff' behind his back and Mortensen gives a more believable if less likeable performance. William H. Macy and Julianne Moore are the only other actors that hold up to the originals.Overall a movie that should be labeled 'Expensive Embarrassing Failed Experiment. Only view if comparing to original or if original is unknown to you. But view original too' The movie would have got a 3 out of 5 if it were original or a reworking but as it is 0.5 out of 5 for Macy Moore and Mortensen".

There are a lot of sides to a character as complex as Norman Bates and I suspect that Vaughn may have wanted to explore them. Instead Van Sant forced him into sticking to a cheap imitation of Anthony Perkins. Perkins turned in a performance that lead to one of the most memorable characters in film history and it would have been impossible for any actor no matter how good to recreate that. The rest of the characters are stuck just as tight to similarly wooden imitations of the originals. It is almost painful to watch very talented actors namely William H Macy have that talent stifled.

	schema:reviewBody "I know that the original Psycho was a classic and remaking it was a mistake ESPECIALLY a shotbyshot remake.  I think that that has been more or less proven by the rest of the comments here.  But there's far more wrong with this movie than just that.The first problem is the color.  The original film was shot in black and white but what few people realize is the original was shot AFTER color film had been invented.  The choice of black and white film was partially a budget concern but it was also a stylistic choice of Hitchcock's.  Now this is not to say that the remake should have been redone in black and white but the colors of this movie are all too wrong.  The most predominant colors in the film are orange and green particularly on Marion who is not supposed to be a flashy character.  The bright colors make it look like a happy movie and when horrific events take place in these color schemes it looks like a cartoon more than anything and the audience is inclined to laugh rather than scream.The second problem is the lighting.  This is a dark dark tale which should be highlighted by dim lighting but this remake seemed not only to fail in this but seemed to go in the OPPOSITE direction.  Most of the scenes are very brightly lit even at times when it is illogical to do so because it's at NIGHT!Another obvious problem is Vince Vaughn's performance.  Yes he does pull off Norman Bate's awkwardness and madness quite well I don't deny him that. But there is one element to the character that he failed to show  the softness.  There should be a certain deceptive friendliness to the character at least at first which then fades away once we realize the truth about him.  Beyond being a character trait of Norman Bates this is a recognized character trait of ALL PSYCHOPATHS!!!!There are a few good aspects of this film.  Some of the performances are great. As I said Vince Vaughn came very close to pulling off a decent portrayal of Norman Bates.  Viggo Mortensen and Juliane Moore were great together and their chemistry was very different from the characters in the original which was a welcome change. Anne Heche may have been atrocious but unlike Janet Leigh who was untruthfully advertised as one of the biggest stars of the film Anne Heche was given last billing in the opening credits.I read on the cover of a copy of the Psycho novel that Gus Van Sant claimed this was not a remake of the Hitchcock film but rather a new adaptation of the original novel.  I now wish that I had bought that book and saved the comment because after seeing this film that comment is quite possibly the funniest thing I have ever seen.  There was no attempt in this film to disguise the fact that it was a rip off of the original and it would be far more believable if Van Sant had tried to tell us that he was really a three ton ape from the planet Zafroomulax.  So many shots were copied exactly without any actual thought as to why Hitchcock had composed the original shot in that way.  Such as the scene in which Sam and Lila are talking while their faces are entirely covered in shadow.  Hitchcock covered these actors' faces in shadow because he thought they were bad actors and wanted to hide their faces so nobody could see their awful performances not because of any artistic or stylistic purpose.In other words my review is about as pointless as the movie itself in that it replicates something that's already been said.  Like everyone else here I reccommend you don't waste your time on this film and get the original.".

There should be a certain deceptive friendliness to the character at least at first which then fades away once we realize the truth about him.  Beyond being a character trait of Norman Bates this is a recognized character trait of ALL PSYCHOPATHS!!!!There are a few good aspects of this film.  Some of the performances are great. As I said Vince Vaughn came very close to pulling off a decent portrayal of Norman Bates.  Viggo Mortensen and Juliane Moore were great together and their chemistry was very different from the characters in the original which was a welcome change. Anne Heche may have been atrocious but unlike Janet Leigh who was untruthfully advertised as one of the biggest stars of the film Anne Heche was given last billing in the opening credits.I read on the cover of a copy of the Psycho novel that Gus Van Sant claimed this was not a remake of the Hitchcock film but rather a new adaptation of the original novel.  I now wish that I had bought that book and saved the comment because after seeing this film that comment is quite possibly the funniest thing I have ever seen.  There was no attempt in this film to disguise the fact that it was a rip off of the original and it would be far more believable if Van Sant had tried to tell us that he was really a three ton ape from the planet Zafroomulax.  So many shots were copied exactly without any actual thought as to why Hitchcock had composed the original shot in that way.  Such as the scene in which Sam and Lila are talking while their faces are entirely covered in shadow.  Hitchcock covered these actors' faces in shadow because he thought they were bad actors and wanted to hide their faces so nobody could see their awful performances not because of any artistic or stylistic purpose.In other words my review is about as pointless as the movie itself in that it replicates something that's already been said.  Like everyone else here I reccommend you don't waste your time on this film and get the original.";

Director Gus Van Sant shows himself to be a complete idiot with this completely unnecessary updating of the classic horror film which comes off the worst in every respect. Any fan of the first film should definitely avoid this movie  Van Sant claimed he made it because youngsters wouldn't watch black and white movies but if that's true then they shouldn't bother watching movies full stop. The only major difference between the two versions is the colour anyway which doesn't really add anything to the film aside from making the murders slightly gorier to look at.The film is technically proficient but then it would be with Van Sant slavishly COPYING Hitchcock's direction at all times. The only things the director adds to his new version are some pathetically pretentious inserts of clouds and cows during the various murders and a crude openly sexual side to Norman's obsession which worked better when merely hinted at in the first film. As for the casting Van Sant has gone out of his way in assembling both popular and talented actors so we have the notable likes of Julianne Moore Viggo Mortensen William H. Macy and Robert Forster filling out the supporting roles. As for the leads well Anne Heche is unlikable as ever and proves herself to be a million miles away from Janet Leigh whilst Vince Vaughn is creepy enough for the part but again isn't a match for Anthony Perkins in the original.If the original film didn't exist then I would have enjoyed this a lot more. But it does so the remake is totally without merit and deserves to be forgotten in due course  what on earth was Van Sant thinking in remaking it shotforshot? That kind of ruins the idea of a remake in the first place i.e. to improve and expand upon the original film's limitations doesn't it? A totally superfluous addition to modern cinema.".

Many writers worked on the script here and the film is based on the book by Marga Spiegel and we see her at the very end in a poor man's attempt to create a Schindler's List vibe when we have her stand next to lead actress Veronica Ferres and the crew. You heard the name Ferres and you probably know this means no good. The names Ferres and Rohde are the most known here and this is a story about Jews being saved in Nazi Germany through the help of farmers hiding them from the soldiers. It's an okay story but the execution was really poor in terms of acting production values and most of all the script. To see how the film also takes itself so seriously certainly wasn't helping matters either. Spiegel definitely deserved better even if the fact that she was played by a limited actress like Ferres and the performance itself were probably not as bad as the take on the story here. I know it is tough to come up with something new with these hundreds of movies made on the subject of Jews and Nazi Germany but if you have a decent story for once like Spiegel's then you really need to deliver more than they did here. Thumbs down. Watch something else instead unless you belong to the easily entertained and I somewhat wish Spiegel did and did not see this film for the flawed piece that it was before dying 3 years ago at the ancient age of 101. She really does not deserve the disappointment.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film demonstrates editing structure and misenscene perfectly. It's clear that with every scene Godard has thought carefully about positioning and in a few shots has cleverly manipulated the use of mirrors or glass. The camera never moves in the film  it stays still in every sequence and so the positioning of the characters is paramount. Instead of the camera moving to capture all the characters on screen many scenes involve the characters moving themselves after an entrance of a another person to ensure that facial expressions can be seen. Music also plays a huge part in this film as it indicates moments of tension or importance such as when the audience sees 'la famille' for the first time in the film. Background noise is also evident with many layers of sound to the film such as background traffic noise from the open window as well as the piano player in the caf. The scenes themselves and the cleverness from behind the camera make this film worth watching. However the plot itself is weak with many superfluous characters and bizarre situations such as the boxer and 'Mister Jim' with the two girls. The many different characters and their individual situations are closely linked through their interaction with each other but the ending is immensely unsatisfactory.".

	schema:headline " Excellent one of Godard's most playful rewarding and radical experiments in genre and design";
	schema:reviewBody "THEME A murder in a hotel room. Who was killed and why? And by who? Is it past or present? And does it even matter? Three characters are detectives watching the story unfold and interacting with it much like we the audience. They piece together the clues to a story that eventually becomes their own folding between the facts of a crime committed two years ago that repeats itself within the film and eventually leads both us and them towards the actions of the film's final act. It's subtle but presented in Godard's typical style that many seem to have a problem with. DECONSTRUCTION 1 Here we have a detective film about detective films and about the relationship in such films between the characters and the audience. So we have ourselves represented by Laurent Terzieff Aurelle Doazan and JeanPierre Laud who hide out in a cramped hotel room and observe the entrance of the building with the aid of small video camera which presents the image back again on a TV monitor.CINEMA If you're familiar with Godard's work then such devises should be recognisable with the film using the clichs of detective cinema as windowdressing to express greater themes on the notions of relationships as well as the role of cinema itself. We also have the selfreferential aspect suggested by the opening shot in which the scene that we are looking at and hear commentary on turns out to be something that has already happened played back from the detective's surveillance video. We also have the notion of film as a background cacophony with a number of scenes taking place in rooms where television sets conspire to distract us from the action at hand. DECONSTRUCTION 2 Three characters caught up in the clichs of a postwar crime picture with a secondary plot about money and a farcical plan from both sides to doublecross the Mafia and each other. Does it matter? Yes and no. I disagree with the first reviewer who claims that this film is something of a throwaway in Godard's career one that puts formal experimentation over content and theme. The plot is silly but it's silly for a reason and goes back to Godard's earliest film  bout de souffl 1960 in which he played with the codes and conventions of American gangster cinema in a way that was progressive and entirely deconstructive.ACTEURS The film works as a result of the perfect casting. In fact I'd say that the acting in this film is far better than any other film of Godard's that I have seen and I've seen 25 of them. Laud is obviously something of a regular in the films of Godard and his manic energy and uncomplicated air of boyish precociousness as this mysterious detective  trying to piece together a murder that may have happened or may be about to happen  is as bright as it was in films like Masculin fminin 1966 and La Chinoise 1967. Likewise Nathalie Baye familiar from the director's earlier more experimental feature Sauve qui peut la vie 1980 gives one of her best performances as a despondent housewife caught between two men as she tries to retrieve money to start a new life but remains unsure of which man to draw allegiance to. The two men are boxing promoter and American cinema construct Johnny Hallyday who breezes through the film chainsmoking and shooting pool as gangsters and cops threaten his plans from both sides and Claude Brasseur a pilot and the husband of Baye's character once again desperate to play both sides off against one another for the benefit of financial gain.DECONSTRUCTION 3 Once again we have Godard reducing the characters to meagre iconographic constructs that are placed in a knowingly cinematic environment that is continually challenged by the director's experimentations with content and form. Despite this however the characters remain likable intelligent and recognisable with the convincing performances from the incredibly talented cast managing to compete with the cold deconstructive formality that Godard strives for in his presentation. L'ARGENT A film made for financial gain about financial gain or at least the promise of such. According to film critic Colin McCabe Dtective 1985 was produced as a favour to Alain Sarde so as to secure the funding for the director's dream project  the subsequent 'Je vous salue Marie' 1985  and this notion of desperation and the wanton pursuit of money is almost selfreferential in design. CRITIQUE I honestly can't understand why so many admirers of Godard's work found this film disengaging. If you're already familiar with Godard's characteristic approach to cinema then half of the work is already done. For me the film was rich in character and ideas and intelligently put together in a way that made the viewing of the film interesting and unique.GODARD Many would have you believe that Godard peaked in 1967 but this simply isn't the case. He's produced many fine films  Dtective included  that require patience and perception on the part of the audience and all released post1980. This particular film might be considered a throwaway work by many Godard fans but I would politely disagree. Like his best work Dtective is filled with ideas and a sharp commentary on the nature of cinema and the relationship between the director the film the characters and the audience. It does take work but I feel that the work is worth it when we're dealing with something as interesting and progressive as this with Godard throwing in all sorts of little jokes and observations the detective as Prospero aided by a character named Ariel and with Laud as the comic personification of Caliban who eventually overcomes his master whilst simultaneously turning in one of his most radical and wellrounded deconstructions on the nature of film and film viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "JeanLuc Godard really should have retired long before 1985 basking in the glory of his early triumphs such as BREATHLESS  BOUT DE Souffl 1960. For later on he became a sad caricature of himself as a filmmaker. Here he artificially tries to revive the corpse of his youthful abilities and fails abysmally. This film is revoltingly pretentious phoney false arrogant clumsy stupid empty vacuous  what other adjectives can I think of? None of them are sufficient to damn the film enough. I recently obtained the DVD for the simple reason that I wanted to see what Julie Delpy was like when she was 14. This was her first film role. I shouldn't have bothered. She has few lines and merely flits around meaninglessly like most of the other characters in this ridiculous excuse for a film. Godard makes most of the women and one of the men engage in pointless nudity and we see lots of tits especially those of Emmanuelle Seignier whose second film it was she was then 19 but mercifully Godard did not inflict this duty on the child Delpy who keeps her nightie on but why she is always in her nightie is never explained just as nothing is ever explained because geniuses like Godard do not need to explain. The power of Godard's name and reputation made many famous people agree to be in this empty vehicle and waste their talents. I would say it would have damaged the talented Nathalie Baye's reputation to accept such a drear lead role as Francoise in this film as it made her look so downatheel and washedup if that is one can be both down and up at the same time and I have not committed some grammatical atrocity to match Godard's cinematic one. Some women may be excited to know that we get to see Claude Brasseur's willy for what it is worth though there is no reason for this. This happens in between him looking ghastly desperate and sad which is just about all he is required to do for 95 minutes. Can being married to Baye be that bad? This film is a real 'downer' and there I go again with one of those directional adjectives although how one can go down any further than rock bottom I have not yet determined. In this film we have the sight of the famous Johnny Hallyday who for decades was the universal heartthrob not only of every French woman but of many French men as well and if there were ever anything that really puzzled me about the French even more than boudin blood sausage and tte de veau calf's head it is Johnny Hallyday and his inexplicable appeal to a whole nations of Gauls. He does nothing in this film of note but sleep with Baye in a melancholy fashion. Baye looks so pained by this that maybe she discovered that Hallyday really had bad breath. The one bright spot in this film is the equally meaningless appearance of the old veteran Alain Cuny in a few mysterious scenes as 'the Prince'. Who the Prince is and why he is there is only roughly sketched. But the crusty old queen is always interesting to watch. Incredible that he lived to be 86 with all that romping around with boys. And my question is this what ever happened to Alain Cuny's trunk in the entrance hall covered by a cloth after the Nazis left Paris? Only D. D. could tell us that presumably. A mystery worthy of ENGRENAGES. Those who have ears to hear let them hear. But I fear there are no ears left acute enough to take my meaning.".

Ever the prankster Godard stocks the film to the brim with pratfalls movie quotes and other allusions.It's hard to imagine how it is watching this in the theater. The film is so multilayered that it's impossible to take in at one time. I'm not sure what his stance is on the home video vs. theater debate. A movie so dense with quotes is almost destined to be better viewed at home. There are multiple scenes where if you pay attention to one thing you wind up missing some other detail. Even after multiple viewings. I had to watch this more times than any of the other Godard film currently in print just to make sure I caught enough of the details. As awesome technically as the film is it somehow feels like a rehash of what he already did with First Name Carmen Passion and Hail Mary. The fact that this was a commission may mean his heart wasn't quite in it. You could never accuse him of that with most of his other films.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not very admirable of JeanLuc Godard's body of work on the whole after the mid 1970s. It may be snobbish to say this or maybe I just don't get films like Hail Mary or Nouvelle Vague or In Praise of Love though the last one does have its moments but after the 1960s going slowly at first into the 70s and then finally becoming all too apparent in the 80s Godard lost something that made his films so special beforehand. He could put so much of his experimentation and poetry and quotations and little tics and oddities that made him such an iconoclast and make them entertaining and even sometimes when warranted have an actual story somewhere in the inspired chaos of his direction. But in looking at something like Hail Mary or King Lear or even Passion it's all a lot of lessthanhalf baked ideas overlong shots of beaches and generally boring semantics. This sadly is a chunk of what happened to a Godard running on steam from his glory years as an auteur.This ranting and castigating said Godard does have some moments in this period that are striking and memorable and solid cinema the best being First Name Carmen and most recently as what is at the moment his final feature film Notre Musique. Detective also is one of them if also sometimes a little shaky and awkward going between the rigorous attention to having characters real out of books and looking or acting unrealistic or in onenote tones as well as a solid Bmovie plot. The latter concerns a detective I believe played by JeanPierre Leaud who does a great job going between serious and comedy in his first Godard film since La Gai Savoir snooping around a hotel trying to find out about the death of The Price while at the same time a boxing promoter is getting into some heat with some overpaid debts and at the same time sleeping with the mafioso's wife I think this last part hopefully I'm clear on this point.Luckily Godard working under a Commercial framework ironic considering that this is commercial when compared to everything else Godard was doing at the time and made this in order to make the controversial Hail Mary is able to slip in some funny and cool and actually engaging bits of dialog and quotes and ruminations by characters and he's able to tag a hold of the plot a bit too. He also understands the jokeyness of doing an homage to gangster and boxing pictures of the noir era in full color without a clear narrative thread all of the time and plays around with it successfully. This doesn't make it automatically a great picture or as daring precisely as his earlier work. But it is a good sign sometimes perhaps a director like Godard needs an Alain Sarde to reel him in just a tad and then the collaboration works out better as opposed to... King Lear.".

Also present is a woman named Francoise Nathalie Baye who's unhappily married to an airline pilot Claude Brasseur. She's at the hotel to settle a debt with Jim FoxWarner Johnny Hallyday a fight promoter. Jim shares a room with a star boxer Stephane Ferrara and an entourage of young women. Whilst all these characters drift about a Mafia godfather also known as The Prince discusses philosophy. He's slavishly followed by a catatonic little girl. Detective periodically cuts away to shots of a tripodmounted camera as it gazes at life outside the hotel. Godard also frequently cuts to shots of neonlit billboards all advertising media brands. His hotel is itself populated by different brands or flattened archetypes detectives boxers singers lovers nods to crime films film noirs slapstick comedy etc as well as actors who come from different performance backgrounds and traditions Johnny Hallyday is a singer JeanPierre Laud is associated with the New Wave Alain Cuny is a classic French actor Baye and Brasseur are mainstream actors Seigner and Delpy signal a new generation etc.Ironically for a film explicitly commissioned to make money  Godard promised producers a mainstream picture in order to secure cash to finance his upcoming Hail Mary  Detective is a kind of antifilm about money. It opens with Francoise apprehensive about entering the hotel which characters insist smells of death. Like most of the film's characters though she's owed payments and so forced to enter. Indeed everyone in Detective is chasing cash. Fighters seek riches gangsters want repayment characters sell jewelry and Francoise and her husband are down a couple million. What's the point running around for nothing? characters state. Man's gotta be paid actors too. Significantly the guy doing the paying is named after two Western megafilm studios FoxWarner.Whilst these disgruntled characters seek payment the film's detectives are locked in their own little subplot. We're looking for the unknown! one detective says as he prowls the hotel's catacombs. He and his companions are always searching for truth plot and story all of which seem elusive and out of reach. There are plenty of stories here Prospero insists Im sure something is going to happen! Of course nothing happens. Godard's Detective is a giant morass of nonevents inaction banal conversations and subverted subplots. A kind of antifilm about nothing happening in which the actors of the film in which nothing happens are grumpy because they're only turning up to be paid and nobody's paying. Godard's films often attack the business of filmmaking but with Detective we get a more vague attack on all economic relations. The monkeys preached the new order and little by little all the animals converted one character says. We're then told a story about a mouse who is killed by his new friends. Things have gone back to the way they were the Prince explains the new regime is over beauty has become the beast! Alligned to this new economic order in which everyone is slavishly forced to submit are the film's outmoded Mafiamen. Whilst a girl reads a magazine titled Crackdown on the Mafia a Mafia kingpin admits the mafia insists upon an outmoded way of life based on work and effort outside of which all existence loses all meaning. The kingpin then explains that the mafia has been forced underground by the new order and that the mafia itself needs law and order to construct its business deals successfully. Later a woman compares the hotel's mafiamen to banks in comparison to which she says the mafiamen are angels.During the film's last act Godard cuts to a movie director on television. The narrator is king the figure says making things happen with his own perception! I'm making this picture for the theatre not the actors! We assume Godard is referring to himself the director as king but soon someone else is revealed to be in control. At this point in one swift move the Prince has all the film's key players killed and steals all their cash. Put up a fight! Retake it! Francoise says leading her husband to stand up to the Prince before being killed himself. Seeking justice the detective's female assistant crouches before the Prince and aims a gun but her efforts are futile. The Prince casually disarms the woman. She then passively walks away and makes a joke about acquiring money. This scene encapsulates the power relations of the film the Prince representing ruling groups within capitalist democracies and their rigid social hierarchies the dead detectives akin to neutralised justice systems and the corpses at everyone's feet hinting at the costs of the Prince's new order. The world is upside down Godard says throughout a complicated subplot which serves as a metaphor for why the Prince manages to be simultaneously dead and alive.Dtective is a film obsessed with books. Francoise wants to start a bookshop the detectives are surrounded by paperbacks Jim carries a copy of Conrad's Lord Jim about a colonialist who sees himself on a civilising mission Prospero reads The Tempest a Shakespeare play with a character called Prospero and the gangsters read The Sicilian. Contrasted with the film's violent characters is an overarching discourse on love the film's crisscrossing love affairs made impossible for various reasons most of which are financial. Francoise's husband represents this love at its purest but he's killed. Only the apathetic survive. This being Godard Detective is relentlessly alienating. Godard's credits are interspersed throughout the picture leading to a sense of disjunction and dislocation. The film's score is likewise disorienting. Epitomizing Godard's alienating effects are Detective's closing moments which focus on feet reflections doors and use odd angles all designed to obscure. 7.910  Multiple viewings required.".

	schema:headline " Detective 1985 JeanLuc Godard";
	schema:reviewBody "This is why I love Godard. He turned a 'commercial' project he did in order to get financing for Hail Mary into one of his most enthralling late works a sleeker leaner funnier lighter version of the sort of film Godard made after the 60's. The film follows four different 'stories' in the Hotel Concorde SaintLazare in Paris where the entire film is set. Something of a deconstruction of the detective film or filmnoir on paper but the film is more formally interesting than it is storywise though its 'narrative' is often very amusing and overall very entertaining. Although critical reviews of Detective seem to be positive all the ones I can find anyway including Variety and the New York Times among others the film is overall not too popular and from my experience not too wellliked by Godard fans either. Shame as well because the fact that Detective combines some of the zip and light humor of Godard's early work with the more experimental sensibilities of later Godard films doesn't mean this is in any way lacking as a filmic experiment. It's gorgeouslyshot with superb intricate miseenscne and features some of the most interesting and complex editing in any Godard film but what really steals the show is the sound which is an entire world all on its own. The visual splendor of the film is not only complimented but overshadowed by the creative sound editing and mixing genius use of music and aural gags and puns. Dedicated to Edgar G. Ulmer Clint Eastwood and John Cassavetes Detective is one of Godard's best and likely his most criminally underappreciated. It does ask for a patient observant audience willing to listen carefully but rewards that patience with great comic energy and some fascinating and beautiful aural experimentation. One of the best casts Godard ever worked with as well.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is why I love Godard. He turned a 'commercial' project he did in order to get financing for Hail Mary into one of his most enthralling late works a sleeker leaner funnier lighter version of the sort of film Godard made after the 60's. The film follows four different 'stories' in the Hotel Concorde SaintLazare in Paris where the entire film is set. Something of a deconstruction of the detective film or filmnoir on paper but the film is more formally interesting than it is storywise though its 'narrative' is often very amusing and overall very entertaining. Although critical reviews of Detective seem to be positive all the ones I can find anyway including Variety and the New York Times among others the film is overall not too popular and from my experience not too wellliked by Godard fans either.

The film is deliberately incomprehensible though very entertaining for film noir lovers and occasionally funny.What is best in the film is the marvelous direction from Godard who returns to a filmmaking that is more reminiscent of his 60's work than anything that came after this film paying a homage to film noir as he did twenty years before to Bmovies with Alphaville although less successfully here. The camera doesn't move in this film and the shots are all very nicely done.As for what the story regards the script offers an engaging story that starts off a bit too slowly and an interesting character a shame it's only one who has to deal with some more compelling relationships as Nathalie Baye's character is caught between two men. The film has some of those Godardian undescriptible scenes to which you laugh or have feelings to without quite knowing how do they fit into a whole.On the downhill we have a film that actually gives no depth to their characters except for Baye's and whose satirical tones aren't as strong as you would expect. It has that pretentiousness that Godard usually manages to hide in his other movies and the whole film at the end feels as a mere direction exercise from his part but if it was just a direction exercise it is a great one.Dtective is a satirical filmnoir with a fantastic direction cinematography and editing some witty scenes and a refreshing unresolved mystery.Rating 35.".

Her stylist really goofed on this one. Her hair was parted in such a way that she looked like she had a combover from the back. Her clothes were perfect for her neat compact figure. She really was an adorable woman and I'm glad that she had a happy second marriage. Richard Loo was marvelous as the anticommunist expatriate general.

Susan Hayward has learned of her husband's capture on trumpedup charges from the Chinese gov't and is willing to use any means possible to rescue him.  This means even recruiting the mysterious Hank Lee a rogue a bandit a smuggler and those are his good qualities according to the British crown represented by Michael Rennie.When all is said and done Gable finally accepts the challenge and how he pulls the rescue off makes the story.  Downtown Hong Kong has many memorable shots and the film utilizes each of them to the fullest potential.";

She runs into of a bunch of sleazy characters and finally meets Henry Lee Gable a soldier of fortune with money and contacts. He's an older version of Rhett Butler  out for himself but capable of goodness as well. He falls hard for Hayward and becomes more determined than ever to find her husband so he doesn't have to compete with a ghost. With two such attractive stars it's obvious what's going to happen.The stars and the supporting cast  Michael Rennie Tom Tully Anna Sten et al  are all very good. It's a beautifully photographed film that undoubtedly looked great on the big screen with its Technicolor panoramas of Hong Kong but alas it's not very exciting. Gable looks fantastic and immaculate in his white suit his smile as dimpled and his voice as gruff as ever and Hayward not the warmest actress who ever lived is excellent as a concerned and confused woman. They work very well together.It's hard to say the movie is not worth seeing because as excellent as some of our actors are today there are no Gables. There was only one  and checking him out is always worthwhile.".

So the bustling and already festoonedwithhighrises city of Hong Kong is the principal setting for the jumpingoff point of the plot. It's pretty obvious that Gable is actually there in Hong Kong for a few of the shots but Susan Hayward embroiled in a custody battle after her divorce from Lex Barker didn't dare leave the U.S. or her chances of caring for her children by that marriage might have been scotched. Therefore long shots and a few medium ones of her were cleverly arranged with a double and she performs all of her closeups et cetera safely ensconced on the Fox soundstages in West Los Angeles and against some rather good back projections.Gable and Hayward are a pretty good team and Michael Rennie lends his usual elegant support. Gene Barry has a rather thankless role as Susan's eventually rejected husband and the supporting cast including the Asians appearing as various Chinese are all convincing under Edward Dmytryk's workmanlike direction.For me the real stars however are Leo Tover's excellent use of the CinemaScope lenses and once again Hugo Friedhofer's atmospheric score. In my opinion no other Hollywood master of the full orchestral enhancement was able to cue the audience and call up some real emotion with so few bars of music. This film is a sterling example of his art. Just check out the closing few moments of the film.

Hayward is particularly sweet in a scene where she encounters one of Gable's foster children an adorable young boy who is fascinated by American cowboys.Veteran actress Anna Sten who had a brief career as a leading lady in the 1930's before Box Office Poison did her in has a nice supporting role here as a shady lady whom even the trashiest of men ignore. Gene Barry plays a rather shady character whom Hayward encounters on her arrival reminding me of a slightly younger Gilbert Roland. Fortunately the Asian stereotypes are minimal so there is only a little that may offend.

	schema:reviewBody "Fiery Jane Hoyt played by Susan Hayward of the blazing red hair arrives in the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong in search of her husband Louis a photographer who disappeared while on a shoot in Mainland China. Louis played by Gene Barry entered China illegally without a visa and has been detained by the Communist authorities. Hayward enlists the aid of a shipping magnate with connections Clark Gable to locate her husband and bring him out. While the chemistry between Hayward and Gable is lukewarm at best an onscreen romance ensues which undercuts the credibility of Hayward's portrayal of a loving faithful wife in search of her missing husband. The gruff mature Gable who incongruously has adopted three Asian children makes the moves on Hayward who stoically receives his kisses and allows him to hold her hand across a table. Actually the coolness between Gable and Hayward is a torrid fire compared to the freeze between Barry and Hayward. Thus both the motivation for Hayward's journey to Hong Kong in search of her missing husband and her attraction to Gable are undercut by the lack of warmth between the actors what the script says and what the performers suggest are miles apart. When not being pursued by Gable or other wolves on the prowl Hayward searches the city for information on her husband. The search brings her into contact with a number of supporting players including Michael Rennie Alex D'Arcy and Tom Tully and several distracting subplots which only serve to remind viewers that the film was adapted from a novel by Ernest K Gann who also wrote the script.Director Edward Dmytryk keeps the action scenes going at a decent pace and Hayward's search is initially intriguing. However even Dmytryk can do little with the unconvincing love affair or the lack of chemistry between his three stars who acquit themselves professionally but no more. Leo Tover's colorful cinematography captures an exotic but now bygone Hong Kong of junks sampans and stunning vistas of mountains and bays. Set in the 1950's Soldier of Fortune would make an ideal double bill with Love is a Many Splendored Thing a more successful romantic film that shares both location and period with the GableHayward vehicle. The Dmytryk film has much in its favor an exotic locale fine cinematography two top stars an able supporting cast and a fairly good story. Unfortunately Soldier of Fortune is one of those movies that is worth seeing but less than the sum of its parts.".

Gann adapted his own novel for the screen the film seems to fall between several stools  action romance politics  but with its eye firmly on the boxoffice this superficial and sometimes contrived approach ends up satisfying no one. That said it's a generally entertaining ride  and Dmytryk handles the proceedings in an efficient if highly impersonal manner.In the end I'd say that SOLDIER OF FORTUNE is the least of the 3 Fox titles released as part of the rather expensive The Clark Gable Collection  the others being William Wellman's THE CALL OF THE WILD 1935 and Raoul Walsh's THE TALL MEN 1955 disappointingly this is the only one not to feature an accompanying Audio Commentary.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film in which The Brooklyn Bombshell Susan Hayward met The King of Hollywood Clark Gable 1955's Soldier of Fortune is a middling adventure that should have been much better. In this one Hayward journeys to Hong Kong to begin her search for her missing husband a journalist being held prisoner in mainland China and enlists the aid of junkfleet smuggler Gable as a last resort. If this scenario of a journalist being held captive by an Asian Communist country strikes anyone as being implausible just consider what is happening in North Korea today and the plight of newswomen Ling and Lee! Anyway with old pros like Gable and Hayward the film is certainly well acted and interesting and the two in their only screen pairing DO have a nice chemistry. They are ably abetted by Gene Barry as Susan's husband and Michael Rennie as a sympathetic British police officer and the scenery of midcentury Hong Kong is at least as spectacular as that shown in Love Is a Many Splendored Thing and The World of Suzie Wong. Unfortunately the picture has its problems. Despite being scripted by Ernest K. Gann from his novel the story seems inadequately fleshed out and several subplots that bar wedding the Chinese exgeneral peter out and seem pointless maybe they are there simply to add color?. Perhaps worst of all the rescue of Barry from his jail on the mainland is accomplished waaay too easily if only WE could send some cando guys into North Korea to conk a few heads and waltz those women out! Hayward did not go to Hong Kong during the filming of this picture and though director Edward Dmytryk who would make another movie based in China that same year The Left Hand of God  Co. work their magic this fact is sometimes distractingly obvious. I must add that I enjoyed Soldier of Fortune more during a repeat viewing with lowered expectations. But then again I can watch Susan Hayward in anything....".

In so many of his films he played a rogue who was often on the wrong side of the law and who claimed to have no loyalty to anything but himself. However again and again by the end of the film his character turned out to be decent after alland usually get the girl. Despite all this being present in SOLDIER OF FORTUNE I enjoyed the movie for two reasons. First Gable always played those parts so well that it's hard to dislike these films. Second setting the movie in Hong Kong was a welcome relief and breathed life into the old theme. In particular the spectacular scenery really enhanced the film and made it sparkle.".

The scenes of Hong Kong in 1954 or 1955 were documented nicely and worth keeping Susan Hayward was beautiful and sexy as usual Clark Gable on the other hand aging so old with blurry eyes but still tried very hard to give off his charm. And that 3 of the goodness is just about it. Laughable screenplay and unbelievable scenario cartoonlike supporting actors all looked like clowns and jerks if without these totally unnecessary figures this film would have nothing to patch up between the ridiculous rescue and the laughable sudden change of heart romance.";

U.S. release June 1955. U.K. release 24 October 1955. Australian release 29 March 1956 Sydney opening at the Regent. 8603 feet. 95 minutes.SYNOPSIS In search of her missing photographer husband Jane Hoyt Susan Hayward arrives in Hong Kong and learns at the U.S. Consulate that her mission is futile that neither the United States nor the British government can help her. She feels that she must try nevertheless and registers at a hotel that services a conglomeration of businessmen servicemen entertainers and ne'er dowells from all over the world. Jane gets in touch with Inspector Merryweather Michael Rennie of the local marine police who although unable to help her officially promises to do all he can for her on his own. He asks her to identify two cameras that the police had picked up from a junk captain at the harbor. She confirms that they belonged to her husband. Merryweather then suggests that she inquire at a place called Tweedie's. Jane is about to be thrown out of Tweedie's when Rene Chevalier Alex D'Arcy joins her at the table as if she were waiting for him. He tells her that he knew her husband and had seen him one night with Fernand Rocha Mel Welles and a girl named Maxine Chan Frances Fong. With nothing more than this information she contacts Maxine who leads her to Hank Lee Clark Gable of whom Merryweather had warned her.COMMENT Although it took good money on the strength of its Hong Kong in CinemaScope background and its starring twosome Soldier of Fortune is a rather ordinary tale with inconsistently motivated Mills and Boon principals forced into a combination pulp novel romance and comic strip adventure. In this latter connection keen movie buffs will notice some remarkable similarities between Soldier of Fortune and Milton Caniff's Terry and the Pirates  especially as regards some of the bizarre background characters which give the movie some welcome jolts of interest thanks to the efforts of players like Anna Sten the former Goldwyn leading lady of the 1930s Tom Tully Russell Collins and other assorted misogynist bar habitues.OTHER VIEWS Another early CinemaScope film in which the accent is firmly on the CinemaScope scenery this time the travelogue cameras focus on Hong Kong rather than the juvenile dialogue stock characters and Boys Own Paper plot. Critics are usually tempted to say at this point that the players do their best  but they don't really. If they'd had a grain of sense they would have played it all tongueincheek but no they're perfectly serious about the whole puerile business. Dmytryk's flatfooted direction matches the pedestrian plot. The appearance of Anna Sten in a minor role is some compensation for movie buffs but otherwise the whole film aside from the scenery and the lushly romantic music score is a very ordinary very tepid and very dated antiChinese Communist tract.

Salman did his tough guy role with lan. Shahrukh though physically unsuitable to play that kind of role didn't do bad either. Kajol may be remembered as an actress of substance today but this movie showed her and Mamta Kulkarni both as mere showpieces a trait of 90s. Amrish Puri did another of those evil Thakur kind of roles that he could even played in his sleep. However the soul of the movie is Rakhi Gulzar every time she mouthed that unforgettable Mere Bete Aayenge Mere Karan Arjun Aayenge line I used to find myself almost in tears. Music was average but Jaati Hun Main Jaldi Hai Kya became a chartbuster and was like Kajol's own Dhak Dhak.Not to forget Mujhko Ranaji Maaf Karna which was one of the most talked about songs after Choli Ke Peeche. Bravura performances hit songs high emotional melodrama and above all Rakhi's spirited performance made this movie a cult. Not to miss if you have been bored of NRI characters roaming in Mercedes and dancing in exotic locales and want to see some real Bollywood extravaganza.".

I like a lot of Shah Rukh Khan's films so that is why I can say Karan Arjun is Salman's best film and not Shah Rukh's. I really liked the idea of the story about a mother's two sons killed and she prayed to faithfully ask for the return of her sons. A miracle takes place and they are both born again. The film was so heartfelt  emotional about relationships. The best scenes throughout the whole movie are when Salman was fighting for money to cure his father. Every actor was terrific in their own place but not Kajol she was a complete showoff and just can not act sorry Kajol fans!. Mamta Kulkarni was also good for her small role also she is beautiful  cute I really do like her but sadly she doe's not appear anymore. Directed by one of my most favourite directors Rakesh Roshan his films always took Bollywood to a new level e.g. Koi Mil Gaya was the first Indian scifi  Krrish is the first superhero movie. Overall Karan Arjun is a very unforgettable film and I just recently bought it on DVD.".

Every actor was terrific in their own place but not Kajol she was a complete showoff and just can not act sorry Kajol fans!. Mamta Kulkarni was also good for her small role also she is beautiful  cute I really do like her but sadly she doe's not appear anymore. Directed by one of my most favourite directors Rakesh Roshan his films always took Bollywood to a new level e.g. Koi Mil Gaya was the first Indian scifi  Krrish is the first superhero movie. Overall Karan Arjun is a very unforgettable film and I just recently bought it on DVD.";

Shakrukh Khan in his new avatar as a raffish stableboy is a crack shot with a sling shot Salman Khan is a muscled bare knuckle fighter. They are briefly pitched against one another when Shakrukh breaks into the gangster wedding where his beloved Kajol as cute as always but more mannerisms than acting here is about to be pledged to the bad guy's affected son just back from London with brilliantined hair  moustache and the catchphrase in English It's a joke!. Salman Khan his unrecognized reincarnated brother is a hired heavy for the gangsters. . . after they have trashed the bar each other and many of the tables throwing one another around cue the lightning flash and dizzying flashbacks to stop the fight. Shakrukh flees Salman is arrested and Kajol is still helpless in the grip of the bad guys.The Khans did much better slicker pictures later in their careers. This one is amusing for posturing that recalls Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns but never bothers to keep consistency of tone. Salman with his handsome and often sullen look is more convincing than Shakruh who is alternately too boyish and too grief stricken.But the best of show is the classic bad guy Amrish Puri bullet headed pop eyed and fierce a villain epic enough to make you believe that he would assassinate his associates but then howl like an animal in the dust when vengeance touches his own family.Music and dance is familiar Bollywood my favorite number was that one done in Kali's temple silhouetted in the dark as the boys appear and then disappear before a baffled Amrish Puri.A trifle but a lot of fun!".

Indians believe in rebirth and karma  but since majority of us are below poverty line and uneducated the Bollywood Directors try their level best to teach us all the Theories regulating our lives!Karna  Arjun were 2 brothers  living with their Mother. They are not engaged to any village belle surprisingly though!!since in villagessuch things happen very soon tyrannical  brute  greedy uncles  villains want to have it all  their piece of land thus taking away their peace of mind as well. The aged Mother  along with her 2 sons demand justice from them. The brutes kill the 2 sons in front of Mother as a reply !! The Mother is left alive  to weep all her life and also because women are considered meek  harmless by Indian Villain men. But she goes and complains it all to most sought after Indian Goddess MAA Kali! And prays to her that her sons should return back to her in order to avenge her loss! She gets an indication that a baby is born almost instantly and gets assured that the 'souls' of her sons have again taken birth  in human form  somewhere...Next Scene 2 infants are born to 2 different houses  in the house of 'not so well to do families'  one baby gets an 'alcoholic beater poverty stricken' father who hits the child all the time  THUS  the child learns to fend for himself and becomes bitter and strong since childhood  a training plan by the upper world  for he had to ultimately go to the village to kill the brutes. The second child is born and brought up managing the horse stable  another strengthening activity  thus both the reborn sons of the 'weeping village Lady' get ready in their respective homes in some remote town.

The picturisation of this song was very sweet very touching.

Over the recent years Salman has really impressed me with his different roles. SRK like his early movies overacted too much the fighting scenes were unconvincing and the dialogues were as they say very filmy. Kajol unlike her recent films was very annoying. Mamta although very short but gave one of her better performances.All in all it's an overhyped movie which won't be recognised as a classic. 510.".

	schema:reviewBody "Reincarnation is the one word which can be used to describe Karan Arjun a film which can easily be a fun watch for the entire family. It is about two brothers who are killed and their mother who expects to see them again for some reason and desperately prays for the day they come back. And her prayers get paid off when her children are reborn in different parts of the country and grow up looking the same as her dead kids. The film has some heartbreaking feel about it but as a film it is a bit overdone melodramatic and cheesy. Yet it never takes itself too seriously so it somehow works despite being blown out of proportions. The film may particularly appeal to children  heroes and villains fights and races dialogue which does not have much sense very caricaturish characters. Despite that there are some emotions that somehow work for others so I would call it a children's film which may appeal to the rest of the family. Salman Khan and Shahrukh Khan work very well together and give the film a certain appeal not warranted by the script. Salman is restrained as never before and Shahrukh is carefree and positive. Raakhee does well as the suffering mom and the moment of unity is such a familiar tearcausing scene that nothing else matters. Mamta and Kajol are hardly there particularly Kajol who is invisible. Rajesh Roshan's music is as always amazing with Yeh Bandhan leading the list. All in all go and try this wholesome Bollywood entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rated on the basis of watching on T.V. 17 years after releasePlotThe two sons of a widow Karan and Arjun are murdered by the evil villagelord. But she believes her sons will return. Will the miracle happen?Review Reincarnation has been the subject of Bollywood films for a long time from Madhumati1958 to Dangerous Ishq2012. Rakesh Roshan also chose reincarnation as the subject of his 1995 venture Karan Arjun but with a difference. Unlike other films where the purpose of rebirth was unfulfilledbetrayed love the sole objective of reincarnation here is revenge. The first halfanhour of the film is captivating. The murdersequence of KaranArjun hammers at the heart. But from the openingcredits the film meanders on without any direction. The romantictracks of the two brothers is clumsily written. While the AjayBindiya romance is undercooked and never depicted properly the VijaySonia romance seems too fast to be convincing there introductory scene is quite embarrassingly amateurish. But the film springs back to life from the wellshot stablefire sequence and from there onwards it's nonstop fun.The second half is thoroughly entertaining. The sequence where Vijay remembers his past is beautifully shot and edited. One can't hold back a smile or tear! at the scene where the two brothers are reunited with their mother. The mountainvalleys of the village are breathtaking. One only wishes the killingscene of Durjan was shot at some of these grand locales and not at the dingy lanes of the village preferably with 'elegant' swords replacing the 'petty' pistols.The script packs in all the clichs in the many highlyemotional scenes but they do succeed in packing a punch. The dialogues range from emotionally stirring to hilarious.Getting Salman Khan riding high on Hum Aapke Hain Kaun and Shah Rukh Khan of BaazigarDarr fame together for the first time was a castingcoup. The hit Baazigar pair of SRK  Kajol was also reunited. The makers clearly modelled the characters of KaranAjay  ArjunVijay on Jai  Veeru from Sholay. While SRK as the chirpy and cheerful Vijay scores easily Salman as the brooding and quiet Ajay fails to create much impression as he lacks that imposing personality in Big B's immortal portrayal of Jai. Kajol and her chemistry with SRK is rollicking as ever. They have just five sequences together but even that is pure magic! One really wished to see more of them together. Mamta Kulkarni gets the most thankless role as her only job is to dance to as many as four numbers she sings more than she speaks! Rakhee reprises her avatar of the wronged widow from Ram Lakkhan and she is a showstealer. Amrish Puri in his habituated evil avatar is good though his broom moustache was unintentionally comical. Ashok Saraf and Johny Lever are hilarious.Rakesh's direction is solid in the opening 30 minutes but then it wanders. But from the second half he gets the narration under a tight leash and some of the sequences are tremendously executed. The composer Rajesh Roshan scores with all the songs except 'Ek Munda' out of which 'Yeh Bandhan' and 'Jaati Hun Main' live on in the mind for long. Equally impressive is the background music where special scores are played for almost every character in similar sequences.But despite a brilliant track the picturisation of 'Jaati Hun Main' is quite atrocious. Due to limitations in script the makers clearly wanted to exploit the famous SRKKajol chemistry to the hilt through this one song. Intended to be erotic the song starts off well but then what follows is embarrassing! It seemed everyone including the stallions were just having fun. It didn't help that SRK used to have two left feet during those times. But more the madness hotter grew the chemistry between the leads. It's only the rocking melody and chemistry that salvaged the song from being an erotic disaster to just a raunchy number. It's almost guilty pleasure for the viewers because it's so bad that it's good! Even in 'Bhangra Pale' the continuity is absent with alternate scenes of sunshine and overcast skies.But the biggest flaw of the film is that it doesn't give equal weightage to both its leads. The makers seemed biased towards SRK as he gets the wittier dialogues the more popular heroine and romantic number he discovers their true identity escapes unhurt while Salman is hit by a bullet and lastly takes a shot on his left palm but Salman takes it on his right no wonder the director chose SRK as the solo lead for his next Koyla! Salman is not required to perform any task alone unlike SRK's discovery of their past which prevents him from creating an unique impression. But Salman's latent utility lies in the formidability he lends to the KaranArjun duo as without his muscled physique SRK in his slim figure standing up to the mighty villains would have been unconvincing. They make you root for them only if they had engaged in some banter between them.Karan Arjun is not a totally satisfying watch considering its unfulfilled potential. But by the end a smile does crop up on the face even unknowingly. What more important can one ask for?BoxOffice Verdict Riding on its cast songs and timetested theme of reincarnation the film became a 'blockbuster'. The songs 'Yeh Bandhan' 'Jaati Hun Main' and 'Bhangra Pale' became hits with the first two becoming classics. Rakhee's dialogue 'Mere KaranArjun aayenge' got cultstatus. The raunchy picturisation of 'Jaati Hun Main' attracted many repeat audiences due to the absence of musicchannels those days. SRKKajol went on to become one of the most popular pairs of all time starting with DDLJ later that year. Karan Arjun set the path to megastardom for Salman SRK and Kajol. But considering this age of sequels if Rakesh Roshan decides to make KaranArjun2 will he able to regroup his two leads now behaving like KaranArjun from Mahabharata? Maybein next birth!".

	schema:reviewBody "Dear reader please appreciate my efforts on your behalf. I stay away from writing comments on films I disliked but just for you I saw Karan Arjun again so I could write a factual review.A loving mother Durga Rakhee and her two super loving sons the Khan duo of SRK and Salman live an idyllic life that seems to consist of lots of running to grab mother's feet sleeping with their heads in her lap. Did I mention GROWN loving sons? Cut to the mystery of their heritage they are the grandsons of a rich Zamindar who is in the clutches of an evil relative Durjan Singh a particularly bug eyed Amrish Puri. The Zamindar wants to make the twins his heir but the evil Durjan Singh has other plans. BTW can any one with the name Durjan be good? Did his parents plan his future when they gave him that name? Durjan pursues and kills Karan Salman and Arjun SRK and the heroes are gone just like that. But the mother prays to the Goddess Kali and asks that her children be reborn  and they are as Ajay and Vijay in two separate families. Ajay romances the buxom Sonia Kajol while Vijay is pursued by the equally buxom Bindiya Mamta Kulkarni. Durjan's son wants to marry Sonia tries to kill Ajay eventually Sonia is spirited away to Malakheda  where Durjan Singh lives. All this while Ajay and Vijay have flashbacks of their past life and eventually meet discover their past and go to Malakheda to try and rescue Sonia and help their mother.What is good about this film? Well let me think HM some cool horseback riding Johny Lever maybe? You know one has scraped the bottom of the barrel when Johny becomes a plus.The negatives SRK Salman Kajol are completely wasted in this silly movie. There are songs that are so horrible and have some of the worst choreography in memory  Bhangra Pale Yeh Bandhan to Jaati Hoon Main are all quite atrocious. But the crown jewel is the Jai Kali Maa song. It has to be seen to be believed. If you have avoided KA up to this point then go view this song just to see how stars do not a film make. You might also appreciate the director's efforts to balance the buxom factor in the two leading ladies!!Something needs to be said about the acting. Salman is sort of less beady eyed than I have ever seen him but maybe because he is not acting either. Shahrukh is pretty bad too in a role that has no scope for any kind of acting. Kajol is awful and is probably very glad that she spent most of her time in a locked room in the film. One hear rumors that Ajay Devgan was to do the role of Arjun but things didn't work out and SRK got the role  this caused a rift between the two. If I were Ajay I would be SRK's lifelong friend for his help in escaping from acting in this movie. There is a bad guy who keeps saying What a joke Amrish Puri is so bug eyed you wonder why the eyes didn't just roll out of their sockets at some point. There are fight scenes that could have been planned and written by either Laurel and Hardy or students in second grade.The movie was a huge blockbuster. But after the recent success of Dhoom 2 mine not to question why mine not to seek reply mine just to avoid or die.".

You know one has scraped the bottom of the barrel when Johny becomes a plus.The negatives SRK Salman Kajol are completely wasted in this silly movie. There are songs that are so horrible and have some of the worst choreography in memory  Bhangra Pale Yeh Bandhan to Jaati Hoon Main are all quite atrocious. But the crown jewel is the Jai Kali Maa song. It has to be seen to be believed. If you have avoided KA up to this point then go view this song just to see how stars do not a film make. You might also appreciate the director's efforts to balance the buxom factor in the two leading ladies!!Something needs to be said about the acting. Salman is sort of less beady eyed than I have ever seen him but maybe because he is not acting either. Shahrukh is pretty bad too in a role that has no scope for any kind of acting. Kajol is awful and is probably very glad that she spent most of her time in a locked room in the film. One hear rumors that Ajay Devgan was to do the role of Arjun but things didn't work out and SRK got the role  this caused a rift between the two. If I were Ajay I would be SRK's lifelong friend for his help in escaping from acting in this movie. There is a bad guy who keeps saying What a joke Amrish Puri is so bug eyed you wonder why the eyes didn't just roll out of their sockets at some point. There are fight scenes that could have been planned and written by either Laurel and Hardy or students in second grade.The movie was a huge blockbuster. But after the recent success of Dhoom 2 mine not to question why mine not to seek reply mine just to avoid or die.";

I remember calling up a radio contest which said that you could win tickets to the premiere of a new movie called  The Idolmaker  at Radio City Music Hall in New York City  Manhatten . I could not believe that I actually got thru and when I did was told that I had won. They wanted my name address and phone number and told me that I would be receiving tickets to the premiere of the movie. What made matters even more great was the fact that my exhusband worked for Rockefeller Center not NBC otherwise we wouldn't have been eligible for winning these tickets. What luck! The premiere of this movie was amazing!!! I loved the acting and the singing was to die for. After the movie ended the stars of the show got up on the Radio City stage and spoke a few words thanking everyone who attended. I was privileged to have been seated in the 5th row from front. Peter Gallagher was so handsome in person as was Paul Land. Ray Sharkey  may he rest in peace  was at his finest hour. Even though this movie received a bad review and it didn't do too well in the theaters I believe that many people were not given the opportunity to see what a fine movie this really was. Prince and Michael Jackson are big fans of this movie and for good reason.  You can be anything you want to be   and that is the motto of this movie. Singer songwriter artistyou can make it!".

Resigned to this bitter fact Vinnie instead decides to groom callow but promising handsome lads Paul Land and Peter Gallagher into fluffy bubblegum teen pop idol sensations so he can vicariously live through their monumental successes. Vinnie transforms raunchy slob Land into an irresistibly dreamy wellmannered Adonis. Vinnie pulls off an even more miraculous metamorphosis with Gallagher a klutzy busboy who under Vinnie's masterful tutelage becomes a devastatingly hunky stuff muffin on wheels. Alas Vinnie's ego and overcontrolling nature skyrocket along with his newfound popularity and teeming bank account leading to inevitable conflicts and Vinnie's painful downward spiral back into the dismal obscurity he started from.Loosely based on the reallife story of legendary South Philadelphia pop music impresario Robert Marcucci the man who discovered both Fabian and Frankie Avalon he gets a technical adviser credit for this picture Taylor Hackford's terrifically tart rock bio is more notable not for what it does but for what it bravely and commendably avoids doing. Although set in the much sentimentalized 50's Hackford's boldly unromanticized movie certainly isn't some plasticky rosy nostalgia piece. Instead Hackford working from Edward Di Lorenzo's smart cheeky astutely observed script offers a tantalizingly tawdry warts'n'all depiction of the blithely amoral behindthescenes music business wheeling and dealing payola groupies wheedling backstabbing and betrayal sneaky advanced promotion tactics rock music as strictly a hot marketable commodity to make money off of  y'know all that tasty lowdown dirty stuff that goes on backstage that the recordbuying public isn't supposed to know about.Moreover the songs and onstage performances are both topnotch Veteran songwriter Jeff Barry penned the bouncy moony incredibly perky and catchy tunes while Denny Terrio did the vital mildly lewd daringly impertinent and provocative dance choreography. The acting is acrosstheboard excellent as well Land and Gallagher the latter also does his own strikingly fine singing are amiably wideeyed and convincing while Joe Pantoliano as Vinnie's loyal songwriter best friend Tovah Feldshuh as a canny demanding teen mag editor Olympia Dukakis as Vinnie's loving mom Richard Bright Al Neri in all three Godfather films as Ray's ineffectual loser uncle and everyone's favorite Brady girl Maureen McCormick as an eminently desirable teen zine writer acquit themselves superbly in supporting roles. Ultimately it's nonetheless still Ray Sharkey's show all the way forcefully projecting a certain low cunning oozing scintillating reptilian charisma from every vibrantly oily pore dressed to the nines in sharp suits perpetually on the make and furiously talking a dazzling line in rhythmic ratatattat pitterpatter bullst Sharkey's spoton positively electrifying characterization deservedly nabbed him a Golden Globe Award and now serves as a sterling reminder of just how remarkably tragic his untimely AIDSrelated death truly is. Rest in peace Mr. Sharkey and thank you for all your wonderful performances.".

The acting is acrosstheboard excellent as well Land and Gallagher the latter also does his own strikingly fine singing are amiably wideeyed and convincing while Joe Pantoliano as Vinnie's loyal songwriter best friend Tovah Feldshuh as a canny demanding teen mag editor Olympia Dukakis as Vinnie's loving mom Richard Bright Al Neri in all three Godfather films as Ray's ineffectual loser uncle and everyone's favorite Brady girl Maureen McCormick as an eminently desirable teen zine writer acquit themselves superbly in supporting roles. Ultimately it's nonetheless still Ray Sharkey's show all the way forcefully projecting a certain low cunning oozing scintillating reptilian charisma from every vibrantly oily pore dressed to the nines in sharp suits perpetually on the make and furiously talking a dazzling line in rhythmic ratatattat pitterpatter bullst Sharkey's spoton positively electrifying characterization deservedly nabbed him a Golden Globe Award and now serves as a sterling reminder of just how remarkably tragic his untimely AIDSrelated death truly is. Rest in peace Mr. Sharkey and thank you for all your wonderful performances.";

This is a very moving film about a man who spends his life making the careers of others only to get left behind as they move up the food chain. Talented himself but didn't have the look that sold records. Ray Sharky died of aids yrs later actually did some work while he had hiv and looked it. This is probably his best work. I have always been a movie buff still dream of directing and I can remember the Ebert and Roeper review of this film. It was their sleeper hit of the week. I remember if vividly because that's when I learned about the term sleeper referencing films. It was a 2 thumbs up and HBO played it constantly. HBO was limited back then and this was always on and we watched it every chance we could!".

It's sort of a formula picture with the struggle to get to the top the famepower corrupting the fall then the redemption. Two things made this work first the musical numbers were very good. This is a very difficult thing making a movie about hit records and having to write original music that sounds like a hit. The movie shows how much work goes into the preparation and planning required to make it. This aspect was surprisingly good.The main thing that holds your attention though is Ray Sharkey. I just saw it again on Encore. I knew Sharkey was good in the part but looking back now I can see he is very good. It almost seems that Bruce Willis copied Sharkey's style from this movie in several of his own. I could see Sharkey in the Die Hard movies. He brings so much energy to the part and is totally believable as wise guy with a quick temper.When I first saw this movie I thought Sharkey was going to have a great career. I don't know if it was the drugs a poor choice of parts or both but he really had talent and charisma. If he hadn't gotten hooked on drugs and contracted AIDS he could have been a Joe Pesci if not a Jr Robert DeNiro. If you think I am making this up get a copy of this movie and take a look. He did show flashes of what he could do in some television work but just couldn't keep it together for any length of time.If you have any interest in the pop music of the late fifties early sixties or just want to watch what a talented actor can do with a formula picture take a look at this.".

If you haven't seen it yet I advise you to check it out it's not hard to find anymore. It is available on DVD. The songs are catchy and catch the feel of the time period. The choreography by Denny Terrio is a bit dated but its still fun to watch. Also it was reported about 2 or 3 years ago Sean P. Diddy Combs was supposed to do a remake. It would of been interesting to see what would have become of it but I'm sure it wouldn't have topped the original. Haven't heard any updates about it though. ENJOY!!!".

He discovers a young sax player who has the right look and voice and recasts him as teen sensation Tommy D. Now Vinnie is riding high. Trouble is Tommy's a creep and Vinnie's hungry to prove he can do it again. Can he or will he lose everything he has trying?Success has no conscience Vincent says his father a rich man who abandoned him and his mother. Vinnie doesn't believe that though and unlike 99 of the agents and promoters you see in movies he actually tries to do right by his young stars and their fans. Sharkey challenges himself and us by essaying a character who's compelling for both his slickness and decency. His control freakiness may grate but he's hard not to like especially as Sharkey plays him with such electricity he comes through the screen.Sharkey won a Golden Globe and deserved an Oscar nomination at least for what should have been a breakthrough performance. Whether he's paying payola to a crooked DJ or saving Tommy D from an underage fling Sharkey does it with panache and charm. He lights a mean cigarette but lets us in with his eyes the windows as Vinnie calls them.Of course the irony of Vinnie is that unlike most agents he actually has more talent than his stars. He just doesn't have the right look and knows it so he must convince others to play the roles he creates. Maybe the film suffers a bit from the fact it's the thinlydisguised autobiography of Bob Marucci the reallife impresario who broke Fabian and Frankie Avalon. I'm sure Fabian and Frankie would have different takes on who made who but Sharkey's so consistently involving and engaging you don't care.In addition to Sharkey The Idolmaker is lifted by a killer soundtrack by Jeff Barry that is blended with some fantastic staging lighting and dancing. Like Poseidon3 noted in another review here the songs are hardly vintagesounding fed through a 1980 pop sensibility that utilizes more chord changes and orchestration than the teenidol songs of Fabian's day. That's actually a good thing especially as the score begins with the coy but catchy Here Is My Love and keeps getting better from there. It's a shame the songs never found a home on radio or they'd be remembered still. Yes The Idolmaker flopped in theaters in late 1980 but so did The Jazz Singer and Xanadu and they had hits. What kept out the brilliant Spectorized However Dark The Night with Peter Gallagher's terrific vocal performance? Gallagher's great on screen too as Vacarri's second project kind of doing Mick Jagger as lost choirboy and giving Vinnie his greatest star. If this film had come out just three years later when MTV was established Gallagher's looks alone would have sold the film.The plot is the film's weakness not bad but labored. There's a romantic subplot between Sharkey and Tovah Feldshuh that goes on too long as when she asks Where are you Vincent? I'm looking for the human being and I can't find him anywhere. Maybe if the film didn't stack the deck so heavily in Vacarri's favor those trite words might have a little more resonance instead of feeling tacked on to create the impression of moral ambiguity in Vinnie's character.Frankly Sharkey doesn't need the help. You watch him here and wonder why he didn't turn out to be one of the 1980s' biggest stars instead of a drug casualty lost to AIDS. Maybe he had too much passion to keep inside. But here for this one film he found the perfect channel to let it all out. The Idolmaker is a fitting monument that way as Sharkey centers an entertaining spectacle worth your time.".

I was in Hollywood in 1980 and on the telephone poles and on construction sites I saw this black and white poster of this guy  he looked like he was right out of the 50's and it asked the question Who is Caesare? Well I've gotta tell ya Hollywood in 1980 was very interesting. There were a lot of signs posters and billboards of folks you never heard of such as The Untouchables The Specials The GoGo's Motley Crue... and this was right along with them. So I thought  it's a retro50's punknew wave thing. The guy is kinda cute though. And went back to school on the east coast.When I finally came back to Los Angeles later in the 80's  I was watching Z Channel and ran into this film called The Idolmaker starring Ray Sharkey. I loved Ray Sharkey's work in Crime Story and Wiseguy and thought this would be a good film. Lo and behold I finally got to connect the posters I saw in Hollywood. It was The Idolmaker.This film isn't getting the recognition it deserves  it is quite wonderful. It is quite near the full telling of artist vs. manager how to be a pop star and how artist dumps manager once they become a star. While this is a parallel of a tale of Frankie Avalon and Fabian it could be just about anyone in the popular music field and the late Ray Sharkey gives the bravo performance of his life here.The one thing to note now about this film is the array of folks in it Peter Gallegher was toted as too pretty to be a serious actor from this film and that has haunted him ever since. But guess what? He was an actor here and the next film Summer Lovers and more TV work and movies after that to his fun performance as The King of Real Estate in American Beauty and on the teen drama The O.C. He has held his own despite what the critics had said. Post 'Brady Bunch' Maureen McCormack for example  and faces you know if not the names that go on to star or be associated with every excellent mob or crime film or series in the 80's 90's and today. This film was a first in many things  and a peek into the work of it's director Taylor Hackford who is very good at telling the devil in the details films.If you're interested in how managersagentsetc. fit in the pop industry here's a look at how it started  and how they are treated once their piece of coal becomes a diamond. And too sometimes how making an 'American Idol' goes to their head as well as they forget about the talent. Great film.".

	schema:reviewBody "On the heels of Grease which created a brief wave of '50's nostalgia but at the same basic time as Can't Stop the Music which was a glitzy ridiculous bust this unusual semimusical film made it's debut and sort of drifted into obscurity afterwards.  The story showcases the exploits of Sharkey a songwriter with drive and creativity to spare who desperately wants success in the music business but realizes that he doesn't have what it takes physically to make it.  He plucks a slightly more attractive kid Land out of a local band and forges him into a singing sensation planning each detail and exacting control over him.  Once Land is solidly in place Sharkey starts in with young Gallagher to repeat his success partially to prove himself to his own father.  Feldshuh is a teen magazine editor who finds herself caught up in the hoopla of these prefab idols and in Sharkey's enthusiasm.  The film has several things going for it not the least of which is Sharkey's terrific performance.  He is completely believable and compelling in the role his charisma taking the story a long way.  The always reliable Feldshuh who recently made a minor splash in Kissing Jessica Stein is saddled with a pretty demeaning role yet manages to get in a few decent moments.  There are several moderately recognizable faces in the cast who do nice jobs including a nearly unrecognizable Pantoliano. Land who showed promise in this film somehow completely petered out shortly after as did Pec who makes an impression as Sharkey's mobsterlike father.  Gallagher playing a 16yearold at 25! is also showcased to good effect despite the occasional silliness of the material and a lot of makeup.  What keeps the film from becoming fully satisfying is the limited period detail mostly just some cars a few poodle skirts and some fun knit tops and peg legged pants the predictability of the story a manager who creates stars and then loses them to their own ego is hardly a fresh concept! and the sometimes disjointed flow of the script ironically this is due mostly to the decision to present the numbers intact....many viewers will appreciate this but it leaves little room for characterization and connecting plot points.  Characters appear and disappear and have sudden changes of attitude.  However the film is not really deep enough to have allowed for a longer running time.  Also the numbers are more along the lines of the '80's than the early '60's.  This doesn't mean they aren't entertaining....just not accurate.  They are sort of early '60's song run through an early '80's filter.  Adding to the camp factor are McCormick trying to escape her Brady stigma as a tarty journalist and Merv Griffin's favorite dancer Terrio as the choreographer of the decidedly un'60's numbers.  Despite Sharkey's romance with Feldshuh there is a somewhat homoerotic feel to his obsession with the boys.  Sadly in real life Sharkey died of AIDS in 1993.  Director Hackford would later direct the blockbuster An Officer and a Gentleman which also dealt with life makeovers.".
