Unknown to the theater going public and despite being married for only six months that magic seems no longer to translate to their personal life where they are constantly arguing even under their breaths during onstage curtain calls. These arguments stem from the actress' moody behavior which the actor believes means that she no longer loves him and that she is looking for another man to replace him in her personal life. He believes she even scans the audience for potential suitors probably being most attracted to the soldier type. Their feuding is at a point where they take pot shots at each other about everything in their lives even the quality of the other's acting. The actor may have a valid point as the actress has been receiving bouquets of roses of late and a Russian guardsman has been seen hanging around outside their home. The actor knows these things as he is that Russian guardsman who is ...";

After all it is the only preserved sound performance in which they have starring roles. In reality however the film is not only historically important because of the legends in it it is one of the most fresh and funny films to emerge from the preCode period. The story is irresistible a vain acting couple constantly insult and tease one another. In order to test his wife's fidelity after a bout the Actor Lunt disguises himself as a foreign guardsman goes out of his way to meet his wife in disguise and furthermore goes on to try and seduce her. After he succeeds he reveals himself furious at her perfidious attitude. The Actress Fontaine begins laughing claiming that she knew all along. At first dubious the Actor is eventually convinced that his wife was playing along with him and the two romantically embrace. The Actress looks at the camera and gives the most priceless look letting the audience know that she may not have really known all along... Lunt and Fontanne make this film come to life. There dominating presence creates a satirical and realistic portrait of what an egomaniacal acting couple's life might really be like. In addition there are some priceless supporting roles Maude Ebourne as a sarcastic maid Zasu Pitts as a strange to say the least servant Roland Young and alwaysreliable Herman Bing as a creditor. Sidney Franklin perhaps the most unjustly forgotten of all screen directors his classics include Private Lives Smilin' Through The Good Earth The Barretts of Wimpole Street and The Dark Angel adroitly guides the ensemble allowing the acting to take centerstage but never neglecting the details so important to cinema. In all this short fastpaced romp with two bona fide legends of American stage history is an essential lesson in screen comedy and romance. Although the Lunts when asked to do later film work replied We can be bought but we can't be bored! there is absolutely no sign of unenthusiasm on screen here. Each earned an Oscar nomination for their performance in The Guardsman and they left their indelible stamp albeit only for a short eighty someodd minutes on American motion picture history.".

The Guardsman remains the only sound film that either Lunt or Fontanne ever did which is a damn shame. Both actors achieve a natural quality on screen rarely equaled in thirties films. Lunt especially gives a knockout comedic performance not only as the whining conceited jealous husband but also as the brash and passionate Guardsman. The rest of the cast play their parts perfectly as well doing justice to the delightfully witty script.

Years ago I read a joint biography of the Lunts and the two of them felt quite strongly that live performance was the only true test of acting ability. They also felt it was important to bring theater out to the hinterlands. Rather than be on a sound stage in Hollywood the Lunts made many road show tours of their Broadway hits and other plays in a tremendous amount of small theaters. The problem for posterity is that those who remember seeing the Lunts on stage are getting older and fewer.No doubt they took The Guardsman on the road after its 248 performance Broadway run in 192425. Given their aversion to film it's a wonder that Irving Thalberg got them at all for a film.This work has a play within a play in fact the inner play in this is Maxwell Anderson's The Private Lives Of Elizabeth And Essex. It opens with the Lunts doing the final scene from that work and to tumultuous applause as the curtain closes we find these two bickering incessantly as Alfred is almost insanely jealous of every attention his wife receives from admirers. What to do?So poor Alfred hatches a cockeyed scheme where with heavy makeup and costume he makes himself out to be a Russian Cossack guardsman who is quite willing to ignore marital conventions for the pleasures that Lynn can offer him. And he puts on a big campaign to win Lynn away from himself.Ferenc Molnar's play was remade by MGM ten years later in The Chocolate Soldier which was the operetta within the play as Nelson Eddy and Rise Stevens played the roles the Lunts originated. The prose of Maxwell Anderson is replaced by the songs of Oscar Strauss from his operetta The Chocolate Soldier. But Molnar's The Guardsman plot remains the same.The play was a tour de force for the Lunts and I don't think it was an accident that the Academy gave its only recognition of this film with Oscar nominations for Alfred and Lynne as Best Actor and Best Actress. It really is quite the personal vehicle.By the way Herman Bing has a small role as a creditor who is trying to get a bill paid from Alfred. In the end he really deflates the pretentious Lunt and you have to see how he does it.One of the other items there is a filmed record of is a Hallmark Hall of Fame production Yankee From Olympus that the Lunts did live for television in the Sixties.

	schema:reviewBody "This was not a great movie. It could have been a great movie but it was let down in two major ways. First off two of the three lead characters are awful. Blake Lively makes for good eye candy but she just isn't a good actress. She's not bad in smaller supporting roles like her part in The Town but she simply cannot carry a lead. Unfortunately the entire film basically revolves around her and she narrates so her shortcomings are brought front and center. Every time her voiceover came on I cringed. It really was not a good choice. Taylor Kitsch is no better. Again... good eye candy poor acting. Very poor acting. He just has no soul and brings absolutely nothing to his character whatsoever. He should be in a brainless Fast  Furious movie playing opposite Vin Diesel not an Oliver Stone drama. The second major failure of this film is even more serious and that is the story structure. We are never really given the opportunity to understand why the three lead characters Chon Ben and Ophelia have such strong feelings for each other. We're told that they do but never given any real reason to believe it. This is extremely important because literally the entire premise of the film hangs on their relationship. If you're going to build a dramatic story around an unorthodox three way relationship you had better explain in more than one quick scene exactly how this relationship happened otherwise the audience won't know why they should care about the characters. Especially when the actors portraying these characters aren't very good to begin with. I know that I kept asking myself why these two guys share a girl how they have absolutely zero jealousy why they never once thought of doublecrossing each other and why either of them care so deeply for her  to the point of being willing to risk their lives and commit horrible atrocities to save her. Where did all this love and loyalty come from? It was never adequately explained and the entire movie suffers tremendously for it.On a slightly more positive note the veteran actors did a fine job. Benicio Del Toro was wonderful as a psychotic cartel underboss John Travolta chewed the scenery to bits and Salma Hayek was entirely believable in her role as well. Unfortunately their competence only served to underscore the incompetence of the younger leads. It's telling that the best scene in the entire film was between Del Toro and Travolta with none of the three lead actors anywhere to be found and hinted at the promise this movie squandered. A lot of reviews took issue with the violence portrayed in the film but I didn't have a problem with that. You really can't make a movie about Mexican drug cartels without violence so I didn't feel it was gratuitous. Unfortunately however it also didn't make the movie any more believable from a plot perspective.Overall I just don't think this was a very good film. I don't think that Stone felt entirely comfortable with what he was doing here trying at times to be Tarantino but failing miserably. And likewise I think that if this film had been in the hands of Tarantino or Robert Rodriguez it likely would have come out much better perhaps even great.".

I guess John Travolta looked as though he was having fun? Which is more than I could say for the poor buggers who had to sit through this mess.Your two leads ladies and gentlemen are Aaron Johnson last seen being upstaged by a preteen girl and Taylor Kitsch who Hollywood keeps casting as the lead in blockbusters which then tank spectacularly at the box office. You know why that is Hollywood? It's because Taylor Kitsch has no charisma. None. The furniture was more interesting than he was and had more emotional range. Even he's better than Johnson a black hole of tedium from which nothing interesting can escape. These are two of the blandest leads I've ever seen and I've seen movies that starred rappers.But dear God in heaven they are much much better than Blake Lively. I haven't seen much else of her acting so I can only think she can do much better than this. But here she's playing a 30yearold ingnue a womanchild who knows Shakespeare but doesn't know what 'savages' means. She's meant to be sexy and alluring but she comes across as so boundlessly stupid that no man could seriously find her attractive. I don't think that's her fault but the nonudity clause that made the sex scenes in this movie so absurd? Yeah that was her fault.Even that isn't the worst. There's still... that voiceover. The narration that infests this whole movie but especially the early scenes is some of the worst writing I've ever heard. 'I had orgasms he had wargasms' is a phrase that will live with me until I die. And now even if you haven't seen the movie it'll haunt your nightmares too. You're welcome.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see 'Savages' today with a friend. The movie was truly a pathetic waste of celluloid and talent. The script seems to have been written with a crayon.Benicio del Toro and Selma Hayek are capable of much better than this dreck. Blake Lively was horribly weak and miscast as a poor little rich girl who is in love with two professional pot growers in California. The two guys live and share her with each other all like a big happy family. Ridiculous.The only thing even remotely reminiscent of Oliver Stone's finer works is the realistic graphic violence Platoon Natural Born Killers. Unfortunately the violence is ham handed and boring.SPOILERAt the very beginning of the movie the two protagonist potgrowingbuddies receive a video message warning from the South American cartel headed by Selma Hayek's character. The video is so shocking so disturbingly violent that how the main characters react to it is completely nonbelievable. Attached to the video is a place and time the cartel wants to meet the expert growing duo the next day to force them into a contract with the cartel.Any normal person receiving this video warning would disappearpack up and flea immediately. But no instead the guys chill out smoke pot and have sex until the next day as if their lives aren't in mortal danger...this is just one of the major weaknesses in the plot.Emile Hirsch is completely underused as a bicycling expert computer hacker who is capable of hacking into the credit card companies and international bank accounts of the cartel he would have been better cast as one of the two main male characters. John Travolta phones in a lackluster performance as a crooked DEA agent who just happens to have a wife dying from cancer. Whenever he brings her up we never see her he is always lighthearted and smiling he might as well be discussing his golf handicap...The ending seems to have been decided by committee. Seems like the studio couldn't figure out how the movie should end so they give us two endings the film literally rewinds and shows the second alternate ending....just pathetically bad. There were audible groans from the audience...The movie is 2 hours 15 minutes could have been trimmed by a half hour or more...The plot is a train wreck Oliver Stone said in a recent interview about the film that the book this is based on had 120 different scenes he trimmed that down to 30. He said he was more inspired by rather than actually trying for a faithful adaption. This is a real tragedy and the movie suffers for it. Mr. Stone basically was too lazy to get it right this movie could have been a classic like the PacinoDe Niro masterpiece Heat. This is too bad as the source book material for 'Savages' is highly regarded.Truly a bad poorly written movie. Stupid and logicdefying.I was excited to see this I was hoping for a Pulp FictionNatural Born Killers vibe that's what the preview falsely promises.This is Oliver Stone's low point he can only go up from here. Please don't waste your time energy or money on this bloated overlong waste of talent piece of crap. A true raspberry. Insulting to fans that have come to expect realistic and compelling films from Mr. Stone.There are lapses in logic within this film that are worse than cheap 'Friday the 13th' films things that no rational human being who values their safetylife would ever do. And this is inexcusable as this movie portends to be a serious and realistic tale. 'Lethal Weapon' is more plausible. So is 'The Dark Knight.' 'Savages' plays like a cheap secondtier comic book of a film. Putrid and sad.On a positive note my friend and I had a pretty entertaining discussion on the way home from the theater discussing the colossal absurdity of what we had just sat through...I wish I could say 'this movie was so bad it's good.' Unfortunately it's just plain BAD. Very disappointing.".

Please don't waste your time energy or money on this bloated overlong waste of talent piece of crap. A true raspberry. Insulting to fans that have come to expect realistic and compelling films from Mr. Stone.There are lapses in logic within this film that are worse than cheap 'Friday the 13th' films things that no rational human being who values their safetylife would ever do. And this is inexcusable as this movie portends to be a serious and realistic tale. 'Lethal Weapon' is more plausible. So is 'The Dark Knight.' 'Savages' plays like a cheap secondtier comic book of a film. Putrid and sad.On a positive note my friend and I had a pretty entertaining discussion on the way home from the theater discussing the colossal absurdity of what we had just sat through...I wish I could say 'this movie was so bad it's good.' Unfortunately it's just plain BAD. Very disappointing.";

	schema:reviewBody "Oliver Stone has a reputation of excellent film making Natural Born Killers Platoon but what I saw in the movie theater last night was easily one of the worst films I've ever seen in my entire life. First the characters are two dimensional. The two male leads are introduced as basically the tough guy and the sensitive guy. Their performances were mediocre at best. Taylor Klitsch was dry and brought nothing special to the role. The female lead O Blake Lively seems to have nothing particularly interesting about her and her voice narrating makes the sound of a root canal suddenly more appetizing. Stone wants the audience to view these three characters as heroes but I don't see it. The characters don't do anything significant they just grow weed smoke weed and have sex. Stone tries to get the audience on our side when he presents the benefits of marijuana but instead it comes across as 2030 minutes of legalize propaganda followed by 10 minutes of renewable energy information.Speaking of propaganda the political and social themes in this movie are about as subtle as prison rape. It seems that instead of making a film about a group of people who live an alternative lifestyle Stone has created a film about alternative lifestyles featuring some people. Blake Lively narrates a sort of montage of the marijuana industry where all the minor characters are young wealthy and attractive not to mention that marijuana is portrayed as a lifestyle dare I say religion. Was this movie supposed to be realistic at some point? I don't know if I should have been eating popcorn in the theater or weaving a hemp bracelet. AHHH but the trailer has guns! It features violence! Well... sort of.... just when you think the movie will redeem itself with some guns blazing action it simply doesn't deliver on this either. There are a few explosions that any highschooler with an M80 could pull off in their garage some CGI blood and the only good violent scene is so late in the movie that the audience doesn't react. I don't understand where these millions of dollars went because they weren't in this movie either Oliver Stone is a terrible film maker or an awesome crook. Terrible acting terrible action terrible script absolutely TERRIBLE. Save yourself the aggravation and skip this movie. I haven't been this upset with cinema since Bill Murray did Garfield. I feel so strongly about this film that I will never spend my money on another Oliver Stone movie ever again.".

Whether familiar or pet Mr. Stone plumbs the theme again in Savages. Unfortunately Savages glides into a land far far away from Platoon.The predominate feeling from Savages is it was about a Hollywood deal. Mr. Stone not only phoned in a cotelephoned script but the direction as well. His renowned editorial and textural format tricks fail to enhance the storytelling as in Natural Born Killers. Here they are plugged in to assuage any fears Savages might not be a Stone film. Casting adds to the feelofthedeal. Bluntly Ms. Lively would never exit a paper bag were she to depend upon her acting to do so. Kitsch and Johnson are directly behind her. Mr. Travolta chews the scenery like he's in a high school production supporting role. Ms Hayek at least turns in a good performance.Given the 24 Hour news cycle's coverage of the MexicanAmerican drug war it's difficult to dramatize an inherently insane subject. Little effort is needed to find chilling video of men hanging upside down like a side of beef being castrated with a dull knife. The corruption greasing the drug distribution wheels as they travel to El Norte is also common knowledge. That leaves the need for a personal story about these purveyors or at least a new slant save a female Cartel leader. All that is missing in the pulpy and broad Savages.On the Pulp early on it's clear the typically amazing Mr. Del Toro's performance is derived from Silent's mustachioed villains. Later he actually twirls his mustache. At this point there was an expectation NyahHaHa would pass his lips.The Savages cast and Mr. Stone recently sat for an interview on PBS' Charlie Rose. The usually garrulous Mr Stone said nary a word about this story which in case you're interested goes something like this a femaleled Cartel losing money sets out to swallow smaller players including one growing 'Primo'. The business is hightech and run by two high school buddies a tough physically and emotionally scarred ExSEAL Barnes who served in the Middle East and a granolaeating college boy Dual Major  Botany and Business who wants to save the world Elias. The woman they share is kidnapped when Butch and Sundance Ms. Lively actually refers to them as such paints herself as Etta Place and doesn't want to be around when they die insult the Cartel Queen. Ms. Lively differentiates them as one likes to fk the other makes love. And the ExSEAL has 'wargasms'????Guess the story's path and how many bodies fall.In a punk opening scene Ms. Lively's voiceover drives a flashback and leaves open her fate by story's end. This sets up an insulting gimmicky twist ending that's also punk and not to be spoiled. Throw your own Milk Duds at the screen.Among too few Savages saving grace is the Political subtext the leftleaning axegrinding Mr. Stone loves to incorporate. Anywhere along in Savages merely substitute the words Afghanistan or Iraq for Mexico. Here however Mr. Stone's political restraint works against Savages.The other small savior of this disappointing film is the universally held belief others are savages. A brutal killer a Mexican believes the Americans are savages because they share a woman. The Americans believe the Mexicans are savages because they decapitate people just because it's Tuesday. A closer look at the great cultural differences separated by a common border is also AWOL.Action fans may get their fix from Savages. There is sick brutality doubledealing and lots of bang bang. There just isn't enough glue in between to hold it together or give it some meaning. And that's the fault of the usually spotonrelevant Mr. Stone.Don't spend your bread. This dog will be on Netflix by September.".

Yes pot heads in High Schools everywhere just rejoiced It's a real thing! and the other one suffering from anger issues stemming from tours in Iraq takes care of the beating the crap out of people when necessary aspect. Oh yeah they also share a girlfriend. Awkward right? her name is O Lively. No really it is I swear. Anyways moving on because we have to these two guys have made some of the best pot known to man and have made millions from it. Still can't find their own girlfriend though just saying. Everything is going great as they take turns with their shared girlfriend still weird in their huge beach house when the Mexican drug cartel decides they want to be partners. This actually stands for We own you now and you know you like it. Ben and Chon don't really feel like being Dedecapitated so they decide to make a go of living in a jungle somewhere until Elena Hayeck the ruthless lady leader of the cartel has O kidnapped.So are you over the fact that our two heroes share a girl yet? OK good because I'm not either. This is one of those films that can only be enjoyed if you can let go of a few things. The whole film is narrated by O in her stoned and lazy version of her OMG you guys I am so high right now voice. She is a lot like her role in The Town only without the Boston accent. She is really annoying as a character and it's kind of hard to feel bad for her much less root for her. This is one of the things you have to let go of to enjoy the film. Ben and Chon worked well because they are the exact opposite to one another yet somehow have the respect for eachother to get along despite their constant different point of views. Kill everybody or run away. Ben was almost as annoying as O because he was always whining and psychoanalyzing everything. I found Chon to be my favorite of the three because he seemed to be the only one who just wanted to actually get things done and blow up some stuff while everyone else talked and talked some more.Villains make films though and despite the awkwardness and UNlikability of some of the lead roles the bad guys were sinister relentless and kind of funny at times. One interaction between Elena's ruthless right hand man Lado Del Toro and out for himself FBI agent Dennis Travolta in particular was tense and humorous at the same time. Travolta was surprisingly great in this film as he looked like his old self and I was pleased to see he had a larger part in the film than anticipated. Elena had a well written back story as well as the bad guys while certainly crude enough to hate were interesting enough to steal the flick. Savages UNintentionally gives us noone to root for and may even get on your nerves for a moment or two with its anything goes mentality. There is no doubt however that it has some great action sequences well written dialog minus a few horrendous lines by O's character strong acting by a strong cast and is an allaround wellmade film all the way up until it's absolutely dreadful crash and burn of an ending. I won't give anything away here but let's just say this ending is a problem. It felt as though the Director had a decent ending for a good film but wanted some attention so badly that he was willing to ruin his own movie to do so. You don't always have to be edgy and cute. Sometimes playing things straight up is what's best.".

	schema:reviewBody "In reading some of the very negative reviews posted here I sensed that some of those writers were more interested In Oliver Stone then the actual contents of the movie. I am not such a great fan of Oliver Stone and thought Wall Street 2 was not well done. Savages on the other hand was quite close to the book gritty and well done. If you have a problem with the portrayal of Seals or the realism of the scenarios then lay the blame on the book not Mr. Stone. Some of the scenes were certainly quite gory an increasingly common occurrence in many films these days. So if that turns you off then don't watch the movie.

	onyx:emotionText "In reading some of the very negative reviews posted here I sensed that some of those writers were more interested In Oliver Stone then the actual contents of the movie. I am not such a great fan of Oliver Stone and thought Wall Street 2 was not well done. Savages on the other hand was quite close to the book gritty and well done. If you have a problem with the portrayal of Seals or the realism of the scenarios then lay the blame on the book not Mr. Stone. Some of the scenes were certainly quite gory an increasingly common occurrence in many films these days. So if that turns you off then don't watch the movie.

Don't get me wrongits not that Taylor Kitch or Aaron Johnson aren't decent enoughboth play their roles with exactly the same kind of stiffness that i guess suit their characters' circumstance but neither really add anything beyond what the screenplay has already provided them.. like if this were made say 1015 years ago and you'd of had Steve Zhan and Ben Affleck in it i'm not saying it would've been batter but the two of them would've made you care for what might happen to the main characters a bit more i feel like. I'd rather not get into the lack of any kind of convincing emoting from Blake Lively here She's supposed to be afraid for her life hereand somehow its like she's barely miffedits as if instead of her life that's being threatened its her wifi connection. having read the book this was based onthe character O in the story was a lot more resourceful and a lot more crazy then Blake Lively ever suggests in the two hours of running timewould that they had cast literally anybody else in her partjust off the top of my head would Lauren Ambrose from six feet under have been considered too old??? would Krysten Ritter??? would Kirsten Bell?? hell Alexis Bidel might of been able to pull this off better and as much as i love Rory Gilmore emoting was never exactly her strong suit at least Blake Lively's narrating was OK...i just really wish they could've found someone who could have really put this movie over the top here. God again if this was made like 1015 years agoimagine what a younger Juliette Lewis or a younger Illeana Douglas could've done with this.That's really all i actually wanted to say cause everything else was fine enoughi was kind of expecting it to be more over the top if anything given that its Oliver St one's first crime film in a little while but its definitely over the top enough to satisfy anyone looking for an over the top crime movie. Its good enough that it overcomes the somewhat major obstacles in its path to keep you watching and keep you entertained but again with a little different castingthis could of been first rate.".

There are no real good guys in this movie unless you romanticize drug dealers. If you do then the movie to see is the 2001 movie Blow with Johnny Depp I've seen just about all the drug dealing based movies and few come close to it. Getting back to Savages I have to say that despite a not so original scenario the movie keeps the pace upbeat enough and has sufficiently interesting scenes to garner a slightly better than average rating by average I mean a 6. I watched it to the end and to be honest it was because Benicio Del Toro played a supporting role. For some reason I watch all the movies he plays in even if half have been a disappointment the good ones seem to make up for the bad ones. I have nothing much to say about Travolta anymore not until he starts acting he hasn't since Primary Colors though he's had a bunch of terrific parts that made him look good. In this movie you may realize that Aaron TaylorJohnson and Taylor Kitsch who play the two lead men are talented enough. I recommend it if have the time and watch an inordinate number of movies if you don't you can skip it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. I guess this qualifies as director Oliver Stone returning to his dark side. Based on Don Winslow's novel it certainly has the foundation to be a complex downanddirty twisted plot doublecrossing love triangle ultraviolent drugdealing smrgsbord. And while it possesses all of those elements it still manages to come across as some slick Michael Mann cable TV project.The film begins with narration from O Blake Lively who tells us that just because she is telling us this story doesn't mean she is alive at the end. Huh?? She also tells us that she is in love with two drugdealing buddies. Yes both of them. Chon Taylor Kitsch is the exSeal and muscle in the business. Ben Aaron Johnson is the gifted botanist who turns the Afghan seeds into the most potent pot in southern California. Oh and Ben is the ultimate philanthropist drug dealer. He builds schools in third world countries and invests in clean energy. After what felt like an eternity the narration finally ended and I could stop yelling Shut up O at the screen.One day the boys receive a video via email. It's an invitation to a business meeting with the Mexican Baja Drug cartel. Suffice to say that the video contained no balloons or party animals. It was more of a warning about what happens if you choose not to do business with us. The cartel front men are played by Demian Bichir fresh off A Better Life and Benecio Del Toro MIA since The Wolfman. The queen of the cartel is Elena played by Salma Hayak. Throw in a corrupt DEA agent playing both sides against each other portrayed by John Travolta and all the pieces are in place for real fireworks once O is kidnapped.The rest of the movie is pretty much the war you would expect with some poor negotiation skills tossed in for fun. Overacting is the word of the day especially from Travolta Ms. Hayak and Emile Hirsch money man. Still not sure what to make of Ms. Lively The Town. The camera certainly loves her but it's too early to tell if she has staying power as an actress. The only character that is really fun to watch is Lado played by Del Toro. He is truly a frightening guy who also happens to have a deceptive mind on how to take over from the weak.The whole good versus evil story line really only works if one side is good and one side is evil. If the good side Ben is a drugdealer in a love triangle with his best friend it's much more difficult to muster empathy. Otherwise when the mandatory hostagemoney exchanges occur we really aren't invested in the characters ... and the action takes center stage. That's the sign of a forgettable movie with no real heart.".

But then again I should have known from the first 10 minutes when you see some heads that were recently chopped off their bodies... A good action movie can be made without being extremely visual and disturbing... Unless the target of the movie is psychopaths and serial killers in that case they have to show such stuff to make their day...

	schema:reviewBody "I'm guessing this is a bit of a Marmite movie. Even though I hate Marmite I loved this movie. That is the wonder of Marmite! So we have a druggrowing likable threesome that falls afoul of a drug cartel and has to go on the offensive when things turn ugly.So things I took away from this movie which isn't terribly realistic.1. Getting involved in the drug business in any way shape or form is ultimately bad for you. Who knew? 2. Drug cartels are brutal and violent. Cops can be corrupt. Again who knew.3. Love conquers all. Pretty obvious that one.So having been muscled in on by the cartel our threesome decides to get out and skip town. But the nasty druglords want their prize in this case a special type of pot grown by one of the guys. So they kidnap the shared girlfriend and hold the guys to ransom over their secrets.Savages is terribly violent and not for the squeamish. It also glamorises the drug trade somewhat though see point 1. above. There is also the threeway relationship between the two men and their shared lady which some people who only think in black and white obviously seem to find almost as objectionable as the drugs and violence.I won't argue for a minute that drugs are good or that violence is always necessary in a movie. But here it does work rather well. There is some confusion on the movie's part as to whether it wants to be deadly serious or somewhat tongueincheek. You can be faced with nasty hideous violence one moment and then you are laughing at the next scene. In short it's a little bit Jekyll and Hyde. This can be a little bit unsettling I grant you. It would have been better if they had stuck to one tonal level.Right the threesome. Putting aside the various level of acting ability what's wrong with that? Nothing. Someone said that O the female of the triplet was a slut and couldn't decide who she loved. Black and white thinking sorry. It is perfectly possible for one person to love two people and no they don't actually have to be emotionally damaged to do it. I'll grant you that the dynamic and setup of this trio needed more explanation but it was fairly well covered in the scenes they did give us. But I'll help out the emotionally hardofunderstanding with the following simple summation The guys both loved O so much that they would rather share her than forcing her to make a choice that could ruin their friendships because let's face it if you are in that situation and forced to make a choice you'll O choose neither because it wouldn't be fair to choose one over the other and go your separate ways probably leading to the collapse of the guys friendship as well they'll blame each other. In short the relationship as it is is a stable one.Phew! Right! Back to the characters! Well the two guys are chalk and cheese. Most of the character development there is some is focused on Ben's character. He's the peaceloving one that goes down a bit of a dark path on the journey to rescue O from the drug lords. As portrayed both Chon and O I have no idea why I keep putting her name in quotes are damaged individuals who rely on Ben to keep them grounded even though they are more often than not high. Ben's journey damages them because they have to witness it and don't much like being reminded of their own faults which Ben mirrors towards the end.It's a pretty brutal film overall and not for everyone. I actually enjoyed it considerably because it was different from the usual Hollywood pap. I don't think it was one of Stone's best movies but top marks to the guy for continuing to take on difficult matriel.The ending is best described as MarmitewithinMarmite. Look what happened! Oh no! Wait that wasn't it at all! But it does at least allow you to blank out one or the other in your head in order to satisfy your particular needs as regards an ending.I'll also point out that the threesome is a key ingredient in both endings and that neither ending is particularly satisfying to the viewer making the point that things don't all work out for the best even if characters live.SUMMATION Dark and brutal and not for everyone's tastes. But it is a little different and that is what makes it enjoyable.TOP TIP Not really a date movie. Do not take your girlfriend and her hot sister to see it thinking you might all end up in bed together. It won't end well.".

But it does at least allow you to blank out one or the other in your head in order to satisfy your particular needs as regards an ending.I'll also point out that the threesome is a key ingredient in both endings and that neither ending is particularly satisfying to the viewer making the point that things don't all work out for the best even if characters live.SUMMATION Dark and brutal and not for everyone's tastes. But it is a little different and that is what makes it enjoyable.TOP TIP Not really a date movie. Do not take your girlfriend and her hot sister to see it thinking you might all end up in bed together. It won't end well.";

	schema:headline " A violent crime thriller that manages to entertain despite its flaws.";
	schema:reviewBody "I got a kick out of reading the popular Hated It reviews about Savages. It's all very funny. It's the same with some other films that Oliver Stone made in recent years. But is Savages really that bad? In my opinion it's not that bad. It's a fine film actually. But its flaws can be irritating. When I began watching the film I wondered if I turned on a dirty movie. But no. That was just Chon Taylor Kitsch and Ophelia Blake Lively having their special time. Maybe it's not that special because later Ophelia has the same time with Ben Aaron TaylorJohnson. I hope Stone included these scenes just to show that these three are very close. Fine. A little later though viewers are treated to what passes as a commercial promoting the use of marijuana. Fine. The three lead actors show little range throughout the film. But I didn't think that this was a problem because it keeps the film entertaining instead of too dramatic. It's entertaining but it's not easy to watch sometimes. It's a simplified glossy watereddown and often violent representation of the War on Drugs and Mexican drug dealing. The Mexican Drug War is still ongoing and several dozen thousand people have been killed because of it. For anyone who doesn't know I'll mention that the war is just a result of America's economic policies. Socalled free trade drove millions of Mexicans out of work and into poverty and crime. On the other side of the world in Afghanistan the Americans and the British have deliberately increased opium production for export to neighboring countries especially to Russia. Genocide as a result of drug use and drug trafficking is an old British trick that goes back centuries. It's an interesting topic but I don't pay much attention to it. Savages is kind of a peek inside though it doesn't get into the seriousness of the issue. Even if Kitsch Johnson and Lively aren't sympathetic leads the film still has memorable performances from Salma Hayek Benicio del Toro and John Travolta. The screenplay by Shane Salerno Don Winslow and Stone can be considered a cheat. It doesn't just raise a question mark at the very beginning of the film which I didn't like. It also tarnishes the ending. I would have just preferred the upbeat version without the downbeat version. But like I mentioned it's an entertaining film that does have something to say. Its running time is a little over two hours however the time goes by fast. For me Savages turned out to be an engaging film. Dan Mindel's appealing cinematography is a benefit too. I didn't think that I'd like it when I saw the trailer but it's a welldirected crime thriller. I recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love movies and watch them with an open mind remembering that this is somebody's art. Even the most open of minds can't make sense of this film and it was just torture to watch for several reasons. First that narration by Blake Lively was flat and poorly written making it a constant annoyance throughout the film and making her seem replaceable. So why would we care if she is killed by some drug lord? We were hoping for the relief. Second there was the absence of a back story that would explain to any intelligent and modern audience why these two handsome rich guys would waste their time on some average looking obviously nonmonogamous space cadet much less share her sexually much less trust her with all their confidences much less be in LOVE with her. What was there to love about that character other than her readily accessible vagina? Third dear dear Mr. Stone if you want to make the audience fear for the delicate kidnapped flower's life by showing us gore scene after gore scene of torture death and bloodsmear everywhere why then would you create a character like O I think the two guys were just too disinterested to remember her entire name who after being kidnapped and roughed up would DEMAND to talk to someone to have better food to have a better room from her psycho kidnappers? Lively's character just came off as a shallow annoying whore. Could this have been worse? Oh but wait it does get worse. Aaron TaylorJohnson who is arguably one of the best young actors today is wasted as the laid back guy while Taylor Kitsch is once again typecast as the heavy. And how many exSEAL's are likely to support such an unpatriotic and illegal business when they can make so much legal money as stunt men consultants or action figures? Then out of nowhere we see Emile Hirsch cast in some nominal role he made the best of but again was totally wasted in and frankly I wish they had cast him in one of the lead roles because it would've been a much better movie. Benecio Del Toro has now been typecast as the psycho more than once but at least he didn't mutter or turn into a werewolf. John Travolta was good as the corrupt DEA agent. Salma Hayek was good as the conflicted ruthless widowcumcartelqueenandlovingmother role but the woman had a lot of hats to wear in that one character as if the director couldn't decide if she was a heroine or a villain in his very disconnected film. Lastly I'd like to say I wish Taylor Kitsch would be given permission to act because from what I've seen of him in his other films he's more than eyecandy and without good direction it seems like he is being limited in range not to mention being written into a character that has little credibility. I'd have been impressed if we had been given an explanation of his name Chon. Is that an acronym for Confused Handsome Orphaned Narcissist? There is no chemistry between him and O whatsoever and typically the type of man who would qualify to become a SEAL is not a man who would risk rotting away in federal prison for money made by illegal means and is definitely not the type of guy that would be best friends with the type of guy played by Aaron TaylorJohnson or the kind of man who would entrust his heart to a promiscuous surfershoppingmallrat. So Mr. Stone a little explaining about how these 3 were so irreversibly committed to each other in such a new age kind of noboundariesfreelovekeepOpamperedway so as to be willing to DIE for each other would have been a favor to the audience as well as possibly connecting some facts leading to an actual plot a lot more credibly. Where is the story? Do your job. And fire the continuity and editing departments. You're no Guy Ritchie that's for sure. And people only like Quentin Tarantino because he likes to outweird himself with every movie but even gore and torn bodies can get boring if there is no point to the splatter. You had an opportunity to make a love story gone wrong. You first have to convince us that there IS love. What bonds these two men with this vapid and shallow woman? What we DO see is the love between a boy and his bong between a boy and a posse of smart employees between a boy and his local DEA agent between a boy and his money and between a boy and his wargasms. Whoever wrote that line should be shot. Whoever made Lively utter that line should be retired from directing.".

	schema:headline " Poorly written and Directed. Good actors can't salvage savages.";
	schema:reviewBody "The story of this one is fairly decent. Two marijuana growers from SoCal Chon Taylor Kitsch a former Navy seal and Ben Aaron Johnson a SoCal Buddhist hippie get a deal from a Mexican drug cartel run by Elena Salma Hayek that they agree to but decide to escape the country and disappear. Elena has their shared girlfriend dumb blonde California girl Ophelia Blake Lively who goes by the equally stupid name O. In order to get her back they must jump through some hoops and agree to terms. The guys decide that they will take things into their own hands and savage violence ensues.The Good The story is interesting and solid at least from a reading it stand point although it's a tough sale for me living in Southern California that with our liberal medical marijuana laws that anyone smart growing to sell at collectives would actually get involved in this crap. Salma Hayek is a solid star in this one and is really the only one to give a solid performance. The visuals of the beach and a somewhat decadent lifestyle are definitely a good distraction. Blake Lively is a beautiful girl. Yes she is in this movie but her character is so dumb that she really loses her attractiveness and I don't mean in a bubbly blonde way.The Bad The writing and directing is horrible truly bad. I at first just thought the acting was horrible but given the complete cast I soon realized that as not good as the acting was the only blame should fall on Oliver Stone himself. First this movie didn't seem to ever find any kind of coherent style. At times it looks and sounds like it is trying to copy a sort of Quinten Tarantino like violent and crude movie with some humor but that fell completely flat. At other times it promised to become a more action packed thriller but that too was just a tease.Also having Blake Lively narrate this movie was an epic fail. Combined with the bad writing it comes off as a pretty stupid girl telling a fourth grade story with the intelligence of a potato and the vocabulary to match. Her voice is just not voiceover worthy. Just take one line from this movie I had orgasms he had wargasms. yeah was about the depth of thought involved in this movie.I must also interject that Mr.Stone has probably never met a Navy Seal in his life. OK maybe Jessie Ventura. His character that is suppose to be an exSeal comes off as a adolescent teenage thug who couldn't find his way out of a paper bag.In the end I think Oliver Stone has been to wrapped up in his lovefests with Cuban and South American Dictators and maybe smoking too much marijuana to actually put out a decent smart movie. Watching this one kind of made me feel sad for Mr.Stone and miss the days when he put out good movies like Natural Born Killers. 1994 I truly was hoping for a great movie when I saw the previews for this one but I was definitely disappointed. It kind of reminded me of that movie Redline 2007 remember that one? Yeah. Nobody else does either.So for really bad writing directing not having any kind of coherent style and not quite fulfilling its action and savagery that it promised the best I can give this one is a 5 out of 10 and that may truly be kind and is out of respect to Salma Hayek who shouldered this movie pretty much on her own although Del Toro had a few tiny moments.Like my review? Hate em? Comments questions or want a DVD reviewed before you waste your time? Email me at  subliminal.lithiumgmail.com".

	onyx:emotionText "The story of this one is fairly decent. Two marijuana growers from SoCal Chon Taylor Kitsch a former Navy seal and Ben Aaron Johnson a SoCal Buddhist hippie get a deal from a Mexican drug cartel run by Elena Salma Hayek that they agree to but decide to escape the country and disappear. Elena has their shared girlfriend dumb blonde California girl Ophelia Blake Lively who goes by the equally stupid name O. In order to get her back they must jump through some hoops and agree to terms. The guys decide that they will take things into their own hands and savage violence ensues.The Good The story is interesting and solid at least from a reading it stand point although it's a tough sale for me living in Southern California that with our liberal medical marijuana laws that anyone smart growing to sell at collectives would actually get involved in this crap. Salma Hayek is a solid star in this one and is really the only one to give a solid performance. The visuals of the beach and a somewhat decadent lifestyle are definitely a good distraction. Blake Lively is a beautiful girl. Yes she is in this movie but her character is so dumb that she really loses her attractiveness and I don't mean in a bubbly blonde way.The Bad The writing and directing is horrible truly bad. I at first just thought the acting was horrible but given the complete cast I soon realized that as not good as the acting was the only blame should fall on Oliver Stone himself. First this movie didn't seem to ever find any kind of coherent style. At times it looks and sounds like it is trying to copy a sort of Quinten Tarantino like violent and crude movie with some humor but that fell completely flat. At other times it promised to become a more action packed thriller but that too was just a tease.Also having Blake Lively narrate this movie was an epic fail. Combined with the bad writing it comes off as a pretty stupid girl telling a fourth grade story with the intelligence of a potato and the vocabulary to match. Her voice is just not voiceover worthy. Just take one line from this movie I had orgasms he had wargasms. yeah was about the depth of thought involved in this movie.I must also interject that Mr.Stone has probably never met a Navy Seal in his life. OK maybe Jessie Ventura. His character that is suppose to be an exSeal comes off as a adolescent teenage thug who couldn't find his way out of a paper bag.In the end I think Oliver Stone has been to wrapped up in his lovefests with Cuban and South American Dictators and maybe smoking too much marijuana to actually put out a decent smart movie. Watching this one kind of made me feel sad for Mr.Stone and miss the days when he put out good movies like Natural Born Killers. 1994 I truly was hoping for a great movie when I saw the previews for this one but I was definitely disappointed. It kind of reminded me of that movie Redline 2007 remember that one? Yeah. Nobody else does either.So for really bad writing directing not having any kind of coherent style and not quite fulfilling its action and savagery that it promised the best I can give this one is a 5 out of 10 and that may truly be kind and is out of respect to Salma Hayek who shouldered this movie pretty much on her own although Del Toro had a few tiny moments.Like my review?

From the beginning you get great character knowledge and some back story as to where things are going in the story. The plot line is just amazing! I loved the whole inside look at legal marijuana in California as well as the Mexican cartel portion. Some parts of this movie were absolutely terrifying! And some were quite heart warming.. Overall it was just a great mix that really kept me entertained the entire way through! I've always been an Oliver Stone junky and he really nailed this one to the wall. I created an account just because I looked up this movie and saw that it's rating was under a 7! The problem with IMDb is right here people writing their opinions unknowingly persuading someone else to not go out and see an awesome movie. People  if you haven't seen this it is definitely worth your time and money at the very least you will be entertained. With all of the new movies coming out and worthless remakes appearing everywhere this movie restored some of my faith in Hollywood. Lastly I thought the cast was brilliant! Really liked John Travolta and Benicio Del Toro's rolls in this! Please don't let the bad reviews fool you this movie is fantastic and a MUSTSEE!".

This is a Hayek we have not seen before  so gritty and dirty yet so beautiful and elegant. And who is Hayek's backup  the dirtier than ever Benicio del Toro  in a magnificent performance.

Drama in every scene nothing is predictable a statement from Stone on living in Southern California which could be anywhere in this day and age.

This is a competently scripted and wellmade Western effort but the story is too routine and forgettable to be counted among the best in its kind.

When she mentions the goldmine she immediately finds a handful of man willing to join her. Among them are a banished confederate soldier a bloodthirsty priest and a several random gunslingers with an unhealthy interest in money and power. Find a Place to Die contains all the basic plotingredients of a solid spaghettiwestern but it's incredibly slowpaced and even the gunfights appear to be tedious. Especially the entire middlesection is painfully soporific and only contains sappy dialogs and redundant sub plot. The final gunfight is pretty cool and lasts exceptionally long but I think something went wrong with the editing as the showdown between the heroic Joe Collins and the traitorous main villain happens offscreen. The filming locations are convincing and atmospheric and the acting performances are adequate. The music isn't very impressive and someone should have paid more attention to the continuity.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was not sure at first but I hate this movie. It looks like it was a drag and even the music sounds forced. Everyone looks sweaty hot and like their costumes don't fit them very well. Jeffery Hunter appears OLD fat and tired. He looks as desperate and at the end of his rope as his character was supposed to be but I don't think it's an act. For one or two scenes the film sort of springs into motion and it has some nice use of location and architecture the shot of that large squarish building in the background of a couple of scenes is impressive.But the film does not have the spunky cartoonish zest of a traditional Giuliano Carmineo film. I've acquired it as a widescreen print that Diamond Ent. appropriated from VCI when their DVD went Out of Print. It looks as though VCI's people attempted a digital enhancement to recolor an old intact but color rotted print and the result is this bizarre palette shift in places where everyone's face is beet red rocks are orange and the skies are green. It has a Cowboy Movie mentality where guys pop up from behind rocks squeeze off a shot duck pop back up then pretend to be shot by throwing their arms up in the air and dramatically spinning around before flopping on the ground. Yawn.The frame compositions are interesting the female leads are attractive and I like the ambiguous character who turns out to be the villain at the end. But I don't know. Jeff Hunter keeps getting his ass kicked and doesn't really have any specialized skills that I can see which would set him apart from just another lout with a Winchester and an ax to grind. He looks uncomfortable in the role either like he felt that the material was beneath him or his pants were too tight. And don't get me started on that shirt he is wearing Were they trying to make him look washed up  about to die of some horrible terminal disease? He sort of waddles around rather than sauntering like a Clint Gianni Garko or even a John Phillip Law. Perhaps that is the point  To humanize the Gringo ala MINNESOTA CLAY rather than having a cartoon character like Eastwood's Joe or Garko's Sartana.The problem is that like Sergio Corbucci's MINNESOTA CLAY the movie simply SUCKS. It's a slog I've watched it three times in vain attempts to find something about the film that I genuinely enjoy and all I get is that big square building in the background of a couple shots. It is an intriguing structure that looks so huge I wonder what it was really built for where it is and if it's still standing today. Gives you something better to think about than the movie anyway and Carmineo cleaned up his routine by the time he inherited the Sartana legacy and made some wonderful films right through 1988's RATMAN. He had a nice comic book touch and his movies are usually more interesting  fun than they had to be.But this isn't one of them and whatever camp fun factor is to be had by watching a former Captain of the USS Enterprise in a Pasghetti Western is quickly blown clear by the first sight of Jeff Hunter in his little shirt there pot belly pushing at the fabric and sweat popping out on his face with effort from being constrained by such tight pants. Just awful.".

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 196869 but not in the USA until 1971 Find a Place to Die is a Spaghetti Western starring Jeffrey Hunter as a dishonored exofficer drinking his woes away in Mexico when a beautiful woman Pascale Petit hires him and several others to save her husband and their gold mine claim from a band of local bandits. Daniela Giordano is on hand as the beautiful Juanita at the cantina. The plot is obviously borrowed or more accurately ripped off from 1954's Garden of Evil and combines it with a pensive Spaghetti Western flavor lacking the goofiness and moral hollowness of say 1966's The Good the Bad and the Ugly. The melancholy is heightened by a moving song Juanita sings at the cantina in the first act the tune is reminiscent of Jerry Goldsmith's excellent acoustic piece for 1970's Rio Lobo. Too bad Giordano as Juanita didn't have a bigger role but it's big enough.There are several other things that propel Find a Place to Die above most Italo oaters The group Lisa Petit compiles consists of a few interesting people including an excon turned minister who seems to be sincere but is dubious at the same time. Secondly their ordeal becomes almost a survival situation and I favor survival flicks. Thirdly the story arc of the disgraced exConfederate Hunter is almost inspiring. Lisa says she's naturally drawn to him because she knows he's not like the other worthless cutthroats. The warmth of love slowly wakens the laconic loner out of his brooding stupor and draws the best in him out. Love is power and when you find it you need to plug into it if you want to live. Only a fool rejects it or worse abuses it. Lastly being shot in Italy at some kind of ancient ruins particularly the notable building of the cantina the movie has a unique look for a Pasta Western which of course were typically shot in Spain. The movie is lean at 89 minutes. GRADE B".

It's ably made but never strikes up any sort of momentum or much in way of excitement from its wellworn staples. More often it came across as tepid sluggish and overly drawnout. The gunfights became dull in their robotic actions brawls were nothing but venomless and the characters didn't make much of an impression with a very nonthreatening villain. Not a good sign. Even the camerawork lacked that adventurous aspect except for maybe one or two frames and the spotty music score bellows out the cues. Some passages worked when going for something with a sensually relax tone but when its trying to arouse it never works. Sound FX literally seems to cop a real pounding. Location choices hold an atmospheric edge and creates a dusty and gritty visualization that suit's the film's ugly greedy outlook within the story's progression. Even on that point it does seem to be missing out on the bloodlust which the untapped premise doesn't seem to break out or even capitalize on. The woodenly blankridden script adds little and keeps things by the book. The film might have had limp characterisations but the performances aren't bad. Jeffery Hunter basically sweats it out and grits his teeth in a washedup lead part. Adolfo Lastretti's gunslinging priest could've made for an interesting character but falls in the shadows. However the beautiful women are the highlights. The stunning Pascale Petit does a fine job and Daniela Giordano gives her role plenty of kick. Not complete dreck but a very soso spaghetti western that will hardly leave an imprint.".

A married pioneer couple who have struck gold in their mining endeavors is attacked by bandits. When the husband is pinned under a wagon the wife Petit must ride for help to a nearby settlement. Oddly though Petit will be gone for roughly four days the husband only asks for a gun and a jug of whiskey to sustain him!

After a scuffle and for a fee Hunter and a few other men agree to go back to rescue Petit's husband even though the territory is teeming with bandits. Along the way naturally one of the men makes a play for Petit while she's bathing. It all comes to a head in an abandoned apparently real ruin before settling on a moderately happy ending. Hunter a gifted and handsome actor is slumming here. He has the distinction of missing out on two of the most beloved and iconic TV shows of the 1960's. He starred in the pilot for Star Trek but his wife at the time made him demand a salary that took him out of the running for the series. She preferred to be married to a movie star versus a TV star even if the movies were like this one?? He was later denied the chance to play Mike Brady on The Brady Bunch because the producers didn't believe an architect would be that handsome! So he wound up in some really subpar features until an accident led to his eventual death. He is okay here his glorious eyes still sparkling but the film gives him little or nothing to work with. Petit an actress with an extensive foreign resume is adequate but poorly dubbed. Her brief seminude scene is tame by today's standards. Lastretti has his screen debut heralded in the credits though he provides no particular interest as a reverend of questionable virtue. He did go on to a dozen or so years of film work however. It's one of dozens and dozens of spaghetti westerns and has very little of distinction to recommend it save some occasionally interesting settings. The familiar and grating type of music score is quite distracting at times.".

It is however graced by the presence of former Miss Italy Daniela Giordano who appeared in a few interesting movies most notably Mario Bava's fun sex comedy Four Times That Night. But she isn't really in this one enough although she does feature in perhaps the most memorable scene in the film where she sings a song while strumming a guitar.

One item I thought very interesting was the lack of mention regarding the large Canadian contribution to this theater. I would have to guess it was not considered appropriate for the home audience in the US at the time. Considering the minor theater the Aleutins seemed to be view as it is a great tribute to this campaign. I found the scenes of vastness of the area amazing. The views of old aircraft in action would be of great interest to aviation fans. For most people I'm sure this is film will be the only views of the Aleutian Islands most people will ever see! Certainly require viewing for any WWll buff!".

	schema:reviewBody "Report from the Aleutians 1943 out of 4 John Huston directed and narrates this Academy Award winning documentary that takes a look at the American troops who went up to protect Alaska during WWII so that it wouldn't be open to attack from the Japanese. Frank Capra William Wyler John Ford and many other legendary directors made these documentaries during WWII but of all I've seen and I've seen most it was Huston who really delivered something different. He made a handful of these documentaries and they were all quite different from others and I'd say that if you know his reputation then you'd understand why. Huston was always known for being a man's man as he loved to fight drink have a good time and live adventure. His documentaries were so different from the others because he seemed to focus in on things that the others wouldn't dare do. Apparently the U.S. government objected to some of the stuff he shot here but the director stood by his guns and these scenes are actually the most entertaining in the movie. These scenes involved showing what the soldiers were doing when not on actual duty. This includes them shaving cleaning their pots and pans and just wrestling around in front of the camera. It's really these scenes here that give you a great idea of what it was like out in the field and we get to see things that other directors often didn't show. Most of the time it was just about rules bravery and the actual combat footage but Huston goes an extra mile and gives you a complete idea of the scene. Most of the action comes at the very end as we see some combat missions with the B17s.".

Good performances especially from the two leads who have the right chemistry for this action comedy.

Once upon again Damien Cyril Raffaelli and Leito David Belle  the originator of Le Parkour are reunited upon to avoid a bombing on destroying the blocks at the heart of District 13 and save the city .

Meanwhile a group of teenagers film the action of dirty agents leaded by Roland PierreMarie Mosconi from the security agency executing policemen in their car and then leaving the car with the corpses in the 13th District to blame the gangs and begin a civil war. Behind these events the corrupt chief of the security agency Walter Gassman Daniel Duval had received a huge amount as kickback from the constructor Harriburton that has interest to construct buildings in the poor area and uses the situation to force the President of France Philippe Torreton to authorize to nuke five towers in the district. The teenager with the film is hunted by the police but he delivers the memory card to Leito David Belle meanwhile Damien calls him from the precinct asking for help. The friends teamup with five dangerous bosses to gather evidences to prove to the president that Gassman has provoked the conflict in their district. Banlieue 13  Ultimatum is a great sequel of the awesome 2004 Banlieue 13. The story has nonstop action scenes very well choreographed and an excellent screenplay the performances of Cyril Raffaelli and David Belle with the Parkour are again very impressive. Unfortunately I found the conclusion disappointing and pointless and it seems to contradict the objective of the dwellers of the 13th District that meet the president to avoid him from blowing up their homes. How could they be so naive to believe in the word of a politician that was under pressure? Therefore in the end the winner is Harriburton! My vote is eight.Title Brazil B13 U  13o Distrito  Ultimato B13 U  13th District  Ultimatum".

Fans looking for more of the amazing David Belle and the stunts of parkour will find these elements lacking in the sequel. B13 had a simple plot and explosive action sequences that still hold up well today. New director this time around and the crisp compositions and editing of the original are replaced with more uses of the handheld cam to less successful results. If you liked the opening camerawork in B13  you get a lot more of it here as the camera swooshes around the blocks of District 13 introducing the major players in the film. Fortunatly the chemistry of Belle and Raffaelli is still strong but they just don't have enough to do together in this plot. Speaking of plot I would dare say that this sequel has too much plot and side characters. Belle seems like a supporting player in his own film. Now to be fair there are a couple of good sequences that spark the original vibe of B13 but sadly they are few and far between. I had high hopes going into this one but was let down overall. Let's hope that for the third film come on there has to be one that both Belle and Raffaelli are given the room to really top and go beyond what we've seen them do before.".

Now the story is a little continued from the first but very weak compared to the first. But they did add a lot of colorful characters in this one that I enjoyed. They all had their personal fighting style or action. The music in this film was pretty nice and worked well with the action. Now back to the story of the film. It is the same basic background like the first but with a different bad guy. I guess you could say is it is pretty uneventful. All you really wait for is Belle or Raffaelli to do something cool.

Neither film has much of a plot and in the sequel the story is similar to the first installment.

No one in their right mind would want to live in this place and if you did you'd need advanced skills in martial arts and some high caliber weapons to survive from one day to the next. In both films crooked police elements are out to destroy criminal gangs in the city to increase their control and are willing to sacrifice innocent people to accomplish these ends.

Nonetheless as if to balance this Raffaelli at least gets to show off far more of his incredible fighting skills in some truly amazing sequences the like which are so seldom seen outside of Hong Kong cinema. It would have been really nice to see a few more appearances from members of the original cast the hulking K2 and Leito's incredibly sexy sister would have been most welcome! but it was not to be sadly.

It would have been really nice to see a few more appearances from members of the original cast the hulking K2 and Leito's incredibly sexy sister would have been most welcome! but it was not to be sadly. Still as said previously the film stands well in its own right.....just try to overlook the somewhat sappy ending though.";

Even so there were enough really good stunts to keep me watching for an hour and a half including a great bit where a car drives through a high rise building. The free running is not as seamless as the original and there's some choppy editing to create the illusion of stunts rather than actually pulling them off but this certainly isn't as bad of a sequel to a cult action flick as Ong Bak 3 was.

	schema:reviewBody "For those of us who unfortunately have not seen the original BANLIEUE 13  aka DISTRICT 13  made in 2004 with the same crew except for the director  Pierre Morel some of the background information that usually follows in a sequel is missing and according to many the sequel here BANLIEUE 13ULTIMATUM  aka DISTRICT 13 ULTIMATUM is not as strong a film. And perhaps that allows the viewer to appreciate fine French film making without the comparison! Luc Besson of the Trasnporter series et al wrote this script or rather this plan of choreography as there is not a lot of spoken dialogue in this fastpaced thriller and Patrick Allessandrin directs a story of a region of Paris District 13 that is cordoned off the rest of Paris by a group of five warlords who manage to control the drug ridden violent region. Basically the tale is that of two men  Captain Damien Tomaso Cyril Raffaelli and undercover cop of the 'good' police and Leto David Belle an exthug who in the previous film infiltrated a gang in order to defuse a neutron bomb. That was supposedly in 2010. The film opens some years later when District 13 is now in control of power over the government and the 'bad police' are attempting to destroy the area and rebuild according to their greedy plans. The action is the story and the action is immensely exciting! David Belle invented a discipline known as Parkour which consists of moving quickly and efficiently in any environment using only the abilities of the human body and though his acting credits are minimal he is stupefying in his live action role. Belle and Raffaelli are the reasons to watch this thriller as their screen chemistry is magnetic. Other standout performances in the film include the much tattooed Elodie Yung as Tao the principal gang queen Philippe Torreton as the much oppressed President and the evil appearing Daniel Duval as the nemesis who turns the keys of the plot. The cinematography is superb the musical score is French rap music that while it suits the mood of the film becomes irritating in its repetitiveness. In all this is an escape film that is high on excitement is not very high on intelligent dialogue. But put Bell and Raffaelli together and the combustion is authentically credible. Grady Harp".

See our villain wants to convince the President to do a missile strike on the impoverished and gang ridden District 13 no Prawns here guys so that his company Harriburton reallllll subtle there Besson can get the contracts to rebuild the place from scratch.Wow what a bummer. Words can't even describe how unmotivated this sequel is. Besson takes sole credit for the screenplay and I'm sure he might still have it written on his palm. The sliver of plot is basically a retread of the first film making this his ESCAPE FROM LA complete with the same ending to the first film's ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK. We know it is the future because everyone has tattoos on their faces and everyone has a gun even little kids! Besson is annoyingly still continuing his cinematic quest for French street cred with Parisians from laughable ethnic gangs taking it all the way to the President. We are one thumps chest The biggest disappoint though has to be action scenes. Despite the two athletic leads returning you get barely a glimpse of their talent thanks to director Patrick Alessandrin's incessant need to cut up every punch and flip. We're not talking TRANSPORTER 3 bad but it does crash the flow of the action to the floor. And for a 100 minute film there is surprisingly little action. My personal favorite bit is in the opening as Damien fights guys while trying to protect a Van Gogh painting. The most laughable part is an escape from police headquarters in a minicar where they make a turn down a dead end and wait for it magically find a car ramp leading right up to the window of the building. Not close or nearby it goes right up to the window. I'd laugh harder if the rest of the film hadn't depressed me so.".

There's one great escape which is up to par with the original. But besides being an average chop shop flick there's something very confusing and disturbing about the whole basic assumption this film is based on. What are we teaching our young people besides to risk their necks jumping off buildings to duplicate the stunts in the movie?Action flicks are about the action. Having a couple of actors who are proficient in their moves is an essential element and here we have 2 pretty good martial artists. At least by Hong Kong movie standards. The backstory the universe the story is set in are usually just pegs to hang the action sequences on. Some story of good guys against bad guys. Cops versus criminal gangs and dope dealers or as in some Chinese historical versions Chinese patriots against invaders and imperialists. Here the moral landscape is confusing at best and morally distasteful at worst. Here we have a bunch of multicultural criminal gangs who live in high rise blocks off the profits of their shady dealings and government dole who are painted as the good guys against a combination of cops and private security conspirators. Whose side are the cops on? Hard to tell. Are they just pawns in a relentless struggle between ethnic gangsters and other more elite criminals? Here ethnicity is reduced to style. Skinheads fight along side of Arabs Gypsies and Black Nationalists to preserve their right to welfare. In the end they join with their fellow style conscious multiculti ethnic brothers and sisters to blackmail the French government into giving them even better living accommodations. So our heroes Tomaso Rafaelli and Leito David Bell are fighting alongside the poor criminals against the rich criminals to preserve and expand government handouts for the poor criminals. No doubt they all want government to pay for their tattoos which seems to be their main means of expression and their reason to exist. The President of France easily capitulates to their demands because France is a welfare state don't ya know. Bad behavior must always be appeased and rewarded. And certainly it is the duty of government to pay for the lifestyles of the shiftless the gangsters and the just plain weird.".

In honor of them and the fact District 13  Ultimatum's original was actually titled District B13 I will present the 13 Best B's for this BMovie1. B  Bad Acting. That goes without saying but c'mon. Even Jackie Chan's back up dancers have more of a feel around a set or camera. 2. B  Bland. Nothing new. Barely any thought process. Sure they used a very expensive painting as a prop but again Jackie thought of that alreadyin his sleep. 3. B  Bloated. Too much of nothing. It would've been a great short. Or 22 minute intro to a new MST3k episode. 4. B  Basic. By the numbers action when it actually comes. I should add B  Blink or don't blink and you'll miss the action. 5. B  Brand Name Distorted. Sure the first movie was a liveaction cartoon but at least it was fun and not to be taken seriously. This time around they ask you to laugh at it.6. B  Butt Shot. No guys not a female though they SPOILER! want you to believe for far too long that it's a female behind. Give it up you thirteenyearolds or is that target audience? 7. and 8. B  Bad Dialogue and Choreography. I don't know which is worse. The constant need to repeat the same shot 45 times we got it already and it wasn't impressive the first time or hear the words from their mouths that would make even Godzilla run. 9. B  Balls 'N' Blame. I know we covered the male's backside how about the front. They certainly had the balls to make this crud. I actually enjoyed the first one. And this one's years after the first one. They had plenty of time to think this out. 10. B  Buffoons. As in the actors directors and writers. You go back to the early Jackie Chan films and there's no comparison. As arrogant Jackie is he wouldn't let this happen even on his worst day. When he had a migraine. When he was injured. When he was in surgery. 11. B  Break out. The Prison Escape Scene was hilariously bad. Take a lesson from Prison Break. There's a reason that was cancelled and I hope this is just 22. 12. B  Believability  Nonexistent. At least The Matrix had a reason they could do what they did. 13. B  Boring. Yep the scenes that they would like you to believe as action were as exciting as a Mentos commercial. If you're not laughing at the enormously had dialogue or Belle's hair you're yawning at the Disney channel's version of a Michael Bay film.Yeah this was a stretch. But there's no reason to see this. And as for that preposterously laugh out loud finale you're the blame for getting that far. I know I did and even though I'm not Catholic I'm currently Googling how many Hail Mary's I need to perform.".

Now a corrupt minister is planning to expel the inhabitants and demolish the buildings so profitable redevelopment can take place. To this end his has a shadowy agency raise tensions and turn public opinions against the inhabitants of the district. They have honest cop Captain Damien Tomaso arrested on a trumpedup charge and murder two other officers before making it look as if they were killed in the District. Unbeknownst to them the killing was filmed when they realise this the go after the witness but he has passed the recording to Leito. Damien manages to call Leito but before he can do anything he must get away from the security forces. Once reunited Damien and Leito set about exposing the truth and saving the community to do this they will have to unite the various groups living in the district.It must be said the story isn't that deep and the villains couldn't be more obviously bad... that doesn't matter though. The story is just an excuse to give great scenes of parkour and martial arts action... and it really delivers these well. David Belle is amazing in the parkour scenes and Cyril Raffaelli is great in his martial arts scenes these combine to give the film a feel similar to Hong Kong action films without it feeling as though the makers were copying that formula. The main cast is solid in the 'acting' as well as action scenes. The ending is a little disappointing especially when we only hear distant explosions rather than seeing them... at least they weren't rendered in poor CGI. Overall this might not be a great film but it is a lot of fun and definitely delivers if you want action and a degree of humour.These comments are based on watching the film in French with English subtitles.".

All that's required of writerproducer Luc Besson is to spin preposterous halfarsed plots around Belle's 'running jumping and rarely standing still' shtick to create 90 minutes of stupefying spectacle a delirious laughoutloud nobrainer.But if the original could have benefited from even less story than it actually had this one's certainly ironed out the problem. I don't like it when you think Leito Belle cautions supercop partner Damien Cyril Raffaelli and the audience which is absolutely fine with us. This time they attempt to thwart the French secret service who are killing cops to inflame an already ravaged District then waiting for it to blow so they can erect penthouses amid the ashes. It's like Iraq sneers a gang leader making the allegory explicit. Actually it's like Robocop. But who cares about originality when you've got stunts? Like two halves of some superevolved organism if Raffaelli's the upper muscle Belle's the dancing feet  although it's Damien who disguises himself as a shapely lapdancer to foil the dealers.

Thus what I saw back then were not computer generated tricks. How the fight scenes were performed by the lead actors David Belle especially and Cyril Raffaelli made the original Banlieu 13 a joy to behold offering something unique in the action genre. Of course the story was practically simple and the ending was easy to predict.The sequel takes place in 2013 three years after the first movie. The corrupted DISS set up a scheme to frame the citizens of the Banlieu 13 so that it would provide a reason for the government to completely demolish the district filled with gangster factions. To ensure the smooth execution of the plan Captain Damien Tomaso was set up and sent to prison for possession of drugs. Later Damien managed to contact Leito asking for help. Now Leito must find a way to free Damien while dodging the chase from the DISS and prevent the annihilation of Banlieu 13.Compared to the first movie B13U was a disappointment. Sure there were still parkour scenes in the movie but after seeing the first movie there's barely anything feels new in the sequel. The story was even more simple than the first and this made the film even less appealing. Acting was not the main strength of the first movie and it wasn't as well in the second one.Overall B13U was a mediocre action movie completely unsuccessful in picking up the success of its predecessor.".

	schema:headline " A splendid Laura Antonelli in a great movie";
	schema:reviewBody "After the bersuccess of 1973's Malizia Laura Antonelli was a top star in Italy and considered as the new Sophia Loren. Yet her following movies  Sessomatto Peccato Veniale Simona  were average at best. Then came the 1974 Mio Dio come sono caduta in basso a definite highlight of her career in comedy and a small step towards the world of the auteur cinema. In fact this works so well that she would resume similar roles in L'innocente and Mogliamante.Set between the early 1900s and 1920 we follow the life of the Sicilian noblewoman Eugenia. Raised in a convent all of a sudden a marriage to the nutty Lord Raymondo is arranged. The wedding night turns into a disaster Not just that Eugenia has no idea about sex beyond some mysterious temptation of the flesh Raymondo receives an information saying that he and Eugenia are actually brothers and sisters! To prevent any damage for the house Raymondo decides to keep it a secret. So they both play husband and wife. But already on the honeymoon trip to Paris the beautiful girl is flirted at and gets seduced constantly and soon tormented and miserable the temptation of the flesh becomes unbearable Let's face it The general premise with the brother and the sister is hard to swallow. Even though the writers were well aware of that and explain it in detail what a huge coincidence. But once it's taken for granted this becomes an ingenious and unique vehicle for hilarious comedy. Eugenia a complete newcomer to anything beyond God and the Bible suddenly confronted with sensuality intimacy desire. She knows she wants it she needs it but she doesn't even understand it she is not capable of it. She doesn't know why she should undress on the wedding night she'll immediately faint when one says a certain word she'll scream in horror when she sees a nude man for the first time and will faint again of course. While deeply caught in her churchy morale she'll constantly cry no! never! have mercy! but at the same time you see her trembling lips her thirsty eyes her body pumping actually saying YES!!!. But the only man she feels the right to be with is her husband and that's her brother so it's out of the question.This may sound like Eugenia is hard to bear but that is definitely not the case. It is actually an incredibly bitter crushing situation and any viewer with a heart must immediately fall for this so beautiful yet so sad girl. And in spite of all that tragedy the script manages to keep a high pace and is funny throughout. The situations are awkward for instance you'll see the longest unsexiest and funniest striptease scenes ever including three times full frontal Laura nudity. She wants to commit suicide but doesn't know how. She desperately seeks the help of her church but the priests don't see her problem. Finally she'll subject to sexual adventures enjoying it while it lasts but being disgusted afterwards. In general all the scenes with Eugenia and her driver are a true delight especially when they enter the hayrick. Laura Antonelli is fantastic just perfect for the part. In my opinion she always excels when being innocent romantic somewhat sad and mistreated and not in her more flashy alluring sexy roles. The face of an angel the body of a sinner. And she is very talented for wellwritten comedy.And of course Alberto Lionello as Raymondo is a great counterpart for Laura. A total buffoon easy to influence easy to distract easy to inspire  a pain in the ass but funny as hell. He is also the script's entrance to provide snappy satire about Italian nationalism imperialism and social conventions of the time. Everybody is obsessed with the works of Gabriele d'Annunzio the involuntary forerunner of Italian fascism. These elements grow stronger in the last third of the movie pushing the comedy more and more in the background. And at the same time the subtle underlying sad mood for our Eugenia grows stronger. This all culminates in the breakout of the World War.Overall Mio Dio come sono caduta in basso tells a unique tragicomic story with strong social criticism along with hilarious comedy and an endlessly lovable main character. It is highly recommended for Laura Antonelli fans but also for anybody looking for a great period dramedy with clear overweight of the comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody " DEFINITE MAJOR SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW  Single dad Terry Josh Lucas lives with his young daughter Angela Beatrice Miller who has a rare terminal disease. Terry has had a recent heart transplant to which he seems to have adapted healthily but he slowly becomes consumed by the tortured persona of the heart's donor through the extraordinary heart that follows no law of nature science or physics.The donor was a terminally ill man who'd put his name on an organ donor list and was then prematurely murdered by organ harvesters. He died watching them murder his wife too which gives the film its impetus.Terry trudges through the film coping with his psychoses blackouts and flashbacks of the donor's murder scene. He finds out the identities of his donor and those involved in the transplant. Discovering in a news article that the donor was murdered he then seeks the bad guys.The film has its Death Wish moments as Terry is quietly egged on to avenge the stillunsolved murder by the annoying detective Brian Cox assigned to the original homicide. As the bad guys start to die the detective has enough evidence to bring Terry in but actually aids Terry because he has his own reason for seeing vengeance meted out. The film tends to the morose as Terry inexplicably morphs into a schizoid psychological mess struggling through his new quest. Yet there are uplifting scenes of the star's relationships with his daughter and girlfriend.The dialog tends to drag. The plot and characters can become fairly unbelievable. Despite decent action several times I viewed the actors as if I were on a distant treetop wondering at the lack of a sense of thrill or horror and at how remarkably unscary and unengrossing this film got.Terry carries the burden of the driven tormented heart recipient  barely  yet his character's dialog is handled in a heavyhanded insensitive manner. The acting of Lena Headey as his girlfriend Elizabeth a caring nononsense physician and lover is enjoyable. But when Headey is forced to watch horrific surgical procedures performed on her beloved Terry she is deadpan. She may have picked up this stoic behavior from repeatedly watching Summer Glau get blown to bits in last TV season's Terminator  Sarah Connors Chronicles canceled after one season. The attractive Headey started acting as an adult 20 years ago has worked mostly in television and as far as I can tell has had a lessthanearthshattering career despite the proclivity of directors to cast her in tight jeans.For the vengeance to have been more credible and make more sense there should have been a stronger more interesting contemporaneous tiein to the harvester ringleaders including the surgeon. Perhaps this part could have been turned out to be Terry's coldblooded cardiologist. Or even Elizabeth.Ironically in the end it's revealed that the heart was ordered up by Elizabeth who was treating Terry's daughter and became attached to her  Elizabeth didn't want Terry to exit this planet quite so soon. She'd asked dodgy coworkers at the hospital to get her a heart noquestionsasked which Terry is not too happy to hear.This ending and the final surgery was a stretch but I enjoyed it. I also enjoyed the film's rudimentary ethics question of whether murder can be condoned if it benefits the perpetuity of family. Terry seems by then to have completely adopted the victim's loss and sense of right and wrong and it trumps his love for Elizabeth and his desire to have his daughter taken care of. Another view might be that his HEART was letting its love for its donor's wife trump everything.The rental didn't have captioning which made Headey hard to understand since she spoke quickly and with an English accent. This is true of some of the other dialog.Filmed in gorgeous Providence Rhode Island.I wouldn't compare this to Poe though I admit that  for a sadistic heart thief  death by defibrillator is a poetic one.".

	schema:headline " I would rather this film had straight up sucked";
	schema:reviewBody "There's something uniquely frustrating about this film. Bad movies are a certain kind of disappointment. Good movies that go bad are another. Tell Tale aims at and successfully achieves a complacent mediocrity and then just as it suggests it might become something better it goes right in the toilet. Being lulled into a resigned acceptance only to have your hopes raised and then instantly dashed is an aggravating emotional whiplash. I usually wish that movies had been better. I would have preferred this one to be worse sparing me those few bitter moments of futile hope.Based loosely and I mean very loosely on Edgar Allen Poe's The TellTale Heart this motion picture is about Terry Bernard Josh Lucas. He's a recent heart transplant recipient trying to get his life back in order. He's got a young daughter named Angela Beatrice Miller with a terminal genetic disorder and Angela has a beautiful doctor named Liz Lena Headey who's also pretty fond of Terry. I'd like to tell you more about these characters but they don't have any distinct personalities. If you smushed all their defining character traits together you still wouldn't have anything resembling a three dimensional human being.Terry starts having these episodes where he hears his heart thundering in his ears and sees strange images of people milling about in a dark room. These episodes eventually lead to Terry killing people and with the help of a jaded detective Brian Cox he learns that his victims are the people who killed the person whose heart now beats in Terry's chest. And that demanding magical organ isn't gong to let Terry stop killing.Now let me give you an example of what I mean by Tell Tale being mediocre. A pretty big deal is made of Angela's genetic disorder to the point where there's an entire scene built around it. Terry having a sick daughter though let alone one with a very rare and heartbreaking condition never goes anywhere or amounts to anything. It doesn't play any role in the plot. It's not connected to anything else in the story. Angela's disease doesn't mirror Terry's condition or link up with it thematically somehow. You could make Angela healthy and Liz her math tutor without changing anything significant in this film. And that's what I mean by mediocre. Tell Tale isn't bad there's simply no depth or complexity or sophistication to any of it.Which is okay. A mediocre movie is better than a bad one but then this flick has to go and suddenly get smart. It begins to suggest that the heart isn't only using Terry for vengeance. The heart may be changing Terry into its original owner setting up a second and more intriguing conflict. The heart isn't only taking revengeit's also taking Terry's identity. But as that concept starts to emerge from the mire the film abruptly turns stupid and falls into an overly melodramatic ending that only works because Tell Tale violates its central premise. All of the supernatural powers the heart has demonstrated throughout the story are pounded away by the Almighty Plot Hammer and Terry is left a helpless victim before his enemies because writer David Callaham apparently couldn't figure out a way to write a climax that didn't involve one clich after another.All of the actors here do good work with Josh Lucas exceeding the barren script to create believable relationships for Terry with both Angela and Liz. Lena Headey admirably soldiers through a typically thankless girlfriend role and looks amazing. Brian Cox is possibly the best thing in the production as a cynical defeated cop given new hope by the unbelievable until he's betrayed by a crushingly trite motivation. And director Michael Cuesta does a perfectly acceptable job.It's dispiriting turn at the end leaves Tell Tale a submediocre 90 minute movie that could have been a worthwhile 2 hour flick if it had followed through on its potential. It didn't so it's not worth your while".

Brian Cox is possibly the best thing in the production as a cynical defeated cop given new hope by the unbelievable until he's betrayed by a crushingly trite motivation. And director Michael Cuesta does a perfectly acceptable job.It's dispiriting turn at the end leaves Tell Tale a submediocre 90 minute movie that could have been a worthwhile 2 hour flick if it had followed through on its potential. It didn't so it's not worth your while";

The story's main character soon begins an investigation that challenges his very sanity.Josh Lucas as the lead does an excellent job.

Those films showed how an organ transplanted from one body to the other can produce unexpected effects usually with tragic consequences to the patient or victim of the procedure. And even though TellTale has a few positive elements its tedious narrative and bland drama ended up producing a boring and unsatisfactory film experience.There are two predictable twists in TellTale the first one is revealed pretty soon and the other one at the ending. And besides of that this film is basically a collection of long and uninteresting scenes in which we see the main character afflicted by events he does not understand the treatment for his daughter's illness and the insipid romance he was with a doctor. And the worst thing of all is that none of those elements substantially contribute to the story and they feel as simple fillers so that the time goes through while there are not murder scenes.TellTale includes elements from a medical drama a thriller and a horror film which deals with supernatural subjects...however there is not an adequate cohesion between them. On the positive side Josh Lucas Lena Headey Brian Cox and Beatrice Miller bring solid performances despite having such poor material to work with. So in conclusion I cannot recommend TellTale because I found it to be a very boring movie which lacks of any emotion impact or suspense.".

	schema:headline " A Contemporary Vision Of Poe";
	schema:reviewBody "'Tell Tale' pays homage to one of American history's greatest horror authors editors and literary critics Edgar Allan Poe. Most of us have read 'The telltale heart' at some point in school and tells the tale of an unnamed narrator who slowly and without much remorse confesses to the murder of his employer  the man with the 'evil eye'. It was and is considered one of the most horrifying tales of the macabre at that point as the speaker describes the reasons methods and means of murdering his master and the madness that eventually causes him to confess.Although 'Tell Tale' is an interesting movie to watch it is only loosely based on the original Poe story. They are completely different in every way as this film is more of a strange psychological ghost story. It is an interesting film nevertheless but it bears no resemblance to Poe's famous short story.The film centers on Terry Bernard a young father and a man who receives a much needed heart transplant just in the nick of time. Slowly his life returns to normal he is a man in love and a very dutiful father... but it all begins to change rapidly when he suffers from a supernatural assault on his memory. Remembrances of a man murdered and a life not his own.There is some really wonderful casting in this movie especially the renowned Brian Cox who plays a retired detective who views the whole thing so skeptically that it's hard to understand why he would become involved until much later in the film. Josh Lucas as the lead does a fantastic job of portraying a man who is very much being tortured mind body and soul. His love interest played by Lena Heady of Game Of Thrones fame is a very welcome addition. Her devotion to him wavers at times due the subsequent changes in the man she loves but she carries an immense secret throughout the movie.Overall it's a very unique take on Poe's work yet I would say only mildly influenced by it. It could be rather predictable at times but it is well acted throughout.610".

But when he gets a heart transplant and meets a female doctor that he starts a relationship with things start to change. Especially within himself. Josh Lucas is actually really good in this in fact he sort of reminds me of an American version of Daniel Craig. The thing is the beginning interested me than the rest of the movie. The mystery of trying to figure out what is going on kinda drives this movie. But when finding out what is going on it just basically goes in a narrow and not very interesting direction.

It's actually fairly enjoyable if you're willing to overlook the more clichd derivative elements and focus on what does work. In the end it's basically just violent exploitation. If you're looking for something more than that then I don't think you'll like Tell Tale very much. It has moments where it rises above that but then it abandons them and sinks right back down again.

Okay sure this is a very familiar idea fine that doesn't bother me at all. There are a LOT of reworked ideas that we see done over and over all the time and for me anyway as long as the film is done well they don't ALL have to be totally original. Just about ANY story based however loosely on POE is great with me same thing with Philip K. Dick BUT... That's not it. First off I am REALLY surprised that this is a Scott Free production. I'm amazed that the Scott Brothers had anything at all to do with this director period. And that in my lowly and wretched opinion is precisely what is wrong with this film. The director. I mean couldn't ol' Ridley and Tony at least have found a better director? Geez... One word Amateurish. I know that word is probably overworked here but that truly is what I believe killed this film. Not overtly HORRIBLE no... But enough little things that added up so that by about 30 minutes I was so irritated that I had indeed had quite enough.Here are just a few things and no they in themselves are not really awful but to me anyway they're so obvious that it REALLY takes you right out of the film. First off and I KNOW many are gonna think this is really silly but ANY director that for some bizarre unknown reason HAS to have the characters giving their dialog while they are chewing their food 4 FRIGG'N TIMES in the first 20 minutes is an amateur. I know I know it may seem petty but it's like the director somehow thinks that this makes the movie more 'Real to Life' somehow as if any of us are interested in seeing about a third of the dialog given with their mouth's full like 'Ooh see this is what REAL people do'  uh huh... apparently they must do it frigg'n CONSTANTLY by how much it is portrayed here.Second and much more annoying and a sure sign to me anyway that the director is an amateur BTW when I use 'amateur' I mean in this context an UNTALENTED amateur  many first time 'amateur' directors CAN be absolutely brilliant! is when the sound design is SO horribly UNnatural that every little rustle of paper and every little movement is amplified and raised to ridiculously artificial levels. And God forbid anyone should poor a drink clear across the room without the ear shattering sound of the liquid hitting the glass Oh yeah VERY realistic there... Like I said Amateur Time... Now I admit that these two areas regarding the 'sound' particularly annoy me  perhaps they wouldn't bother someone else as muchNext the script itself is really trying. And I don't mean 'Trying' as in really making an attempt either. First the little girl who is very cute and lovely BTW spouts these completely unrealistic lines that a six year old would never likely say. And DON'T get me started on the 'romantic' interplay between the two leads can you say 'AWKWARD'...? So it honestly is a shame that this film wasn't placed in MUCH better hands even with the moderately painful dialog at least with a good director it could have been possible to improve the quality and bring out better performances. Then perhaps this movie might have had a chance to be quite good. But no...Sadly in a word...Painful...".

Now I admit that these two areas regarding the 'sound' particularly annoy me  perhaps they wouldn't bother someone else as muchNext the script itself is really trying. And I don't mean 'Trying' as in really making an attempt either. First the little girl who is very cute and lovely BTW spouts these completely unrealistic lines that a six year old would never likely say. And DON'T get me started on the 'romantic' interplay between the two leads can you say 'AWKWARD'...? So it honestly is a shame that this film wasn't placed in MUCH better hands even with the moderately painful dialog at least with a good director it could have been possible to improve the quality and bring out better performances. Then perhaps this movie might have had a chance to be quite good. But no...Sadly in a word...Painful...";

However in doing so she gets nightmarish images she rather no talk about but through these experiments Ricky actually awakens from the coma and because of that attachment he heads after Laura.Credit for trying some different but it got completely daft and spineless leading to something routine. At the beginning it started using scenes from the first film in what Laura's character was seeing in her visions and I was thinking Here we go again?. Gladly it wasn't the case. The only thing that achieved some sort of energy was the hysterical screaming by Samantha Scully as the stubbornly unlikeable blind heroine but again that wasn't entirely convincing. Moments within the plot actually reminded me of John Carl Buechler's 'Friday the 13th Part 7 New Blood' 1988. Now that one was better. Popping up as the maniac Ricky is Bill Moseley as his robotic manner goes through it with that plastic bowl on top of his head getting most of the attention. Robert Culp gives a batty performance while Richard Beymer goes for stiltedly serious temperament. Laura Harring and Eric DaRe also appear. The busily echoing score punches out the electronic cues. The man in the director's chair Monte Hellman 'The Shooting' 'Cockfighter' and 'Twolane Blacktop' does a stylish but lethargic job which lacked a sinister bite. Bit of atmosphere in some dreamy parts and camera placement showed some inventiveness but it triggers no tension no jolts and no fun.".

It is due to the killer's slugglishness that taints the whole movie because since he is so slow pretty much every scene he is in bores you out of your mind.

His amazing power is completely laughable as well..I mean he receives a shotgun blast that forcefully throws him across the floor yet he's able to get up and attack brother Chris who is quite bigger than Ricky.";

So why bother doing another unwanted entry in the Ricky story? Or bother watching it? Well personally I thought that with Richard Beymer from Twin Peaks as a mad scientist and Bill Moseley who's had sort of a comeback lately but was probably working for free food when this movie was made as reanimated Ricky it could only be so bad. Well right now it's almost Christmas so can I be blamed for wishing for a cinematic miracle? Back to reality Beymer doesn't do anything with his clichd character and Moseley tries to keep a straight face wearing that fun glass head top supposed to keep his reconstructed brain from falling out! just looking evil and hardly uttering a word. He's rather slow and fragile than dangerouslooking yet the bad supporting cast including Laura Herring in an undemanding 'girlfriendforthebreastsshot role are in panic. The blind girl doesn't act as tough she's blind but as though she's berstoned. Her bad 80shaircut victim of a brother behaves absurdly not even caring when someone he's supposed to love gets killed. There's boring flashbacks galore and that after SNDN2 was trashed for its use of flashbacks though they don't take up half of the movie here and the murders are mostly tame or offscreen so this isn't even of interest to undemanding gorehounds. Silent Night Deadly Night 3  better watch out and rent a better movie!".

About the only positive this one has is the finale stalking around the house which is quite effective here at putting her in danger due to the use of her physical condition causing a lot of fumbling and stumbling around in the dark while trying to avoid the killer who's closing in through several different floors of the house and down into the basement where the real stalking is used and the best bloodletting is all thrown together. By itself it's a decent enough sequence but is just trapped all throughout here with the rest of the banal attributes that hold it down. Among the numerous flaws here nothing is bigger than the utterly lame and unimposing killer who looks so ridiculous with the comadevice still strapped to his head that he gets quite more laughs than scares by his appearance and really settles into this one quite weakly. It's hardly off to a good start when we find ourselves treating the killer as a joke and the other flaws only enhance that since this one is just interminably boring and lifeless. There's hardly any action at all within this since the first half tends to run through her experiments at the hospital before finally just getting to the house at the fortyminute mark as the useless sidetangents of the killer's stops along the way and the detectives spouting pointless scientific jargon at each other make up the rest of the running time in the first half. This is naturally spurred on by the criminallylow bodycount that never really gives this one a chance to let loose with the splatter that would've helped the running time along here and in the end there's just not enough action to really get this one going at all. The last flaw here is the overall cheapness of the film both in regards to the locations and sets but also the overall quality of the rest of the special effects as the kills are all offscreen the design is pretty bad and overall this one never really had a chance to do much good for itself.Rated R Graphic Violence Nudity and Language.".

After the abysmal part 2 I can't believe anyone thought the Silent Night Deadly Night series needed to continue. But it was the '80s and crappy movies like these were very popular on home video. This time the Santa killer Ricky Caldwell Bill Moseley is awakened from a coma and naturally returns to killing people. There's also a blind psychic girl Samantha Scully with a telepathic connection to the killer. Her brother has an awesome perm and loves denim. They take a trip to see their grandmother and find Ricky instead.Samantha Scully is one of the worst actresses that ever lived. It's not surprising that her career was so brief. What is surprising is that her career didn't end with her first audition. She is exceptionally bad in this. Consider yourself warned. The movie is somewhat notable for being directed by cult director Monte Hellman who does manage to imbue the film with more quirky weirdness than most '80s slasher sequels. Also notable for a nice Laura Harring nude scene. Robert Culp had bills to pay I guess so he's in this as a detective with one memorably awful scene discussing the merits of the car phone with his partner. It's really a dull chore of a movie to sit through even for the most avid slasher fan. The acting is incompetent the pace sluggish and the 'kills' unimaginative. We can thank the good people at Ragu for the blood used in this. Avoid unless you really like garbage. And don't forget  it's Piru not Peru.".

	schema:reviewBody "Better than average slasher film that was surprisingly directed and cowritten by iconoclastic director Monte Hellman Two Lane Blacktop The Shooting Cockfighter China 9 Liberty 37. This directtovideo sequel would be Hellman's second to last film until he made Road to Nowhere over 20years later. This third sequel has the Santa Claus Killer Richard Ricky Caldwell a deranged man obsessed with Old St. Nick awakened from his coma after a blind woman makes a psychic connection with him who he then stalk for the remainder of the film. Caldwell is played by genre regular Bill Moseley ChopTop from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and Otis in The Devil's Rejects which adds tremendously to the fun of the film where he sports a visible man style transparent dome over the top half of his skull to repair damage from the first two films where the audience can see right into his brain cavity. Hellman delivers effective suspense and plenty gory special effects which are sure to please horror fans but it's the film's black humor that sets it apart from the more pedestrian first two films making this this best of the rather lack luster five films in this series. The only reason the original film ever spawned a sequel was due to the notoriety it gained due to the controversy surrounding its use of killer in a Santa Clause outfit with an axe. Also bolstering the film over it's predecessors it features 1960s hunks Richard Beymer West Side Story The Haunting Twin Peaks and Robert Culp I Spy Hickey  Boggs The Greatest American Hero in supporting roles. Overall I don't think this is necessarily a film I'd recommend for fans of Hellman's prior films unless you're also a fan of 80s slasher films which I am. It will likely appeal more to fans of oddball comedyhorror films along the lines of TCM2 Sleepaway Camp or Slumber Party Massacre.".

Why would you reconstruct a serial killer's brain? That is very dumb.Never once does he even dress up like Santa so this really has nothing to do with the other movies. There's one Santa that appears at the beginning who's killed. There's fairly little connection to Christmas at all. I would think that a movie literally titled Better Watch Out! would feature Santa. Instead we get a pointless violent film with Ricky's brain being exposed making him look like the DC supervillain Psimon. What ever happened to the original Santa who killed his parents? Was this film really necessary? Couldn't they have addressed that to give this movie a reason for existing? 12".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know what I was expecting from this but I knew I wanted to see it for a simple reason Monte Hellman is the director. You don't often get someone to helm a madeforvideo sequel to a schlocky horror flick about a guy who gets triggered as an adult to kill lots of people around Christmas for... reasons I don't need to go into here that made such existential genre films like Ride in the Whirlwind The Shooting TwoLane Blacktop and Cockfighter.It's a curious choice and I have to wonder if Hellman went for it for reasons other than money his previous film Iguana barely got a release in the US and before that he hadn't directed in ten years but rather to have the odd kind of challenge of getting something done very quickly that would certainly be seen by some people regardless of format. Maybe I was expecting that Hellman would put a crazy twist on the slasher genre and in a way I did get that. Sort of kind of maybe by the end it's all so damn crazy that it's less inspired crazy and more trying too hard.Certainly his premise has promise leaning at first to seeming like a Nightmare on Elm Street movie a girl Laura Samantha Scully is having dreamsnightmares in a facility the opening is perhaps the best part of the movie or one of them but it's soon revealed she's actually trying to be connected via uh unconventional Dr. Newbury Richard Beymer to 'Ricky' the killer from previous entries or a previous one I still haven't seen the second of these movies who is in a coma. She's allowed to leave since you know it's Christmas so it's time to go with her brother Eric DaRae and his girlfriend Laura Haring to their grandmother's house... but lo and behold somehow he wakes up maybe from her connecting to his visions the whole Is he seeing what's inside me like I'm seeing what's inside him comes up and it becomes more like a Halloween movie as he is a seemingly indestructible and b is basically a walking corpse.One curious thing of course to note is the cast of people from David Lynch projects  seeing Leo Johnson from Twin Peaks with a hairdo out of the band Whitesnake is unreal but it's also nice to see an early Haring performance of Mulholland Drive though I actually forgot Beymer aside from being Tony in West Side Story was Benjamin Horne on Twin Peaks too until I looked it up  and in the first act I thought that Hellman was going for a Lynchian sort of set up. Probably not intentional but certainly the connections with the subconscious dreams nightmares the inner landscape of the mind as a fed up minefield of terrors it made for a set up that I was initially engaged in and Hellman as a director has a pacing that is set apart from the usual hacks and journeymen doing these horror sequels much less direct to video.He takes his time doesn't always use music where you expect and whether it's due to him being disgusted by what's usually done in these movies or wanting to change it up there's not as much blood when Granny gets it  oh is that a spoiler nope come on you see it coming a mile away folks  he cuts away to an outside shot of her house and so there's an uncanny sense of suspense at times. Yet the key word here is 'at times' since Hellman is also seeming to be so set apart from other horror movies of the time that he trips himself up much of the midsection of this is dull as there is only a slim narrative that's actually going on with Ricky already ahead of Laura and Chris and Jerri plus the doctor and one of those logical cops that doesn't get this doctor's higher theories about Ricky  again a knockoff of Halloween and Christmas is only used sparingly as if we have to be reminded of it at the very end as 'Oh right yeah it's Christmas you actually made it to the end here's Bill Moseley again to finish off with a WTF moment.But the thing that keeps me from finding this to a full on guilty pleasure as opposed to something that is decent but only has its moments is Scully's acting. For some reason she's made to be blind as a I guess way to make her seem stronger in the film that she has to rise up to fight Ricky with uh some postdeath guidance from her grandma. None of that really matters though since she's not terribly convincing either talking in a monotone or screaming her head off. I think that ultimately this is the best possible Silent Night Deadly Night III we could've asked for and I'm glad Hellman tried out something extremely different for him. The results were just hit or miss this includes a rather selfconscious reference done twice as if there's a friggin' marathon on it TV of The Terror which Hellman did uncredited work on. 5.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Even though the final frames of Silent Night Deadly Night Part 2 hinted that there was still life in this series this third chapter strongly suggests otherwise.Continuing the story of Ricky from Part 2 Silent Night Deadly Night III opens with our recurring killer in a coma with a clear plastic dome housed over his exposed brain like a cryogenic beanie. Apparently Ricky is now at the center of a bizarre experiment in which a young woman named Laura a blind girl with an inexplicable psychic link to him explores the recesses of his psychotic mind and relives the chapters of his tormented past.After Part 2 squandered over a halfhour of its running time with repeats of scenes from the first Silent Night one would assume the filmmakers knew that the viewers of this installment were up to speed on the origin of this character. Not so apparently since once again the runtime here is liberally padded with flashbacks to the original slasher Santa tale. Amazingly even though they were obviously aware enough of Silent Night Deadly Night to crib portions of it for this movie the geniuses behind this outing overlook the most crucial element of the story. Ricky is referred to here as the Santa Claus killer who butchered people with an axe but Ricky was just a little boy when the first SN DN took place and it was actually his older brother Billy who was responsible for those murders That example of the producers' keen attention to detail should give you a good idea of how sensible this outing is as a whole.Once our blind mindreader gets attuned to Ricky she begins to experience violent hallucinations and envisions his forthcoming series of brutal murders before they occur. Of course Ricky awakes from his coma when a drunken lout in a Santa suit wanders into his hospital room to spout priceless oneliners like Hey vegetable who's your favorite singer? Perry Coma? Apparently the psychic link forged by the experiment is a twoway street and when Laura hits the road with her brother and his girlfriend for Christmas at Grandma's Ricky hears the directions in his mind and decides to join their holiday festivities. Seeing Eric Da Re from Twin Peaks as Laura's brother is one of the few bits of fun the movie offers and with his nipplelength curly locks he looks like he's planning on auditioning to play bass for Whitesnake on the way to Granny's.Ricky doesn't have Laura's carpool connection so he's forced to hitchhike to the gathering. Despite being dressed in a hospital gown and having the aforementioned braindisplay bubble atop his head he doesn't have any trouble getting someone to pick him up and this short road trip provides an excuse to throw a couple of random victims into the mix. Somehow Ricky reaches Granny's before the rest of the gang and when he arrives she does what any old woman living by herself would do if a mute Frankensteinesque stranger with metal circuitry poking out beneath his snow cap showed up at her doorstep she invites him inside and makes him cookies.Since Laura is clearly meant to be our main protagonist we're probably supposed to care what happens to her but she's actually a braying shrew and completely unlikeable so this becomes a dicey proposition. Worse she sounds as disinterested as we are most of the time and even a line like if we don't leave he'll kill us all is delivered with all of the emotional intensity of someone asking for a glass of water.Yes Bill Mosely portrays our plasticskulled villain but even Mosely completists will find little of interest here since all he really does is lurch after his intended victims with a drunken stagger and moan Laura occasionally. Although he does turn up just before the credits in a tuxedo to wish us a Happy New Year so I guess that's something.The acting here is uniformly lifeless the plot makes absolutely no sense and the dialogue is some of the most atrocious you'll ever hear my favorite line occurs when Chris confronts Ricky during the final showdown shouting Hey BubbleHead! Is it live or is it Memorex?. The series of murders the title implies are bland and uninspired and so clumsily staged that some of the victims basically just walk into the knife themselves. On every front Better Watch Out ventures so far beyond bad that it would probably be funny if it wasn't so damn boring. These 90 minutes feel like an eternity and without any decent scares or splatter to dilute the tedium finishing this film becomes an endurance test.This is one of those rare pieces of cinematic history that I silently loathe myself for owning and whenever anyone says they hate Christmas I just assume they feel that way because they've seen this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Silent Night Deadly Night III Better Watch Out! begins as a sexy young blind woman Laura Samantha Scully is having nightmares featuring the previous movie's psycho Santa killer Ricky Caldwell now played by genre icon Bill Moseley. As it turns out her demented doctor Newbury Richard Beymer has been planning to probe the mind of Ricky who is still alive yet in a coma and is using Laura to this end. Laura and Ricky now share a psychic link what one sees the other sees. As Laura her brother Chris Eric DaRe and Chris's new girlfriend Jerri Laura Harring travel to the family homestead to visit with Laura and Chris's grandma Elizabeth Hoffman Ricky naturally escapes and leaves a few bodies in his wake as he attempts to meet up with Laura. Trailing Ricky are Dr. Newbury and a detective named Connelly Robert Culp. Done by cult favourite director Monte Hellman The Shooting TwoLane Blacktop etc. basically as a favour Part 3 largely eschews any sense of humour that the previous sequel displayed playing its material with a very straight face. The one exception to this approach is the ever so slightly off kilter character of Connelly amusingly and effectively played by Culp a man who's quick with the sardonic quips and who has one strange yet memorable exchange with Beymer during a car ride. The character and performance are really the best thing about Part 3 which unfortunately despite some solid atmosphere is ultimately too tedious to maintain much interest. It should be pointed out that one supposed shock moment just falls way too flat. The science fiction element is a fresh enough new element but it fails to inject much life into the story. Moseley better known for much more uninhibited performances in movies like The Devil's Rejects and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2 is awfully low key here his antagonist never registers very strongly or inspires much fear or unease. Costar Harring does show off some of her nice body in a bathtub scene but horror fans who crave nudity and lots of gore aren't going to find enough here to suit their tastes. As an interesting footnote though it's been noted by buffs that both DaRe and Beymer became regulars on 'Twin Peaks' after and that Harring would get a showcase role in David Lynch's feature film Mulholland Drive. It's also worth noting that Hellman and executive producers Richard Gladstein and Ronna Wallace would also executive produce Tarantino's break through film Reservoir Dogs a few years later. Not even the finale which borrows a little from Wait Until Dark is particularly exciting. Scully's character isn't particularly likable although some viewers could see that as an appreciable break from convention. The use of archive footage is still present but not prevalent. In any event SNDN No. 3 is dull draggy and something of a chore to sit through. Hellman's daughter Melissa plays Newbury's assistant. Four out of 10.".

In any event SNDN No. 3 is dull draggy and something of a chore to sit through. Hellman's daughter Melissa plays Newbury's assistant. Four out of 10.";

In fact her doctor has been using her in an attempt to 'channel' the comatose Ricky Billy Moseley who was responsible for a string of murders on Christmas Eve some years before. Christmas Eve finally arrives and Laura goes with her brother Chris and his girlfriend Jerri Laura Harring to her grandmother's house in the country. Unfortunately Ricky awakens from his coma and targets the three travelers.Anyone familiar with this series knows that these movies are not examples of stellar filmmaking the first film however has rightfully gained its place in the hall of appreciated cult slasher flicks. The second entry in the series was admittedly a complete disaster and this third followup takes things in a different direction for better and for worse. In some regards there are things to appreciate here the opening dream sequence is a great start to the film and the aspect of the protagonist's blindness could make for some very scary situations when being stalked by a killer unfortunately this opportunity is completely underutilized. Instead we get a sort of hokey clairvoyant connection between Laura and Ricky ala Halloween 5 that is fairly silly.The acting is decent for a directtovideo horror flick in other words it isn't great by any means but the performers get the job done. Most interesting are a younger Bill Moseley playing the villain back in his Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 days with his brain enclosed in some bizarre plexiglass case that rests on top of his head and a very young Laura Harring notable for her performance in David Lynch's Mulholland Drive as a snarky girlfriend. Samantha Scully is essentially a noname but she is decent in the main role and has the right look for it. My biggest problem with the film though was how it lacked surprises. There are dozens of opportunities that are never taken and because of it the film seems to drag. There is nothing in the way of scares or tension  we get a little bit of atmosphere when the trio arrive at grandma's house but that's about it. The psychic element of the characters gets tiring after awhile and the lack of scares or surprises gives the audience little to nothing to chew on. The lack of a score in some of the more dramatic scenes also makes things almost too awkward the film could have used something more in terms of music. It's kind of a bummer when you take the premise into account because it could have been much more than it was.Overall Silent Night Deadly Night III is a bit of a disappointment. The film has an interesting cast who were for the most part just starting their careers and it has a few inventive dream sequences and a slight use of the Christmastime setting. These few things however can't make up for the film's shortcomings lack of suspense and surprise very little music and the shoddy psychic subplot. Maybe worth watching for fans of the series but it's a mostly uninteresting film on its own. 410.".

While some of her skating positions and landings look awkward compared to today's skaters she was a consummate performer and a dazzling skater  fast with amazing spins and great dance moves. She is responsible for the ice show in this country the creation of skating costumes rather than dresses for combining ice skating and dance for making skating popular and for of all things  white skates which flew off the shelves when audiences first saw her skate in them!The threadbare plot consists of a pact between countries a prince disguised as a vacationer at a European ski resort and lots of misunderstandings.

It would be a couple of years before his looks matured to the point where he would be so spectacularly handsome that this viewer's jaw would drop at the mere sight of him. But I can imagine his effect in 19361937 on teens. I saw a photo on ebay recently of Power and Henie sitting side by side holding hands and talking to the director between takes of this movie. According to screenwriter Milton Sperling they couldn't get the two of them onto the set from Henie's dressing room and when they finally did Power looked like he was going to collapse. If I'd been Sonja I'd have had my clutches in him as well. She was as smart as she was talented. As an added plus there are two ridiculous numbers by Joan Davis who was always worth watching. For those who remember I Married Joan it's a delight to see her as the leader of a female orchestra in this.Take Thin Ice for the entertainment value that it has and enjoy it.".

Zanuck felt better about investing more money in her next film Thin Ice. The resulting production is obvious for any viewer the money spigots were left on for Thin Ice.It's hard to imagine today the world wide popularity of Sonia Henie who the year before had come off her third gold medal in the Olympics before turning professional with the 20th Century Fox movie contract. The public wanted to see her skate and Zanuck gave them what they wanted. Her many routines are nicely staged and the ice dancing got an Academy Award nomination for Dance Direction. Yes back in the age of musicals they actually had that as an Oscar category.Zanuck even gave her his lot's most popular leading man in Tyrone Power. This was the first of two films Power did with Henie and while I think that Second Fiddle was a better film this one isn't bad for what it is a vehicle to show off Sonia Henie.Sonia plays a skating instructor at an Alpine resort which is going to host a European conference. Power plays the playboy prince of a small duchy whose romantic escapades get him headlines. Henie gets herself involved with him but she doesn't know who it is. In the meantime the two of them become tabloid fodder. I think you have a good idea where this plot is leading.Still Thin Ice is not bad as entertainment. And for comic relief we have Joan Davis conducting the all girl orchestra at the hotel and giving us some comic numbers. She's not bad at all. And Zanuck had such scene stealing character actors as Arthur Treacher Alan Hale Raymond Walburn Sig Ruman Melville Cooper and Maurice Cass for support.None but the best for his Olympic size investment.".

The public wanted to see her skate and Zanuck gave them what they wanted. Her many routines are nicely staged and the ice dancing got an Academy Award nomination for Dance Direction. Yes back in the age of musicals they actually had that as an Oscar category.Zanuck even gave her his lot's most popular leading man in Tyrone Power. This was the first of two films Power did with Henie and while I think that Second Fiddle was a better film this one isn't bad for what it is a vehicle to show off Sonia Henie.Sonia plays a skating instructor at an Alpine resort which is going to host a European conference. Power plays the playboy prince of a small duchy whose romantic escapades get him headlines. Henie gets herself involved with him but she doesn't know who it is. In the meantime the two of them become tabloid fodder. I think you have a good idea where this plot is leading.Still Thin Ice is not bad as entertainment. And for comic relief we have Joan Davis conducting the all girl orchestra at the hotel and giving us some comic numbers. She's not bad at all. And Zanuck had such scene stealing character actors as Arthur Treacher Alan Hale Raymond Walburn Sig Ruman Melville Cooper and Maurice Cass for support.None but the best for his Olympic size investment.";

With screenplay by Boris Ingster and Milton Sperling it's basically flufftype material consisting of mistaken identity between two people highlighted by song and ice skating production sequences that was no doubt back in 1937 to be another sure winner for the One in a Million Sonja Henie.Plot Summary Christmas is fast approaching in the Swiss Alps but at 82 degrees there seems to be no signs of snow in the forecast. With three weeks before the season Herr Kratz Melville Cooper manager of the Grand Hotel Imperial of St. Christoph prays for a miracle of snow so Christmas will find his empty hotel full of ski going guests. A miracle does happen Nottingham Arthur Treacher the butler to Prince Rudolph Tyrone Power makes reservations for 81 rooms and three suites for an upcoming convention shortly before the much needed snow starts falling down from the clouds above. Some time later Prince Rudolph and Nottingham arrive by train. After coming to the Grand Hotel Imperial on wheelchair pretending to be sick Rudolph sneaks away with his servant to the quaint Billage Inn where he remains to have his privacy. While on the ski slopes he encounters Lily Heiser Sonja Henie a skating instructor at the Grand Hotel. Unaware of his identity the prince passes himself off as Rudy Miller a newspaper man covering the convention at the hotel where she works. After Lily is seen returning to the hotel exiting the prince's royal car driven by her chauffeur boyfriend Alex George Givot rumors spread rapidly throughout the village of Lily being romantically involved with the prince. Feeling this news to be good publicity for his hotel business Krantz allows Lily to display her skating skills to the guests at the hotel's ice skating musical programs. With Lily is a bit confused by all the attention and gifted presents she claims to have never even met the prince before. Later Lily finds herself being watched by some elderly gentleman in the audience bearing bushy mustache and glasses during her slating exhibitions unaware it's Rudy in disguise leading to a series of complicated events for all. Also in the cast are Raymond Walburn Lily's Uncle Dornic Sig Ruman Prime Minister Ulrich Alan Hale The Baron Maurice Cass The Count and Greta Meyer Martha. Look fast for Lon Chaney Jr. a few years before his Universal horror fame of the 1940s glimpsed as one of the newspaper reporters.New songs by Lew Pollack and Sidney Mitchell are as follows Over Night vocalized over opening credits My Secret Love Affair sung by Leah Ray Olga of the Volga by Mack Gordon and Harry Revel sung by Joan Davis The Polovetsian Dances from PRINCE IGOR skating number with Sonja Henie and ensemble My Swiss HillyBilly sung in comic fashion by Joan Davis Tales of the Vienna Woods by Johann Straussskate number with by Henie and Over Night finale sung by chorus skate number with Henie. Leah Ray offers a beautiful rendition to My Secret Love Affair a title tune that might have served better as its movie title considering the royalty meets commoner theme involved. Skating numbers choreographed by Harry Losee is well staged with Henie naturally as its center of attention.Formerly broadcast on commercial 1960s and later public television 1980s where the closing cast credits was edited THIN ICE would come to pass again in its entirety on video cassette and DVD plus cable television availability as American Movie Classics 199293 and 2001 and occasionally on Fox Movie Channel where other Henie musicals are shown.THIN ICE is short 77 minutes sweet and to the point romantic fairy tale type caper with Henie and Power appearing to be enjoying their assignment together as they would again in the second film together of SECOND FIDDLE 1939. While the plotting may be a bit thin with ice only part of the skating sequences there's enough entertainment to go around for anyone's enjoyment. 12".

Likewise the songs are pleasant and fit well but there are no instant classics here.However 'Thin Ice' looks great the comedy from Joan Davies still stands up as very funny it's all competently directed and the dance direction for the Prince Igor Suite is pretty exemplary.While stretched ever so slightly in the acting department Henie is pert and charming with a smile that makes anyone go weak at the knees and the camera clearly loves her. Her ice skating is also out of this world and the envy perhaps of even professional ice skaters now. Tyrone Power is a handsome and charismatic partner their chemistry endearing to watch while Joan Davies steals scenes in a deliciously riotous performance.On the whole a nice if not great film. 710 Bethany Cox".

Hardly the nave innocent she was playing on screen it's amusing to watch Sonja ply her trade as a skating instructor for a financially strapped Swiss hotel but as soon as rumors abound of her romance with Power's Prince Rudolph offers arrive swiftly and decisively though the girl is kept in the dark about his true identity until picture's end. Their off screen chemistry doesn't seem to have translated well on camera but the strapping young Tyrone Power cements his cinematic rise to superstardom by carrying the lightweight material for his novice leading lady as well as nervous studio chief Darryl Zanuck often on the losing end of negotiations with the temperamental Sonja. Among the unbilled extras Lon Chaney can be spotted as an American reporter on two very brief occasions at the 10 minute mark a silent bit as Power's prince makes his first appearance posing as an invalid coming off the train and again 16 minutes later rushing in to breathlessly await news of the couple's romance his dialogue drowned out with the noise of all the other newsmen.

While this Henie film was not done by famed choreographer and director Busby Berkeley it was filled with gobs of song and skating numbers that frankly bored me and looked a lot like the work of Berkeley.Fortunately this film was on tape so I was able to speed through these numbers when they became too tedious. What was left was actually pretty good thanks to some decent writing and a surprisingly nice performance by Henie. She and Tyrone Power did a good job when it came to the story and I really wish TwentiethCentury Fox would have just eliminated or extremely shortened the musical numbers because the romance was very sweet. Apparently folks in the 30s loved these cornball numbers but they seriously impede the story.

	schema:headline " A Stone's Throw from Greatness";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the films that is very atmospheric stylish and inventive in the European 60's fashion. The story is somewhat of a cross between Nathaniel Hawthorne's short story Rappacini's Daughter and the film House of Wax. An art professor is keeping a secret about his invalid beautiful seductive daughter Elfi away from Hans von Arnam a man sent to write a piece on the centennial of the professor's mill and its famous statues of women that move around on a carousellike machine. The statues are of famous women through history as well as having local historical murderesses and victims displayed. Living with the professor and Elfi is a strange doctor. Amidst this strange foursided triangle women are disappearing. The story is'nt too hard to figure out and much is given away early on. What it does do quite nicely is create a slowlypaced mood that leads to an interesting if not wholly imaginative denouement. The style infused throughout the picture is a credit to Italian director Giorgio Ferroni. The use of colors the settings the haunting carousel music the waxworks themselves all help create the oppressive almost hallucinogenic mood. The acting is pretty good overall with Wolfgang Preiss as the complex doctor and especially Robert Boehme as Professor Gregorious Wahl standing out. Scilla Gabel as Elfi is just gorgeous as is Liana Orfei as one of the girls that gets missing. The production looks very German in manner and style  another compliment to the director. There are several scenes which stand out the first time we see the carousel moving nay almost cranking itself away past those that have come to gawk at it the druginduced dream sequence Hans goes through and the ending  a real barnburner! Mill of the Stone Women isn't a fastpaced horror film but if you like movies like Black Sunday or Bava's work in general  Ferroni seems to have some similar directorial flair.".

But Mill has a lot more to offer than just a mashup of those two great pictures. In it handsome Pierre Brice plays Hans van Harnim a writer in what appears to be late 19th century Holland who goes to the windmill home of one Prof. Wahl to do a story on his unusual abode and the professorsculptor's carousel collection of grotesque female statues. What follows for van Harnim is quite the nightmarish experience as he discovers the secrets of both this statuary and Wahl's mysterious daughter Elfy. While not nearly as classic or seminal as two other horror films that premiered that yearMario Bava's Black Sunday and Uncle Alfie's Psycho then again how many pictures are?Mill still manages to provide some shudders. The film begins quite eerily and its unusual backdrop that of the misty canal district in Holland's countryside is a unique one for a horror film. An hallucinatory freakout sequence that transpires roughly halfway in is truly disorienting before the picture turns to more conventional albeit still quite fun madscientist fare. The film also gives us handsome sets nicely muted colors interesting direction by Giorgio Ferroni and perhaps the most inspired use of a creepy windmill since Uncle Alfie's Foreign Correspondent 1940. And almost stealing the show in her role as Elfy is Scilla Gabel a gorgeous actress with Sophia Lorentype looks and the otherworldly air of the young Barbara Steele. In all a very fine horror outing nicely presented on this DVD from the good folks at Mondo Macabro and with loads of fine extras to boot.".

In the same year in which Mario Bava brought us the arguably greatest Gothic Horror film ever and in my opinion one of the greatest films ever made with his masterpiece La Maschera Del Demonio aka. Black Sunday and Roger Corman began the arguably greatest Horror cycle in film history with the brilliant House Of Usher director Giorgio Ferroni enriched the world of Horror with this atmospheric and hauntingly beautiful gem called Il Mulino Delle Donne Di Pietra aka. Mill Of The Stone Women a film with an incredible sense of Gothic beauty and eerie atmosphere that no true Horror fan could possibly afford to miss. A FrenchItalian Coproduction the film is based on an unknown story by Pieter van Weigen. The creepy morbid and incredibly fascinating storyline is very similar to that of Georges Franju's masterpiece Les Yeux Sans Visage aka. Eyes Without A Face which was made in the same year but the execution is different in style. Morbid stories about mad scientists who target innocent young women in order to restore life youth or beauty of one specific young woman were a very popular Horror theme in the late 50s and early 60s and tales of the kind are still among the most fascinating topics the Horror genre has ever brought forth. What also makes this film an absolute must is the eerie atmosphere the ingenious photography superb settings and mesmerizing use of color.Journalist Hans Pierre Brice comes to the small town of Veeze in order to write a story about the 'Mill Of The Stone Women' a macabre museum in which female statues in morbid situations such as executions are displayed on a millwheel. The museum is kept by Professor Wahl Herbert A.E. Bhme who keeps his beautiful daughter Elfi Scilla Gabel locked in the Windmill. The house is furthermore inhabited by the sinister doctor Bohlem Wolfgang Preiss... I don't want to give away too much of the story but I can assure it gets morbid haunting and fascinating. The film's visual style and morbid atmosphere often earns it comparisons to Mario Bava's masterpieces. The locations and settings are beautiful and immensely eerie alike and the brilliant camerawork and excellently eerie score contribute a lot to the creepy and unsettling atmosphere. The performances are also very good and the characters are intriguing. I am not a very big fan of Pierre Brice in general where I live he is mainly known for the incredibly cheesy German Karl May flicks but he delivers an excellent performance here. The highest praise however has to go to Herbert A. E. Bhme for his brilliant portrayal of the sinister professor and especially to the ravishing Scilla Gabel. Gabel is a stunning beauty and great actress and she delivers a wonderful performance as the mysterious and seductive Elfi Wahl. Wolfgang Preiss is very sinister as the doctor and Dany Carell fits well in her role of the innocent girl. Mill Of The Stone Women is an elegant and haunting masterpiece that no lover of Gothic greatness can possibly afford to miss!".

What Hans doesn't know is that Wahl and Bohlem kidnap young women using their blood to keep Elfie alive.

But Bohlem's in love with Elfie Elfie's in love with Hans Hans is in love with a fellow art student LiselotteDany Carrel and Gregorius will not have anyone complicating his keeping Elfie alive. Bohlem's desire for Elfie will complicate his working relationship with Gregorius. But a true thorn in their side is Hans who poses a threat to their neatly run operation when he discovers that Elfie is in fact dead. Developing a possible serum for Elfie Bohlem discovers that a certain person's blood type would in fact be needed so that they would never need supplies of blood again..the very one's blood they need is Liselotte's. They will try to keep Hans at bay by putting him through the rigors of a hallucinogenic drug which produces a nightmarish effect blurring reality and fantasy. But the situation becomes heated between Gregorius and Bohlem over Elfie and Hans will pursue the whereabouts of his missing love Liselotte.Superb Gothic chiller with the most perfect setting rivaling even castles..I mean seriously a windmill which not houses a carnival of exhibits made with sculptures of human victims..and operating the sculptures which escape from a door bursting forth to often startle the audience are the gears within the windmill quite an architectural achievement but a basement which contains the lab where Bohlem conducts his blood treatments! It's too good to be true but it is. I'm not sure why others haven't used a windmill more because the director proves just how wonderful an atmospheric tool it is. I guess it's partly inspired by Frankenstein except the director creates inventive ways to use the windmill. But it seems that..judging by the climaxthat the director doesn't forget where his inspiration come from. The hallucinogenic nightmare sequence is quite a spellbinding experience..we are just as bewildered at what is transpiring as Hans is. Bhme and Preiss are appropriate villains both desiring Elfie's safety and beauty intact. Bhme has a great devious scene where he hovers over a kidnapped victim tied to a slab about to have her blood drained promising her situation would be all over soon carrying a look of mania on his face..the camera looks upward as he stares directly at us his eyes wide with madness. I'm not sure why Mill of the Stone Women isn't more widely known..I only found out about it through word of mouth. I think this film belongs alongside the great masterworks made by Ferroni's contemporaries in the 60's Bava Fisher  Corman. The climax..the windmill and Gregorius and Elfie's fatecertainly ends in a blaze of glory. Mill of the Stone Women is an atmospheric marvel any horror fan with an opportunity to check out.".

The climax..the windmill and Gregorius and Elfie's fatecertainly ends in a blaze of glory. Mill of the Stone Women is an atmospheric marvel any horror fan with an opportunity to check out.";

	schema:reviewBody "Mill of the Stone Women is the story of a researcher named Hans who is finishing a book on the famous sculptor Professor Wahl and his carousel. The carousel features wax representations of women being tortured and killed in a variety of sadistic and inventive ways. A meeting with the Professor's beautiful seductive daughter Elfi ignites conflicting passions within Hans because of his one true love Liselotte. Things are even more complicated because breaking the news to Elfi will not be easy. She suffers from a rare disease that can cause death if she becomes too upset or disturbed. In addition Hans is convinced that Professor Wahl is up to some twisted experiments that may involve several of the local women including his Liselotte. Hans must solve the mystery of the windmill and the carousel if he is to save himself and the one woman he cares about.What Works Atmosphere Atmosphere Atmosphere. If you're into atmosphere with your horror look no further than Mill of the Stone Women. Most movies can't claim to have 110 of the atmosphere found here. The barren landscape the isolated windmill the constant overcast skies the dark corridors with secret rooms in the windmill the eerie music the twisted carousel of death and the Gothic trappings everywhere you look all add to a movie that just drips with atmosphere. The movie takes it's time and doesn't rush or try to force things. There's a real foreboding sense of unease that runs throughout the movie. There are moments when you might think the atmosphere is going to literally ooze from the screen into your living room.Scilla Gabel. Gabel is one of those women of the 60s that I don't think exist anymore. She's from that Sophia Loren  Claudia Cardinale  Daliah Lavi mold of women that were a product of that time. She may never be confused with a great actress but she has a screen presence that's hard to beat.Prof. Gregorius Wahl. What a character! Robert Boehme does an excellent job of playing a mad but goofy genius. By the end of Mill of the Stone Women though it's easy to feel some sympathy for him as his dreams are shattered. It's an excellent piece of acting from a man whose acting credits only include this movie.Wooden Shoes. Any movie with people wearing wooden shoes has to get a bonus point from me.What Doesn't Work Slow Going. For me this is a plus. But I put it here to warn those who prefer a movie with a killing or explosion every five minutes.Love Story. Because Hans represents a new exciting life it's easy to see why Elfi might quickly fall for him. And because Elfi is such a looker it's easy to see why Hans might be interested in Elfi. But the fact that both are declaring their undying love for each other after one fiveminute meeting stretches the imagination quite a bit.In the end Mill of the Stone Women is one of the finest examples of a Gothic atmospheric movie ever made. The film plays like a combination of The House of Wax meets Eyes Without a Face. It's a wonderful movie that I enjoy more each time I get the chance to watch.".

	schema:headline " Lush Gothic atmosphere with a haunting plot line";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on a Flemish short story by Pieter Van Weigen Mill of the Stone Women is an excellent slice of Eurocult Gothic horror. The film is along the same lines as films by Mario Bava most notably Black Sunday and Kill Baby Kill and just like the aforementioned masterpieces bathes in its own atmosphere and most of the horror is drawn from that. Horror is a genre that people often mistake for not having many ideas but films like this prove otherwise. Here we have a story that couldn't be further away from the 'norm' in horror and on a technical level Mill of the Stone Women is both inventive and influential. The macabre plot follows a young journalist named Hans who travels to Holland to write an article on the mysterious sculptor who lives in a mill that the locals have nicknamed The Mill of the Stone Women. While there he meets the Professor's beautiful daughter but she's damaged goods as she suffers from a sinister malady that means she has to remain within the mill. Is there something yet more morbid to this intriguing set up...?The mill at the centre of the piece makes for an excellent location for this story to take place in. Old castles are a more common location for Gothic horror so the fact that this one takes place in a mill again differentiates it from the norm and is yet another example of the imagination behind the story. The colour scheme is largely quite drab and to be honest I'd have preferred either more striking colours or a black and white picture...as the inbetween doesn't look good in my opinion. That's pretty much the only thing I don't like about this film in regards to the style however. The plot moves slowly but this means that the film has time to both build up it's plot and wallow in the atmosphere. One of the trademarks of Italian horror is a muddled plot and things that don't completely make sense and this film adheres to that. There are several threads within the plot and a number of them are left unexplained by the conclusion...which is a shame. Still the final conclusion is fitting and at least it doesn't suffer from bad dubbing! Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mill of the Stone Women is a regretfully undiscovered gem of authentic Gothic craftsmanship that totally blew me away. It's not an easy puppy to come across despite the recent DVDrelease so I had to purchase an entirely Frech version called Le Moulin des Supplices. But eventually beholding the beauty of this film was worth every effort I took for finding it for sure! Like stated in the review title this is one of the most atmospheric tales ever told and even though the basic premise might not be unique a fascinating Gothic experience that will mesmerize you from start to finish.The story is set in a remote Dutch village the land of the windmills! where Professor Wahl slickly turned his mill into a macabre history museum. He's an artist whose handmade carousel and sculptures attract many viewers as also the young journalist Hans. But Wahl simultaneously is a father whose exquisite daughter Elphi suffers from an incurable illness that forces him to keep her hidden in the windmill. When Hans meets Elphi during his stay Professor Wahl fears that his presence will have a bad influence on her fragile health. Because of all the mystery and Wahl's distant behavior Hans suspects that he has more hidden secrets than just an ill daughter.... Because of the period of release the mood and the highquality level Mill of the Stone Women often gets compared with the repertoire of Mario Bava. I second this statement and  believe me  that's quite a compliment as I consider Bava the greatest director cinema has ever known. This is a slowpaced masterpiece that makes the most out of its eerie set pieces and isolated locations. The ominous windmill emphases the intriguing Gothic effect terrifically while the use of sound creates a constant disturbance. Rather than to gross you out with immediate gruesomeness or sleaze the suspenseful plot builds itself up to somewhat expected but still ferocious climax that will be memorized forever by fans of classic horror. I won't spoil the actual finale but it's not the film's biggest anyway as it combines the equally brilliant premises of Mystery of the Wax Musem Eyes without a face and even Frankenstein. Mill of the Stone Women also influenced many eurohorror films afterwards like for example Jess Franco's The Awful Dr. Orloff. And I'm not done yet since simply every aspect of this film is praiseworthy. The camerawork is stunning and often quite groundbreaking. When it's believed that Hans is hallucinating the implementation of different shades and rough camera movements increase the confusioneffect. The characters are efficiently spooky! Especially Dr. Bolem played by Wolfgang Dr. Mabuse Preiss and Professor Wahl Boehme who strangely hasn't got any other acting experience are impressive villainsmad scientists. Mill of the Stone Women is essential viewing for Mario Bava fanatics and any other genre fan who appreciates a solid gothhorror monument.".

Every inch of the windmill is ominous and each room and there are many has its own distinct feel lighting and color palette. With this strong foundation in place the movie builds in the details including a wild hallucination scene the actual workings of the carousel a daughter who appeared very dead but is soon quite fine and many others.Despite being a visual feast well acted and having a solid if not overly original plot line the movie still suffers from a sizable problem Pacing. As a diehard fan of '60's horror I have no beef with a deliberate buildup but in this case it goes a bit overboard. There are a fair share of scenes that are filled with stretches of unnecessary dialog and lots of wandering around the mill with no real reason to be found at the end. Tighter editing would have helped immensely.Flaws and all Mill Of The Stone Women is a classy film that needs to be seen.

	schema:reviewBody "Another classic Italian Gothic which has an unusual and effective setting an old windmill to distinguish it from all the others of the period. MILL OF THE STONE WOMEN is a slowburning but often effective creepfest which makes fine use of the almost expressionistic sets of the interior of the windmill filled with odd angles and bits of female dummies and skulls littered all over making for a highly distinctive visual look. Filmed in Holland the brief shots of the flat countryside which surrounds the windmill help to give it an authentic look and a chilly atmosphere and Ferroni makes excellent use of colour to create a morbidlybeautiful looking movie. On top of this a fine and creepy score just adds to the tension.The plot itself when it comes down to it is nothing particularly new. The idea of a doctor forced to kill young women to sustain the life of his ill daughter was very popular in the period this was made and variations on the theme can be seen in many other horror films like Freda's THE VAMPIRES ATOM AGE VAMPIRE THE AWFUL DR. ORLOFF and even the French classic EYES WITHOUT A FACE. Mixed in with this plot which incidentally only comes to the fore in the final third of the movie the beginning is just atmospherebuilding and mysteries with no real answers are some genuinely macabre HOUSE OF WAXstyle shenanigans involving the bodies of the dead being turned to stone and displayed on the carousel the creaky contraption which is the film's focus point and a highly effective image of horror.Castwise the film benefits from the presence of the creepy actor Robert Boehme as the professor. Boehme puts in a restrained and ultimately sympathetic performance here but he's still pretty chilling. Also effective is the German Wolfgang Priess he of the '60s Mabuse films as a sinister doctor living in the windmill he doesn't have much to do until the end in which his part in the horror and his explanations for his actions finally come out but his role helps bolster the movie and he has some interesting exchanges with Boehme usually the roles of the two men are combined into one in these sort of films. The actresses don't really have much to work with especially Dany Carrel whose sole presence is to provide a female victim for the finale and Scilla Gabel's role as the diseased daughter is seriously underdeveloped. Ultimately the film's biggest failing in the cast is Pierre Brice's turn as the hero Hans von Arnam Brice is wooden and uninteresting and seemingly unable to carry a lead by himself.MILL OF THE STONE WOMEN really does pick up for the predictably fiery conclusion which has some great action but director Giorgio Ferroni really needs to learn a thing or two about pacing as the first hour of this film is a long haul and lacking in incident. Compare this to a similarlythemed film like Freda's THE TERRIBLE SECRET OF DR. HICHCOCK which expertly racks up the tension and suspense for the first hour and its clear that MILL OF THE STONE WOMEN needs more of that suspense and buildup. The atmosphere is perfect yes but something is missing. Don't get me wrong however this is still a perfectly watchable if only a little flawed Gothic horror film with spoton visuals and sets and worth tracking down for fans of horror from the period.".

The action takes place sometime around the last turn of the century. The mill looks nice otherwise there aren't so much interesting locations  nor interesting or beautiful actors to that matter. It just drags along and once you've figured the plot out you also know that it ends with an inescapable fire that destroys the mill and lets the good young couple escape in the nick of time.

Sadly the film sort of fails to deliver on the promise of that title. But it's still pretty interesting.If you're a big enough horror fan to have heard of this movie you'll probably like it. It's a slowpaced Gothic piece in the same tradition as the British Hammer movies. It even has the standard cast of characters for a Gothic horror  a sinister doctor a corrupt professor an earnest young man a sexy mystery woman and a wholesomely pretty nice woman. This kind of stuff is so familiar to me at this point that it feels like a comfy old security blanket.The best part of the film is the first half when the goingson at the mill are still cryptic and unexplained. The second half gets a little predictable and lurid and there are a few too many scenes of women getting strapped to tables and menaced with needles. Dare I say this kind of stuff is sexist? Erotic sure but also sexist. And in a very strange and somewhat disappointing twist the villains pretty much defeat themselves! Despite my reservations this is still a decent film thanks to some atmospheric sets and unusual ideas. As I said if you're enough of a horror buff to have heard about it you should definitely check it out.".

	schema:headline " mad artist murders in Dutch windmill";
	schema:reviewBody "This is clearly a movie of emulation the producer or director were excited by what Hammer Coreman and Bava were up to right about 19581960 and threw their hat into the ring. As a result most of the auteur elements are imitative but very good imitations! Two fabulous tableaux both in a hallucination sequence Elfi the sick daughter rising from her deathbed and later her hands extended out of a heavy curtain. Otherwise 50s horror was studiostylish  with storybook quality production design and plots wellconstructed and quickly dispatched this one holds up to the standard. As to the theme An older artist living in a mill with a wax museumlike carousel in it outside of a Dutch town tends to his very ill daughter in a very creative way not unlike in Barbara Steele's Nightmare Castle. Mad scientists are great but for me mad artists are even better. Stories where the veneer of art is torn off by the psychosis of the artist represent true horror they throw us back upon very primitive fears of representation. In one scene cut from the print see the French clip in the extras a young lady mentions that as a child she thought merry go round figures had real dwarfs inside.

	onyx:emotionText "This is clearly a movie of emulation the producer or director were excited by what Hammer Coreman and Bava were up to right about 19581960 and threw their hat into the ring. As a result most of the auteur elements are imitative but very good imitations! Two fabulous tableaux both in a hallucination sequence Elfi the sick daughter rising from her deathbed and later her hands extended out of a heavy curtain. Otherwise 50s horror was studiostylish  with storybook quality production design and plots wellconstructed and quickly dispatched this one holds up to the standard. As to the theme An older artist living in a mill with a wax museumlike carousel in it outside of a Dutch town tends to his very ill daughter in a very creative way not unlike in Barbara Steele's Nightmare Castle. Mad scientists are great but for me mad artists are even better. Stories where the veneer of art is torn off by the psychosis of the artist represent true horror they throw us back upon very primitive fears of representation. In one scene cut from the print see the French clip in the extras a young lady mentions that as a child she thought merry go round figures had real dwarfs inside. Later she screams and faints when the sculptural figures of the artist's greatgrandfather's carousel featuring Joan of Arc etc go too Gothic.

Even though I'm not Jewish I found the film totally entertaining. This film is more than slap stick comedy woven into a worn out display of oneliners.

They call it Keeping Up with the Steins open up with a Stein bar mitzvah then ignore them for the entire movie until the very end. You can't suddenly try to add a plot at the end of the movie... it doesn't work.Further no one would possibly let the father do what he did. The wife the kid ANYONE ELSE would have said something. How about get over it this day is about your son deal with your issues later. The day of the bar mitzvah is not the time to let that happen.Also someone rediscovering Judaism learning his Haftarah and doing all that other stuff in less than a week? It's just too ridiculous.I agree with other posters... it had potential but the characters were not developed well the plot tried to do too much but then simply ignored the subplots how about sacred feather and the cameraman? We're going to have him make passes at her like 3 times then never bring it up it tried to create. Parts were funny but the entire second half dragged to the point of becoming unbearable.

The backstory of their relationship how it affected Piven and how they've let bygones be bygones while Piven clutches to his old grudges is beautifully and deftly handled by the director. Marshall delivers the father figure as likable to an audience as the characters he created on network television back in the 70's.One more interesting thing about the 'Steins' you don't have to be Jewish to appreciate the humor you just have to recognize the strengths and failings of every human being represented in these characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a comingofage story with a twist. There is more than one person comingofage.In a nutshell it is the story of an angstridden thirteen year old boy whose troubles are doubled by his pending bar mitzvah.His father Jeremy Piven is a Hollywood agent intent on turning the bar mitzvah into a recruiting event to keep and grow his client base. This is complicated when his former partner played by Larry Miller throws a mega bar mitzvah for his own son with the same intention in mind.Piven's angst at creating the perfect bar mitzvahrecruitment event is made worse by the arrival of his hippylike father Gary Marshall who is attached to an early 40something New Ager Daryl Hannah and teaching English to children on the Navajo reservation. I guess it's supposed to be funny just looking at Marshall and Hannah. Marshall's and Piven's characters are estranged the father having walked out on Piven and his mother Doris Roberts 26 years earlier.We have an angstridden triangle between the three men grandfather father and grandson. The trinity in a Jewish story? Indeed the only struggles in the story are between men. The men have no plot difficulties or unresolved issues with the women or the women with each other. Frankly there is no way men can have unresolved issues and not emotionally involve the women in their lives. It's just not realistic not even in a satirical sense.I gave this film a 4 because of the story. It has a significant flaw. There is just no moment when I felt a human connection with the three men. I was shown all the events that led to the allimportant climax and then I felt nothing. It was like discovering I had swallowed a Chicklet instead of Viagra. No emotion. No ah ha! moment. I was more concerned that there wasn't enough butter on my popcorn. And because I felt no emotional connection with or between the three men I did not feel their catharsis. And that's a real problem for a comingofage film. There were a few nice moments between the grandfather and grandson but that was it.Not good.Regardless of what several mainstream press critics wrote and to the writer's and director's credit I didn't see one stereotype. There were a few undeveloped characters caricatures really but that too is the fault of the storytellers it's lazy not malicious.Why it happened this way I have no idea. Maybe they were forced to cut the film strangely or leave out things they wanted put in due to money constraints. It just doesn't work.The acting was fine featuring some of the best actors on television today. That made it marginally watchable. Maybe television is where this film should have been sold. I see this as a Starz film. Not quite HBO or Showtime material. IFC or Sundance will be its home in about six months.I counsel the writer and director to learn from this experience. You have to flesh out your characters more and let us in on their inner struggles. Don't tell us. Show us. That's what makes drama and comedy work especially on film. Make us as tense as the characters appear because of the conflicts within the situation and then resolve the audience's and characters' tensions at the same time. To paraphrase Woody Allen if it's a comedy make us bend with the character if it's a drama make us break.For example don't match Richard Benjamin's BillO'Reillyloving rabbi character with Marshall's tolerant grandfather and do nothing with it. That could have been some very funny stuff as the two men synthesize their worldviews. Instead pffft. Nothing.And finally have a bigger theme something the audience can sink its teeth into. I'm still not quite sure what it is. And I won't venture a guess because I don't want to spoil the ending for anybody. Go back and watch how Chaplin created and then unknotted tension in City Lights how Sam Woods did it in A Night at the Opera how Marshall did it in The Flamingo Kid another comingofage story or even how it's done in the simplest episode of Piven's Entourage. Have somebody check the treatment and script thoroughly for theme conflict and catharsis. Then try it again.I don't want this to sound angry or meanspirited. But the situation within the film was just lousy with potential for a better film. It was all wasted. And that's a shame.".

	schema:reviewBody "This seemed like such a good idea.While most Jewish parents try to give their kids a nice barbat mitzvahbecause this is such an important event in an observant Jew's lifethere are a few who go to extremes as exemplified by Zachary Stein's parents at the beginning of the film. Let me reiterate that parents like these who spend obscene amounts of money on their child's b'nai mitzvah trappings rather than keeping the affair modest and more focused on the spiritual aspect are the exception and not the rule.I was hoping that the movie would be a wry yet amusing look at the process of Bar Mitzvah oneupsmanship with the rival family or families realizing in the end that what is really important is what the Bar Mitzvah symbolizes and not how lavish an affair it is. Kind of a Jewish version of National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation perhaps? Unfortunately as a few others have pointed out most of the movie is not inspired or amusing nor does it stay focused on the fascinating issue of oneupsmanship. Rather it seems to end up centering largely on the unfunny Garry Marshall character Irwin Fiedler the Bar Mitzvah boy's grandfather.Turns out Grandpa Fiedler ditched his family years agoit's not clear if he ever paid child support but it's a safe bet he didn't seeing as how he couldn't seem to earn money back then a major bone of contention in his marriage to Grandma Fiedlerand his son the Bar Mitzvah boy's father Adam played by Jeremy Piven remains resentful about having been abandoned.The movie IMHO tries to drum up a bit of sympathy for Grandpa Irwin portraying him as a good decent guy in several uninspired scenes where he helps his grandson. In an effort to justify a possible reconciliation between Irwin and his estranged son the movie even seems to make an effort to downplay the seriousness of Irwin's abandonment of his familyafter all as Grandma Fiedler points out they both made mistakes in their marriage and as Irwin tells his son Haven't you ever made a big mistake you couldn't fix? I didn't buy it. I never found Irwin Fiedler to be likable. Moreover I couldn't help feeling that while Grandma may have made mistakes in the marriage too and while Adam may have made fatal mistakes with his clients Irwin's mistakes were 1 not liking his work a feeling which took precedence over feeding his young family and 2 abandoning his family. How in any way can one minimize this colossal selfishness? How can these mistakes be compared to a few mistakes Adam may have made with his clients? And whatever Grandma Fiedler's mistakes may have been she didn't just up and abandon her family. The movie never properly addressed this important topic IMO instead it aimed for a more lighthearted treatment of the issue in keeping with the overall trite and shallow tone of the script.Something else about the script that bugged A number of times when someone used a Yiddish or Hebrew word mensch for example it seemed that there was either a tiny pause before and after the word or else it was a bit louder or a little overenunciated. As though the writers or director thought thatmaybe for the benefit of the nonJews in the audience?all of these words must be Spoken. Very. Clearly. And. Distinctly. Unfortunately this made me feel that the foreign words were almost an afterthoughtas though the writer went back over the script looking for places to insert quaint little Yiddish expressions How about I add the word mishigas to this line of Irwin's here? An effort to give this film a more Jewish flavor I guess. But it seemed a clumsy device to me.Finally let me just add that I could not suspend disbelief enough to buy Darryl Hannah as a love interest for the geriatric notmuchgoingforhim Irwin Fiedler. I can only wonder if Casting was given specific instructions on what type of love interest would be acceptable to Mr. Marshall.Whatev.Were there any bright spots in this trite production? YesJami Gertz was delightful as the Bar Mitzvah boy's mother. And the opening sequence with Zachary Stein's Bar Mitzvah was a hoot.Given the general lack of depth in this film and the number of rather juvenile plot devices such as when Benjamin is at the Bima to deliver his Haftorah and he deals with his stage fright I'd guess that this film may well appeal to teens with the ideal target audience given the Bar Mitzvahrelated subject matter being Jewish teens.".

This movie has a target audience and that is the audience that to any extent of the way can relate to it. Its a little slow and at some times feels as if you are missing a scene. Nevertheless the jokes are there and I did laugh. As a coming of age story I would give it a 5 but as a Jewish comedy I would give it a 9 so that brings us to a seven. Jermey is funny as always and a couple camio roles that I don't wish to reveal really brings the whole movie together and at the same time has you brawling in your seats.".

	schema:reviewBody "The idea of young boy arriving at the age where he is considered a man is celebrated traditionally by Jews. In this age of consumerism most 13 year old boys are given lavish feasts in which expense seems to be no object by parents that have the means to do so. The feasts evidently must have a theme. When we first meet the people in this mildly funny movie they are in the middle of a bar mitzvah with a Titanic theme. We watch as the young boy arrives in a replica of a ship posing as Leonardo DeCaprio and even colliding with an iceberg. This party cost about half a million dollars to Arnie Stein a Hollywood type that can well afford it.As Benjamin's own bar mitzvah approaches his parents Adam and Joanne Fiedler must make a decision about how big a party they want and what theme will their son choose. Benjamin who appears more grounded than his Hollywood agent's father only wants to have his paternal grandfather a person he has never met at the party. Benjamin plays a trick by sending Irwin Fidler an invitation with a date of two weeks before the actual event. Little prepares him for the character his grandfather turns out to be.Irwin who left his family when Adam at a young age comes to town with his New Agetype girlfriend who goes by the name of Saved Feather to stay at his son's mansion. This brings back bad emotions Adam has kept bottled inside him. He can't forgive his father for what he and his mother Rose had to endure. The old man is a changed man and his love for his newly found family serves to get Adam's forgiveness.Scott Marshall the director who is the son of Garry Marshall follows in his own father's foot steps and finds his way into this ethnic comedy that shows how people must compete with one another to show who is the one giving the best and most elaborate party something that probably the children feel too overwhelmed as it's the case with Benjamin. The film points out to basic problems in our society in which we must outdo our friends and even our own family in order to prove we are superior or just to prove we have more money than they.Garry Marshall steals the show with his Irwin. Mr. Marshall knows comedy well and knows what buttons to press to put the audience in his pockets. Doris Roberts is tremendously appealing as Rose the wife that has had to endure a lot after Irwin left her. Jeremy Piven and Jamie Gertz are perfect as the parents facing a dilemma about to go broke in order to keep up with the Steins. Daryl Sabara is an excellent actor who shows he knows what he is doing. Daryl Hannah has some good moments as the evolved New Ager. Larry Miller and Richard Benjamin are seen in supporting roles.Much has been said about this comedy as far as being targeted to Jews but in our experience not being Jewish we found it speaks a universal language and people of other backgrounds will enjoy it as well.".

Yes there were stereotypes and yes I'd like it more if the family appeared to be more interested in their religion than just getting their kid through the ceremony. However this movie did show the kid Benjamin as a dynamic character who did grow and change for the better.

Recently we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.It is the Jewish version of My big fat Greek wedding. It is hilarious and will play very well in NY Los Angeles and in all the communities where Jewish people live. But remember My Big Fat Greek Wedding did 245 million dollars because it was so very funny. This movie is so much like it and very very funny.".

Rather it has become the elaborate parties that families engage in to outdo one another.Such as the case with this film. In addition to the obvious plot we are subjected to an estranged relationship by a father's abandonment of his family 26 years before and his attempt to reestablish a relationship with his bitter son at the time of his grandson's Bar Mitzvah celebration.Nice seeing Richard Benjamin back in films after many years behind the camera. His role as the rabbi is brief but to the point.Gary Marshall steals the film as the grandfather and should be Oscar nominated in the supporting category. Doris Roberts wonderful as always plays the understanding grandmother. She is willing to admit that she was to blame as well for her husband abandoning the family years before. Ms. Roberts seems to be comfortable in Jewish related theme films as is evident by the television rendition of The Diary of Anne Frank the television film Yiddish with Harold Gould and the 1975 film Hester Street with Carol Kane. She is continuing down the path of the late Shelley Winters.A film for all which shows what religion should be all about.".

This is true of ALL kinds of traditions  religious cultural etc. Keeping Up With the Steins deals touches on that and the kid's father trying to out do his neighbors and prove he's doing better than those who failed him in his life.

OK that happens a lot as well but he always seems to be hilarious.The point is this is all very familiar ground but nonetheless remains pretty funny and a very cute lighthearted film. Piven and his dad played by Garry Marshall dad of director Scott Marshall have their bitter moments but for the most part it is played pretty straightforward as a coming of age comedy with more adult roles than usual.Daryl Sabara plays 13 year old Benjamin Fiedler who is preparing for his bar Mitzi's the rite to manhood in the Jewish religion. Helping him are Richard Benjamin as his Rabbi and his long lost grandfather played by the charming Garry Marshall who shows up with his significantly younger hippie girlfriend played by Daryl Hannah the second Kill Bill reference of the film. Benjamin is a wreck as his parents compete with the Stein's over the size of the party while he dreads the chants that must be performed in front of the audience.The best scenes are between Marshall and Sabara but Piven delivers his usual fine work as the bitter dadgrownup son. You definitely don't have to be Jewish to get this movie or to enjoy it. It doesn't aspire to be much more than a cozy couple of hours at the theatre and that front it succeeds.".

I must tell you that my favorite in the entire movie was actress Sandra Taylor who played Raylene Stein. This gal is drop dead gorgeous. In my book I rate her a '13' in both looks and acting. I found her to be most entertaining and very funny. I also enjoyed Larry Miller Cheryl Hines and Daryl Sabora's roles. I think Daryl Sabora was the perfect choice for this movie. Bravo to Scott Marshall for putting out such an entertaining flick. I left the theater feeling like I really got my money's worth this time.".

And they had just shown X Men 3 its a 6 hour flight and up pops the Jewish kid talking about his Bar Mitzvah MAN! I started looking around to see if anyone was like gonna freak out because this movie is unmistakably Jewish! Luckily no incidents involved and I got home to Kuwait safe. I just had to tell that story to me if they can show a movie about Jews on an Arab flight there may be hope in the world after all. About the movie I once converted to Reform Jewish to marry a Jewish girl when I was much younger that didn't work out and I didn't keep up with it but growing up with a lot of Jews in New York I did find it humorous at times. I would only see Reform Jews truly enjoying this movie because the characters don't strike me as very conservative. It's no American Pie because the kid is only 13 and its really not for kids so this movie is really hard to like a whole lot but I did watch it through because I was on a flight and I chuckled a little. All light weight in the end though there was little resolution done with the Grandfather and the relationships he left behind like his Wife.".

More than the dialect or the actors the region itself and its people are beautifully pictured and the spirit is well captured. Clichs are used for comedic purpose and are dispelled instead of being woven. Amateurs will also find an incredible short appearance by Michel Galabru my favourite part of the film. The film never aims to be realistic and never seems pretentious but the feel of Northern France is genuine.In the end it is a truly pleasing film funny true to itself fresh and nicely French but not the part you are most used to seeing is what you should expect.".

If you like crosscultural fishoutofwater movies such as My Big Fat Greek Wedding you're going to love this story of a postmaster who gets reassigned to the apparently misunderstood in many senses northern region of France and how lives change accordingly.But what really impressed me the most were the subtitles. The English subtitles amazingly captured all the nuances of the convoluted wordplay that was obviously happening on screen. This becomes an even more impressive feat when you consider that much of the verbal fun of the movie comes from the various misunderstandings between the Frenchspeaking lead character and the folks who speak in the northern provincial Schticks dialect. Because of this added layer of complexity I realized that capturing these dynamics cannot be the product of any ordinary clerical translation job.And it turns out I was right. I later read that the director Dany Boon actually took an active role in ensuring that all the subtitles for the different languages properly and lovingly reflected the nuances and intent of the on screen banter. With truly impressive results.So kudos to Boon for paying attention to this particular detail. Oftentimes foreign audiences miss out on much of the seeming injokes that movies play for their local audiences. Schticks made it a point to share its world with everyone else. Great job.".

It is an excellent comedy with the two great actors Dany Boon and Kad Merad but the movie has also its philosophical dramatical and sad parts.This movie is extremely funny it is really difficult to make me laugh but this film made me laugh really hard several times. The best examples are when the postman and his director are having some drinks with half of the town while they deliver the letters or the scenes in the old mining town of Bergues This movie is extremely touching and emotional. When the excellent Kad Merad tells his new partners and friends about his lies and mistakes you feel really sad and ashamed for him. The movie's finale is also very emotional and a perfect and really philosophical conclusion.But the real star of the movie is the whole region the NordPasdeCalais where this movie is settled. This film presents strange and funny accents of the Sticks their historical and charming towns their way of living and thinking their relation to the other parts of France and the clichs and prejudices about both sides. The NordPasdeCalais is more than just a part of France it is a country within a country and a culture within a culture. I have been in this region for some weeks during an exchange program and I can tell that those people living there are mostly openminded very sympathetic and have many reasons to be proud of their region. I really like this movie as it reminds me of a few very positive and unforgettable memories. And I like the movie because it is different and finally a French film that doesn't present us Paris over and over again. The France is way more than just Paris and there are many beautiful and unique regions and people to discover and this successful and charming movie shows this to all the people out there.For everyone that is interested in a touching emotional and simply profound comedy movie or anyone that likes foreign cultures and lifestyles this unique movie is an absolute masterpiece. I hope that other French regions will follow this example and make similar movies in the future and take the focus off Paris a little bit.".

	schema:headline " Should please French Canadians  Chti' Vee Wonder !!";
	schema:reviewBody "This film which should be a big success amongst the qubecois and other Frenchspeaking Canadians for reasons I will explain later came out recently here in France and is having pretty substantial success. The plot  basically a manager of the Post Office in Salon de Provence France is trying to obtain a transfer to the Riviera in order to satisfy his neurotic and depressive wife who wants to live near the sea. Just when he thinks he's clinched an opening in SanarysurMer he learns that preference was given to a handicapped candidate. He then tries to pass off as handicapped wheelchair and all during an interview for another post in the same area. All goes well and the interviewer is convinced that he is handicapped and cannot walk when at the end of the interview he stands up to say goodbye and thereby gives himself away ! This is a pretext for a blme or sanction and the poor guy's punishment is to be transferred for a period of two years right to the other end of the country to Bergues in the Nord department not far from Lille. To someone from the far south of France going to the north is like going to the north pole and his wife's old uncle brilliantly played by Michel Galabru warns him about the dangers and sub zero temperatures of the north so our friend leaves his wife in Salon and makes the journey himself planning to return home every second weekend. The purpose of the film is in a lighthearted and satirical way is to introduce the spectator to life in the north of France and to have a bash at some of the stereotypes commonly held about this region. The film contains numerous linguistic jokes and references and non French speakers will have difficulty in appreciating the full force and effect of the plays on words. Chti'mi is a dialect spoken in the north of France which tends to muddle c's and ch's use mi and ti to mean me and you braire bray to mean moan or complain as well as frequent usage of the word biroute which elsewhere in France is used for something more crude as well as lavish helpings of the word quoi what eh ! pronounced as it if were quow. I can see the film having enormous success in the Frenchspeaking area of Canada as the Chti accent is not dissimilar to that used by the qubecois and I feel intuitively that the latter will relish in it. Director Dany Boon is actually a Chti or northerner himself in real life and as well as directing actually plays the part of one of the Bergues post office employees and using his chti accent to excellent effect. His mother in the film is played by singer Line Renaud  which IMDb lists as being born in Nieppe in Department 59  Nord  so she may well be a chti herself ! ! These northerners are painted as high livers  bons vivants  over indulging in fatty foods and alcohol very different from the south but little by little our new manager gets used to this way of life although the picture he paints to his wife in the south is much blacker than the reality. Eventually she joins him is initially shocked but ends up enjoying herself too. Plot is not so important in the film more important is the culture shock and interaction between the players. I have lived for several months in the north of France and the people there are indeed hearty sincere and friendly far more so than those in the south of the country who make more noise but are generally shallower as far as friendship goes. I also was lucky enough to have made a guided tour of Bergues about ten years ago and found it a truly delightful place surrounded by old fortifications. To resume I really enjoyed the film and will willingly purchase the DVD when it is issued.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film which should be a big success amongst the qubecois and other Frenchspeaking Canadians for reasons I will explain later came out recently here in France and is having pretty substantial success. The plot  basically a manager of the Post Office in Salon de Provence France is trying to obtain a transfer to the Riviera in order to satisfy his neurotic and depressive wife who wants to live near the sea. Just when he thinks he's clinched an opening in SanarysurMer he learns that preference was given to a handicapped candidate. He then tries to pass off as handicapped wheelchair and all during an interview for another post in the same area. All goes well and the interviewer is convinced that he is handicapped and cannot walk when at the end of the interview he stands up to say goodbye and thereby gives himself away ! This is a pretext for a blme or sanction and the poor guy's punishment is to be transferred for a period of two years right to the other end of the country to Bergues in the Nord department not far from Lille. To someone from the far south of France going to the north is like going to the north pole and his wife's old uncle brilliantly played by Michel Galabru warns him about the dangers and sub zero temperatures of the north so our friend leaves his wife in Salon and makes the journey himself planning to return home every second weekend. The purpose of the film is in a lighthearted and satirical way is to introduce the spectator to life in the north of France and to have a bash at some of the stereotypes commonly held about this region. The film contains numerous linguistic jokes and references and non French speakers will have difficulty in appreciating the full force and effect of the plays on words. Chti'mi is a dialect spoken in the north of France which tends to muddle c's and ch's use mi and ti to mean me and you braire bray to mean moan or complain as well as frequent usage of the word biroute which elsewhere in France is used for something more crude as well as lavish helpings of the word quoi what eh ! pronounced as it if were quow.

	schema:reviewBody "I laughed out loud with this move and certainly I didn't expect it.Sometimes we forget how important it is to have a good plot. Nothing turns out badly but there are some happy surprises. The best is how the Ch'Tis play on the brute simple vulgar stereotype to their advantage. It'd be a crime to say more. Witness the cat as food spitting Philippe's appalling house decoration.Another thing I liked it is that they don't become somebody else. I mean in the end you see people turn out and behave as what they are. The Abrams are not Ch'Tis and they are wary of outsiders. I'm not saying anything important but I think sociologically it makes it more valuable and respectful. It has the perfect moderate amount of conflict for making it interesting besides the chic vs coarse theme. Antoine's induced alcoholism his love interest for Annabelle his overbearing but loving maman Julie's neurosis always finding fault at everything Philippe does him lying all the time finally for no reason.Kad Merad is one of the best comedy actors I've ever seen. He's got a natural talent for mimicking and copying all their local pronunciation accents and even ways of having fun. His scam with neurological twitching included was masterful.Dany Boon is of course perfect his face says it all. They have good talks despite being utterly different. Great scene of male friendship that form of art at the beach and not crying later. His two sidekicks steal the show. Even their way of dressing is just perfect. Both young women of the film are beautiful specially Anne Marivin always bustling with activity. I'd have liked Zo Flix to have more to say than just grouch and be a pain until her nice acknowledgment near the end that she may also have something to do with all this. The funny copper Patrick Bosso has one of those vital small roles that differentiate a good from a great film. Notice how the speed at which he drives is a function of Philippe's moods .Line Renaud from Le silence de l'pervier TV among others is beautiful as an intrusive and contradictory witness Anabelle's face at the post office the only time they speak mum who in a way only wants the best for her sun but harasses poor Antoine following him to his dead end job with food and constantly fearing he'd be ill but her serious talk with him was so matteroffact while peeling potatoes mind you! that his face of relief afterwards is worth the price of the ticket. If you have family or friends in the province you've probably feel as Philippe does. They are wary probably will give you a couple headaches with their sense of humour and yes they eat strangely but with their heart and warmth they'll probably more than make up for it.Try to follow their French. I'd say 60 of the fun is there. It's carefully geared so as for you to learn the codes. They even teach you how to speak and translate the language twice. Which consists of letter replacement and pronunciation as well as particles that just don't mean anything social rules they invite you in when you drop by and even intonation the from the guts interjection in the end. In short if you play moderate attention you'll end up speaking like' em. Or at least understanding it perfectly and using its funny way of speaking outside the cinema. I suppose it's a matter of why and how we learn. They are SO friendly and honest these people that you end up wanting them. And when you feel safe and in company you learn twice right !dbdumonteil on IMDb as usual wrote a great review I won't touch on the topics he did.I'm very glad that this film is a commercial success. I also liked the latest Asterix iteration but this one probably has more humane content. Here in Argentina we can't be so picky about European French cinema. What comes is little and far between so one just watches everything. This with Le diner des cons is probably the best French comedy I've seen. The Les Bronzs series was also smashing but it somehow lacked somebody to identify with. Something this film has plenty of.Wisely it doesn't even touch social issues like unemployment and redneck political views. Consequently achieving a bigger almost universal market share.Enjoy!".

	schema:reviewBody "As a French film lover I had to discover this little film which was surrounded by much hype and now ranks among the 5 most profitable movies launched in France. Otherwise people would have told me what? You haven't seen Bienvenue Chez Les Ch'Ti's? Everyone's talking about it. It's terrific. So terrific that it turned the small town of Berck into an unlikely tourist attraction and a few months ago I ate a delicious Maroual tart! Without mentioning verbal expressions that are now used in French common language like Biloute. I went to see it also partly because I had enjoyed Dany Boon's first effort as a director la Maison Du Bonheur 2006 even if I especially smiled than laughed.I'm a little baffled that this film which isn't that much original made itself known in virtually every French house. The premise of a man who has to cope with a new and supposedly hostile world has been used thousands of times before in cinema. At first Boon follows an apparently mapped scheme. Kad Merad is anguished at the idea to spend a part of his professional life in Northern France where it is supposed to rain every day and where inhabitants appear to be sullen. But then things aren't what he believes them to be it's often sunny and people are generally charming. But as he wants to avoid a breakdown to his wife Merad lies to her until one day she joins him in the Nord Pas De Calais.What I like in Boon's effort is that it recycles the clichs linked to this French area to boost laughter and it often works. I dig the moments when Merad is on the highway to hell? and as soon as he arrives in the Nord Pas De Calais it starts to rain. When Merad also tries to help Boon to solve his problem with alcohol it's quite funny too. I would also quote the moments with humorist Patrick Bosso as a cop who stops twice Merad on the highway and its results. Boon's directing should also be praised for taking some of his clichs into unexpected territories like when Boon announces to Line Renaud that he wants to marry his girlfriend. And when Merad's wife comes to visit him in Northern France Dany Boon thumbs the nose at the ones who have a dogged vision of dreary Northern France.There's no denying that Boon is deeply attached to his native area. His love for it transpires in virtually every plan where we can see parts of the town and its inhabitants. It's obvious that he feels much more at ease in directing and acting than in its previous effort where secondary roles almost stole him the show. He manages to convey tenderness for his characters to the viewer. However like in la Maison Du Bonheur I especially smiled than laughed. The sole moment where I was dead laughing was when Merad pretends to be disabled to have his promotion even if this trick isn't new.But Boon's effort is better than his first one thanks to his control over directing one can admire the contrast when Merad enjoys being in joyful Northern France and when he has to go back to Nice to find again his depressed wife clichs and also the performance as a whole. It's also comforting that such a film rode high at the French box office while other productions that were likely to be successes failed in spite of a conspicuous publicity campaign like Astrix Aux Jeux Olympiques 2008. And it's a film that should definitely reduce the detractors of Northern France to silence. So I liked Bienvenue Chez Les Ch'Ti's but I doubt whether I would want to watch it again.".

	schema:reviewBody "I studied Spanish for five years and have a deep unrelenting bias to all foreign films that are not Spanish. I did not go into this French comedy  translated to Welcome to the Sticks  with very much hope that it was going to be a good film.I could not have been any more incorrect.Welcome to the Sticks is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen foreign or domestic. It's about a guy  Philippe  who tries to con his way into getting a better job in warm sunny southern France by pretending he's handicapped gets caught and is punished by being sent to The North. Everyone knows that The North is full of lazy uneducated people and freezing weather and just absolute awfulness all around. Philippe is not excited and his wife Julie is furious. She refuses to move with him and instead stays at home with their son. Philippe has to travel back on the weekends to visit his family.But when Philippe arrives in The North he discovers that it's nothing like the rumors he's heard everyone is super friendly and everything is beautiful. The only problem is they speak in a dialect that is almost impossible to understand. Hilarity ensues and the story continues and Philippe lies to his wife and tells her that everything is terrible in The North which actually helps to strengthen their marriage.This was an incredibly cute film. The person who wrote the commentary even made the dialect come through in written English words which was a little frustrating at first but helped Englishonly speakers to better understand the story. I would highly recommend this movie and I kind of wonder if there could ever be an English equivalent to it  I think it would be almost impossible to do which makes this movie especially unique in my opinion. I give this film nine out of ten stars and you should definitely choose this as your next Friday night rental.".

Now in this age of consciousness of the dangers of alcohol a film focused on how funny is it when you're blasted sounds like how much fun a child has hearing a rude joke than how grown ups enjoy themselves.While some moments are funny pushing the language joke too far makes it look like the writers had nothing else to laugh about. OK the accent up North is funny. But NOT funny enough to base a whole film on it! When a single joke Et je vous dis quoi turns into a language class and is taking more than one minute and a half you start wondering if someone had a proper look at the final cut. When that same language joke is repeated four times in 90 minutes you start wondering is the way northerners speak the only funny thing?Do consider as well that the leading character is supposed to come from a region in Southern France where people are known to have a fairly strong accent too but oddly enough does not have any accent himself you start wondering whether this Essex meets Glasgow film deserves that much attention.A few good jokes here and there in particular about how people in Southern France see anything beyond Lyon as the North Pole a decent performance from the actors but really really not worth the hype.".

Not because they're are ridiculous but because you find yourself confronted with the  clichs you formed about the persons and then discover  in a very humoristic way how wrong you were.Personally I loved it because the humor was simple something i would see myself end up doing. You don't have the impression to see actors who memorized their script without really knowing what they're talking about. Which would be weird since the actors are mostly all from that area. Just know that when you go see the movie you don't go for the line of the story  man from south goes north. doesn't understand. and finally Loves it there.  You go for the heart of the story the exchanges between the people the subtleties of the language and the fine humor of people who are mocking themselves in a good way. Whoever didn't understand that part of the story  my opinion should just keep watching senseless American movie with the clich dialog where you can anticipate the end. Guess it can be relaxing but is it enough?Bravo Danny Boon. you succeeded in putting your love for your country in the movie without making it look fade in front of the audience.".

I like the antiPC element leading man Kad Merad feigns disability in order to win a transfer to the Riviera but the main thrust of the story  the singular dialect peculiar to Northern France  can take it only so far. Writerdirector Danny Boon a native of the region spoke the dialect exclusively for the first two years of his life and full marks for getting a featurelength movie out of it. Kad Merad is excellent in the leading role as is veteran Line Renaud as Boon's mother. It's definitely entertaining but I would rate it no higher than that.".

Our hero sets off for the North as if he is heading for his own funeral. Although initially shocked at what he finds on his arrival and on being unable to understand half of what anyone says he soon learns to love the people and the culture. However he hides this fact from his wife because on returning to Provence at the weekends he finds his relationship with her is much better than before he left because she believes he is going through hell for the sake of his family. The scene where she finally arrives in Bergues is a joy to see.The acting particularly from the major characters is very good. There is no sex no violence one minor scuffle only minimal badlanguage and no special effects. There is one politically incorrect scene where both of the major characters are drunk but it is very lighthearted and extremely funny. I would have no hesitation in taking my 12 year old child to see this.Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis is currently breaking all box office records in France and it is a crying shame that it will probably never get a major international release in any nonFrench speaking country simply because the playonwords between French and ch'tis will not work if the film is subtitled. The film deserves to be seen I haven't laughed so much at the cinema for years.".

However he's no Jim Carrey his attempts at pratfalls and neuroses fall flat. Fortuantely though that's not all he's required to do. He's easily likable because he acts in a way anyone else would. Dany Bloom despite wearing three hats actor cowriter and director makes Antoine a lovable character. He's frequently funny and always sympathetic right from the getgo. When he's troubled we feel sad. When he's being funny we always laugh. Anne Marivin is adorable as Antoine's love interest and Zoe Felix is always believable as Phillippe's cynical wife who won't believe her husband.The main problem is that for the first forty minutes Welcome to the Sticks is flat. There are laughs to be sure but I laughed because I knew I was supposed to laugh not because what just happened was especially funny. After that though the film finds its groove and brings about a lot of laughs including two flatout hilarious sequences. Of course one has to accept a huge plot device to get some of the humor but that's not hard because the film's earnest and likable tone makes you want to go along with the flow.The film's major asset is it's charm and that makes it easier to swallow everything that happens in it. Special credit has to go to Dany Boon for accomplishing this and keeping it consistent throughout the film.However flat the first part of the movie might be the better part of the movie is good enough to warrant a viewing.".

After her first husband Bill Cardew MacMurray was lost at sea his grieving lonely widow Vicky marries his friend and business partner Henry Lowndes Douglas six months later. Boy is she surprised when Bill shows up alive. So is her new husband and her father Davenport. It then falls to the confused Vicky to decide which husband she wants.This is a very amusing comedy with terrific performances from all the stars. Melvyn Douglas one of the truly great American actors had to do this type of film until he finally reached old age and could show the world how sensational he was. He's very funny his voice cracking when he's upset. The men act like quarreling children playing games of oneupmanship and chasing Vicky everywhere. Seeing the frilly guest room Bill questions Henry's effeminate taste. What's this fabric? Bill asks holding up a piece of curtain. DOTTED SWISS! Henry yells in a booming voice. In another scene Bill impresses Vicky by jumping over furniture causing Henry to give it a try. He falls flat on his face. Arthur does an excellent job as a somewhat dizzy woman who loves both men and Davenport is a riot as her soberfaced worried father. MacMurray has always seemed bland to me but he holds his own as the returning husband who's been stranded on an island for a year.Much better than I thought it would be and Arthur fans will love it.".

Only in Too Many Husbands did I get a distinct sense of the terrible dilemma faced by the spouse who has to make a choice. This is because in this version alone are the two competing spouses portrayed as equally worthy charming and attractive by actors who were close to one another in those qualities as well as in their respective levels of stardom at the time the film was made. In both My Favorite Wife and Move Over Darling it is quite clear from the portrayal of one of the competing spouses and from the casting of a lesser star in the role whom we are supposed to be rooting for. Not so in Too Many Husbands. Douglas and MacMurray are very near equals in star power and in the way their characters are written and portrayed. Unlike the other two films this results in as real a conflict for the viewer as it does for Jean Arthur's character. Unfortunately it also results in the movie's weakest pointthe ending or lack of one. The dilemma was apparently so strong that the film makers themselves were unable to decide. After having Arthur's character seemingly make her choice they tacked on a rather strange ambiguous ending suggesting that the losing husband might still have a chance. The effect is a nonending that suggests the film makers couldn't make up their minds so they just turned off the camera.".

But in and of itself this is a good film with solid laughs. I've always thought that Fred MacMurray deserves more credit than he gets nowadays for what was a fine career as an actor in both comedies and dramas although I think he was better in for example The Egg And I. But as the lost and sea and presumed dead husband who returns only to find that his wife Jean Arthur really good in this film is married to best friend and business associate Melvyn Douglas who is utterly charming here. Arthur's character must choose which husband to dump...the crux of the plot...which goes on a bit too long...why can't she make up her mind. Both husbands are portrayed as being rather charming and perhaps that's the reason she has trouble deciding. I'll bet most people would have been rooting for Melvyn Douglas' character but guess what  at the end of the film you're not sure who she's going to select  a rather unsatisfying conclusion from my perspective. It's a bit too much of a drawing room or bedroom comedy...clearly it was adapted from a stage effort but the closing party scene is nice...would have also worked well earlier in the film to breakup so much of the action taking place in the home. Perhaps it's supporting actor Harry Davenport the doctor in GWTW who really shines in this flick as the father of the Jean Arthur character he's always a great addition to any film but gets more play here and really excels. A good film comedy but not memorable.".

	schema:reviewBody "1940 was a wonderful year for lost spouse returning films. Both this film as well as MY FAVORITE WIFE debuted a short time apart and they are on the surface very very similar movies.In MY FAVORITE WIFE Irene Dunne is lost at sea and assumed dead. Years later she's declared legally dead and Cary Grant her husband remarries. Dunne then returns just after the wedding and hilarity ensues.In TOO MANY HUSBANDS Fred MacMurray is lost at sea and assumed dead. He's declared dead almost right away and Jean Arthur his wife remarried. Fred then returns to find she now has two husbands and only a little bit of hilarity ensued! In fact because these two films were so similar lawsuits were launched. I really don't know how they were settled or which movie came first. All I know is that MY FAVORITE WIFE is definitely the better of the two. The fact that TOO MANY HUSBANDS was only showed on TCM for the first time a week ago is probably indication that it is the lesser filmsespecially since MY FAVORITE WIFE is a commonly seen film on American cable TV.The problem is the writing. While the cast of TOO MANY HUSBANDS is just fine Jean Arthur Fred MacMurray and Melvin Douglas the lines they are given and the situations they are placed in just aren't as funny. In particular Jean's character is VERY annoying at timesas she seems like a selfish and immature person throughout the film. This is BAD as Jean's usual screen persona is of a sweet and spunky ladyhere she in an indecisive and whiny person. Just thinkin this film she learns she has two husbands and LIKES IT when the two guys are ready to fight it out as well as all the attention they pay her!! Conversely the fact that Cary and Irene in the other film truly love each other never really is in questionthe problem is just figuring out HOW to extricate themselves from the mess! While this is still a pretty good film nearly meriting a 7 it just isn't in the same league as the other one. If you love old films like I do see them both. If you only want to pick one then the answer is pretty obvious.".

All of these actors are capable of elevating mundane roles and films into something special. Unfortunately none of them can do so in this film.The comments of rhoda1 are most illuminating. Changing the motivations of the characters in the original Somerset Maugham play results in a very unsatisfying movie. I would love to see the original play!The situation in this film is the same as My Favorite Wife and the mediocre remake Move Over Darling  except the male and female roles have been reversed. But there the similarity ends. In My Favorite Wife Cary Grant wants to restore his first marriage to Irene Dunne. Ditto in the remake with Rock Hudson and Doris Day. Both Grant and Hudson are motivated by the desire to let the second wife down easily. By contrast in Too Many Husbands the normally lovable Jean Arthur plays a character who at first seems torn between her two husbands but increasingly seems to just bask in the egocentric pleasure of having two men pursue her. This motivation completely undermines the sympathy I initially had for her. By contrast I am completely sympathetic with the erstwhile husband and wife in the other two films.In addition while there is some clever dialog in Too Many Husbands it is too scant. Most of the time the characters are just sophomoric. Jean Arthur reverts to a flirty schoolgirl leadingon two schoolboys. Unfortunately both Fred MacMurray and Melyn Douglas behave accordingly. The furniturejumping scene is painful to watch. Nothing of this juvenile nature happens in My Favorite Wife or Move Over Darling.This one trick pony becomes all the more annoying when the end arrives without any resolution. It is as if the viewer has simply been watching the beginning of a perpetual competition between two high school boys pursuing the same girl.Basically this film is disappointing because Jean Arthur becomes pretty unsympathetic the 3 characters in the love triangle are all sophomoric in the extreme and there is no resolution at the end of the film.I absolutely love both romantic comedies and screwball comedies. Too Many Husbands is an insult to both. It is ANTIromantic and not screwball but sophomoric slapstick silliness. What a total waste of incredible talent.".

In My Favorite Wife Irene Dunne's character comes home after 7 years on a deserted island with Randolph Scott's character. Cary Grant's character had just remarried after the customary 7 year grace period before a person is declared legally dead In the present film Jean ArthurVicky only waited 6 months before marrying her lost husband's best friendplayed by Melvin Douglas She gave some legal reason I didn't understand for this uncommonly short grace period. But her first husband played by Fred MacMurray inconveniently showed up after one year and was shocked to find his wife remarried already. If Vicky was legally allowed to divorce her 1st husband in his absence I could see this happening. But the legal verdict near the end is that her first husband still had priority within the time frame. Her 2nd husband graciously accepted this decision after fighting tooth and nail to retain his marriage. This film is based upon the 1919 play Home and Beauty written by Somerset Maugham. However there are significant differences. The lost husband was missing in action rather than marooned on a desert island. Instead of 2 husbands fighting to remain married to the same woman the 2 husbands are fighting to decide which should divorce her as both found that her beauty was her only good asset. In addition she wanted to divorce both and marry another man. This sounds like it has more comedic potential than the screenplay for the present film.Actually this play is a variation on the 1864 narrative poem Enoch Arden in which a marooned sailor showed up after 10 years to find his wife happily married to his best friend. However he doesn't reveal himself as he doesn't want to cause a problem for his former wife. The basic story was also redone as a musical in 1955 Three for the Show and again as a nonmusical in Move Over Dalring'63.I agree with the majority of reviewers that My Favorite Wife is the more interesting of the 2 films. The present film too much emphasizes the endless bickering between the 2 husbands promoted by Vicky's inability to choose which one she prefers.They have quite different personalities and Vicky apparently likes some of both. Besides she gets more attention than when she had only one husband as they try to outdo each other in pleasing her and emphasize the other's weak points. Although there are funny scenes in addition to the perplexing situation I think the plot could have been milked for more humor.".

	schema:reviewBody "The plot for this film has been used a couple of times in literature and a few times with variations in movies. A man is lost at sea and presumed dead so in time his wife marries another man only to have the first husband return. Enoch Arden was an 1864 poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson that was made into movies in 1911 1914 and 1915. This remake stars Jean Arthur Fred MacMurray and Melvyn Douglas. It came out in 1940 just two months before My Favorite Wife. RKO Radio Pictures was filming a story that reversed the plot of Enoch Arden. It was based on a 1919 W. Somerset Maugham play. In it the wife is lost at sea and returns just as her husband is getting married again. While both 1940 films were hits the latter was a bigger one. The comedy output and film outcome were easier to achieve with the reverse scenario. Still this movie is loaded with comedy. The plot as such is very simple  the wife must choose between her two husbands. Much of the humor is in a battle of dialog between the two men. Jean Arthur is Vicky Fred MacMurray is Bill first husband Melvyn Douglas is Henry second husband and Harry Davenport is George Vicky's dad. All of the supporting cast are very good. Bill and Henry were best of friends and partners in a publishing firm. Henry had been best man at Bill's wedding. Bill had been lost at sea and reported by the Coast Guard as drowned. That was one year ago. Now Vicky and Henry have been married six months. Two scenarios are very hilarious.

Here are some of my favorite lines from this film. For more hilarious dialog snippets see the Quotes section in this IMDb Web page for Too Many Husbands.In the guest bedroom. Vicky I just thought I'd see if you were all right. Bill I don't feel very good. Vicky No? What's the matter? Bill Fever I guess. Deadly tropical fever. Vicky Your forehead isn't hot. Bill Don't take you hand away. Vicky Get some aspirin from the cabinet will you Henry? Henry Let him get his own aspirin. I don't feel any too well myself. Vicky Really dear? Henry No. Vicky Stick out your tongue. Henry What's my tongue got to do with it? You held his head. Vicky Let me see your tongue. You know your stomach always goes bad first. Bill I'd be sick if I had that in my mouth. Vicky You're all right. Did you brush your teeth? Henry Ask him if he brushed his. Bill Can I help it if somebody gave my toothbrush to a tramp? Henry The tramp wouldn't take it. Vicky Now please don't quarrel.Vicky If you loved me at all you never would have left here even if I did tell you to get out.Henry Vicky as your legal husband I'm asking you to order this cad out of the house. Bill As her legal husband I'm asking you to shut your mouth before I slit your throat.Henry What are you whispering? Vicky I wasn't whispering. Bill I was showing her where a barracuda bit me.Henry A fine thing. And may I comment in passing that it seems awfully strange to order a man out of his own bedroom just because a squealing corpse has washed ashore. Bill This.

	onyx:emotionText "The plot for this film has been used a couple of times in literature and a few times with variations in movies. A man is lost at sea and presumed dead so in time his wife marries another man only to have the first husband return. Enoch Arden was an 1864 poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson that was made into movies in 1911 1914 and 1915. This remake stars Jean Arthur Fred MacMurray and Melvyn Douglas. It came out in 1940 just two months before My Favorite Wife. RKO Radio Pictures was filming a story that reversed the plot of Enoch Arden. It was based on a 1919 W. Somerset Maugham play. In it the wife is lost at sea and returns just as her husband is getting married again. While both 1940 films were hits the latter was a bigger one. The comedy output and film outcome were easier to achieve with the reverse scenario. Still this movie is loaded with comedy. The plot as such is very simple  the wife must choose between her two husbands. Much of the humor is in a battle of dialog between the two men. Jean Arthur is Vicky Fred MacMurray is Bill first husband Melvyn Douglas is Henry second husband and Harry Davenport is George Vicky's dad. All of the supporting cast are very good. Bill and Henry were best of friends and partners in a publishing firm. Henry had been best man at Bill's wedding. Bill had been lost at sea and reported by the Coast Guard as drowned. That was one year ago. Now Vicky and Henry have been married six months. Two scenarios are very hilarious. One is Bill and Henry trying to show one another up by physical prowess in high jumping the furniture. The other is in the guest bedroom where Vicky has sent the two men for the night. Here are some of my favorite lines from this film. For more hilarious dialog snippets see the Quotes section in this IMDb Web page for Too Many Husbands.In the guest bedroom.

The two husbands are forced to sleep in the guest room which has been decorated as a nursery for the daughter that Douglas and Arthur had been hoping for. It's filled with fripperies and bows. What's this? asks the sullen MacMurry fingering a valence. Dotted Swiss replies the sulky Douglas. Oh dotted Swiss says MacMurray breathlessly with the slightest of lisps.I guess it was the code that demanded the men sleep in separate beds although it would have been funnier if they'd had to argue over who was hoarding the blankets.Jean Arthur was never a sexpot but she was always appealing with her cracked whine of a voice. She remained winsome even in middle age in a dramatic role in Shane 1952. She was born in New York state and died at 90 in Carmel California. Not a bad life course.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am currently watching this movie on TCM. I have always loved the Cary GrantIrene Dunne version called My Favorite Wife as well as the Doris DayJames Garner version Move Over Darling. In the man remarries versions both husbands waited the appropriate amount of time and only just declared their first wives dead and remarried the same day. So they just started their honeymoons and the first wives stopped it before the honeymoon night. In this case the wife remarries  not only after six months but also to her dead husband's business partner! Melvyn Douglass and Fred McMurray are great as the husbands in question and it was funny when Bill McMurray realizes that his best friend Henry Douglass has been sleeping with his wife! It was not actually spoken that he realized it but when Henry talked about having children the realization came to him. It is a wonderful movie but I do find that Vickie Jean Arthur although wonderfully funny was in reality quite a vixen and quite selfish in this version. Also for those who do not know there was a fourth version of this in production called Something's Gotta Give with Marilyn Monroe and Dean Martin. This was before Move Over Darling. Monroe died before the movie was completed and it was canned. I really would like the producers to dust it off and maybe complete it. But maybe not enough was done to make it viable.".

The photography is as good as anything in those movies if not better. This is good stuff great direction with interesting closeups wideangle lenses lowangle shots tons of shadows and light. Instead of a big city we had the desert as the main area. The DVD transfer is terrific too.All of this to me was more fun to watch than the actual story although the second half of this movie is extremely tense and well done. It makes up for the first half which is a bit on the sordid side at times and a bit slow at times but definitely film noir material meaning a feeling of dread just around each corner. The suspense gets really thick in the last 20 minutes when George Murphy is discovered by th sadistic criminals to be an undercover lawman. What happens to Murphy is memorable.Howard da Silva and Charles MacGraw are effective as the main villains. MacGraw's distinctive voice alone makes him a film noir Hall of Famer. Murphy  known more for his lighthearted hoofer films  does a credible in here and it was interesting to see Ricardo Montalban of TV's Love Boat fame as such a young man. Those two play the good guys. This is a tough allmale cast with no romances or soft stuff. In a way the atmosphere reminded me a bit of another tough noir The Big Combo although the subject matter here is entirely different than any other noir I know about immigrants crossing the border. However unlike the reallife situation that is a major story today this involves Mexicans crossing the border to do migrant farm work and then getting robbed and killed by bandits on the way home. Still the subject of illegals is a big part of this story and ironic to watch today in light of what's happening now.Anyway if you enjoy literallydark stories and am a fan of film noir check this movie out.".

Devoid of the usual film noire femme fatale it is nonetheless a dark and unusually for the time violent film.The plot concerns the efforts of the Mexican and American Immigration Services to stem the flow of illegal farm workers crossing the border into the US illegally. To this end the Mexicans assign Pablo Rodrgues Ricardo Montalban and the Americans Jack Bearnes George Murphy to work under cover to find the sources of both the illegal traffic and the grizzly murders of workers crossing back into Mexico with their earnings.They discover that the head of the operation is Owen Parkson Howard DaSilva. His cohorts include Arnold Moss and Alfonso Bedoya as a couple of ruthless murders Charles McGraw and Arthur Hunnicutt as his foreman and assistant and Sig Ruman as his Mexican recruiter.The film is both dark most of the film takes place at night and violent. At the beginning we see the brutal stabbings of several helpless workers returning home by Moss Bedoya and company and the unceremonious dumping of the bodies into a pool of quicksand. Later one of the characters meets a particularly gruesome end under a large farm cultivator.Montalbon and Murphy in particular turn in excellent performances. Both live on life's edges in their efforts to bring the criminals to justice. Sig Ruman is very good as the brutal Mexican contact. McGraw walks away with the villain's honors as the devious foreman. In fact the whole cast is excellent.As this film was produced by MGM Mann was given a larger budget than usual. The scenes are well constructed and lit to give one that classic black and white feeling of impending doom. It will keep you glued to the screen from start to finish.".

There's also a naturalistic documentary feel in the beginning and end that make this somewhat realistic for the era which is also achieved by rare uses of the music score throughout.

	schema:reviewBody "Border Incident 1949This is an amazing movie. There are moments when it feels a little forced or once or twice a little politicized but the rest of the time this is as good as postwar movies get and I'm a complete devotee of this period. John Alton's photography is worth seeing alone even without the sound it's so good not that you would want to avoid the fantastic score by Andre Previn. And the direction by Anthony Mann at the peak of his intensity is sharp and beautifully controlled. The story is largely broken into two parts though even these two get complicated so you have to pay attention. Action moves from Mexican to the American side back and forth following an American agent and a Mexican one played by the handsome Ricardo Montalban both undercover. They cross paths more than once but largely their stories are independent. Eventually there is a huge and exciting confrontation in the Valley of Death with a thick and rather convincing quicksand pool at the bottom. It becomes something like a Western shootout at this point something Mann became an expert at but the movie as a whole has a unique feel to it neither Western nor noir. Yes it involves crime guns deception and lots of night stuff terrific is an understatement but the underlying tone is to undo a crime syndicate on the border and to root for the two heroes who are working for a cause a very unnoir thing to do.A terrific full review of the movie is at bighousefilm.com click on reviews in particular going into the director and cinematographer and the overall mood of the film. Certainly this was my initial attraction for both Mann in all his ominous but realistic violence and Alton with his deep focus shadow photography are favorites of mine. There isn't a dull moment in this film just in visual terms. If you watch with your eyes and see great moving camera vivid dark night stuff and some sudden changes of focus like when the two men are in the field at night toward the end and are suddenly up close in the camera no cutting just a fast running to the lens an following with the lens. It's really masterful.But equally important for those who are curious about context and content beyond the art of it all is the Wikipedia entry on the Bracero program a collaboration between the US and Mexican governments begun in the 1940s to control legal migrant workers. The need for lots of Mexican labor was pressing when millions of US men joined the army in 1942 and after the war there was pressure to keep the program going. In a way this movie is pure propaganda to support its continuation and it did get renewed time and again until 1964 which is about when Cesar Chavez and the La Raza movement grew huge. Naturally agribusiness didn't like ittheir claim was they wanted to pay Americans full wages not Mexicans but in truth apparently they wanted to let the illegal market expand because illegals were so cheap and required no benefits. Whatever the case Border Incident helps dramatize the need for some kind of program in postwar America just to counteract the bad guys running illegals over the border to everyone's peril.Speaking of which the bad guy in charge is played to perfection by Howard Da Silva who is not Hispanic nor Portuguese but Jewish American from Ohio. His whole cadre of greedy ranchers in the desert is convincing and a thrill cinematically. There is only a glimpse of a female in the whole movie and yet there is tenderness at times especially among the braceros themselves. In a way there is something of the feel of They Live by Night here with the layering of plots and types of people together in the dark desert shot in the same year. But ultimately this is a far more masculine movie filled with action and power plays and terrific energy.".

Yes it involves crime guns deception and lots of night stuff terrific is an understatement but the underlying tone is to undo a crime syndicate on the border and to root for the two heroes who are working for a cause a very unnoir thing to do.A terrific full review of the movie is at bighousefilm.com click on reviews in particular going into the director and cinematographer and the overall mood of the film. Certainly this was my initial attraction for both Mann in all his ominous but realistic violence and Alton with his deep focus shadow photography are favorites of mine. There isn't a dull moment in this film just in visual terms. If you watch with your eyes and see great moving camera vivid dark night stuff and some sudden changes of focus like when the two men are in the field at night toward the end and are suddenly up close in the camera no cutting just a fast running to the lens an following with the lens. It's really masterful.But equally important for those who are curious about context and content beyond the art of it all is the Wikipedia entry on the Bracero program a collaboration between the US and Mexican governments begun in the 1940s to control legal migrant workers. The need for lots of Mexican labor was pressing when millions of US men joined the army in 1942 and after the war there was pressure to keep the program going. In a way this movie is pure propaganda to support its continuation and it did get renewed time and again until 1964 which is about when Cesar Chavez and the La Raza movement grew huge. Naturally agribusiness didn't like ittheir claim was they wanted to pay Americans full wages not Mexicans but in truth apparently they wanted to let the illegal market expand because illegals were so cheap and required no benefits. Whatever the case Border Incident helps dramatize the need for some kind of program in postwar America just to counteract the bad guys running illegals over the border to everyone's peril.Speaking of which the bad guy in charge is played to perfection by Howard Da Silva who is not Hispanic nor Portuguese but Jewish American from Ohio. His whole cadre of greedy ranchers in the desert is convincing and a thrill cinematically. There is only a glimpse of a female in the whole movie and yet there is tenderness at times especially among the braceros themselves. In a way there is something of the feel of They Live by Night here with the layering of plots and types of people together in the dark desert shot in the same year. But ultimately this is a far more masculine movie filled with action and power plays and terrific energy.";

We know now the bottomless depths these vermin will sink to in order to make a buck.  We know that life today is worth less than it was then.

He plays the INS agent investigating this smuggling ring along with his Mexican counterpart played by Ricardo Montalban.  They work well together  both in character and personally.  They are surrounded by a despicable group of psychos that include Charles McGraw Howard Da Silva Arthur Hunnicut and Alfonso Bedoya Gold Hat from Treasure of the Sierra Madre.  A good cast and a tense suspense filled plot make this an enjoyable experience.  My one major criticism is this mutual ass kissing we see between the efficient US and incorruptable Mexican federal cops. I may be wrong but I can't believe we ever have or ever will enjoy that kind of cooperation.".

Of course there are the mandatory sops to convention the usual triumphant authorities in the usual highkey lighting with the usual handshakes all around. But don't let that fool you because the other 95 stretches into a nightmarish landscape of grotesquery and violence that lends about as much support to convention as Jack the Ripper does to the National Organization for Women. In fact the rotary plow scene may be the most unrelenting and excruciatingly violent episode of the entire decade. On the surface the movie's about migrant farm workers. But that's really just a chance for Mann to bring forth his highly personal view of a violencestrewn world. In fact his noirs amount to an ongoing struggle between artistic vision on one hand and societal convention on the other. Though good is predictably rewarded and evil punished he again writhes expressively against the artificial limits that stand in his way. Note how the movie sets the stage beginning not with a snippet of normal life but with a horrendous crime.The supporting cast alone is a pantheon of noir icons including Charles McGraw Jack Lambert Howard deSilva and the underrated Arnold Moss whose rolling eyes and demonic leer can make you doubt the course of evolution. And where did they get the palmchecking weightlifter of a hag whose dubious version of the weaker sex belongs somewhere in the defensive line of the Chicago Bears. Some nice little surprises along the way a messenger who wisely goes by motorcycle and a goodsamaritan housewife with unexpected connections. Too bad that Hollywood could never figure out how real foreign peasants speak. Here they come up with the usual pseudopoetic tropes like I was praying my husband to the same sainted Guadalupe that you would not go. Then too I'm curious about an achingly dry desert with a swamp in the middle. Oh well it's probably better that screenwriters don't have to take courses in geology since these subliminal swamp scenes with flashing knives and disappearing bodies would likely frighten Dr. Freud.Anyway there's enough tension and suspense in these 90 minutes to send a viewer reaching for the heart medicine and maybe even ponder the provenance of those peas and carrots on the nightly dinner plate. Too bad Mann's assigned shift to Westerns began soon after this. It helped spell noir's inevitable decline in the face of a mounting Cold War and anything smacking of social criticism. That move may have amounted to Jimmy Stewart's big gain but it ended in noir's big loss.".

Both George Murphy and Ricardo Montalban go undercover to smoke out an organized people smuggling ring Murphy as a convict with illegal stolen immigration work forms and Montalban as a migrant worker. Working in border towns on both sides of the MexicanCalifornia border Murphy and Montalban work in a nonstop atmosphere of intrigue and deceit. They are working separately but know each other is on the case and the problem is there really is no one either can trust. Anthony Mann does a beautiful job in creating the tension involved in such an operation as director.Noir films were not usually what MGM put out but in the case of Border Incident they put out a real good one.";

	schema:reviewBody "Provided you can ignore the plot holes here and there in the film then this is an enjoyable and exciting film. While I noticed that now this film is being marketed in a Film Noir multipack by MGM I really don't think I'd consider this film Noir. It does have many aspects of this but a story about illegal Mexican migrant workers and the scum who traffic in them is hardly the stuff of Noir though there is some gritty action and violence that is definitely influenced by this style film.The movie stars George Murphy and Ricardo Montalban. While Murphy never became a huge star he was pretty good in this movie. However for Montalban who only occasionally got a chance to act in films that were nonmusicals it was a very welcome role.The film itself is a fairly entertaining and straight forward tale about some scum who smuggle illegal immigrants into America and then use them as slave labor or even kill them when it's no longer convenient to keep them! Because of their brutality a joint Mexican and American task force is created to infiltrate. Despite the complexity and evil of this gang two agents Murphy and Montalban are sent in with no real backup! And once Montalban begins his journey into the US an a supposed illegal Murphy's tailing techniques are incredibly shabby and so he's naturally caught but manages to escape.The rest of the film concerns Montalban as well as a later infiltration by Murphy when he poses as a man who has stolen a large supply of legal identity cards that he attempts to sell to the scum running the gang from the American side of the border. Some of the film is excellent as Charles McGraw and Howard Da Silva make great heavies particularly McGraw and what occurs with Murphy once he's in the gang was quite a surprise. Also like Noir the film is unflinching and brutal. But unfortunately several times throughout the film the heroes and their forces didn't seem all that bright and at times the only thing that saved them was the sloppiness of the criminals! Additionally the narration particularly at the end is very heavyhanded and hokey. This isn't a great film but it is exciting and worth a look.PSWhile George Murphy wasn't the greatest actor that ever lived and this film doesn't change my opinion of this. However try reading him IMDb biographyit really is fascinating and has many parallels to Ronald Reagan's.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a dark movie! Everything seems to happen at night. Ricardo Montalban is a member of the Mexican FBI and George Murphy his counterpart at the INS. They form a partnership to investigate the illegal smuggling of braceros Mexicans with temporary worker programs across the border where they are exploited by unscrupulous American interests then robbed by bandits when they return to Mexico.Talk about your contemporary problems! It's a decent mystery. The acting is up to snuff. The direction and the photography are professionally competent.And that's about it. Ricardo Montalban gives a good performance and the rest are middling. I prefer Sig Rumann in comic roles maybe alongside the Marx Brothers whereas he's a serious heavy in this one. There is always Alfonso Bedoya along with one of his henchmen from The Treasure of the Sierra Madre but he doesn't have much to do except mangle the English language and his character provides no deliberate relief from the intensity of the story.There's something  unconvincing? Is that the word? Not a moment goes by when you forget you're watching a movie. No matter how hard I tried I was unable to suspend my disbelief. Ricardo Montalban may be too handsome to be a bracero. His haircut is not that of a poor laborer but a Hollywood star. In fact all of the braceros seem too well groomed. Their clothes don't seem lived in although they are all provided with bundles wrapped in serapes and they all wear straw sombreros. They're burdened with lines like Tell me my husband is it dangerous? And it's impossible to sense any feelings of social responsibility behind or in front of the camera. Watch Viva Zapata with its screenplay by John Steinbeck for an illustration of what's lacking here. And watch Traffic for a treatment of the systemic problem that does not devolve into a Manichaean struggle of the good guys versus the bad guys. There are ethical problems on both sides of the border although the ones on the Mexican side seem to dwarf those on the other as that perceptive reviewer Howdymax has observed. Also  what is the Imperial Valley except a flat desert irrigated by water absconded from the Colorado River? I mean there are groves of date palms in Indio. But there is no sense of the desert in this movie. Most seems to have been shot in the studio or on the back lot. The place is missing. There is one unforgettable scene though in which George Murphy is sliced and diced by an agonizingly slowmoving dieselpulled harrow. I think that's what it is. There wasn't much farm machinery in Newark. Murphy by a curious coincidence was elected to the Senate from California back in the 60s. There was a small furor at the time over the ethics of the bracero program. They were getting pretty shabby treatment and some wanted to end the program. Murphy's position on the issue was firm. He approved thoroughly of the bracero program. Braceros he argued were better at picking lettuce and carrots and melons because they were built closer to the ground. I swear I'm not making that up.Well the movie may be obsolete but the questions aren't. It makes for interesting viewing.".

This film was made in 1933 less than a year before Baer demolished Primo Carnera for the title. The 63 225pound Baer was 24 when this film was made and at his physical peak. His chiseled features rivaled those of any actor. Though Baer had never had formal drama training his sheer presenceand funloving personalityoften dominated scenes regardless of those with him. Nowhere is it more evident than in this film. Despite the skills and experience of his primary costars Baer utterly overshadows everyone. About all Loy and everyone else can do here is try not to look too much overshadowed. Everyone who knew Baer including those who fought himsuch as Joe Louisstated that Max was a frustrated performer. As for the film itself as an early talkie its plot and character interactions were quite elementary. Corny might best describe them. Loy and Otto Krueger when not in scenes with Baer demonstrate solid acting. For fight fans this is a Who's Who. Some of the greatest names of early boxing appear here in walkon roles. Jack Dempsey just seven years removed from his championship days is the referee in Baer's climactic title fight with cinemaand actual world championCarnera. Other renowned figures are Jim Jeffries and Jess Willard former heavyweight titlists and former heavyweight challengers Tom Sharkey and Frank Moran. Some trivia Baer here played a character named Steve Morgan. Though his celluloid fight with Carnera was judged a draw Morgan gives the champ quite a beating early in the bout. When Baer and Carnera actually met for the championship on June 14 1934 at New York's Long Island City Bowl Max entered the ring wearing not his own robe but the one from the film...with Steve Morgan's name emblazoned on the back. Obviously it was an attempt to psych Carnera. One of the ringside reporters quipped Too bad Max couldn't make it tonight. I think he might have beaten Primo. Whichever name he used Baer knocked down Carnera a record 11 times in 11 rounds before the referee stopped the bout and awarded Max the crown. This film is worth watching for the charismatic Baer his exciting and entertaining battle with Carnera and all those historic boxing figures.".

We see him in semicomic scenes as a braggart strong man in love scenes with Myrna Loy in which something seems really to be going on between them and in flirtations or affairs with other women in a tenminute dance number embodying fighter training techniques with a line of chorus girls and finally in an only slightly abridged championship fight with the then heavyweight champ Primo Carnera anticipating their actual battle a year later. It's amazing that a screen neophyte with no drama training actually brings these off credibly I agree with the dominating presence comment. If you look at his subsequent filmography it's clear that he never had another significant opportunity perhaps it was necessary for a film to be built around him as this one was.

	schema:reviewBody "Max Baer Myrna Loy and Otto Kruger deliver worthy performances in this curiosity of a film. Clearly it was made and distributed preCode as Myrna Loy's character displays a certain...moral laxity that would not have gone unpunished a few years later. Kruger's tough guy is also unusually nuanced for a gangster of this period.But the real surpriseand delightis Baer. He acts he sings he dances and he does it all as convincingly as he fights in the climactic bout. In that bout he takes on then heavyweight champ Primo Carnera. I found myself on the edge of my seat as I waited to see which of these two renowned boxers would be the one to post an onscreen loss. The resulting decision is best explained by this entry in the American Film Institute Catalog Professional heavyweight boxer Max Baer made his screen debut in the film. At the time of the film's production Primo Carnera who also made his screen debut in the picture was the world's heavyweight boxing champion. Baer was considered the main contender for Carnera's crown and in 1934 he defeated Carnera for the title. Variety notes that Carnera refused to be knocked out at the end of the film and agreed to the draw decision in the script only after the studio added an extra 10000 to his 35000 salary. Hollywood Reporter notes that Baer was 'mutilated' for the first time in his twoyear boxing career when he had two teeth knocked out during a staged fight. According to the modern interview with Myrna Loy Baer studied Carnera's boxing techniques during the filming and later used this 'scouting' information to beat Carnera. In March 1934 Daily Variety announced that the picture had been banned in Germany because Baer was Jewish. That last line is quite the kicker isn't it? All in all this is a film that's worth giving time to.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't think anyone in Hollywood history did so well at playing himself as Max Baer did in this film until Audie Murphy played himself in To Hell and Back. Though his character name was Steve Morgan believe me this is the genuine Max.And this is a lot closer than the portrayal of Baer in that otherwise excellent film Cinderella Man that came out this year. Baer had all the tools necessary to have been the greatest heavyweight champion of all. His power punching killed two people in the ring as was graphically demonstrated in Cinderella Man.But Max was no killer and no bully as Cinderella Man showed. Those deaths deeply affected him and he pulled his punches in many subsequent matches. In addition he was a colorful playboy who just loved the fast nightclub life as he does in The Prizefighter and the Lady.Myrna Loy and her chauffeur are saved from an auto wreck by Max and his fight manager Walter Huston. They find out later she's the main squeeze of hoodlum Otto Krueger. I won't say more but there are some of the same plot elements that are found in Broadway Through a Keyhole and Stars Over Broadway in which this same story has the protagonist a singer.Today's audience might find it a little silly that fighter Max Baer appears in a Broadway review. But that was definitely Max as he sings with a bunch of chorus girls Lucky Fellow Lucky Guy.Myrna Loy Walter Huston and Otto Krueger all turn in fine performances in their parts. And Max Baer was a natural born performer. After his ring career he had a nightclub act with fellow pugilist and former Light Heavyweight Champion Maxie Rosenbloom. Baer was no longer the physical specimen he was in 1933 but he had great comic timing and also did several movie roles by himself and with Rosenbloom.He also did a great dramatic part in The Harder They Fall as a stone cold killer of a heavyweight champion the image that Cinderella Man tried to convey of him.Also the Twentieth Century Fox film Footlight Serenade uses Max Baer as a model for Victor Mature's character.And as a special treat for you boxing fans a whole slew of former ring greats are introduced at the climax of the film before Baer fights for the heavyweight champion.I found the film thoroughly enjoyable and hope TCM shows it more often so the real Max Baer is seen by today's audiences.".

Loy plays a singer who's seeing Otto Kruger and singing in his club  she has a rich mezzo voice courtesy of Bernice Alstock. She meets handsome Baer who pursues her until she marries him. It's not all roses once she learns that he plays around.This is a fascinating as well as entertaining film. Loy is extremely beautiful and lovely in her role and Huston is his usual excellent self as is Otto Kruger. The fascinating part is Baer the champion fighter whose character was unfairly decimated in Cinderella Man  I hope his family objected. Baer was an extremely colorful character out of the ring but never got over killing Frank Campbell during a fight  he put Campbell's children through college. Here he plays something closer to himself an amiable playboy with a mean punch. His appearance in a vaudeville act is almost as impressive as his fighting. In The Prizefighter and the Lady as in real life he fights Primo Carnera as he would a year later. Carnera refused to appear in the film as originally written where he would be knocked out. I thought Baer was big until I saw Carnera  WHOA. The screen fight is very effective.There are several real sports figures in the film besides Carnero  Jack Dempsey who helped Baer make a comeback later on when he started telegraphing his punches and also James Jeffries and Frank Moran. If you're a prize fighter historian this is the movie for you.Baer went on to make other movies in fact he was known as a frustrated performer. His most notable appearance was in Bogart's last film The Harder They Fall. By then of course his screen persona was a little different. I don't actually agree with one of the comments about the film  I think The Prizefighter and the Lady despite the star performances would have been fairly routine without him. As an added plus for baby boomers  he's Jethro's dad after all.".

Even though Max Baer was second billed and is the center of attention of the plot he actually gets very few lines or real acting scenes. People talk more about him than talk to him.The film opens in a bar where washed up boxing manager The Professor Walter Huston is drowning his sorrows and telling tall tales as has apparently been his habit for some time. The bartender Max Baer as Steve Morgan takes care of a couple of rough customers with some impressive boxing moves and The Professor decides to promote him as a fighter  starting small at first partly because Morgan is an unknown partly because the professor's reputation has become somewhat scarred along with his liver. While out road training one day a car crashes nearby and the professor and Morgan rescue Belle Mercer Myrna Loy and her driver. It turns out Belle is a nightclub star and mistress to jealous gangster Willie Ryan Otto Kruger. In spite of this danger Morgan won't take no for an answer and pursues Belle although with sparse dialogue and little finesse making her succumbing to his charms all the more mystifying.So far you have your standard fight movie of the 1930's  a washed up promoter gets a second chance and an unknown natural gets an opportunity to work up to the championship with a classy lady and a gangster thrown in for good measure. I'll let you watch and see how everything plays out. I will talk about some of the weirder points of the production though.The dialogue is very abbreviated and also delivered rapid fire like a Warner Bros. film of the same era. Also gangster Willie Ryan is a hard one to figure out. When Morgan is pursuing Belle he threatens gun play and gets very tough. After Morgan wins her he tries to take a more psychological even gentle route. Plus Willie's chief bodyguard and muscle looks like he is eligible for social security had it existed in 1933. That guy couldn't scare much less beat up anyone. While Steve seems only interested in satisfying every carnal urge at Belle's expense Willie seems interested only in Belle's happiness. By the end of the film I found myself genuinely liking Willie the gangster and disliking selfcentered Steve.. Then there is a bizarre little musical number stuck in the film featuring Max Baer and a bunch of chorus girls with fight training gear as props. Max sings does some simple dance moves and acquits himself pretty well in this silliness but it did leave me asking  Why???? I'd say it's worthwhile just for the cheekiness of it all. Plus it's a chance to see Myrna Loy in a role that MGM would never have assigned her to after she really hit the big time the following year in The Thin Man.".

However soon after the wedding Baer begins drinking and womanizing and seemed to be a major jerkand a very talented boxer. Unfortunately he promised again and again he'd change but he didn't. By the end of the film he'd lost his wife and manager and didn't seem to care. However the usual clich of turnaround scene when the boxer hit bottom never really occurred with Baer's character! By the big fight at the end of the film he STILL was a jerkyet despite this the wife and manager came running back to him!! This made very little sense and seems to have set back women's rights several decades.While the plot of this film and production values are at best average this film has a lot of historical value and so it shouldn't be written off completely. That's because this boxing film is unique in that it stars several real boxersincluding several champions. Max Baer and Primo Carnera were at the time the most famous active boxersboth having been champions. Max Baer is the star of the film and does a pretty good job of acting considering he is NOT an actor. Plus it's interesting to see Max Baer Jr.'s Jethro from THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES father act. In addition Jack Dempsey perhaps the most famous boxer of the 20th Century makes a significant appearance as well and there are some small cameos by famous boxers and wrestlers of the age. So as a result this movie is a MUST for boxing fans or lovers of pop culture and American history. All I suggest though is that you realize this is NOT a great filmjust interesting for reasons other than artistic merit.".

	schema:headline " Decent but unravels a bit at the end";
	schema:reviewBody "There is a lot to like about this movie starting with the beautiful Myrna Loy who is caught in a love triangle between a gangster and an up and coming boxer. The boxer is played by real life heavyweight Max Baer who is certainly as good an actor as most for the time period and very interesting to watch. The gangster is played well by Otto Kruger so it's a strong cast. The film's pace over the first half or so is great and I found myself a little surprised with one of the directions it took but I won't spoil it. I liked seeing Loy singing though it may have been lip sync'd and it was fun and a little silly to see Baer in a pretty long musical number later. That's probably the beginning of where the film finds itself being a little too long but it's really the big fight at the end with reallife champion Primo Canera which drags on. They introduce a number of other reallife boxers which may have been a thrill to boxing fans in 1933 but with the exception of Jack Dempsey is less interesting today at least to me. During these introductions there is a pretty mean joke about Kate Smith who is said to be in the audience sitting in seats one two and three. The boxing action itself is spotty  director W.S Van Dyke includes some nice shots such as Carnera coming out of his corner as well as an overhead angle but there is quite a bit of footage that you can tell has been sped up and quite a bit that looks unrealistic. I also hated the ending. Oddly enough in a movie with so many big name boxers it was the boxing that caused me to drop the rating a bit. Still worth watching though.".

It's not your typical swooning love story and she isn't exactly ecstatic about announcing her love to her former crime boss lover who worships and adores her but is also not your typical gangster.

I know that Willie Ryan was a gangster and not good but spoilers ahead He did not order people to get knocked off and did fire Belle Myrna Loy from her nightclub singing position so she could go back to her husband boxer Steve Morgan Baer. Speaking of Ryan he ended up okay much better then other guys who lost Loy characters to someone else such as Blackie Gallagher Clark Gable in 'Manhattan Melodrama.' 3 Myrna Loy. Her character Belle is the one who is the moral compass of the movie. Belle is different then many dramatic characters she played in her career. Gertie Waxted in 'Penthouse' 'Evelyn Prentice' Coco in 'Topaze' AnneMarie in 'Stamboul Quest' Eleanor in Manhattan Melodrama' and her two nastiest characters Fah Lo See in 'The Mask Of Fu Manchu' and Ursula Georgi in 'Thirteen Women.' Come to mind. None of which are really nice. What you see with her is a very decent and strong person who is unappreciated by both Willie and especially Steve who cheats on her. The only person who really understands her is 'The Professor' Walter Huston who is Steve's trainer. He said You are not like other women.' If you see the fight where Steve is getting pounded by Carnera and believes everyone is against him 'The Professor' cannot help him because Steve fired him and Willie said to Belle Have you seen enough? enjoying seeing him get beaten it is Belle who says We haven't even started and gets 'The Professor' back in the corner and he helps Steve salvage a draw. Also watch the end where Steve goes down on one knee to her and says I don't want to be the big man I just want you. And repeats 'The Professor's observation of her. However she along with 'The Professor' are going to continue to have him fight and become the champion he can be. The one difference is unlike earlier when she was home washing dishes she will be there making sure everything works in and out of the ring. 810 stars.".

Without the principals involved it's just another romance gone wrongsports story but when you throw in the fact that there are five count 'em five former World Heavyweight Boxing Champions in the picture well just the idea simply blows me away.Regarding the love story it's rather improbable that a character portrayed by Myrna Loy would fall for a lug like boxer Max Baer but that's the premise so you'll have to go along with it. Gangster Willie Ryan Otto Kruger couldn't believe it himself he was Belle Mercer's Loy main squeeze until Steve Morgan Baer showed up and when Belle announces her surprise marriage to the fighter Ryan had to ask her Were you on the junk? Whoa preCode remarks like that are always a sit up and take notice moment!Before we get to the picture's world title match Max Baer genuinely surprises with talent that supersedes the boxing ring. Lined up chorus style with a bevy of dancers about half his size Baer sings and dances his way through 'Lucky Fella' while manhandling the gals through an entertaining gym performance and a solidly choreographed table routine. Seriously I couldn't get over Baer's performance here he had showmanship and style that belied his large muscular frame.The story builds to an eventual boxing match between Steve Morgan and the real heavyweight champ at the time Primo Carnera. The introductions prior to the match allow modern day viewers a look at some of the boxing greats of yesteryear  Joe Rivers Jackie Fields Billy Parke Jess Willard Frank Moran and Jim Jeffries. Even wrestling champ Strangler Lewis makes an appearance while Jack Dempsey shares a joke with Jess Willard regarding their own title match in 1919 Willard stating that he didn't remember much about that day.Though the relationship between Belle and Morgan turns rocky during their marriage due to Steve's wandering eye and libido her presence at ringside for the title bout brings her around to caring about the big lug once again. There's not much about their reconciliation that's believable following the match's draw decision much less Willie Ryan's favorable reaction to their getting back together again. I guess the best way to describe it is by using Belle's own words from earlier in the film  Oh that's a lot of horseradish.".

	schema:reviewBody "This novelty film provides more entertainment that one might expect. Myrna Loy is Belle headline singer at a club owned by tough guy Willie Ryan Otto Kruger. When Belle meets ambitious heavyweight boxer Steve Morgan Max Baer she is swept off her feet by his confidence and charm. Willie wants to retaliate against the ironjawed palooka but his love of Belle forces him to step aside and hope for her happiness.Max Baer is the center of this film. The story follows his life in and out of the ring. This is stunt casting. Baer was a prime contender for the real world heavyweight title. Who knew he could actually act...and sing and dance! In one scene he performs with a bevy of chorines in a number that is the best part of the film. Most dance numbers in 1933 are no match for the precision artistry and technical skills of the choreography in the forties and later but the training day motif of this dance displays real fitness and gymnastic ability. And Baer performs with them tap for tap.The end of the film includes a boxing match between the contender and the champ featuring three boxing champions in the ring at the same time Jack Dempsey as the referee Max Baer and Primo Carnera. It also features the introduction of other ring celebrities including James J. Jeffries. With boxing in its heyday these cameos must have thrilled many filmgoers.As a time capsule this film reveals much about the culture language and attitudes of the depression era. It is also a surprisingly effective romance.In real life Baer would defeat champion Carnera in 1934. Baer's life was so colorful it would make a great subject for film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Max Baer may not be a name a lot of people remember today he didn't stick out as powerfully in the longrun of the public consciousness as Joe Louis for example but it may depend on who you talk to. But in his time he was a very popular boxer and he shows in The Prizefighter and the Lady that he could hold his own very well as an actor  this is significant because he is put as a colead with Myrna Loy one of the great actresses of her time in Hollywood or any time. The story is very simple though there's some deep emotions running through a boxer meets a woman by chance a road accident actually from a car Belle's in that swerves off the road. He brings her back home she's alright but he asks her to come and check out a fight that he'll be in. Belle does and it's something that makes her a little uneasy possibly but Steve Morgan is one helluva guy to keep persisting and charmer as well and they somehow find each other at a club where she's singing. Oh and she's technically with some vaguely criminal element what he does isn't entirely clear but whatever.Somehow very quickly she decides to marry him. This is where the complications set in for them since he's got a wandering eye for other ladies. I wondered why it was so quick for her to marry him and other characters ask this question of her. She says something to the effect of looking into his eyes and seeing a kid she'd want to protect or take care of or something. It doesn't seem very credible but I went with it. What unfolds is somewhat predictable but not in a way that's written poorly and certainly the acting helps Belle catches Steve in one lie lets him off there's a scene where she's in bed and the way she confronts him isn't as angry but just as stern and disappointed but willing to forgive it may be my favorite acted scene in the movie and then when she catches him again that's it and she leaves him. But what about the next big fight against Primo Carnera? I think that because Baer really does sell the emotions of this guy  there are times that Dyke's camera just lays on his face as he thinks of something and it feels real like he's not faking it  and can deliver the dialog with a great amount of believability he's a natural for the role. That he doesn't have to stretch too far as a boxer likely helps but with Loy there she must have helped to keep him at ease and be natural as he is as well. Other actors around them are fairly standard Walter Huston as the Professor is fine but not as great as one might think but it's just a pleasure to see Loy on screen in a role where she can be naturally beautiful and sexy and deliver a good song albeit two different times which is odd and yet is still interesting in the climax.By the final fight it seems fairly clear what the trajectory will be but maybe that's not a bad thing and the director and writers get a lot of good conventional movie mileage out of the fall and rise element in just this final fight. It actually became intense and I have to wonder if other boxing movies in decades to come maybe even Rocky to a small extent looked to something like The Prizefighter and the Lady as an example of how to do it. I wouldn't say it's a lost classic or anything and there's a point midway through where the movie just stops for a ridiculous musical number ! which is kind of fun but strange to see for how long it goes for. But if you want a sweet little movie about characters being good or disappointing to others then this is something to check out.".

They meet by chance but it is obvious from start to finish that her benefactor a dour Otto Kruger is unwilling to let her go without a fight. Baer goes from rags to riches as a rising prizefighter and like others before him he is exploited in the media practically becoming his own circus.Throughout all this are the musical numbers which tend to interrupt the more interesting dramatic action basically stopping the film to show Myrna Loy obviously dubbed performing Downstream Drifter. Then comes the big production number with Lucky Fella an overthetop romp with Baer and tons of chorus girls performing a nonsensical number that is as large as anything else MGM had produced yet seems to have no real point other than to show how the character was being exploited once he became a household name. An excellent performance by Walter Huston as Baer's alcoholic mentor and reallife champ Jack Dempsey in a cameo as himself are among the highlights but overall I was disappointed for something I had extrahigh hopes for.I must also comment on the extremely dark photography which made the film seem rather hard in an era made before film noir where that intentionally was thrown in to heighten the mood.

I don't know anything about Cinderella Man or the violent sport of boxing that so many people seem to be drawn to. So this was a film I wasn't sure was even going to be worth my time. But I love precode films of the early 1930s and I do like Myrna Loy so I figured there might be a chance I'd enjoy the movie somewhat. Well it was one of the best films I've ever seen and for those who are wincing or gagging at that let me say it's all a matter of opinion folks.I've been reading the reviews here I did not know Max Baer killed anyone in his boxing career and I just have to laugh at some of the comments from those who couldn't get anything out of this.For example. Someone said that a real actor should have been used for the role of the prizefighter. Okay. How about Clark Gable who was just coming in to his own at the time? Needless to say Gable would have been perfect as he was and always will be The King. Actors today should bow to the man and simply step aside. But they went with a real athlete and to my surprise he pulled it off and then some! If you want to get technical and start nitpicking on Baer's acting then you'll find exactly what you're looking for. But as far as I was concerned I was thoroughly entertained by a man who had never acted in his life before and then to sing and tap dance in a musical number midway through the film? My gosh why haven't we heard about this film before? Someone also said that Walter Huston's performance wasn't believable. Gee. I've never seen any film work of Huston before but I not only found him believable but I walked away a fan looking forward to seeing more films of his. He definitely deserved a nomination for Best Supporting Actor had the category existed in those days.I also walked away appreciating Myrna Loy more than I ever have. What a beautiful woman and what star presence! This might have been a good role for Claudette Colbert once a grand star of her time and much forgotten today but I think Miss Loy probably has the edge here.At the end I had tears in my eyes. All was forgiven everybody reunited and walked away happy ain't love grand?".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the joys of seeing foreign films is catching a glimpse into  other cultures. What do other people consider funny? Ordinary?  Terrifying? Cure puts a Japanese spin on an idea that several  American directors have touched on that evil is something that can  afflict perfectly ordinary people. David Lynch's Twin Peaks  television series explored a similar idea to Kurosawa's ordinary  people afflicted with evil rather than evil people as such.  The difference between Lynch and Kurosawa is that Lynch saw evil as  some sort of independent force whereas Kurosawa sees evil more as an  idea. Cure presents us with a world in which words and ideas are a  kind of virus that passes from person to person leaving destruction in  its wake. A carrier who doesn't fall ill himself but who infects  others with murderous instincts.  For this reason some of the comments here surprised me. Frequent  complaints about how elliptical the film is and how the characters  need to be better defined. In particular several complaints that the  film never explained who the drifter was or where he came from.  Surprising because that to me was the point he was nobody special.  He didn't come from anywhere special. Viewers brought up on a diet of  American cinema will find Cure frustrating American thrillers always  explain who the killer is why he kills and most importantly why he  is different from you and me. This last point is to comfort the  audience to let them know that they could never be like the killer  that they are outside the drama watching. Kurosawa presses the  opposite point this could be you there is nothing special about these  men. You should not be convinced that you are different from them.  I will admit that if you dislike slowlypaced cinema a la Tarkovsky  or if you don't buy the hypnotism mumbojumbo on which the film is  based then you will probably find Cure tiresome. I enjoy Tarkovsky  and I found that it wasn't a lot of work to suspend disbelief on the  point of hypnotism. Finally this film is an intellectual thriller  it's more frightening for its implications than for what actually goes  on. The point is not to scare you and then wrap it all up neatly at the  end like most American thrillers but instead to show you a possible  world and then scare you after you leave the cinema with thoughts of  what might follow.

Kiyoshi Kurosawa is an extremely talented individual and perhaps the only writerdirector who is able to simultaneously scare and mentally challenge me at the same time note that very few are capable of doing one or the other. Although the writing is very good story and dialogue Kurosawa's real strength is his ability to represent visually the progressive denouement of his story. He rather subtly show you and let your imagination and intellect figure it out for you than to spell out bluntly what the straightforward storyline should be. It does not however get to the point of chaotic untidiness or pointlessness for he is able to guide you slowly along the way I would then say that he is slightly easier to follow than David Lynch is but then again who is not. He uses here a strikingly effective technique where he shows you a room from one angle and later lets you discover that room more and more as the movie advances. His camera shots are always well planned and he is thus able to draw you in the movie bit by bitquite an eerie sensation.The acting is generally good and believable. The camerawork is a stand out.There are many scenes where you will be able to appreciate this superior artistic and technical quality. The music is good and tenseful but it is sparse and what is used instead is a contrast of minimalist and grossly amplified everyday sounds that vibrate through the movie. When there is no sound you often find yourself holding your breath. This is not used strictly as a ploy but rather creates a mood and further pulls you in the general atmosphere of the movie. Most of all again the directing is top notch. The pace which is slow enough for you to have the time to both think and be afraid is not slow enough that it gets boring although you should not expect a North American expeditious run through the film. Everything is there but it comes to you in slow meticulously chosen dosage. Only at the end can you truly see the masterpiece that has been drawn stroke by stroke in front of you.One of the reason this movie actually works is that it is designed to play with your mind and trigger fear and reaction based not only on emotion but on reason. People are dying but everything is calm rational. The tone and story are pretty much realistic and at the end of the experience you may feel beyond your volitional control that you are actually convinced of the strange things in the movie. Hopefully this feeling will subside...".

To reveal any more of what happens would be to give a bit too much away.The subtlety and fluidity of this film is remarkable. The main character can be charming and simultaneously irritating when he speaks. He turns his speaking partner's question back on the speaker he answers with vague phrases that nevertheless over the course of the film gradually bring out the complexity of his psyche. Pitting him against a cop whose wife seems to suffer from something like the hypnotist's 'brand' of mental wanderings underlines the thematic context of the film what we know is almost certainly only what we think we know. And what we think we know is almost certainly based on someone else's 'knowledge' derived the same as ours.That knowledge is a collective phenomenon a shared and critical feature of the 'hive' is not a novel concept in film. But its presentation here is bold and original. To link that idea with a person who destroys life is a master stroke it says that what we know vanishes in a suddenly extinguished flame or a tiny stream of water that appears runs and then is seen no more.This is a film that should definitely be added to the great films of the 90s. Since it was not released in the U.S. until 2001 I vote for it being one of the great films of that year here.".

Much of the story unfolds in master shots keeping you at a distance from the characters and affording the illusion of a comfortable intellectual detachment which it meticulously strips away scene by scene.The plot is deceptively simple a weary Japanese Homicide detective is investigating a series of grotesque murders.  Each murder seems to have the same ritualistic pattern yet in each case the culprit turns out to be an ordinary individual dazed and unable to offer any motive for their horrific crime.  Nothing seems to connect the murderers to each other until the Detective picks up the trail of an amnesia afflicted drifter who seems unable to answer even the simplest questions about himself yet displays a disconcerting ability to reflect any line of questioning about his own identity back upon the questioner.  Time and again he returns to a question at the core of the mysteryWho are you?It seems more and more as the drifter is passed from detective to guard to clinician to pyschiatrist that this question is far more dangerous than anyone might have guessed.Kyua is a model of subtlety and restraint.  Although there's a significant amount of implied violence and several shocking scenes of murder these aren't gratuitous.  Kyua's particular genius is it's ability to transform it's urban Japanese landscapes and even the most common objects from familiar to suspect and eventually sinister a length of piping a flashing traffic sign a blast furnace the sound of ocean surf at night a flickering lighter a dark apartment lined with academic tomes a puddle of spilled water the letter X smeared on a wall a deserted rundown building.There are few filmmakers with the audacity and imagination to venture into the places Kyua wants to take you.  Fincher Lynch and Cronenberg come to mind as those who time and time again have shown their willingness and perhaps compulsion to return to the unsettling territory of perception identity and the boundary between normalcy and psychosis.  If the director's first name were only David it's not his name is Kiyoshi Kurosawa we'd have the makings of a good conspiracy theory here.The film was released in 1997 but only recently has made it's way to western shores and US distribution by Cowboy Pictures and has wound its way inevitably to cable networks like Sundance.  It's cast includes Koji Yakusho as the detective Takabe.  Fans of Japanese cinema will recognize this fine actor from his award winning roles in Shall we Dance and The eel.Kyua isn't the type of visceral immediate drama that the average suspense film provides.  If you can put aside your preconceived notions and allow it to unfold in it's own time I suspect you will find the questions it asks and secrets it reveals to be all the more disquieting problematic and in the end profound.  Many critics have lined up to call this film a masterpiece and pegged Kurosawa as one of a number of japanese directors worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the wake of the saringas attack mounted by the Aum Shinrikyo cult on the Tokyo subway system in 1995 horror films enjoyed a sudden spurt of popularity in Japan. Many of the films focus on hypnosis or mediainduced violence the fragile normalcy of modern life and grisly deeds committed by seemingly ordinary citizens. This unnerving 1997 thriller which seems like a direct response to the Aum Shinrikyo incident offers a glimpse of how our own national cinema may absorb the blow of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. A rash of senseless murders wracks Tokyo the victims have deep Xshaped gashes across their throats and the killers often their loved ones are found in a daze. The only connection appears to be a mysterious drifter Masato Hagiwara who gets into random strangers' heads with a single oftrepeated question Who are you? What makes this subtle quiet shocker so unsettling is the idea that everyone has secret resentments that render him or her hypnotically pliablethat everyone harbors some glimmer of murderous rage that can be exploited whether by a drifter or by religious extremists. The writerdirector Kiyoshi Kurosawa a prolific Japanese filmmaker who's developing a large cult following here heightens the unease with buzzing soundtrack noise and eerie long takes that leave us consistently unprepared for the violence to come.

	onyx:emotionText "In the wake of the saringas attack mounted by the Aum Shinrikyo cult on the Tokyo subway system in 1995 horror films enjoyed a sudden spurt of popularity in Japan. Many of the films focus on hypnosis or mediainduced violence the fragile normalcy of modern life and grisly deeds committed by seemingly ordinary citizens. This unnerving 1997 thriller which seems like a direct response to the Aum Shinrikyo incident offers a glimpse of how our own national cinema may absorb the blow of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. A rash of senseless murders wracks Tokyo the victims have deep Xshaped gashes across their throats and the killers often their loved ones are found in a daze. The only connection appears to be a mysterious drifter Masato Hagiwara who gets into random strangers' heads with a single oftrepeated question Who are you? What makes this subtle quiet shocker so unsettling is the idea that everyone has secret resentments that render him or her hypnotically pliablethat everyone harbors some glimmer of murderous rage that can be exploited whether by a drifter or by religious extremists. The writerdirector Kiyoshi Kurosawa a prolific Japanese filmmaker who's developing a large cult following here heightens the unease with buzzing soundtrack noise and eerie long takes that leave us consistently unprepared for the violence to come. And the last sequence will leave people arguingit requires close attention culminating in an ending even more disturbing in its implications than the conclusion of SEVEN.";

	schema:headline " Cure impressionistic portrait of a serial killer";
	schema:reviewBody "I think it is important to distinguish Cure from the avalanche of whitefaceghostgirl Japanese horror flicks that followed in Ringu's wake. Purely because it's a different beast and lumping it in a convenient Jhorror niche is doing it a disservice. I won't go into plot specifics because it's only a skeleton for Kurosawa to hang his atmospherics. That said I can understand the complaint many viewers seem to share man it doesn't make sense but without having any claims on solving Cure's riddle I'm satisfied with letting wash over me one watch at a time. Kurosawa wisely doesn't attempt to explain his plot. He's content to lift the veil just enough for us to sneak a glimpse in before he disorients again. The plot slowly builds through little tokens that are never followed by an orchestral crescento to signal their arrival. They just happen. A small photo in a book muffled words on a phonogram an old video the ramblings of an amnesiac theories on 18th century Austrian doctors. In the course of the film everything seems to be coming together only to remain elusive in the end. In that aspect I find Cure to be closer to Last Year at Marienbad than your average Ringu clone. It's not about making sense it's about pushing limits within which you can. It's about soaking in the impression it makes. When muffled words come through a phonogram they're more incoherent ramblings than a telegraphed plot solution but they contribute just as well to the overarching feel. This elliptic mentality is abetted by Kurosawa's choice of a slow deliberate pace and many long shots entire scenes covered without any cuts. The gritty and rundown aspect of Tokyo is photographed like a more naturalistic version of David Fincher's work and does the job well.It's my impression that a surrealist air hovers above and at the heart of Cure at times reminiscent of a more languid version of Lynch. It is undoubtedly a horror movie so don't be put off by my Resnais comparison but it's as much bleak as it is subtle and leaves enough to the mind's eye to make you carry it out with you.".

This young suspect has amnesia or does he nowhe exasperates the Doctor  the detectives questioning him to the point of our wanting to do the same  then changing our mindsThis is a modern tale set in modern Tokyobut using an old camera style of cinematography Most interesting.There is also a very old building from the late 19th century that may hold the clue to solve this tale. We do learn certain things BUT left in doubt at the conclusion.OH yes Mesmerism play a vital role as well.This is a near brilliant film  should be seenOf course the US run consisted of no more than 4 theatres in 1997.I do not know if it was ever on Cable or TV. It is available for rent in libraries this is where my friend rented it from I got mine from NETFLIX  am glad I did. It is a most thoughtprovoking mystery drama It is deliberately slow paced so we can hopefully appreciated every scene. Final Warning It is confusing at times BUT always interesting.Rating  out of 4 89 points out of 100 IMDb 8  out of 10 89 points is 1 point shy of a 12 rating".

It had slow methodical pacing but it was never boring. I for one appreciated the elliptical editing as it's just a filmmaker doing something different and being creative. Actually it added to the hypnotic arc of the story. It didn't bother me whatsoever although it wasn't nearly as effective in Kiyoshi's other great movie Kairo. Koji Yakusho was brilliant as troubled Detective Takabe and the mysterious drifter with hypnotic powers was very convincing as well. The use of hypnotism to get others to kill and rendering themselves soulless was a refreshing take on the serialkiller subgenre of which I love. Someone commented here that only people who buy the mumbo jumbo hypnotism storyline would like this film and comments like those always bother me. Narrative films are not REAL LIFE even the ones based on true stories.  They are works of art and try to tell us entertaining comedic frightning and dramatic stories to keep the audience interested. I don't have to believe in the subjects their stories are telling me nor do I believe they need to solve the world's problems. All I care is that they give me an interesting idea an interesting story with wellwritten dialogue and if it ends with a bang. These blended with great acting now that's an area that needs convincing in film great camera work and an engaging score. Those are what make films interesting and Kyua aka Cure has all those qualities. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "First time I saw this thanks to an otherwise fine festival director obsessed with Eastern Europe to the exclusion of most neoeiga I'd seen nothing by Kiyoshi Kurosawa and though I realize now I'd seen him in his 1979 debut for Gosha as well as in Tampopo and Kamikaze Taxi I was incognizant of Koji Yakusho's range or his stardom. Shall We Dance I'm pretty sure played here after Cure's festival debut. The festival buzz on Cure was scream flick not director matures crowds Tarkovsky.Early in Cure Kenichi Yakusho comes home to find the clothes washer spinning stops it looks inside finds nothing. A little later his wife Fumie stops him doing some chore Let me do it. I feel good today She means I'm sane today but we don't know this we haven't quite understood her chat across a table with a bearded man in a previous scene. Those words this line I feel good today to the exclusion of other or even most days are uttered in pretty much Fumie's tone one time or another by nearly any wife. My mother's spoken them countless times far back as I can recall. Now she's 85 mobile sane with a couple of decades likely still in her. Though Cure a film of words as much as images works linearly it's really a circular film. Repeated viewings pay. You could start at any point within it and watch full round. It's not a suspense film though it's full of suspense of the moment of where the camera will go next of where a gaze will fall a hand will go of where and whether a character will turn or pause or not pause.Because both actors have Koizumi hair when we first see at distance a trenchcoated figure walking a beach we can't be sure it's not Kenichi. The camera won't zoom in on the incessantly questioning amnesiac until after we've placed his voice as new to us. NoName later Mamiya functions as a semantic a near totally verbal catalyst. If you must he's Ringu's tape but I kept thinking of the What Was It You Wanted? track on Dylan's Oh Mercy. It's no accident that NoName's nothing but voice at first. The beach scene's school teacher later babbles introspectively analytically tangled up in words amazed Yes. I killed her for no reason. Mesmer makes an okay MacGuffin but as I say about rope and knots in my comment at Undo don't see hypnotism spell or trance. See hear just words just questions. Even Mamiya's lighter needs to be named spoken. The Aum weren't hypnotized. Suicide bombers aren't. Atta's Al Qaeda crew weren't. Zero pilots willing and not because it's an infinite world there have to have been both as well as every gradient inbetween weren't. Whatever was done to any of these was words language.Later in Sance Yakusho plays a sound man. Devoid of music Cures' ambient sound is sometimes so pumped it backgrounds the images. Try closing your eyes for a few film minutes and only listen. If you know no Japanese all the better. What's there? Rhythms? Randomness? Oddity? The mundane? Tradition? Modernity? I could go much longer than allowed here but skip to the very last scene for not a spoiler but an alert. YakushoKenichi's seated in a cafeteria. You MUST see small backgrounded in an obscure corner of the screen a glint of metal traveling. Seeing it completes the loop thrusts you into the beginning of the film. Your instinctive struggle to leave the loop to understand the glint or even not to have seen it is Kurosawa's design. Your struggle his design. That's why I say crowding Tarkovsky. At best they spiral. They turn back or turn in. Kurosawa's Kairo works a similar loop.".

	schema:reviewBody "In many ways this movie has one of the scariest villains in horror movie history. He is so cunning and emotionless and he has tremendous powers that he could use at will. I wouldn't call this movie scary but it really got under my skin.Certain scenes were really effective because they come out of absolutely nowhere. The hanging scene or the scene with the nurse murdering the guy came out of nowhere. The movie moves really slow with absolutely shocking moments at frequent intervals. The mark appearing at various points was also effective. I have often mentioned that payoff is important at least give me something! And this movie delivers that in spades. Koji Yakusho gives a stunning performance as Takabe. His frequent bursts were incredible to watch. A detective as he explains is not supposed to show any emotion. Takabe at various points is almost losing it but he manages to compose himself at the last moment. He tries to be the dutiful husband to his ill wife. He tries to do his job despite dealing with scumbags. Yet towards the end he finds that he might be losing the battle to Mamiya.And that's what this movie is all about. It is about the battle between Takabe and Mamiya. Despite trying his best Mamiya manages to get into the mind of Takabe after getting a few details about his life. That's all Mamiya needs to manipulate someone. Few people are immune to his hypnosis techniques. The way in which the movie details the crimes of Mamiya is a treat to watch. It is just fascinating to watch how he manages to talk to those people and understand their issues quite easily. Most probably he knows their story even before they told him. Even the calm and composed Sakuma becomes increasingly erratic towards the end.As in many movies of this nature the lack of music or minimalist music works so well. It lends a documentary feel to the scenes. But some scenes suddenly switch to a surreal nature and that is disorienting. That's why this movie works so well. The concept itself is interesting. What is Mamiya exactly doing? Is he manipulating people to commit crimes or is he just removing the inhibitions? It is even scary to see how otherwise normal people seem to lose it. Even people like that friendly officer. The movie is incredibly atmospheric and the creepy concept and the execution elevate this movie to classic status.The ending is disturbing as well and it gives a satisfying conclusion to his excellent horror film.One of my favourite Japanese horror films and I rate it a 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw CURE at the San Francisco Film Festival in around 1998 and like many I found the concept and craftsmanship arresting. A number of audience members stayed around afterwards to discuss it  it's a psychologically complex tale of hypnotism and the seductions of altered consciousness. Koji Yakusho DORA HEITA 13 ASSSASSINS etc. is at his acting peak as a detective who tries to solve a series of murders that don't seem to relate to common logic.Recently I saw the DVD version of the film  and it's clear that the film had been cut severely. Most viewers have only seen the US DVD version so they're not even aware of the problem. A few of the more graphic sequences were cut important portions of the narrative set in an old sanatorium were excised and the violent finish was excised entirely. The US DVD concludes with the suggestion of a further killing the theatrical Japanese version is more powerful and unambiguous. In some cases a later recut version may be better than the original however that's not the case here. There's scant online text relating to the differences between the two versions. It speaks well for director Kiyoshi Kurosawa that he took a lowbudget police procedural and made an innovative thriller out of it. Most of the scenes are underedited and shot at a distance to extract the most from the hypnotic storyline the longer hypnotic sequences are several minutes long with no edits. Because the film uses mediumdistance shots to give a sense of hypnotic disassociation viewers with larger screens will gain an advantage.I strongly recommend seeing it  but would suggest you seek out the original uncut theatrical print if you can. The differences are striking. I'd rate the original print as 1010 the cutdomestic DVD is maybe 710. This film would profit from a Criterion reissue but that doesn't seem to be in the works.".

In 'western' storytelling there's always a clear distinction between the good side and the evil side. In Japanese storiesthis distinction is often more vague which makes the story behave more like the realworld. If you seek simple amusement and a puzzle that is gradually but surely solved by the detective this movie is not for you. The movie begins like a straightforward serial killer story but soon changes from a 'whodunit' to a more enigmatic 'HOWdunit'.The sometimes apparently random introduction of characters events and clues to the story and the way the personae subsequently derange from their expected behavior in the course of events adds to the shock and never gives you any solid ground to identify and sympathize with the characters or to get a grip on the story. You have the feeling you're constantly put on the wrong track. You're brain is desperately trying to put the puzzle together but it's no good. Sometimes they find a clue that might solve the puzzle but a moment later you realize they're on the wrong track leaving you completely clueless again. 'Kyua' leaves you with mixed feelings amazed unfulfilled puzzled scared disgusted and everything in between. All you want to do is to watch it again and make sense of it all in spite of the fact that you know that it's no good.".

	schema:headline " The Single Greatest Film in the History of Japanese Cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Kiyoshi Kurosawa perfects the concept of hypnotic villainy in this film which features a battle of wills between a detective and a genius who uses the power of suggestion to set in motion a series of killings throughout a city. Showcasing innovative suspense sequences plot twists and rich psychologicalphilosophical concepts this film will have viewers pondering well after it ends. Kiyoshi again manages to elude the pitfalls of popular cinema to contribute not only a chilling masterpiece but arguably one of the most awesome villains to ever grace the big screen.Of the thousands of films I've seen few have floored me to the point where I've wanted to grant them the honor of being the Best Movie Ever. The only other film that comes to mind is A Tale of Two Sisters 2003 which is easily the most impressive motion picture of all time. Since that distinction is taken that leaves Cure 1997 with the runnerup spot in terms of world cinema but the medal for Best Japanese Movie Ever is still for the taking. This film takes it. I've seen 1328 films from that country and I can tell you that even Yasujiro Ozu and Shinya Tsukamoto have failed to match the brilliance of Cure. This is quite possibly the most engaging slowpaced film in existence. The tempo moves slower than molasses in January but the introduction of the lead antagonist a mere 8 minutes into the film sets the seemingly endless array of intriguing moments into motion from the get go. Masato Hagiwara's character of Kunio Mamiya is spellbinding with his hypnotic technique that starts off with seemingly trivial dialogue but slowly progresses into an ingenious psychological trap. This provides for a number of memorable moments my favorite of which is the mesmerizing water enchantment of the hospital nurse. In addition the identity of this character is expertly crafted as a sort of ambiguous soulpersonality whose essence is only truly revealed during the very last frame. No other film has created an antagonist so uniformly dangerous sublime and interesting as Kunio Mamiya.Kiyoshi Kurosawa is easily one of the top five directors of all time. This guy made three perfect films that no one talks about  Cure 1997 Kairo 2001 and Charisma 1999. What's really interesting is that he follows a rather unique arthouse style that's almost never applied to the horrorthriller genres. Kiyoshi uses long shots deliberate pacing and ambiguity in moderation which is unlike most arthouse directors who have no sense of discretion. Despite the mindless ramblings of mainstream cinemaphiles Kiyoshi rarely if ever indulges in pompous selfcongratulatory filming techniques because his choice of lean running times under two hours in almost every instance helps him to avoid the bloated masturbatory pretentiousness that rears its ugly head in other arthouse style films. Think Andrei Tarkovsky with more interesting and refined philosophical content and you'll have an idea of just how special Kiyoshi Kurosawa is as a director.Whenever possible I like to point out the high content levels of Kiyoshi's films in an attempt to counter the nonsensical claims of some who feel that he practices a form of style over substance. Take the seemingly trivial dialogue that the Kunio Mimiya character engages in during his hypnotic acts of terrorism. The exchanges are an odd mix on a superficial level but one comes to realize their importance when the victims are subjected to police interrogation. Only then does the viewer understand why Kunio fakes his amnesia an attempt to elude his victims memories and engages in circular questionbegging. Also note the attention to details in other situations. Within the final 20 minutes we see Koji Yakusho in a quaint diner but only upon further inspection do we realize that in one case his plate is filled with leftover food while in the other case it's licked clean an important revelation of his essential change in character for the finale. And how about that final shot? This is just awesome cinema people. Magnificent.In retrospect Cure was the true beginning of the Japanese horror phenomenon that has followed it's release. While lacking in industry influence that has helped to establish Japanese horror in general that nod goes to Nakata's Ringu of 1998 it provides a ground zero date for the turning of the tide so to speak. For all intents and purposes Japanese horror has kicked everyone else's backside from 1997 onward. That said I am truly unhappy that Kiyoshi chose to leave the genre for more dramatic fare because we're already inundated with enough arthouse dramas to keep us busy. How many expertly crafted arthouse horror films are there floating around today? Whatever the number it's not nearly enough.It's really too bad that good taste in film is practically extinct because Cure should be one of those movies that everyone under the sun raves about until they're blue in the face. Kiyoshi isn't blessed with the lunatic fan base that follows guys like Akira Kurosawa or Andrei Tarkovsky. Maybe I count as the first big fan of Kiyoshi. It's a shame that he has established himself as an upper echelon filmmaker but somehow hasn't won over the majority of paid critics and film snobs who so easily drive the emperor with no clothes tide to coerce and guilt people into riding the bandwagons of lesser filmmakers.In any case Cure is the pinnacle of exceptional filmmaking. It's also Kiyoshi Kurosawa's best film and that's saying something.".

Showcasing innovative suspense sequences plot twists and rich psychologicalphilosophical concepts this film will have viewers pondering well after it ends. Kiyoshi again manages to elude the pitfalls of popular cinema to contribute not only a chilling masterpiece but arguably one of the most awesome villains to ever grace the big screen.Of the thousands of films I've seen few have floored me to the point where I've wanted to grant them the honor of being the Best Movie Ever. The only other film that comes to mind is A Tale of Two Sisters 2003 which is easily the most impressive motion picture of all time. Since that distinction is taken that leaves Cure 1997 with the runnerup spot in terms of world cinema but the medal for Best Japanese Movie Ever is still for the taking. This film takes it. I've seen 1328 films from that country and I can tell you that even Yasujiro Ozu and Shinya Tsukamoto have failed to match the brilliance of Cure. This is quite possibly the most engaging slowpaced film in existence. The tempo moves slower than molasses in January but the introduction of the lead antagonist a mere 8 minutes into the film sets the seemingly endless array of intriguing moments into motion from the get go. Masato Hagiwara's character of Kunio Mamiya is spellbinding with his hypnotic technique that starts off with seemingly trivial dialogue but slowly progresses into an ingenious psychological trap. This provides for a number of memorable moments my favorite of which is the mesmerizing water enchantment of the hospital nurse. In addition the identity of this character is expertly crafted as a sort of ambiguous soulpersonality whose essence is only truly revealed during the very last frame. No other film has created an antagonist so uniformly dangerous sublime and interesting as Kunio Mamiya.Kiyoshi Kurosawa is easily one of the top five directors of all time. This guy made three perfect films that no one talks about  Cure 1997 Kairo 2001 and Charisma 1999. What's really interesting is that he follows a rather unique arthouse style that's almost never applied to the horrorthriller genres. Kiyoshi uses long shots deliberate pacing and ambiguity in moderation which is unlike most arthouse directors who have no sense of discretion. Despite the mindless ramblings of mainstream cinemaphiles Kiyoshi rarely if ever indulges in pompous selfcongratulatory filming techniques because his choice of lean running times under two hours in almost every instance helps him to avoid the bloated masturbatory pretentiousness that rears its ugly head in other arthouse style films. Think Andrei Tarkovsky with more interesting and refined philosophical content and you'll have an idea of just how special Kiyoshi Kurosawa is as a director.Whenever possible I like to point out the high content levels of Kiyoshi's films in an attempt to counter the nonsensical claims of some who feel that he practices a form of style over substance. Take the seemingly trivial dialogue that the Kunio Mimiya character engages in during his hypnotic acts of terrorism. The exchanges are an odd mix on a superficial level but one comes to realize their importance when the victims are subjected to police interrogation. Only then does the viewer understand why Kunio fakes his amnesia an attempt to elude his victims memories and engages in circular questionbegging. Also note the attention to details in other situations. Within the final 20 minutes we see Koji Yakusho in a quaint diner but only upon further inspection do we realize that in one case his plate is filled with leftover food while in the other case it's licked clean an important revelation of his essential change in character for the finale. And how about that final shot? This is just awesome cinema people. Magnificent.In retrospect Cure was the true beginning of the Japanese horror phenomenon that has followed it's release. While lacking in industry influence that has helped to establish Japanese horror in general that nod goes to Nakata's Ringu of 1998 it provides a ground zero date for the turning of the tide so to speak. For all intents and purposes Japanese horror has kicked everyone else's backside from 1997 onward. That said I am truly unhappy that Kiyoshi chose to leave the genre for more dramatic fare because we're already inundated with enough arthouse dramas to keep us busy. How many expertly crafted arthouse horror films are there floating around today? Whatever the number it's not nearly enough.It's really too bad that good taste in film is practically extinct because Cure should be one of those movies that everyone under the sun raves about until they're blue in the face. Kiyoshi isn't blessed with the lunatic fan base that follows guys like Akira Kurosawa or Andrei Tarkovsky. Maybe I count as the first big fan of Kiyoshi. It's a shame that he has established himself as an upper echelon filmmaker but somehow hasn't won over the majority of paid critics and film snobs who so easily drive the emperor with no clothes tide to coerce and guilt people into riding the bandwagons of lesser filmmakers.In any case Cure is the pinnacle of exceptional filmmaking. It's also Kiyoshi Kurosawa's best film and that's saying something.";

Maybe this still was an Asian thriller that is genuinely good andor earned its cult reputation in an honest way rather than because everyone praises it blindly? Well the answer is yes...and no. The basic premise of Cure is truly compelling and Kiyoshi Kurosawa's filming style is definitely impressive but eventually the exaggerated complexity ruins the whole lot. Just once I'd like to see a Japanese occultthriller that doesn't leave me scratching my head after the final denouement. Anyway let's just focus on the first hour and the atmosphere! Fatigue copper Takabe is tormented by a mysterious series of killings in Tokyo. The culprits are always caught immediately at the scene of the crime and even though they're seemly unrelated they're all highly unlikely assassins and mysteriously marked their victims' bodies with a large X. The one thing they all have in common turns out to be a brief encounter with Mr. Mamiya an odd drifter with amnesia and a dubious past involving the study of hypnosis. Cure features a high tension level during the first hour when the murders still are a giant riddle and you also definitely sympathize with the main characters. Detective Takabe is a good man with noble ideals the unfortunate murderers truly evoke feelings of compassion and Mr. Mamiya has a fascinating personality despite his malicious ? intentions. The acting performances are amazing and Kurosawa patiently gives his cast the opportunity to show their versatile talents. There's few explicit gore but several highly disturbing images of mutilated corpses and suicides that really aren't for the weakhearted. The music is excellent and Kurosawa's directing is solid up until the last sequences when he regretfully leaves too many questions unanswered and relies too much on the supernatural aspect.".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed this film laughed throughout in fact but as a whole I have to be critical. Including in comparison to other films similar to its nature and when it comes to films involving teens and sex there are many to choose from. It's been a done a million times so it's nice to see refreshing and moderately realistic scenario and character interaction like that of Superbad or Juno. The cast for one thing is damn amazing. There are many excellent actors like Steve Buscemi and Ray Liotta both did wonderfully. Zack Galifianakis and Justin Long were very well into their characters and I loved them on screen. A lot of the characters are pretty memorable an aspect I enjoyed. I enjoyed seeing the character interaction which is the key to filmmaking at the base of it all. But Michael Cera as the awkwardnobody is beyond overdone. Sorry but at this point I've seen too many times. Only when he's donning the Francois persona do I admire his performance and really embrace him as a character.Not to mention the whole plot at a glance makes his character seem rather pathetic really. He steals cars travels hundreds of miles sabotages the girl's education among many other ridiculous things all for one girl who half the time doesn't really seem to care about him that much. It's a love story I just can't connect with despite my attempts to. So check this one out for some crude laughs but not a masterpiece by any means.C".

Including in comparison to other films similar to its nature and when it comes to films involving teens and sex there are many to choose from. It's been a done a million times so it's nice to see refreshing and moderately realistic scenario and character interaction like that of Superbad or Juno. The cast for one thing is damn amazing. There are many excellent actors like Steve Buscemi and Ray Liotta both did wonderfully. Zack Galifianakis and Justin Long were very well into their characters and I loved them on screen.

Here he plays an effete high schooler named Nick Twisp who thinks he's found the girl of his dreams during a lakefront vacation. Only to get the girl he needs to man up and become more dangerous so he invents a subpersona named Francois a dashing lad full of derringdo. This black comedy has plenty of laughs amid a wacky absurdist atmosphere.Nick Twisp. Great name for a fictional character terrible name for a real person I would think. Nick is into Frank Sinatra his computer and classic prose he lives with his trailertrash mom Jean Smart and her ne'erdowell current boyfriend played with laidback zeal by Zach Galifianakis. Nick is as stammery as any other Michael Cera character and his approach to the fairer sex is unsurprisingly ineffective.Things look up when he meets neighbor Sheeni Saunders Portia Doubleday who is both enigmatic and ebullient as Sheeni who's gorgeous and fun to be with. It's not long before Nick decides Sheeni's the one for him. But it's quickly revealed that Sheeni already has a boyfriend a real manly man named Trent. How can anyone played by Michael Cera compete with a guy named Trent? Easy  by inventing an alter ego that gives voice to his rampaging id a rogueish cad named Francois because Sheeni loves French things. Francois allows Nick to do and say things that he'd never otherwise say.And that's when things really take off. The pleasure of this movie is twofold. First Cera's delivery and the script by Gustin Nash go together like Forrest Gump and Jenny. The jokes are often laughoutloud quality and it's at least partly due to Cera's sometimesmumbled frightenedrabbit replies. His funny lines are played straight and somehow it works. Second the absurd escalating situations in which Nick finds himself  as a result of his own actions it should be noted  are funny the same way Mr. Creosote's predicament was funny in Monty Python's The Meaning of Life. The stuff Nick does at the behest of Francois to win Sheemi's heart are hilarious yet unlikely  and yet they ring true nonetheless.It also helps that Cera is supported by some damn funny actors Galifianakis is a hoot in a somewhat dark role Steve Buscemi plays Nick's dad with vulgar intensity as if he were a domesticated version of Mr. Pink Justin Long of all people is Sheeni's stoner older brother M. Emmett Walsh who's perhaps a tad too old to be the father of a teen is Sheeni's dad Mary Kay Place is the mom Smart as Nick's mom and Adhir Kalyan as a fellow student who helps Nick in his quest for Sheeni. Oh and Fred Willard as a neighbor who likes to save illegal immigrants from the INS.I know the word quirky is overused for oddball comedies today particularly those starring Michael Cera who if he plays another Nick may as well dot his face with bloodied pieces of tissue paper but this one outquirks most of them. Even with all the madness zooming around this film at the heart of things is the love between a girl and a boy and the lengths either will go to protect that bond. This movie should appeal to those who like offbeat romances.".

Cera and Doubleday carry the film along nicely and provide some very humorous onscreen chemistry especially during the sequences involving very awkward circumstances  i.e. when Nick is asked to place a small amount of sun cream on Sheeni's back during a trip to the beach.

	schema:reviewBody "'Youth in Revolt' adapts the first three volumes of C.D. Payne's sixbook series about Nick Twist a smart and in his own opinion anyway morethanusually horny 14yearold in Oakland a large torpid city across from San Frandisco who reports in daily journal form on a series of adventures encountered on the way to losing his virginity despite the obstacles set up by his irresponsible divorced parents. Ironically though pointed at today's young teens 'Revolt's' R rating excludes them  though the books are far more sexually explicit. Whether somehow this will become a cult movie via Netflix is hard to say. It's pretty faithful to the books leaving out lots but adding or changing little. Unfortunately Arteta's flat direction and focus on the action aspects  an accident a fire a botched fake suicide invasion of the girls' dorm of a Frenchlanguage prep school in Santa Cruz  excises much of the selfsatisfied wit of the books and Nick's one flourish his intellectual and literary showing off. The film necessarily loses the flavor of a daytodayjournal though most of the characters tend to talk in the same ornate overlypolite style as Nick's entries.C.D. Payne is no Salinger. His books serve as pageturners for young readers but they're nothing special. There's a curious sense of being out of time. Is this the Nineties when the books were begun? or the youth of Payne himself who was born in 1949? Nick's girlfriend Sheeni Portia Doubleday's fascination with Belmondo chanteur Serge Gainsbourg and the existentialists  and the general innocence of the behavior  would suggest earlier days but in the movie people have cell phones and a prevalance of 'shrooms and blunts makes this postBreathless francophile Sheeni's favorite movie. The main point was to keep the incidents coming and Payne went on with The Further Journals and finally the adventures of Twist's younger brother.Young Canadian actor Michael Cera the star of Miguel Arteta's adaptation of this movie who's now twentyone was already a TV veteran before he was ten. Though he appeared in many episodes of the cable series Arrested Development and in retrospect we realize he played the young Chuck Barris in George Clooney's droll ramble 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' he reached a kind of nerdy adorable megastardom only a couple years ago with two big hits 'Juno' and 'Superbad' followed by the equally charming if less seen 'Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist.'What has Mike done with his stardom? Well he played opposite Jack Black in Harold Ramis' slapstick and generally panned prehistoric comedy 'Year One' and costarred with his now exgirlfriend Charlene Yi in the poorly received 'Paper Heart.'Cera has good timing and is adept at delivering lines which makes him well suited for comedy. His limitations in other areas appear in this new outing. He's both the hero and voiceover narrator Nick Twist and Nick's bolder and more dashing imaginary alter ego Francois who goads him on to bolder action. There is a certain nonchalance in the flat style. Under ideal circumstances it might seem elegant. If you could be nerdy and cool at the same time Michael Cera is it and girls do find him cute. He rarely appears anything but relaxed. But the highpitched voice is inexpressive. The range is from A to B and this is highlighted by how little success Cera has in making Francois seem any different from Nick despite a little mustache tight pants and a lot of cigarettes amusingly puffed on even while running fast through the woods while Nick lags clumsily behind. With this new performance Cera continues to seem enormously appealing but for conventional starring roles cripplingly limited. He's just too pale and bland and androgynous and the more he's cast as a horny guy the more farfetched that seems. Anything with him in it seems defanged.Maybe it doesn't matter. You either get it or you don't and there are plenty of young readers who insist these are the best books ever. This is as good a time as any for some lighthearted teenage adventures. The adaptation was cowritten by Gustin Nash the guy who did 'Charlie Bartlett' a soso movie about a young high school entrepreneur starring Anton Yelchin.'Youth in Revolt' casts some veritable cult actors who include M. Emmett Walsh as Sheeni's bornagainChristian dad and Mary Kay Place as her mom Steve Buscemi as Nick's dad Ray Liotta as a cop who gets involved with his floozy mom Jean Smart. But the presence of such memorable thespians only emphasizes how little developed their characters are. I liked relative newcomer Adhir Kalyan as Veejay Nick's erudite school friend and fellow wouldbe seducer of women he gives his lines some juice. Best of all is Justin Long who slides into the scene as Sheeni's sly older brother. He is the only unexpected character. Long can always do a lot with a small part and when he gets a bigger one like in Raimi's recent oldfashioned horror movie 'Drag Me to Hell' he can be equally appealing. And there are others such as comedy veteran Fred Willard as an excessively goodhearted neighbor.The director Miguel Arteta did annoying but memorable work with writer Mike White in 'Chuck and Buck' and the pair made something very droll in 'The Good Girl.' One wonders if Arteta was the ideal person to do this job. He seems just to be walking through it.The Eighties were the time of the movies that celebrated youth and its many voices ranging from S.E. Hinton and 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' to the dark Alpha Girl portraiture of 'Heathers' and John Hughes' classics. This lacks their warmth and bite.But I still like Cera and as has been said by a preview audience member His fans will be in heaven with this.".

Nick's girlfriend Sheeni Portia Doubleday's fascination with Belmondo chanteur Serge Gainsbourg and the existentialists  and the general innocence of the behavior  would suggest earlier days but in the movie people have cell phones and a prevalance of 'shrooms and blunts makes this postBreathless francophile Sheeni's favorite movie. The main point was to keep the incidents coming and Payne went on with The Further Journals and finally the adventures of Twist's younger brother.Young Canadian actor Michael Cera the star of Miguel Arteta's adaptation of this movie who's now twentyone was already a TV veteran before he was ten. Though he appeared in many episodes of the cable series Arrested Development and in retrospect we realize he played the young Chuck Barris in George Clooney's droll ramble 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' he reached a kind of nerdy adorable megastardom only a couple years ago with two big hits 'Juno' and 'Superbad' followed by the equally charming if less seen 'Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist.'What has Mike done with his stardom? Well he played opposite Jack Black in Harold Ramis' slapstick and generally panned prehistoric comedy 'Year One' and costarred with his now exgirlfriend Charlene Yi in the poorly received 'Paper Heart.'Cera has good timing and is adept at delivering lines which makes him well suited for comedy. His limitations in other areas appear in this new outing. He's both the hero and voiceover narrator Nick Twist and Nick's bolder and more dashing imaginary alter ego Francois who goads him on to bolder action. There is a certain nonchalance in the flat style. Under ideal circumstances it might seem elegant. If you could be nerdy and cool at the same time Michael Cera is it and girls do find him cute. He rarely appears anything but relaxed. But the highpitched voice is inexpressive. The range is from A to B and this is highlighted by how little success Cera has in making Francois seem any different from Nick despite a little mustache tight pants and a lot of cigarettes amusingly puffed on even while running fast through the woods while Nick lags clumsily behind. With this new performance Cera continues to seem enormously appealing but for conventional starring roles cripplingly limited. He's just too pale and bland and androgynous and the more he's cast as a horny guy the more farfetched that seems. Anything with him in it seems defanged.Maybe it doesn't matter. You either get it or you don't and there are plenty of young readers who insist these are the best books ever. This is as good a time as any for some lighthearted teenage adventures. The adaptation was cowritten by Gustin Nash the guy who did 'Charlie Bartlett' a soso movie about a young high school entrepreneur starring Anton Yelchin.'Youth in Revolt' casts some veritable cult actors who include M. Emmett Walsh as Sheeni's bornagainChristian dad and Mary Kay Place as her mom Steve Buscemi as Nick's dad Ray Liotta as a cop who gets involved with his floozy mom Jean Smart. But the presence of such memorable thespians only emphasizes how little developed their characters are. I liked relative newcomer Adhir Kalyan as Veejay Nick's erudite school friend and fellow wouldbe seducer of women he gives his lines some juice. Best of all is Justin Long who slides into the scene as Sheeni's sly older brother. He is the only unexpected character. Long can always do a lot with a small part and when he gets a bigger one like in Raimi's recent oldfashioned horror movie 'Drag Me to Hell' he can be equally appealing. And there are others such as comedy veteran Fred Willard as an excessively goodhearted neighbor.The director Miguel Arteta did annoying but memorable work with writer Mike White in 'Chuck and Buck' and the pair made something very droll in 'The Good Girl.' One wonders if Arteta was the ideal person to do this job. He seems just to be walking through it.The Eighties were the time of the movies that celebrated youth and its many voices ranging from S.E. Hinton and 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' to the dark Alpha Girl portraiture of 'Heathers' and John Hughes' classics. This lacks their warmth and bite.But I still like Cera and as has been said by a preview audience member His fans will be in heaven with this.";

Nick Twisp Cera is masturbating and almost everyone in the theater knows it. Now that's testament to how far the Rrated comedy sexual revolution has come over the last decade so it's not surprising to see a film so unabashed about teenage sex let alone one whose entire plot is driven by a teenager's zealous appetite to shed his virginity.The always softspoken and awkwardly verbose Cera plays yet another character that fits his mold in Twisp a teenager with divorced parents who loves Fellini films and vintage vinyl and really really wants to get laid. It's a semiromantic aspiration as well but the depths to which he'll let his hormones take him is at times even implausibly absurd. On vacation with his mother Jean Smart and her lover Jerry Zach Galifianakis of The Hangover Nick meets a perfect match in the daughter of two devout Christian trailer park folks named Sheeni Saunders and the two have an awkward but adorable summer fling. Newcomer Portia Doubleday makes an impression in this early portion of the film as Sheeni teasing Nick and viewers with her poise and charm. When Nick has to go he realizes their relationship and his ascent to manhood is at risk. He devises a scheme to get his father to move to Sheeni's town and his mother to get mad enough to send him to live there. The only problem is that for it to work sweet and innocent Nicky will have to be bad.Nick invents an alternate persona for himself one based on Sheeni's ideal man. He's a blue eyed mustached chainsmoking Frenchman named Francois Dillinger and he's Nick without hesitation or reservation. Cera does wisely in agreeing to be in this film because of this alter ego aspect. Having to be Francois pushes Cera out of that same old wimpy character box and has him being frank  and really dirty  for once. If Cera doesn't want to flame out in the near future he'll need more parts like this.From here on out Youth in Revolt sort of tumbles into a teenage daydream of all the insane things any good normal kid would do for love and sex  if it were all fiction. The creation of Francois doesn't exactly justify the ridiculous decisions Nick makes like burning down half of Berkeley California for example. It's fun but not all that memorable. I've never read the C.D. Payne novel but you can tell it was much more extensive and that Gustin Nash had a hard time with the adaptation. All the events feel compressed especially in the middle and last acts. Nothing builds gradually it just gets stuck in. Some characters such as Sheeni's drugendorsing older brother Justin Long who's snuck in toward the end feel important to the story in an intangible way but don't leave any particular impression. Nash's adaptation despite having the comedic dialog down lacks a clear interpretation of Payne's story by which to tailor itself. In other words deciding on one of the book's messages to craft the adaptation around might've helped eliminate certain parts of the story and alleviate the cramming. Director Miguel Arteta picks up on some subtler ideas such as how the many side characters act as insight on or inspire rebellious behavior but they mostly get lost in the love story and Nick's sexual comingofage.Youth In Revolt is an explicit teenage RatedR comedy but not a raunchy one which ultimately makes it more respectable than more than half the genre offthebat. Much respect to The Weinstein Co. and Dimension Films for not trying to taper back for a PG13 considering R closes the film off to half its intended audience. At the same time it's not as unique or genrechanging as Areta's indie stylings try and make it out to be. Once again audiences have grown accustomed to an assortment of male genital references and open discussion about sex. But there are some good performances from young actors and clever dialog in Youth in Revolt and it deserves a viewing.Steven Chttpmoviemusereviews.com".

His role in Youth in Revolt belies both a selfawareness and a willingness to take risks to poke and twist his safe Paulie from Juno image. Which is why he's still funny despite the occasional disaster Year One Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist. It's suggestive of longevity and legitimate wit and as somebody who wholeheartedly loves funny people in funny films it's exciting. My score 810".

	schema:headline " Cera finally breaks the George Michael mold";
	schema:reviewBody "Oh Arrested Development how I loved thee. And yes I was ecstatic when Michael Cera became a breakout star from the show after his awkwardnaive George Michael role. Unfortunately this had started to wear thin after he moreorless reprised this role over and over again with varying degrees of success. So along comes Youth in Revolt which on the outset looks like Michael Cera playing George Michael again. Lo and behold not only is Youth in Revolt hilarious its also by far Cera's most diverse role yet.Youth in Revolt is about Nick Twisp. His mother has a boorish boyfriend Jerry whom Nick hates and his father chases bimbos despite his lack of a job. When Jerry is on the run from some Russian sailors the family goes up to a trailer park to lay low where Nick meets Sheeni Saunders who may well be the entire alternativehipster scene wrapped up. She likes old music French cinema and strange robot poetry. Eventually the two start making out and such but just as love blossoms its back home for Nick.Of course Nick won't let his true love get away that easy and hatches a diabolical scheme to be back with her. To do so he needs to break his niceguy frame doing so by inventing the mental persona Francois Dillinger. Francois is easily the best part of the film also played by Cera but manifesting himself physically with Nick. Its some kind of Fight Clubish thing going on but the way its presented definitely feels fresh.This extra character is what puts Cera over the top. While Nick may be his standard character for the most part Francois is a side of Cera not seen yet very confident and moreover badass. Although part of me doubts Cera was able to grow that moustache himself. The Francois scenes are definitely the best of the film and worth the price of admission alone.What would a comedy like this be without wacky supporting characters? This is where the movie is more hitandmiss. Portia Doubleday is very serviceable as the idol of Nick's affection and any guy who says he didn't majorly crush on a girl like that is clearly lying. Sure her character is perhaps written as slightly to hipster to appease the fanbase but the relation is by all means believable.Jean Smart stands out among the supporters as Nick's unsympathetic mother as does Fred Willard as a very sympathetic teacher. Steve Buscemi and Zach Galifinakis get unfortunately little to do as Nick's father and his mother's boyfriend respectively. Ray Liotta is excellently used as an antagonistic cop. However Justin Long comes across perhaps just a little too creepy as Sheeni's stoner brother and her sweaterwearing boyfriend is simply far too much of a douche to be anything but a clich.But whats important is that the movie is outright hilarious. Sure there's better comingofage stories out there but this one takes the cake in terms of simply making me laugh. A lot was in the trailer but there's still more here and Youth in Revolt is a mustsee for fans of the genre.".

	onyx:emotionText "Oh Arrested Development how I loved thee. And yes I was ecstatic when Michael Cera became a breakout star from the show after his awkwardnaive George Michael role. Unfortunately this had started to wear thin after he moreorless reprised this role over and over again with varying degrees of success. So along comes Youth in Revolt which on the outset looks like Michael Cera playing George Michael again. Lo and behold not only is Youth in Revolt hilarious its also by far Cera's most diverse role yet.Youth in Revolt is about Nick Twisp. His mother has a boorish boyfriend Jerry whom Nick hates and his father chases bimbos despite his lack of a job. When Jerry is on the run from some Russian sailors the family goes up to a trailer park to lay low where Nick meets Sheeni Saunders who may well be the entire alternativehipster scene wrapped up. She likes old music French cinema and strange robot poetry. Eventually the two start making out and such but just as love blossoms its back home for Nick.Of course Nick won't let his true love get away that easy and hatches a diabolical scheme to be back with her. To do so he needs to break his niceguy frame doing so by inventing the mental persona Francois Dillinger. Francois is easily the best part of the film also played by Cera but manifesting himself physically with Nick. Its some kind of Fight Clubish thing going on but the way its presented definitely feels fresh.This extra character is what puts Cera over the top. While Nick may be his standard character for the most part Francois is a side of Cera not seen yet very confident and moreover badass.

In fact I probably would have liked it a hell of a lot more if I hadn't seen the trailer first which pretty much ruined all of the plot twists and jokes for me. If you like that sort of Juno comedy with a splash of Fight Club you will probably love this.

	schema:reviewBody "Boy meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy creates alternate persona and burns down half his town to get the girl back. Boy makes a whole lot of bad decisions and so do the filmmakers.There's a lot to like about this movie and some real headscratching moments as well. I really enjoyed Cera and newcomer Portia Doubleday she's absolutely stunningly beautiful and has a great future ahead of her. Her performance pretty much makes this movie. Their relationship is the driving force of this movie and although it never quite becomes believable they do have some nice chemistry. I like Cera and his doublerole really lets him break out of his typecast innocence. There is some great comedy here but it comes at a price. The problems I have with this movie weren't immediately apparent but after the movie was over they became very obvious.For one thing there's way too many characters played by indie actors all over the place in this movie. Almost none of them get any respectable screen time or any real character development. Jean Smart plays the stereotypically promiscuous mother who has almost no redeeming qualities whatsoever Zach Galifianakis has about 5 minutes of screen time and the whole plot of his car being stuck in the living room and the sailors is never resolved. Steve Buscemi has some enjoyably intense backandforth fights with Cera but again no real depth of any kind.Even Cera's character is hard to get behind at times. Halfway through the movie he meets a girl named Bernice Lynch who seems nice but emotionally unstable. So what does he do? He manipulates her by telling her he has feelings for her so she'll drug Sheeni and get her expelled. Then the movie completely forgets about her. Wouldn't she be heartbroken and ready to do something horrible to get back at Nick or do something horrible to herself? Then there's this guy called Vijay who randomly shows up and follows Nick to Sheeni's school. They have some hijinks and then the movie completely forgets about him as well. Then there's Nick's best friend Lefty who has about two scenes. There's some chuckle worthy magic mushroom comedy involving Justin Long Ari Graynor and Fred Willard. Then in almost the very next scene there's more magic mushroom hijinks with M. Emmet Walsh of all people. This is all pretty much all these actors are used for. Ray Liotta plays a cop who covers for Nick about the fire while he dates his mom then when she dumps him he tells the whole police force that Nick set the fire. First of all wouldn't the police force figure out that he'd been covering for him? I mean he'd been dating the kid's mom. They also never really showed why she dumped him. I could go on and on but suffice it to say that all these pointless characters start to give the movie a strange coldness after a while like everything is happening at a distance. There are laughs to be had but it's just too hard to care about anything that happens.A lot of stuff here is just really silly. Cross dressing? Really The whole caroffthecliff thing from the end really didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. If he was trying to fake his death why did he take off his clothes and throw them in the car? Did I mention Cera is in his underwear for about half this movie? Even the character of Francois is pretty much pointless and unbelievable. Nick creates him so that Sheeni will like his 'bad side' even though she seemed to like him fine just the way he was. Somehow Nick loses control of Francois at several points and lets him control his actions which really doesn't make sense. There's also never really any conflict between the two personas.In short I enjoyed this movie despite it's silliness but what I had a problem with was things that were lacking like depth of character and nonsensical plot points. I've never read the books but the characters feel flat like they were taken right off the page and not expanded on at all. In the end it becomes apparent that there was a whole lot more they could have done with this material. I don't know if I'd see it again but it is a fairly enjoyable comedy. Just remember to leave your brain at the door.".

I'm perfectly fine admitting that I can't relate to the pretentiousness of the romance presented.There are some laughs to be had some good oneliners delivered and some capable work from the supporting actors but it's just not enough. This one just sort of lingers seemingly lasting for much longer than the 90 minute running time. Characters and subplots sort of appear only to sputter out which is a common flaw in movies drawn from books where the screenwriter feels compelled to touch on too many things without being able to properly develop them. In the end everybody seems like stock characters from the Quirky Movie Playbook as the plot meanders to it's neverindoubt conclusion. Youth in Revolt ultimately comes up short while it hits all the quirky hipster landmarks it just doesn't do it with nearly enough humor or focus.".

	schema:reviewBody "'A' Gai WaakProject A1983 is known for the physical comedy performed by its star Jackie Chan.  No one does physical comedy with the same type of bravery like Jackie Chan does here.  Physical comedy is the hardest kind of comedy.  This is because a person has to be in excellent shape to do the kinds of stunts required in physical comedy.Project A1983 is my favorite film of the Jackie ChanSammo HungYuen Biao collaborations.  Film proves why they are the Marx Brothers of Kung Fu Comedy.  These three actors are at home when working with each other.  The fight scene between the head pirate and ChanHungBiao is done at a frantic pace.The stunts in Project A1983 are dangerous and daring.  They are also filled with energy and style.  The stunt on the clock tower is both amazing and breath taking.  When it comes to stunt work Jackie Chan is the best at taking chances in giving action scenes an ounce of authenticity.  The actors make the stunts look easier than they actually are.Jackie Chan does a brilliant job in the dual role of actor and director.  As an actor he gives a simple performance that is transcended by his ability to perform incredible stunts.  As the director he films the action scenes with high speed energy.  The best film for Jackie Chan as actor and director.The scene with Chan hanging from the clock tower is a fabulous homage to the famous sequence from the silent comedy Safety Last.  Scene shows the actor's love for silent pictures and the Harold Lloyd film.  This scene is a throwback to the glory days of silent comedy.  Not only does it gives respect to Safety Last1928 but also stands on its own as something memorable.The action scenes in the movie make any similar scenes from the average Hollywood action pic look puny.  A pure action film that shouldn't be mistaken for intellectual viewing.  The fight scenes are done with imagination and passion.  Action scenes from Project A1983 are just as impressive as the action set pieces in Police Story1985.Project A1983 is an entertaining tribute to the great silent pictures of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd.  Jackie Chan plays a character in the Keaton and Lloyd mold.  Its this aspect of Jackie Chan's arsenal that makes him a superstar.  Project A1983 is a great example of a film with the techniques of a silent comedy.In comparing the USA version of the film to the Hong Kong version I came to the conclusion that the version released here is a travesty.  First the US version is missing some key scenes that made the film funny.  Second the film was badly dubbed and poorly edited for its US release.  If I ever got this film on DVD its most likely I will get the Hong Kong version.Its a pleasure to see Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung fight side by side in Project A.  Their films are usually terrific whenever they appear together. The fight scene in the tea house showcases their similar but slightly different brand of fighting technique.  Its a shame that these two haven't done anything with each other lately.One of the top films directed by Jackie Chan besides Police Story1985 Armour of God 21991 and Project A part 21987.  HoShan Kwan provides the comic relief as the hard headed Captain Chi.  Yuen Biao is good in a role that's over shadowed by Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung.  A film for fans of action movies and people who want to discover the films of Chan Hung and Biao.".

The humour translates well and three sequences stand out as some of the best action scenes ever put to film the three being Jackie's homage to 'Safety Last' by falling from the clock tower the bonkers bike chase through increasingly narrow city streets and the final showdown defeat of San Pao by Jackie Yuen Biao and Samo with a little help from Mars and some wayward grenades.

	schema:reviewBody "Okay let's judge this film overall and not just by the fighting which is obviously the best thing about this film.The sets are very good and you can tell that this was a bigbudget film for the time. You get the feel of being in colonial turnofthecentury Hong Kong. The costumes add to this feel too not to mention the fact that a lot of the buildings used actually ARE Hong Kong landmarks from all those years ago. On top of this there's the fact that the film ages less because it is a period piece. Police Story might as well be called Eighties Story. Acting  well although I watched this movie in Chinese with English subtitles and with English dubbing I cannot find anything wrong with the acting. It's all done pretty well with the obvious quirks that make Hong Kong movie acting what it is strained facial expressions a lot of pointing and a lot of laughing that is laughable itself.Sound  not very good but when you consider that all the sound had to be redubbed it makes sense and allow for more leniency.The plot is not waferthin as has happened in earlier Chan movies but this isn't Pi. To be honest it's about as complicated as a Jackie Chan movie is ever going to get and if the only reason for watching a kungfu movie is plot you're an idiot anyway.Right then  action  and boy oh boy this film is full of incredible action. I have over sixty Jackie Chan films in my collection so I know what I'm talking about when analysing his films. Project A ranks among the best of his films when looking at the action. There are so many fights staged and so many payoffs. You get to see Jackie Sammo Hung and Yuen Biu fighting each other and the bad guys in such a fast furious and creative way that this is an action movie you'll never forget. Dick Wei is muscular and mean as the head of the pirates and is a formidable foe who forces the three brothers to come together to dispose of him.As usual the stunts would not have been allowed in Britain or America but hey this is Kong Kong so let's blow these guys up and watch them flip and fly across the set for our own satisfaction.Overall this is a top notch film with wonderfully edited fights excellent creativity and superb Chanesque humour along the way. It's a showpiece of the efforts of the three special ones of Hong Kong cinema in the eighties and any fan of Hong Kong cinema should only miss this at their peril.".

I doubt any American action star could do the fights and stunts in this movie  that is what makes this movie so special as well as a captivating rousing story. Jackie plays Dragon Ma a Coast Guard officer at the turn of the century. There are some phenomenal unique fight scenes in a bar and a hotel that are absolutely classic. Then you have a classic bicycle chase scene and finally one of Jackie's greatest stunts ever where he falls two stories crashes through a canopy and onto the ground. Jackie took a week to muster enough courage to do the stunt because it was so dangerous.The scene had to be shot twice because the first time he fell on his neck which you can see in the outtakes. Incredible. The story continues as Jackie hunts down pirates with his friends Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao and anytime you get the three of these action stars together you can be sure you are going to get plenty of action humor and fun. This movie is one of the greatest adventure movies ever made and is one that a lot of people do not know about. Unfortunately the American release really botched up some things from the Hong Kong version. Notice the horribly mismatched background music during the fight scenes and some cuts from the original that do nothing to help. You could use this movie as an example in a film class of how music can make  or ruin  a scene. Still a mustsee movie for any Jackie Chan fan.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are certain cinema ideas that were just meant to work no matter what the circumstances might be. Jackie Chan fighting pirates easily ranks up there as one of the slickest ideas ever composed. Thank goodness it delivered on the premise. Jackie Chan's Project A is a mesh of action comedy and homage to classic slapstick. Within the 100 minutes you'll see some spectacular fights even more spectacular physical stunts hilarious physical humor and of course Chan at his best. Unlike the insurancerun Hollywood the Jackie Chan Stunt Team wasn't afraid of taking risks or getting hurt at the sake of entertainment and this beatemup' underrated classic overpowers any modernday action film that Hollywood could muster. Project A is silly but viciously raw and thanks to clever direction and choreography its one of the better martial arts movies out there.Project A is about Yes guys there is a plot a group of sailors Navylike men trying to stop Chinese pirates from wreaking havoc in the coastline. However because of corruption amongst the government and the police force they are unable to receive enough funding to continue the fight and are forced to thwart the terrorism when it strikes on their home turf. Jackie Chan and co. must try to stop the rivalry against the Chinese police force and unravel the web of corruption that's entangling everyone involved and heightening the danger present. Jackie Chan not only starred and directed the flick but he wrote the script too and it's quite clever at times. Other times it can be quite confusingusually in those instances you are anticipating the next fight which is never too far away.In a martial arts movie we watch for all about the fighting. While Enter the Dragon may have started the obsession and love towards the genre Jackie Chan and his reliable crew perfected the art in the 80s. Project A is easily one of the best choreographed films of alltime in terms of the action some of the fights are just flatout unbelievable. Jackie Chan fights with a bicycle for crying out loud. While the punching and kicking combinations aren't as gruesome as his other films Drunken Master Meals on Wheels Dragons Forever the elaborate movements and avoidance of damage example Chan avoids a man swinging a sword at him for two minutes straight more than make up for it. Not a single action fan should be disappointed. Plus just like Chan's best comedic work there has to be at least one humorous fight thrown in and Project A delivers in this category as well.Chan's direction does two things allows for the action to remain intense and showcases just how elaborate everyone's movements are. There is no trickery you shall see elongated shots of handtohand combat that's too precise to be filmed in the United States. While Chan doesn't have the ability to capture emotions like Spielberg or Scorsese he knows how to flesh out the energy and craft of a good fight. And that's why we are watching this correct? Nobody's acting here is awardworthy but it gets the job done and maintains its sillybutserious tone. Sammo Hung gives the best performance of the film as the thief that thwarts Chan's quest for justice and at the same time helps him.Bottom Line While perfection or masterpiece isn't achieved here Project A delivers everything you could possibly want in a martial arts film amazing stunts great fights decent story good acting worthy adversary explosive finale and a tang of humor. Welldirected and written by the master himself Project A remains one of Jackie Chan's best work and another example of how his foreign films are far superior to that of his work in America. It's not all his fault though Hollywood doesn't lust as much over precision and perfection as the Chinese do when staging a fight. Legend of Drunken Master's final fight took months to film one stunt here required a week of merely convincing Chan before actually filming itwe don't believe in investing that much time towards a couple of minutes. This is called effort and Chan's career has more effort than twentyfive actors and actresses put together. Project A Jackie Chan fighting pirates it's too good to be true. Thank goodness it's true.P.S. Is it so hard to correctly dub a movie? Buena Vista pretty much butchered this film.".

Jackie Chan is top notch as one army man fighting a group of heinous pirates and as always he makes his own stunts like is well showed . Awesome  incredible stunts and brief comic touches  as usual  the picture is better constructed than Chan's predecessors films . The lightingpaced storyline slows down at times  but frantic action sequences make up for it . Spotlights movie include a spectacular brawl at a bar  Jackie jumping down a building  impressive and interminable fights with Chan dangling and downing  a breathtaking final struggle and other extraordinary action sequences in overwhelming style . This is an acceptable action movie distinguished by nicely cinematography of the spectacular sequences  and contains agreeable sense of humor such as previous entries . Chan pays overt homage to two of his greatest influences as Charles Chaplin and Harold Lloyd . Jackie Chan usually forms couple to notorious actress as Maggie Chung and Michelle Yeoh . However in this outing Jackie teams up again to prestigious Chinese actor Sammo Hung  a fine action star in their own right and also had an American career as successful Martial Law TV series . Both of them starred together several films as Heart of Dragon 1985 which was directed by Sammo . Third protagonist  Yuen Biao also played some movies with the famous pair as Dragon Forever. This is a passable action movie distinguished by ferocious sequences  and packs silly sense of humor as well as Jackie's subsequent entries . Furthermore  moving and thrilling original musical score fitting to action . It's followed by a sequel  part 2 1987 in which Dragon is back with a new set of action and played by Maggie Chung  Carina Lau and again produced and directed by Jackie Chan.

Chan is a hardworking actor and director throughout his long and varied career . He went on playing Cannoball  The protector and Rumble in the Bronx until getting all American success with Shangai Knights  The tuxedo  Around the world in 80 days and Rush hour trilogy  and the recent Karate kid.

Overall the movie flowed very nicely.  There was very witty dialog a great storyline who can't excited when pirates are involved! and unparalleled action sequences with not only the movie in general but add to that the scene with Martial Law's Mr. Hung and the bicycle chase scene about half way through the most just adds even more to the fact why I think this movie is definitely up there in the top 5 Jackie movies of all times.Overall rating 6 out of 5 you won't be disappointed with Jackie Starring and Directing in this one as he most often does and does well!".

	schema:reviewBody "While Jackie Chan's previous film Dragon Lord 1982 did not have as much local success as Chan wanted his next film Project A would be an artistic and commercial success. It is the maturation point for Jackie as a filmmaker and would start a string of successes that would help establish Chan as an action auteur. He directed starred cowritten and even hired two brothers in Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao they had grown up together in the same opera troupe and performed as the Seven Little Fortunes amongst others Sammo was already an established success at this time and certainly is a prodigious presence in this movie in the first film where they all had decent acting time  kudos to those who can name the first film they acted in together.Dragon Ma Jackie Chan is a sergeant in the Hong Kong Water Police where pirates are problematic on the coastline they would remain an issue even past WWII his department is poorly financed there are interdepartmental squabbles with the landlubber police and their haughty commander Captain Chi Kwan HoiSan and his nephew Inspector Hong Tin Chi Yuen Biao Knockabout and they just had their remaining ships blown up real good nice model sets in that scene. Project A is the codename to combat these buccaneers. However it looks bad for the Water Police when they get merged back into the main police force and there is a plot to steal rifles and be sold to the pirates headed by Lo San Po Dick Wei The Five Venoms who ultimately does not seem that bad to me. Later the pirates make the ultimate mistake in kidnapping a ship with a Rear Admiral aboard and take them hostage. This leads to Dragon Ma eventually teaming up with wayward thief and gambler Fei Sammo Hung and Inspector Hong to combat these irascible swashbucklers.There are several stunts in this movie that are truly amazing. Much has been stated about the clock tower fall inspired by Harold Lloyd in Safety Last and with good reason. It is a superlative stunt and still one of my favorites as well as Jackie too. Jackie hangs by a clock hand about 50 feet above the surface and lets go to crash through two cloth awnings until the rude smacking into the ground proving that gravity is indeed a harsh mistress. It would be the first superstunt Jackie would do in a film and which would soon be a reoccurring theme in his movies to risk his life to please the audience. All three takes of this lifethreatening drop are available to see on the film two are shown in the movie and one is shown in the outtakes at the end. Every take looks quite painful. Leading up to this situation is another quick stunt that was quite dangerous. He climbs a flag pole to the top while handcuffed so he can unwrap himself from that mast and escape his predicament. But you look at how high he is from the concrete floor below and realize that if he messes this stunt it could be much worse than the fall through the awnings.The comedic fighting in this film is also quite adroit and amazing in its action direction led by Jackie and Sammo. The first scene between the water and land police is a crazy mle of kung fu throwing objects and spaghetti. It is quite reminiscent of an updated western bar fight. The Keatonesque bicycle chase and action sequence is a brilliant combination of the two. While the scene certainly had been influenced by such films as Sherlock Jr. especially in the bicycle camera view towards the end Jackie gives it such a unique touch that makes it such an aesthetically pleasing and entertaining spectacle. Add in several other fight scenes and a fantastic finale with the three brothers and the antagonist and you have quite a satisfying film.Project A was a hit in Hong Kong 19M HK dollars box office and found critical support there as well. Jackie Chan would be nominated for Best Actor for Hong Kong Film Award however this film would win Best Action Design Jackie Chan's Stuntman Association was even nominated against itself that year in Wheels on Meals an award it truly deserved. It is also an important film for Hong Kong cinema. It helped push action movies into modern day locales and away from the Qing era and before dominated themes though this film is considered a period film since it takes place in early 20th century.While the film may not know what to do with female characters like Wong ManYing and the plot is not the most sublimely cohesive  there is a grenade scene early in the film which seemed a bit excessive not that funny and did not seem to fit  this film is consistently fun and beautifully directed cinematographer Cheung YiuJo does not get enough credit for the work he has done with Jackie Chan. Action aficionados certainly talk about this film though it is somewhat overshadowed by Police Story one of my favorite films when they discuss the oeuvre of Jackie Chan. With the humor the dangerous stunts with complete disregard for human life and the awesome action scenes it is easy to recommend this. I certainly love this film and find multiple viewings rewarding. There does remain one question that I will resolve soon which film is better this or the sequel?".

	schema:reviewBody "If you were very disappointed by Jackie Chan's recent works don't make your conclusions too fast that he's just so so. Instead watch Project A and its sequel. The movie is not Oscar Stuff it's not even hot at that year's HK movie awards. However its value purely as a action movie is still recognized until today. To say it made history is not exaggerating at all. Audiences were often awed by the fact that Jackie jumped down from places like clock towers and roofs with no proper protection and no camera tricks at all. This is something Hollywood wouldn't do therefore it made history. Artistically Project A is a perfect blending of comedy and Kungfu. The story centers around two cops and a thief. One cop is a street cop and the other one is a coast cop and they hated each other. The thief was really good at what he does but had an unusual friendship with the coast cop. The coming of a pirates' fleet changed all the situation and pushed the 3 into a dedicated fighting. The plot is not very far from a farce but it created so many chances for the actors to make fun for us. Many chasing sequences are tight thrilling and goofy at the same time but it never get you nervous. The pace the choreography and the fun made it a perfectly entertaining movie even after 3 decades. If the earth doesn't explode in 50 years this movie will still be one of the best choices of action fans that time. To say that Project A is Star Wars of the modern Kungfu movies is not exaggerating either. It totally started Jackie Chan's own dynasty at HK movie industry. The whole movie was written directed and leadingacted by Jackie Chan himself. It would give you some hints why he's so welcomed. These days we respect him mainly because his glorious old days.".

	schema:reviewBody "Now that this beautifully sculpted wildly atmospheric truetotheera in which it is set movie is on DVD I've watched and rewatched it many times. This is more of a review of the DVD than of the whole film and the spoilers are more DVD commentaryrelated than plotrelated so read on if you wish.This is by far one of the finest films paying homage to the motorcycle enthusiasts or outlaws as it may be settings and characters of the 1950's that I've ever seen and I own many so any rockabilly guys or gals out there reading this review  this movie is for you! It's moody sexy violent and slick  great eyecandy with an outstanding cast of characters.The DVD has one of the better commentaries featuring conversations with the film's cowritercodirectors Kathryn Bigelow  Monty Montgomery as well as the film's star Willem Dafoe. Dafoe credits the movie's directors for starting his career with this movie a fact which Monty Montgomery humbly shrugs off. They get into the movies they watched that directly influenced how The Loveless was shot trivia notes like how Robert Gordon who was paid to score the flick blew all of the budget on on single calypso tune that is featured for a few minutes of the film. It would also seem that Gordon who is most noted for being a rockabilly musician and an excellent one at that! was inadvertently cast while meeting with the film's directors. Gordon created some onset tension that flickered mainly between himself and Dafoe as Gordon felt that he was the only one on set who truly understood the whole bikergreaser world.It is interesting to note that the movie was Bigelow's thesis for film school as well as her directorial debut and it must've earned her some high marks as she's gone on to work with people like David Lynch! Montgomery too has worked extensively with Lynch producing Wild At Heart working on Twin Peaks and acting in Mulholland Dr. For those who expect this to be a biker exploitation flick like The Wild One and all of its followers thereafter you're in for a surprise. The directors intended for the audience to feel as if that is what they were in for while the initial scenes unfold but as the story moves forward we realize that it isn't so much a biker film but more of a kind of a wildwest movie. Monty Montgomery credits Edgar G. Ulmer's short noir film Detour as being the major influence as far as the style the framing and the shots of The Loveless go. He also credits Kenneth Anger's movie Scorpio Rising as the movie that inspired the whole homoeroticism of the biker world as presented in this Montgomery's earliest film.For those interested in some trivia here ya be  Originally titled U.S. 17 which used to be a U.S. superhighway up until the 1960's when the I 95 highway replaced it as the major thruway from Georgia to Florida and up to New York the entire film is shot on location along this now abandoned stretch of blacktop. Monty Montgomery the movie's codirector grew up in and around the Georgia area where the film was shot and at the time of filming the stretch of road was like a time capsule with abandoned motels diners and gas stations along the way which had not changed since the 40's and the 50's. This made the reality of the movie much easier to capture and cut down massively on the cost of what would have meant sound stage creations of all of these types of locations. I wonder if any of these places exist now as the movie was done at the beginning of the 80's? I can only hope...There is no disguising that this film focuses more on atmosphere than on plot and there is no pretense to suggest that the directors intended anything else. Montgomery even refers to it as eyecandy and why not? Sometimes my eyes crave the cavities offered up by such sweet treats as The Loveless! There are many a long lingering shot of beautiful vintage 'cycles being worked on close ups on tattoos one of the actors Larry Matarese who plays La Ville opted for an actual oldschool pinup gal tattoo on his forearm before filming began tensioncreating pauses while characters look on sipping coffee in a diner or lean on a 50's Coke machine clad in leather and denim and all of this works for the piece that this movie was meant to be.It is somewhat of homage to The Wild One but only in that it deals with motorcycle enthusiastrebels in the 50's  all other plot comparisons and similarities fall by the wayside.Though they wished for a score that was more like Sergio Leone's large sweeping and melodramatic western film's scores and they were held back by budgetary constraints I felt what they did have to work with offered the film the nostalgic atmosphere perfectly. The score as it stands on the DVD which unfortunately is not on CD record or tape darn it! largely done by John Lurie of The Lounge Lizards fame and also a regular in many Jim Jarmusch films along with a minimal amount of tracks supplied by Robert Gordon can be credited for being the cherry on top of this 50's diner served tasty milkshake of a flick!T.Paul www.tpaul.com".

	schema:headline " cool little biker movie that favors mood over story but what mood!";
	schema:reviewBody "They ride fast and live dirty and cool that could be a tagline for The Loveless. The characters in this biker gang who are actually relatively peaceful compared to the people in The Wild One they aren't that rebellious but just enough to make an impression and just want to chill in a small notquite town until they can go down to Daytona for a big race. But there isn't much to do in terms of hanging out. Sure they can work on their rides in a local garage and sure Willem Dafoe's Vance has a ladiesman charm that is uncanny or just you know 'bad boy' style as we see in an opening scene where he helps an older woman with a flat tire and sure there's a night of revelry in a bar. But these guys aren't looking too much for trouble relatively. It's more about how they just want to drink some good booze listen to their rock and roll and unfortunately get harassed by rednecks who think their Commies. I can't really say for Monty Montgomery as he directed this as his first feature and then went off into producing save maybe for the connection to Wild at Heart but as Kathryn Bigelow's first film as co director it shows so much promise for the rest of her career. And intriguingly it's not quite like her other movies. It's inspired by some of the Wild One some rock and roll but in its look and melodramatic shades such as with the girl Vance hooks up with it's akin to Douglas Sirk. It's visual sheen is very 1950's and it's got guys on bikes who are looking for a good time and all the actors are cast spot on. Fun to watch as well is one of the bikers played by Robert Gordon a Rockabilly legend. But it's Bigelow's vision that makes it unique and perhaps Montgomery's affinity for 50's lowdown road culture.It's hard to pinpoint what makes the movie interesting since frankly not a whole lot happens. There's the romantic fling Vance has with the girl a scenario shot with loving closeups to the girl and a fine look to the motel bed scenes and there's some doing with the subplot of the redneck dudes looking to beat some biker ass. But the tone is what counts here and what may actually turn off some viewers. There isn't a lot of 'plot' and in some ways more than any other Bigelow film resembles a European piece that concerns itself with how these guys move react listen to the music and there's a lot a close second to American Graffiti in terms of amount of 50's rock tunes this less recognizable but still as meaningful and get drunk in a bar with what looks like 100 bottles on a table. What it comes down to in The Loveless is you can either take the figurative ride with these guys just hanging out or not. I did and it was enjoyable once it got me in its grasp. It's never boring though you always are a little on edge that something could happen and when it does i.e. the confrontation between the girl's father and Vance that it reaches a dramatic peak or of course with the violent climax that could be an homage to Peckinpah. It's just a different kind of biker movie less concerned with action and more about what it was like to be these guys or be around them in a sleepy nothingtown in the mid 50's. If Antonioni made a biker movie and had to have a soundtrack of walltowall rockabilly it might be this.".

	onyx:emotionText "They ride fast and live dirty and cool that could be a tagline for The Loveless. The characters in this biker gang who are actually relatively peaceful compared to the people in The Wild One they aren't that rebellious but just enough to make an impression and just want to chill in a small notquite town until they can go down to Daytona for a big race. But there isn't much to do in terms of hanging out. Sure they can work on their rides in a local garage and sure Willem Dafoe's Vance has a ladiesman charm that is uncanny or just you know 'bad boy' style as we see in an opening scene where he helps an older woman with a flat tire and sure there's a night of revelry in a bar. But these guys aren't looking too much for trouble relatively. It's more about how they just want to drink some good booze listen to their rock and roll and unfortunately get harassed by rednecks who think their Commies. I can't really say for Monty Montgomery as he directed this as his first feature and then went off into producing save maybe for the connection to Wild at Heart but as Kathryn Bigelow's first film as co director it shows so much promise for the rest of her career. And intriguingly it's not quite like her other movies. It's inspired by some of the Wild One some rock and roll but in its look and melodramatic shades such as with the girl Vance hooks up with it's akin to Douglas Sirk. It's visual sheen is very 1950's and it's got guys on bikes who are looking for a good time and all the actors are cast spot on. Fun to watch as well is one of the bikers played by Robert Gordon a Rockabilly legend. But it's Bigelow's vision that makes it unique and perhaps Montgomery's affinity for 50's lowdown road culture.It's hard to pinpoint what makes the movie interesting since frankly not a whole lot happens. There's the romantic fling Vance has with the girl a scenario shot with loving closeups to the girl and a fine look to the motel bed scenes and there's some doing with the subplot of the redneck dudes looking to beat some biker ass. But the tone is what counts here and what may actually turn off some viewers. There isn't a lot of 'plot' and in some ways more than any other Bigelow film resembles a European piece that concerns itself with how these guys move react listen to the music and there's a lot a close second to American Graffiti in terms of amount of 50's rock tunes this less recognizable but still as meaningful and get drunk in a bar with what looks like 100 bottles on a table. What it comes down to in The Loveless is you can either take the figurative ride with these guys just hanging out or not. I did and it was enjoyable once it got me in its grasp. It's never boring though you always are a little on edge that something could happen and when it does i.e. the confrontation between the girl's father and Vance that it reaches a dramatic peak or of course with the violent climax that could be an homage to Peckinpah.

	schema:reviewBody "In the 1950s a group of leatherclad bikers led by Vance are on their way to Daytona Florida to compete in a race but they get sidetracked into a quiet Georgia town to fix up a broken down bike. The uptight locals see them as nothing but trouble and surely enough problems occur. The waitress of the dinner catches Vance's eyes and another being a brash young teen Elena.Wearing black leather never looked so cool! We're going nowhere fast Well this tagline accurately describes this sublime independent feature. Sure it's not for everyone's tastes but I loved this ultraslick inventively moody trip through the eyes of a couple of laidback bikers of the 50s. For some people it might be aimlessly dull because of the mellow tempo and it consciously ticks a long at a leisurely pace with vast empty spaces. I found it to be an evocative tale despite being quite broad that has a real hypnotic trance surrounding its arrestingly stylish framework that milks out the sullen atmosphere. There's such an authentic feel about it and so many inspired and iconic imagery seeping off the screen that you can't bear to take your eyes off it.The film was cowritten and codirected by Kathryn Bigelow and Monty Montgomery in their first major feature. The pairs' profoundly textured direction catches every little elegant detail great use of the soothing neonlighting and composition with the guidance of Doyle Smith's crisply spacious cinematography. Being shot on location really added to the film's natural presence and unattainable free spirit. Storywise there's nothing really conventional about it but just letting the poetically distinctive situations evolve into an impulsively harrowing conclusion. The dialogues are rather dry and very sparse with splashes of sly remarks. While it might not have a lot to say in its context. The stirring visual and music contributions do actually round it off nicely. A divinely swish rockabilly soundtrack by Robert Gordon and mostly John Lurie becomes a major part of the scene as it does shape the swanky feel.A huge curiosity would be that of William Dafoe's first major feature role and he rings true in a brilliant performance. His confidently hardened turn simply has you in awe of his on screen magnetism. There are memorable nobar performances by Robert Gordon Tina L'Hotsky Lawrence Matarese Danny Rosen and Phillip Kimbrough who snugly fill the shoes of the tightly rapport biker gang. Marin Kanter has attitude in her part as Elena. J. Don Ferguson plays Elena's father Tarver and brings to the table a character just waiting to crack. Finally Elizabeth Gans is delightful in her role as the waitress Augusta.This is more than just a basic biker exploitation movie and I sure loved it. A beautifully worthy obscure gem that's worth a look for those who enjoy a lot finesse mixed with a touch of enigma.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before director Kathryn Bigelow became widely recognizable with her later effort in 1987's NEAR DARK 1991's POINT BREAK 1995's STRANGE DAYS and of course right down to 2009's Oscarwinning war drama THE HURT LOCKER she made her first feature debut in a lowbudget independent drama called THE LOVELESS when she was still studying in NYC as a film student. THE LOVELESS is a stylized and eccentric genre movie that pays homage to 1950s biker movies notably Marlon Brando's THE WILD ONE with arthouse sensibility. This movie is also notable as Willem Dafoe's first lead role.Set in 1950s the story centers on Vance Dafoe a leatherclad biker who rides into a small Southern town where he supposes to meet up with his fellow motorcycle gang at a cafe somewhere at Highway 17. Their plan is to head over to Daytona Beach for the races but they forced to postpone for a while when one of their motorcycles breaks down. While waiting the broken motorcycle to get fixed in a nearby garage Vance and his motorcycle gang hang around at the cafe. Along the process Vance flirts a bit with a widowed waitress named Augusta Liz Gans. She also hooks up with Telena Marin Kanter the rebellious teenage daughter of a psychotic father Tarver J. Don Ferguson.THE LOVELESS is also codirected by Monty Montgomery who is best known for producing David Lynch's WILD AT HEART 1990. Both he and Bigelow favors a lot in fetishism mostly closeup on leather outfit motorcycle chrome that it's quite mesmerizing to watch their stylized eroticization of a '50s biker culture. Somewhere in between you can also see Bigelow's earlier attempt in lurid direction that will later becoming one of her trademarks in her subsequent movies. Despite its lowbudget standard the visual is adequate enough for this kind of genre while Robert Gordon's who also appeared as an actor here playing one of Vance's motorcycle gang member named Davis rock soundtrack is a standout. As for Willem Dafoe he made quite an impression playing a stoic lead character.But most of the movie is a disappointment. Despite clocking at a brief 82 minutes the movie can be excruciatingly tough to sit through. The pace is deliberately slow to a crawl especially in the longwinded first hour. Here the movie lingers in a circle as we watch the characters sit around and talk about nothing in particular. Other times we see them stare silently into space waiting for something to happen and all the mundane tasks that goes on and on. The purposefullystylized dialogues which meant to be cool are mostly borderline into selfparody. Meanwhile the sudden burst of violence that occurs in the final act fails to deliver any wouldbe shocking impact.Suffice to say THE LOVELESS isn't much of a recommended effort other than those who always curious to see how Bigelow and Dafoe get started during their early careers.www.caseymoviemania.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Willem Dafoe earned his first starring role in this somewhat obscure biker film that also marked the filmmaking debut for future A list director Kathryn Bigelow Point Break The Hurt Locker. Dafoe plays Vance one of a bunch of bikers that stop over in a small town on their way to some races in Daytona. Unsurprisingly they shake up the local populace despite the fact that as some movie depictions of bikers go they're kind of on the tame side.While there are some appreciable exploitable elements namely nudity The Loveless is indeed much more mood piece than action film. It does capture a certain slice of Americana at a certain time the 1950s when outsiders and rebels such as Vance and company were treated with suspicion. It's not completely without humor but is also not afraid to get pretty grim and tragic. Excellent location shooting and local flavor help to make this feel authentic. Bigelow and her cowriter  codirector Monty Montgomery who went on to work with David Lynch on a couple of projects 'Twin Peaks' Wild at Heart etc. get able performances out of their mostly noname regional cast. Dafoe shows definite screen presence and charisma in this early showcase while Tina L'Hotsky has plenty of appeal as the young sportster driving girl who catches Vances' eye. One of the costars is Robert Gordon who's pretty good himself he's been an icon in the rockabilly genre and naturally also composed much of the score.Highlighted by a literate philosophical script by Bigelow and Montgomery.Seven out of 10.".

The acting is also well done you can really believe these brooding characters. And the atmosphere is appropriate for a movie about hard core bikers.Unfortunately despite positive things like what I've listed the movie didn't work for me. In fact I think that most viewers will be dissatisfied as well. There is a big problem and that problem is that there is virtually no plot. The movie is just one scene after another where little to nothing usually nothing of consequence happening. I admit I came close to hitting the eject button on my DVD player several times because I was quite frankly bored. In the end I can only recommend the movie to hard core fans of anyone in front of or behind the camera.".

Even the sex scenes are boring.I saw this film at MOMA and Bigelow herself conducted a QandA after the show. She said at the time she made this film she was interested in the process by which audiences identify with characters on the big screen. Sad to say there is not a single character with whom this audience member could identify. In fact I felt positively invited to view the entire cast with condescension andor contempt.The drawback to starting one's career with a masterpiece like Citizen Kane is there's no place to go but downhill.

Unknown to many Gwen has been separated from her daughter for ten years because of her great popularity and finds that she cannot reveal to her fans that a glamor girl like herself is a mother of a 14yearold girl. Gloria Harkinson Deanna Durbin the daughter in question is being educated at a Swiss school for girls. Well liked by her classmates she is immensely disliked by one in particular Felice Helen Parrish who is not only jealous of her popularity around school but is very eager to learn more about Gloria's questionable family background especially when she refuses to believe that Gloria's father is a famous African explorer. To cover up her lies Gloria has her middleaged friend Pierre Christian Rub back her up by writing letters to her signing them from her Dad. Because her little white lies are getting her deeper and deeper in trouble Gloria realizing that she is being followed by her classmates as she is heading for the train station suddenly approaches a man named Richard Todd Herbert Marshall and his valet Tripps Arthur Treacher. Before Todd realizes what has happened the distinguished gentleman finds himself suddenly acting as Gloria's father and coming to her school where he impresses the girls by talking about his hunting adventures in Africa. More problems arise when Gloria learns that her mother is visiting in Paris and must manage to sneak away from the school without arousing any more attention.The storyline to Mad About Music may sound corny in print but in reality it is highly amusing and entertaining throughout its 98 minutes screen time and it's easy to see why Durbin became such a box office attraction having both voice and personality. The supporting cast consists of a younger William Frawley playing Dusty Turner Gwen Taylor's agent Marcia Mae Jones as Olga Gloria's best friend Elisabeth Risdon as the school official Jackie Moran and Charles Peck as military academy students interested in Gloria and Olga Franklin Pangborn seen briefly as the hotel manager plus a cameo appearance by Sidney Grauman of Grauman's Chinese Theater in the opening segment of the story. One scene finds Frawley's character in a sentimental moment as he tells Gloria that she mustn't see her mother as much as he knows in his heart that seeing her mother would mean a lot to her. The way this scene is handled is well done showing the warmer side of Frawley a fine character actor known for his grumpiness and his sarcastic comedic oneliners especially used to great advantage in the immortal long running TV series from the 1950s I Love Lucy starring Lucille Ball. It is also interesting to see the young and sassy Gail Patrick cast against type playing a mother.New songs by Harold Adamson and Jimmy McHugh include I Love to Whistle Ave Maria by Charles Francois Gounod Chapel Bells I Love to Whistle and Serenade to the Stars. Aside from Durbin's singing the Capps Barros Harmonica Players also participate in a song number.Mad About Music resembles the story lines used by MGM especially those Jane Powell Technicolor musicals of the late 1940s mainly because it was produced by Joe Pasternak who brought over his charm of teenage musicals from Universal to MGM revamping the formula he originated in the Durbin films. UniversalInternational would remake Mad About Music as The Toy Tiger 1956 featuring Jeff Chandler Laraine Day and Tim Hovey in the Marshall Patrick and Durbin roles. While The Toy Tiger did get some television exposure on American Movie Classics in the 1990s Mad About Music at present did not. This Durbin original is available on video cassette. After watching this it would be impossible not to become Mad About Deanna. ".

Kay is played by the young and beautiful Elizabeth Taylor who had just been married for the first time in real life and her intended is played by Don Taylor an actor I haven't seen in anything else and can't really remember doing anything of interest in this.  The family is completed by Joan Bennett as Tracy's wife and Rusty later Russ Tamblyn as their youngest child.Although the movie does play up the comic potential of the wedding situation  the dad dreams of losing his trousers as he walks down the aisle for example  it also has moments of poignancy especially in the last few sequences where the parents dance together in the postparty mess of their oncepristine house.  This kind of thing puts the movie above the ordinary and is exactly what was missing in the Steve Martin remake years later.And don't let me forget Billie Burke and Moroni Olsen as the groom's parents  really funny!".

	schema:reviewBody "There's an old saying that the best ideas are the simplest. This is only partly true. The best ideas often stem from a basic concept but one which yields wideranging and elaborate results and then only if pulled off properly. Father of the Bride has a simple idea at its heart  a straightforward romantic comedy told from the point of view of someone on the periphery of the romance. However that idea provides the basis for a neatly structured picture that is both funny and endearing.The screenplay by the fantastic but rarely lauded husbandandwife writing duo Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett tells a story on two levels. The actual events of the picture of chart the romance and wedding of a young couple and this is more or less all that actually takes place on screen. However the device of a voiceover narrative as well as setpieces such as the engagement party shown entirely from Spencer Tracy's position as involuntary butler make this undoubtedly his story. The voiceover was a popular feature of thrillers around this time but here it serves as a comical inner monologue and commentary. Telling the story through the father's eyes ultimately allows Goodrich and Hackett to make this a tale not of romantic love but of family and paternal affection and one that is more moving than dozens of runofthemill romcoms.Director Vincente Minnelli was perhaps an odd choice for this project. Having had his biggest successes with musicals his flowing flamboyant style could have been a bit overthetop for such a smallscale realworld setting. However Minnelli's tendency to lead the audience in a certain direction and his skillful control of elements within the frame bring a lot to Father of the Bride. He is careful to always keep the wedding story going often literally in the background while putting Spencer Tracy in the foreground to give us his expressions and reactions. Usually the background goingson are very busy helping them to balance out as well as giving a better comedy effect as Tracy grumps about before the camera. In the scene where the Bankses meet the Dunstons Minnelli begins successive shots with a closeup of Tracy's martini glass to give the whole scene the overtone that he is getting more and more drunk as he speaks. One of Minnelli's brightest ideas is to shoot the chaotic wedding rehearsal in one long take from a distant high angle. Not only does this allow the comedy to unfold naturally it introduces us to the setting but in a slightly detached way. This gives all the more contrast and intensity to the following nightmare sequence which is all done in closeups with dozens of cuts.In the titular role Spencer Tracy gives a typically engaging yet understated performance. This kind of thing was really Tracy's forte. He is essentially a comedy character since it's his grouchiness and his bewilderment that underlie most of the funny bits. But he's not a wild comic  he's also very believable and very human and more importantly someone we can like and sympathise with. Although Joan Bennett plays her role completely straight and very reserved it makes sense for the two of them to be a screen couple. And while Katherine Hepburn had the best chemistry with Tracy and it was always nice to see them on screen together Bennett is the more appropriate actress here because she is more sedate and will not threaten to upstage Tracy whose movie it is after all.And Elizabeth Taylor a huge star even then and arguably the female lead ultimately has a fairly marginal role both in the script and on the screen. Some commentators bemoan this fact and even prefer the 1991 remake to this original as a result. And yet it is all organised in such a way  the GoodrichHackett screen writing Minnelli's direction Tracy's acting  that brings a depth and poignancy to the fatherdaughter relationship despite Taylor's minimal participation. Take moments such as Tracy's relieved smile as the camera pulls away with him from the young lovers' reunion after their argument or his frantic searching for his daughter so he can say goodbye before she leaves for the honeymoon. They don't distract from the general pattern of this being the father's story and yet they reveal his true feelings sometimes better than many a conventional scene between two people who love each other.".

	schema:reviewBody "For those who like a light comedy diversion this was pretty good stuff. Spencer Tracy is excellent as a father of the bride and he gives us a good idea of what it's like to have a daughter married off. Of course Hollywood exaggerates a bit and not everyone's daughter looks like Elizabeth Taylor but that's what made this fun and I think a hit movie.It must have been a good story and pretty successful for a remake to be made 40 years later starring Steve Martin. I watched both versions and would select this one over the re make. As in most cases there were more values and family togetherness in the classicera movies than what Hollywood usually shows today. Nothing against Martin but it was too difficult trying to top Tracy's performance in here.This version actually was honored quite a bit up for a handful of Academy Awards including Best Picture. I don't remember this movie being THAT good but everyone's sense of humor is different. Also not being a father it was hard for me to relate to the mom and dad's predicaments here. Tracy and Joan Bennett played the parents. However married friends of mine who saw this movie all loved it.Obviously some of this is very dated and a little unrealistic. Any father who still sees his daughter as someone in pigtails and tomboyish when she looks like Taylor ain't paying attention! Then again maybe all dads see their daughters as little girls no matter what age.We see something else employed in this film you don't see anymore someone talking directly to the camera as Tracy does here. I kind of like that. Daffy Duck did that with hilarious results. So did Groucho Mark. It made us the audience feel we were involved with wedding too.All in all still a good film which holds up reasonably well if you can look at it as a farce and a comment with weddings  something that will never change!".

	schema:reviewBody "When I watch either this version or the Steve Martin version of Father of the Bride I always think of my poor brother now. He's the father of girls 21 and 19 so he will have to deal with what Spencer Tracy did twice.This film was one of MetroGoldwynMayer's big moneymakers at the tail end of Louis B. Mayer's reign. It certainly has a theme one that we can all identify with. 55 years after Father of the Bride came out fathers all over the world will be overwhelmed by weddings. It will be so 100 years from now.Twelve years after he won his second Oscar in Boystown Spencer Tracy got an Oscar nomination for Stanley Banks beleaguered and harried father of one of the most beautiful brides ever to grace the screen. It's on his performance narrated in flashback by him that the whole film rises or falls. Of course Tracy never let an audience down.By coincidence the publicity surrounding Elizabeth Taylor's first marriage came as this film was being made and released. Sad that Liz Taylor never settled down to a stable marriage with a loving faithful husband as Kay Banks did with Buckley Dunstan. But she sure is a bride for all seasons.Of course the wedding the planning the cost the disruption to the lives of the Banks household is the film. Who of us who dealt with having a wedding didn't have to deal with a snooty caterer? A formal announcement party that Tracy puts on and can't enjoy because he's stuck behind a jerrybuilt bar in his kitchen? A wedding rehearsal that can't seem to come off? Universal and timeless themes.Joan Bennett registers well as the patient and loyal mother of the bride who has to deal with both her husband and daughter losing their minds to prewedding jitters. Moroni Olsen and Billie Burke and their son Don Taylor do just fine as the groom's side. And Leo G. Carroll is the wedding caterer from snob city. Maybe Clifton Webb could have done it better if MGM could have afforded him but Carroll is just fine.My favorite moment in Father of the Bride is in the midst of all the chaos Tracy looks at the older of Taylor's two brothers Tom Irish and tells him with great relief that when he gets married his only contribution to the wedding will be him. My brother has to go through two daughters before he can say that to my nephew.".

Stanley Barnes nominal head of the Barnes household finds himself increasingly marginalised as the wedding approaches.Tracy underplays Stanley and judges his performance beautifully.  He is the staid old dinosaur at the centre of the hubbub.  Whereas Steve Martin in the 1991 version played the father as a manic plunger into other people's swimmingpools Tracy can raise a laugh by lying motionless in bed staring into space.Stanley's wife Ellie is played by Joan Bennett and hers is the comedy of manners manoeuvring through the various social minefields which she encounters.  She restrains Stanley from yelling in front of the domestic help harbours doubts about Kay and Buckley unlike Diane Keaton's character in the remake and gets nervous and embarrassed in front of the inlaws.  It is touching for us to learn that she regrets not having had a white wedding of her own and this gives her a credible motivation for the spendfest which follows.This film is surer of itself than is the remake at least in part because in 1950 the social demarcations were clearer and more solidlygrounded.  The Barnes family lives in a bourgeois community in which the 'rules' are universally understood.  There has to be an engagement party and a formal visit to the inlaws.  These procedural steps en route to the wedding are unquestioned.  In the 1991 version the notion of 'being middle class' has expanded and grown nebulous.  The inlaws are simply richer not socially superior.  The milestones towards the marriage are fumbled for  noone is comfortable with the protocol.  Even the mantoman talk feels inappropriate.Interestingly Stanley is able to get away with being a garrulous bore. Martin strives for the viewer's sympathy whereas Tracy is assured enough to let his character have shortcomings.  He does not need to swing from ballustrades to get laughs because he has enough presence and authority simply to be what he is and to allow the humour to arise out of the situation.Tracy can however mime with the best of them.  The slightlytooshort waistcoat is great fun and his silent reactions to the bustup and reconciliation are marvellous.  The film contains lots of goodies like the expressionist nightmare or the quiet moment when Tracy is alone with the floral displays seemingly hemmedin by the frippery of the wedding.

	schema:reviewBody "FATHER OF THE BRIDE tells the tale of how the once perfectly serene Banks household led by genial wouldbe patriarch Stanley Banks Spencer Tracy deals with the trials and tribulations that come with the wedding of the family's sweet daughter Kay Elizabeth Taylor to her earnest suitor Buckley Dunstan Don Taylor. Pretty much anything that can cause a father's hair to gather even more grey streaks happens in the runup to this weddingfirst the bills as indicated in the tagline to the film start pouring in... then he realises that his wife Ellie a Joan Bennett almost unrecognisable from her role as Amy March in 1933's LITTLE WOMEN never got the church wedding she wanted so he gives in and splashes out for Kay. The guest lists swell beyond his expectations and financial means the caterer belittles the planned menu and the Buckley home and Kay fights with Buckley and temporarily but hairraisingly calls off the wedding. In fact amidst the mess and chaos of the actual wedding itself the father of the bride doesn't even get to kiss the bride goodbye.All this might seem mighty familiar to anyone who's seen a 1991 film which oddly enough bears the same title but stars Steve Martin Diane Keaton and in a hilarious turn as the effete wedding coordinator Martin Short instead. The film is of course a remake retaining a great deal of the original 1950 film's dialogue and situations while updating it for modern times and developing the relationship of the characters further. For example the two Banks brothers are eliminated for a younger baby brother for Annie no longer Kay played by Kieran Culkin. As I recall the relationship between father and daughter is also better fleshedout in the remake as is that between the patriarch and matriarch of the family.However even though the 1991 remake is one of the most credible remakes of a classic film ever I would willingly watch the remakenot something I can say for several other similarly presumptuous films there are still some areas in which it falls far short of the original. Almost all of these areas have to do with the fact that the remake is lacking its own Spencer Tracyit is his grasp of the role that makes the original film worth seeing to begin with otherwise one could just as easily watch the remake and not lose very much in the translation. While Steve Martin does a great job as the title character Spencer Tracy does a defining job. Diane Keaton just about every other scene from Martin as does Kieran Culkin Spencer Tracy dominates all the scenes he's in. He plays his role perfectly with just the right amount of frustration genuine bemusement and abiding adoration for his only daughter.One scene early on in the film captures exactly what Tracy contributes to his role as he does to all his others Stanley lies restless in bed unable to sleep for worrying over Kay's announcement of her intent to marry Buckley. When he wakes Ellie up and starts complaining watch Tracy as he keeps listing the different things there are to be worried abouthe keeps fidgeting on the bed almost lying back and then snapping upright again when a new horrifying thought enters his mind. The entire scene just rings of truth and you realise just what a great actor Spencer Tracy is even in slight fare like FATHER OF THE BRIDE.In the end although FATHER OF THE BRIDE has a clever script and a generally good supporting cast Taylor appears beautiful but rather blank most of the time it is held together by the commanding performance given by Spencer Tracy and for that reason becomes a film worth watching. It might also be worth your while to catch the remake if you haven't already. Both films are sweet and utterly likeable and a fun way to spend an evening. ".

The mere idea of having Spencer Tracy playing the father of the bride after his many years of portraying heavier characters is in itself a triumph!The film was tremendously successful because of the casting of Elizabeth Taylor in all her beauty. Ms. Taylor is an example why more fathers will go into the poor house when their daughters decide to marry and must have an elaborate wedding. Of course those were other times poor Stanley Banks didn't have to spend so much money to marry her daughter. Had it been today it must have cost a small fortune to do a modest ceremony with a few hundred guests. The way they figured the cost of the affair was less than three dollars per person! Incredible!In a way this picture points out to the basic problems of having a social event of this magnitude when the parents are well connected as is the case with the Banks. In fact watching the reception we realize most of the people attending the celebration are friends of the parents. We hardly see any young friends of the couple with the exception of the ones in the wedding party. Imagine having to spend so much money knowing most marriages will end in divorce! Oh well.Spencer Tracy makes a wonderful father of the bride. He was at the top of his career he makes us believe he is the man losing his daughter and having to pay for it in the process. Joan Bennett makes a delightful Ellie the mother of the marrying girl. Elizabeth Taylor not only was beautiful but in this film one can't keep the eyes away from her for a second. The supporting cast was excellent. Mr. Minelli brings all these characters together in a comedy that although a bit dated will charm anyone because of the excellent cast in it.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a cute movie. What separates it from all the TV sitcoms that were to follow is the care time and expense that went into all aspects of the production. Except that it was shot on the MGM lot which would have made more money as a theme park than a shopping mall. Followers of the more popular TV sitcoms become familiar with the various characters over the course of episodes sometimes over the course of years. But Minnelli and his cast and crew had to squeeze everything we learn about the characters into an hour and a half so they had a lot more work to do. The audience couldn't take the characters' traits for granted like Jack Benny's stinginess Ralph Kramden's bluster Lucy's mishchievousness Ted Baxter's vanity or Archie Bunker's ethnocentricity. In a feature film it all had to be shown first and then developed in the course of one long episode so to speak.This was one of a series of what might be called uppermiddleclass comedies which included Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House. Father of the Bride crafts and executes the jokes almost flawlessly.Want to see a great example of intuitive acting one that probably took more than a few takes? Watch the bedroom scene before the wedding in which Spencer Tracy wakes his wife and tells her how worried he is that their daughter's Elizabeth Taylor's fianc is basically an unknown in their lives. He's a charming boy replies Bennet the wife. Charm eh? Tracy shoots back and unleashes his anxiety. That's just what these guys have got. Oh lots of charm. Probably got a criminal record and so on until he winds up with Just the kind of guy who'll probably put a bullet in the back of her neck. Then he rolls over and goes to sleep. What a performance. Tracy rolls around frantically while talking fluffing his pillows settling back and then sitting up again shaking the blankets scowling at his wife. In TV there simply isn't enough TIME to devote to a single scene like that nor are the performers usually up to Tracy's standards.The same goes for the direction. Watch the scene of the wedding rehearsal at the church. It is as Tracy despondently describes it afterwards utter and complete chaos. The scene lasts a good four minutes and involves at least a dozen characters who must learn how to walk in a particular way and recite their lines appropriately. It's both maddening and hilarious. And it's all done with no more than one or two cuts. Minelli's camera simply sits there and captures the insanity in long takes. How many were required we'll never know but certainly there were more tries than The Mary Tyler Moore Show could afford.Not much is required of the rest of the cast.

	onyx:emotionText "What a cute movie. What separates it from all the TV sitcoms that were to follow is the care time and expense that went into all aspects of the production. Except that it was shot on the MGM lot which would have made more money as a theme park than a shopping mall. Followers of the more popular TV sitcoms become familiar with the various characters over the course of episodes sometimes over the course of years. But Minnelli and his cast and crew had to squeeze everything we learn about the characters into an hour and a half so they had a lot more work to do. The audience couldn't take the characters' traits for granted like Jack Benny's stinginess Ralph Kramden's bluster Lucy's mishchievousness Ted Baxter's vanity or Archie Bunker's ethnocentricity. In a feature film it all had to be shown first and then developed in the course of one long episode so to speak.This was one of a series of what might be called uppermiddleclass comedies which included Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House. Father of the Bride crafts and executes the jokes almost flawlessly.Want to see a great example of intuitive acting one that probably took more than a few takes? Watch the bedroom scene before the wedding in which Spencer Tracy wakes his wife and tells her how worried he is that their daughter's Elizabeth Taylor's fianc is basically an unknown in their lives. He's a charming boy replies Bennet the wife. Charm eh? Tracy shoots back and unleashes his anxiety. That's just what these guys have got. Oh lots of charm. Probably got a criminal record and so on until he winds up with Just the kind of guy who'll probably put a bullet in the back of her neck. Then he rolls over and goes to sleep. What a performance. Tracy rolls around frantically while talking fluffing his pillows settling back and then sitting up again shaking the blankets scowling at his wife. In TV there simply isn't enough TIME to devote to a single scene like that nor are the performers usually up to Tracy's standards.The same goes for the direction. Watch the scene of the wedding rehearsal at the church. It is as Tracy despondently describes it afterwards utter and complete chaos. The scene lasts a good four minutes and involves at least a dozen characters who must learn how to walk in a particular way and recite their lines appropriately. It's both maddening and hilarious. And it's all done with no more than one or two cuts. Minelli's camera simply sits there and captures the insanity in long takes. How many were required we'll never know but certainly there were more tries than The Mary Tyler Moore Show could afford.Not much is required of the rest of the cast. Tracy is the main show and he provides the narration. But Elizabeth Taylor is dropdead gorgeous. Russ Tamblyn doesn't have many lines as her younger brother but he has one of the best. Tracy and Taylor have a minor row and Taylor huffs off. Well what's the matter with HER? asks Tracy. And Tamblyn gets to say in his whiny adolescent voice suggesting knowledge beyond his years She's nervous. ALL women are nervous. If you haven't seen this yet don't miss your next chance.";

	schema:reviewBody "Vincent Minnelli was famous for his attention to detail on a movie set. Father of the Bride is no exception to his welldeserved reputation. I loved the setting of the Bank's home the comfortable twostory home on a treelined street. Elizabeth Taylor's bedroom with its fireplace and its generous baywindow made me wonder why she got the best bedroom in the house and if she had regrets about leaving that lovely home to probably live in a small apartment. The family room with its Victorian couch and leather chair by the fireplace helped me understand why the Banks family seemed so close they had probably spent lots of time in that room together on cold snowy nights. The kitchen was definitely a product of the 19401950's rather sterile and sanitized with its white metal cabinets. The idea of warm countrystyle kitchens had gone out of fashion by that time by people in the same social class as the Banks. The dining room makes up for that coldness with the beautiful dining room set and elaborate silver candle sticks. Ellie and Stanley probably did a lot of entertaining in that room she with her garden club and he with his clients from the law firm. I have seen the colorized version of the film and I was not offended by it. I rather enjoyed seeing some of the details of the home and the costumes come to life through the addition of color. I could see Elizabeth Taylor's famous violet eyes. The matching baby blue ensemble of matching dress and coat that she wore out on a date with Buckley said to the viewer This is definitely a uppermiddle class family of the 1950's. The fact that Miss Taylor's wardrobe was so expensive coupled with the fact that she seemed to have no job except to be the fiance of Buckley left no doubt in the viewer's mind as to the kind of finishing school life she must have led as a daughter of Stanley Banks. I once read that her white slippersatin and lace bridal dress was voted the best movie bridal dress and I agree with that vote. It was gorgeous and she was gorgeous in the dress. Ellie looked beautiful as the mother of the bride in her powder blue dress with all of its elegance and attention to detail validated Spencer Tracy's remark that she wore in that dress all of the beauty of her own wedding day. Yes Ellie wore the years well despite a being a busy mother of three and a woman with many 1950's social obligations. The church with its elaborate floral arrangements seem to be stand out more in the colorized version. The salmon pink color of the seven bridesmaid's dresses and matching juliet caps underscored the elegance and elaborate statement of the event and the fact that the father of the bride in the end spared no expense for his daughter's wedding. All in all the sets and costumes were a feast to the eye. I also admit that I enjoyed the colorized version and that it enhanced my understanding of the characters of the movie and their various reactions to a wedding in the family.".

	schema:reviewBody "Marriage and the married life may be wonderful but the wedding is something else entirely. Based on the novel by Edward Streeter this simple story of the Father of the Bride is Hollywood at its best. Despite the fact it doesn't contain an elaborate dance number or colorful sets this movie shows director Vincente Minnelli at the peak of his craft. Spencer Tracy the father of the bride tells of how his daughter's wedding turns his life upside down and his bank balance. But more than that this movie not only shows life in an average!? American family but it lovingly portrays the relationship between a father and his daughter. Despite Elizabeth Taylor's subtle and surprisingly effective role as the daughter and her exquisite looks it is definitely Spencer Tracy's movie. In fact his expressions and his whole manner and attitude make for the whole plot and the whole enjoyment of the film. A personal favorite highlight of mine is the they're the ones...the smooth talkers speech. Director Minnelli puts Elizabeth's looks to great use in closeups and she truly makes a stunning bride. Joan Bennett is great as the mother. Young Russ Tamblyn is one of Elizabeth's brothers. Billie Burke Oz's Glenda the Good Witch of the North and Moroni Olsen who provided the voice of the Mirror Mirror on the Wall in Snow White  the original are the parents of the groom. If you haven't seen this gem you have missed an essential. Watch this immediately!! Reviewer's Orders!!".

Sure Rod Hopkins aka Brad Armstrong is a technically proficient filmmaker who invariably assures that his movies look and sound like their mainstream equivalent but he lacks both imagination and inspiration when it comes down to the one aspect that differentiates the admirable from the merely adequate i.e. hot sex. Proving that every dog will have its day he has come up with the occasional near masterpiece like EUPHORIA or to a slightly lesser extent EXILE but most of his flicks primarily pander to easily impressed production value junkies who value surface gloss over actual heat. Unfortenately his heavily hyped CURSE ETERNAL falls squarely into that already overstuffed latter category with only a few fiery flickers alleviating the thudding repetitiveness of the proceedings.Ace archaeologist Samantha Stewart Jessica Drake is called to Egypt to investigate the ruins of the tomb of Princess Neferkala Kaylani Lei the same site where her father Randy Spears lost his life nearly two decades prior. The opening flashback has already alerted the audience that there's truth to the rumored curse of the adulterous princess who was sentenced to death after killing the Pharao who had executed her lover Nomron Eric Masterson. The removal of the ankh on the mummy's withered chest awakens Neferkala from her slumber as she both thanks by offering her luscious body and punishes by sucking the life force out of him the perpetrator for doing so. Hence we get various disappointingly similar scenes of lovely Lei a former Michael Raven muse in features such as ANGEL X and DELILAH the latter a product of his shortlived stint for Private working her way through a number of male and female obstacles before latching onto bespectacled Samantha an obvious graduate of the why Miss Jones you're beautiful school of scientists whose parentage keeps her from suffering the fate of her predecessors. Turns out that Neferkala can only find eternal rest if she's reunited with the reincarnation of her former paramour. Rather inconveniently this turns out to be Sam's livein boyfriend Adam also played by Masterson. Before we get to the film's excellently handled finale with Lei and Drake mauling Masterson in two different time frames easily the flick's carnal highlight we still have to suffer through a seemingly endless night club group sequence which also zaps back and forth to ancient times. Narratively this is explained as filling Samantha in on her past life. Visually however this scene is seriously marred by the shirtless presence of director Hopkins who's gone really saggy as of late ! Now I have no problem with physically imperfect performers in porn hey you're talking to a lifelong Robert Bolla fan after all but in a cast otherwise filled with hardbodied gym bunnies he does tend to stick out like the proverbial sore thumb.Hopkins takes an inordinate amount of time this baby lasts over two and a half hours people ! to reach the conclusion of his slender tale pausing every so often for an elaborate grope that substitutes professional athleticism for passionate pleasure. Star power's also a bit low on this occasion with neither the exotic Lei nor the admittedly lovely leggy Drake so well used in Mike Raven's superlative BEAST making much impact. The film's most impressive quality remains its luminous cinematography by Franois Clousot a director of some merit who started out shooting some of Private's better pictures like STUDY IN SEX and SUMMER WIND. Notwithstanding first rate production design that clearly ate up much of this flick's undoubtedly substantial budget it's yawn city all the way.".

	schema:headline " A major step backwards in the franchise even for fans of it.";
	schema:reviewBody "Okay so I'll admit that I found the first Paranormal Activity to be overrated and the second to be largely an extension of the first. The third one I must admit I found very effective at times and it was the best of the franchise in my view.Now we have Paranormal Activity 4 and I must admit I found this one utterly ridiculous in so many ways.The base story is that Katie the possessed woman from the first two films and the sibling who was haunted by Toby in the third film has moved next door to a new family with her adopted son Robbie in tow.Robbie has a propensity for wandering onto the property of the neighbours across the street giving Alex the daughter of the family and her best friend Ben the creeps...something that they mention seemingly every 30 seconds in the first half of the film.One night Katie is taken away in an ambulance and so the family across the street takes in Robbie until Katie is well enough to come home. During this time Robbie bonds with the family's young son Wyatt...and introduces him to his unseen companion...who we assume is Toby though I don't recall this ever being made clear.Paranormal activities begin to plague the family in particular Alex from the moment that Robbie enters the home...but her efforts to alert her family of what's going on falls on deaf ears until by the end they meet the typical franchise fate.Now it has to be said that I think the found footage element in this film has been stretched to the max. I mean there are no home video cameras in the film...it's all captured apparently on laptop web cam...which requires Alex to basically cart along her laptop wherever she goes while the other laptops are set to remote record.Apparently no one closes there laptop after they're done using it but I digress...the formula is obviously warn out.As is the need to rely on jump scares and CGI. Seriously aside from some menacing moments when Katie appears behind someone and you're waiting to see what she does there is literally no scares besides jump scares.The most bizarre moment of the entire film...is when Alex and her Father are under attack by the witches coven and the paranormal force...and presumably as she's running for her life Alex is carrying around her laptop.To be honest I just think they've run out of ideas on this franchise which is I suspect why the film even with about five minutes of clips from the first two films just barely makes it over the 80 minute mark.My advice if you're looking for a scary film that will be with you for days...go see Sinister. If you see this one prepare to be disappointed...as it wouldn't be incorrect to say that the scariest scenes...are in the trailer...some of which somehow don't even make it into the film itself.".

	onyx:emotionText "Okay so I'll admit that I found the first Paranormal Activity to be overrated and the second to be largely an extension of the first. The third one I must admit I found very effective at times and it was the best of the franchise in my view.Now we have Paranormal Activity 4 and I must admit I found this one utterly ridiculous in so many ways.The base story is that Katie the possessed woman from the first two films and the sibling who was haunted by Toby in the third film has moved next door to a new family with her adopted son Robbie in tow.Robbie has a propensity for wandering onto the property of the neighbours across the street giving Alex the daughter of the family and her best friend Ben the creeps...something that they mention seemingly every 30 seconds in the first half of the film.One night Katie is taken away in an ambulance and so the family across the street takes in Robbie until Katie is well enough to come home. During this time Robbie bonds with the family's young son Wyatt...and introduces him to his unseen companion...who we assume is Toby though I don't recall this ever being made clear.Paranormal activities begin to plague the family in particular Alex from the moment that Robbie enters the home...but her efforts to alert her family of what's going on falls on deaf ears until by the end they meet the typical franchise fate.Now it has to be said that I think the found footage element in this film has been stretched to the max.

Her own daughter either doesn't fulfill this role or did and its just a damn greedy demon.At the end of the film the Grandma takes her grandchildren to do whatever it is she wants them to do. Then in the 1st and 2nd films we see that the demon now wants a boy in return for the wealth and power it allegedly provided to the Grandma despite her living in a distinctively average house and apparently choosing not to share her wealth with any of her descendants. Quite what the demon got from whatever happened at the end of the 3rd film isn't clear but by hook or crook the demon gets the boy at the end of the second film. Now it's something of a clumsy demon because by the 4th film it's lost the boy and he's been adopted but it wants him back. You'd think after all that effort it would do a better job of holding onto it but still. So in summary we don't know what the demon actually wants a boy for or two young girls. It is starting to sound rather dodgy now isn't it I wouldn't let that script writer babysit the Grandma appears to have got a bit of a raw deal and the demon prefers more difficult targets to possess some of the time? rather than just possessing some homeless person if a kidnapping is all that's required. Is any of that inaccurate?".

Unlike the first film and to an extent the second film tension is not built up to a satisfying ending as 20 minutes into the film we are already well established and getting scared by things popping out at any time. The acting in the film is okay for a horror movie for a film. BUT for a film so late into a franchise with no set direction for a 5th film i think they should just let it die but i'm sure 13 yr olds will just LOVE it for the fact things jump out which is NOT scary And the Ending. I will not even comment as i believe it to be not a proper ending and i will go on a rant.Don't expect too much and you might enjoy it but for what its worth it was atrocious just another franchise getting run into the ground like the Saw films.".

The only activity that happened was a knife disappeared and a few chairs moved with the occasional loud thumps. But apart from that the worst thing was the unanswered questions.First off you start off with a boy named Robby who lives across the street. You believe that this is Hunter seeing as how the kid's mother is Katie. Then come to find out that he isn't Hunter but the boy with the real family is somehow Hunter and was adopted. And the first boy Robby completely disappears without any sort of explanation never to be seen again. The teenage girl Alex sets up carefully placed web cams throughout the house that run at all times but she rarely checks any of the video. In fact she only checks it twice throughout the entire movie even after the important things happen. She and her boyfriend do a little research and come up with something about there being three steps to doing something. What that something is I'm not really sure. The last step is the sacrifice of a virgin. Later on as the girl is sleeping her little brother comes into her bedroom and Alex is lifted from her bed into the air. Then it cuts to the morning and she wakes up as if nothing happened at all. They set up a Kinect which shows movement. I thought this would be a cool concept except they did nothing with it. At one point they showed a little boy ghost following close behind Hunter but again that was just something that was never discussed and never answered. The boy Hunter is dragged under water in the bath tub for several minutes and somehow doesn't drown. Finally he surfaces and his mom comes in and gets him out of the tub and that was that. There was a cat that was used only for cheap jumps from the audience. A chandelier fell from the ceiling and never talked about again. There was no explanation of why the two teenagers were carrying around cameras every where they went. At the end after everyone has been killed in the same way everyone in every movie was killed Alex goes to the house across the street to find her dad. She winds up in the back yard of the house after running from Katie and for some reason there is an army of demon women. No idea where those demon women came from or what their purpose was but they were there. Then Katie catches Alex and kills her. End of movie.All in all... It just was not good. The story was bad. The cinematography was bad. The direction was bad. The acting actually was pretty good but that's the only thing that was. I would not recommend watching this. And this is coming from a guy who will defend the first three movies absolutely.".

	schema:headline " Rustles up basic cookiecutter scares and shortchanges the exposition it needs to begin piecing together";
	schema:reviewBody "It has become an unintentional October ritual that I decorate the house for Halloween watch a few horror films and since 2009 see the latest installment of the Paranormal Activity franchise. When I walked out of the original film on that faithful October morning I hoped that the wonderful picture I had just saw would be left alone and not have the albatrosses known as sequels leaching off of it.Now I'm faced with the fourth film in the genre directed by the extremely talented directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman who made one of 2010's finest documentaries Catfish. This installment is a small improvement over the uninspired third part yet it has little to offer. The characters are a tad more tolerable and some sequences including the end have a bit more life in them but when the moments examine the paranormal inactivity of it all it becomes totally vanilla.After two films we finally reconnect with Katie from the original film this time living on an uppermiddle class suburban block with Hunter from the second film. Only in this part he's called Robbie not Hunter and is about six years old. Don't question. Turns out they have moved across the street from fifteen year old Alex Kathryn Newton her techsavvy boyfriend Ben who doesn't live there but might as well Matt Shively of True Jackson VP fame her younger brother Wyatt Aiden Lovekamp and her parents Stephen Dunham and Alexondra Lee. When Katie is taken to the hospital for unknown reasons Robbie Brady Allen who already loves to venture into the neighbors' backyard and hang out in the treehouse is sent to be cared for at Alex's home for the next few days.Robbie immediately strikes up an unsettling friendship with Wyatt and it isn't long before Alex and her goofy boyfriend become victim to the paranormal activity occurring in the household. Everything from falling chandeliers to dining room chairs moving out abruptly to knives falling loud thumps and alarms claiming FRONT DOOR OPEN BACK DOOR OPEN occur and there is little consistency with anything.Many different cameras are utilized throughout the film mainly Alex's webcam on her laptop which she apparently carts around with her everywhere she goes. The main camera is the one on the Xbox 360's Kinect for those unaware a mechanism that now comes equipped with the console which allows the person to use the tiny sensor on the device to utilize motion control and be able to control their character without a formal controller which when on creates little small green dots that glow and showcase nightvision movement. It's a nifty little novelty and we can at least see that Joost and Schulman have respectively tried to breed life back into the way these pictures are filmed.Thank goodness because there's little that can be done with the story and the scares. We get a barrage of different jump scares many inactive nights and lots of abrupt noises always followed up by a startled hello? from one of the characters. These films have gotten to be achingly predictable and it feels like every year since 2010 I've gone on a lunchdate with a person whose intentions I like but personality and charm I've come to loathe.I think besides the nifty camerawork what elevates Paranormal Activity 4 from the monotony and the drabness of the previous installment is the fact that we have at least marginally tolerable characters to watch as well. Alex and Ben are at times a humorous riot and at others dreadfully unremarkable. Easily they are the most fun to be with since Katie and Micah but Katie and Micah were at least trapped in a film that was fun to experience for the first time in a fresh original manner. Here we've become so accustomed to this formula that we continue to anticipate every twist and every turn and we watch in plain awe to see the films border more and more on the line of selfparody.So let's say Joost and Schulman make the decision to direct the inevitable Paranormal Activity 5 and Paranormal Activity 6. What they should focus on instead of repetitive deadend jump scares is giving the audience some insight as to what is haunting Katie and her family and how it came to be. It seems every film we get a different entity and no explanation surrounding it. When will we get the explanation of Katie's action during the first installment? Or her sister's spontaneous ones in the sequel? Or what about Toby or whoever the imaginary figure was in the third film? And don't forget about whatever the hell that was at the end of the third film and this film for that matter. Just another sidenote the last fifteen minutes of this film did not scar me for life much like its predecessor's.Paranormal Activity 4 is effective in rustling up scareattempt after scareattempt on a basic level yet shortchanges the larger questions that would offer insight to Katie's family if explored. Some viewers may not want to be bothered by lengthy explanations of the countless questions still at hand or the numerous symbols that have been associated with the demonic creatures in these films. Perhaps so but to watch the fourth film in a series continue to be resistant in exploring the exposition of its characters doesn't seem like an ideal move. Considering audiences seem to be tiring from the bangandscare features the found footage genre has inspired it would be a pity to see this franchise die before it can fully clean up its messy tracks.Starring Kathryn Newton Matt Shively Katie Featherston Brady Allen Aiden Lovekamp Stephen Dunham and Alexondra Lee. Directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman.".

	schema:reviewBody "Paranormal Activityyou either love or hate it I fall under the latter. Paranormal Activity originally started out as a Blair Witch Project rip off and for some reason it became incredibly popular and spawned a franchise which releases a sequel every year. Now before this review starts I would like to point out there will be spoilers and if you are interested in seeing this stop reading this review. The plot focuses on the exact same thing as the last 3 films did a family moves into a house a member of the family films every little thing that goes on in the house for some reason Ricky Fits would even call them weird They notice something creepy on the tape and some spooky things happen. Lets introduce our main characters shall we! We have Alex Our annoying teenage brat protagonist. She spends the whole film trying to look scared and swearing.Ben Alex's perverted possibly pedophile boyfriend There is no way this guy is 15. He spends the film trying to get Alex nude recording their video chats and breaking into her house. Charming.Wyatt Alex's adopted brother. He's almost a ripoff of Danny Torrance there is even a scene where the have him ride a bike through the house. Every time he was on screen me and my friend would shout Redrum!Robbie The son of Satan himself. He just spends the film walking around talking to himself and being creepy. I'd also like to add that this character kind of disappears from the film they just put him on a bus and say SCREW THE PLOT WE HAVE SOME SCARY CRAP TO SHOW YOU!Doug Alex's father played by the late Stephen Dunham. He really doesn't do much in this film so there is no point in talking about him.Holly Alex's mother. This character is possibly one of the worst mothers ever put to screen she leaves her 6 year old son in the bathtub with a laptop RIGHT BESIDE THE TUB why the hell does a 6 year old have a laptop anyway!? and knocks her daughter out with sleeping pills. Now I'll cover the basics Writing The story is just a rehash of the past 3 films which was a terrible story to begin with. All of the characters are flat and unlikeable and I just really didn't care what happened to them. The dialogue in this film is just atrocious there are scenes which are simply here to explain words like duckface or explain what a Kardashian is. Oh I forgot to mention there is a scene where Robbie draws a triangle with a circle inside on Wyatt's back Alex and Ben are confused about this and decide to Google what it means and what do you know it's some satanic crap even stranger they find it AS THE FIRST RESULT. I have to bring up the ending as well it ends with Alex running out of her house after discovering Wyatt is missing while holding her laptop for some reason and finds him in an old house which for some reason have windows that are covered in Spanish newspaper. creepily talking to himself Alex then discovers this creature Katie from the last 3 films who then chases after her she makes it outside where she discovers a large group of people with glowing eyes who then kill her Village of the Damned anyone?. This ending made no sense at all and had me thinking What the hell just happened? I mentioned earlier that a new films is released every year shows the thought process that goes into these films.Directing This whole film is filmed in that annoying shaky cam found footage style and some if it looks so bad I'd swear it could have been scenes deleted from Julien DonkeyBoy because it looked too crappy. Acting Good god...the acting. This film has some of the worst acting I've seen in a horror film our two protagonists Alex and Benare the absolute worst. I have to admit the two kids Wyatt and Robbie gave decent performances they not Marlon Brando or Spencer Tracy but they are good compared to everyone else.Scares Scares? What scares? This film relies on jump scares to scare you the majority of these scares are false there is a scene where Alex goes downstairs looking for Wyatt and then a chandelier falls from the ceiling SCARY! The cat jumps in front of the screen several times SCARY! The door slams SCARY! The pedophile boyfriend is tackling Alex SCARY! There is however one that did work there is a scene where the boyfriend is killed and the body is hid in the closet Alex later comes home and tries to call him from her cellphone and hears his phone ring in her closet.If you loved the last three Paranormal Activity films you would love this if not you will hate it.If you want a scary horror film watch Perfect Blue Eraserhead Psycho Alien The Shining The Thing 1951 or 1982 remake Les Diaboliques The Exorcist Rosemary's Baby Nosferatu 1922 or 1978 remake or George A. Romero's Living Dead series.If you want a good modern horror film watch The Cabin in The Woods or American Horror Story season 2 is the best.If you want a good found footage film watch Cloverfield.Just stay away from this unless you are a fan.".

	schema:headline " Frighteningly disappointing";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite only finding at best mixed reviews I had high hopes for this film as a fan of the series the original Paranormal Activity was a refreshing change from what had become a stale and repetitive phase of horror films. I was apprehensive that a sequel would be a disappointment but was if anything better than the first installment. I enjoyed the third film to an extent turning a blind eye to the repetitiveness and weak story. The cliffhanger ending reassured me that the fourth Paranormal Activity would answer the fairly basic questions which are the only reasons that we feel the need to watch every film in this series. However Paranormal Activity 4 is the most disappointing yet. Granted some moments would make me jumpif those moments weren't almost identical to the ones in the first second and third films. Not only are the scares hugely predictable but this installment doesn't even answer any of the questions that audiences have. In fact it somehow manages to raise more particularly with the frankly terrible ending  OK so a long time ago someone in the original family made a pact to give the firstborn male to this Demon. The firstborn male being Hunter who was kidnapped by Katie in the second film. We still do not known exactly what this has to do with the coven of countless women who are seen in the third film and at the end of the fourth film. Aside from the hopes of sucking more money from viewers who have been drawn into the original genius of these films I don't see what is stopping the demon from taking Hunter and that being the end of it. Especially now that the demon has control of a Human body Katie and all of Hunters family is dead so there is no one to stop it or try to save him.Overall this film was hugely disappointing failing completely to recover from the slump of story line and structure which the third film saw. As much as I would love to say that I will not bother watching any more of these films this wouldn't be true because I need to have my questions answered and find out what it's all about. All we can hope is that they do something a little bit different next time and finally wrap up the story.".

That version is missing only a few minutes of material but should be avoided nonetheless.Cantonese and Mandarin dialogue".

It is light as a feather but it's also fun fun fun  far more interesting and surprising than any action film I've seen out of Hollywood in a long long time all of which have seemed to me to be recycling the same script plot characters and score to desperation. Beats me how people could shell out eight bucks a pop to see Enemy of the State aka Mercury Rising aka Absolute Power...when they could rent Supercop for two bucks and actually see something unexpected.Of course this film stars Jackie Chan being his usual goofy self deftly making his extraordinary skills as a martial artist stuntman and physical comedian look as natural as breathing but the other amazing talent in this piece is exhibited by the fantastic stuntwoman Michelle Yeoh aka Michelle Khan the same woman who for the first time blew away many Western moviegoers in Tomorrow Never Dies.  I think this woman is made entirely of rubber and springs.  Most of her stunts in this movie are actually scarier and more daring than most of Chan's and some of the most brutal took more than one take.  And she did a lot of them in a dress!Fortunately she is also in the sequel to this Supercop II.  It's seven years old and I can hardly wait to rent it.  When was the last time you were in a hurry to see an action flick almost ten years old?  Too bad I can't say the same for Rush Hour which I had to click off after less than 10 minutes because Chan's colead character was such an obnoxious idiot.I really hope Hollywood learns from Chan and his Hong Kong associates and not the other way around.  Indicators are not positive.  Keep your fingers crossed.  Meanwhile watch Supercop and enjoy something fresh.".

She is an excellent martial arts talent in her own right and a pretty lady. By the way during the closing credits they show some of the stunts that went wrong. Not all of these are shown for laughs. In a few of them Chan is injured.The sound was amazing for a VHS. I can only imagine the stereo on the DVD. Overall a dumb movie with unrealistic fight scenes people just about get killed but keep getting up for more! but if you know that and just want to enjoy a lightweight action film it serves its purpose.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've never really been a great fan of Jackie Chan often feeling that he somewhat downgrades the true force  meaning of pure martial arts. Instead he turns it into a caricature mixed with lots of excessive special effects such as flying through plate glass windows or jumping over cars on a motorbike.I prefer the more natural aethetic Bruce Lee when it comes to studied martial arts. He took the art far more seriously and didn't take it to extremes just for the sake of another gee whiz effect.HOWEVER.....Jackie Chan DOES take his art just as seriously although not in a spiritual sense this is proved by the number of neardeath accidents he has received for the sake of his art over the years. He doesn't use stunt doubles very often and spends hours  hours going over potentially lethal special effects before finally performing them for us.Police Story 3 is a superior Chan product much better than his paperthin stories as of late although this could be down to the heavy Hollywood influence that perpetrates most of the latter films and IMHO he is worse off for it.PS3 is no different from his earlier films although on this occasion he has a more equally efficient lead in Michelle Yeoh as his Chinese army partner.Yeoh is a perfect foil for the extroverted yet dumb Chan. She screams screen presence and her beautiful face belies her hidden deadly martial arts skills. And more significantly she like Chan very rarely uses stuntdoubles. Best example is her jump onto a moving train while riding a motorcycle. Previously a stuntdouble tried to do this but failed ending up with a broken leg. But then Yeoh tried it and hey perfect jump!Together they bring a more spirited edge to a rather humdrum story of drug traffiking. Chan isn't allowed to wallow in his ego because Yeoh is never far behind to push him out the way. The buddy chemistry works surprisingly well perhaps because we have a woman who is truly independent and can definitely look after herself thank you very much.Chan does his usual stunts and his martial arts are good enough to get by with although he is becoming just a tad predictable with more  more extravagant stunts for every new film. Which goes back to my earlier argument that he should really concentrate on the more natural side of his art and push all these boring pyrotechnics into the corner and let the character drive the story rather than the action sequences.".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly this third installment is better than the previous two";
	schema:reviewBody "Third time is the charm for this franchise. The previous two movies is good but this one is better. Not only does it have a better storyline it has better action as well. This time Jackie Chan as a cop is going undercover in order to infiltrate a Chinese criminal organization. And it has some good action and slapstick humor along the way. Which is expected from Jackie Chan movies. It's just done really well in this one. Maggie Cheung is back again as MayJackie's girlfriend in the movie. And again she goes through getting put into another conflicting situation. She must really love the hero of this franchise Jackie. It just seems like she is constantly being used as a plot device to put the hero through one troublesome situation after another in this franchise. But at least she is incorporated into the plot somewhat instead of a girlfriend character that pops up once in a while for irrelevant reasons in movies. The relationship between the two reminded me of Mario and Princess Peach. To spice things up a bit Michelle Yeoh is in this as well and plays the partner in the undercover work with Jackie Chan. And she actually adds a lot to the film and her fighting and stunt works are just fantastic. This movie alone shows how great of a stuntwoman she really is and plus she is a actress. And highly entertaining to watch probably a bit more than Jackie in this case. Maybe it's because I enjoy the female lead kicking ass in movies. Also when it comes to the undercover work there is actually quite a bit of creativity and good humor behind it as well. In a lot of cases the third installment just isn't as good as the previous ones. But in this case the third installment is better...Well until the 4th installment. If your one of the audiences that liked the previous Police Story films there is a high chance you will enjoy this one. This is one of the best buddy cop movie I seen. Although it lacks in bonding development it backs it up with the chemistry between the two and the action sequences.7.910".

	onyx:emotionText "Third time is the charm for this franchise. The previous two movies is good but this one is better. Not only does it have a better storyline it has better action as well. This time Jackie Chan as a cop is going undercover in order to infiltrate a Chinese criminal organization. And it has some good action and slapstick humor along the way. Which is expected from Jackie Chan movies. It's just done really well in this one. Maggie Cheung is back again as MayJackie's girlfriend in the movie. And again she goes through getting put into another conflicting situation. She must really love the hero of this franchise Jackie. It just seems like she is constantly being used as a plot device to put the hero through one troublesome situation after another in this franchise. But at least she is incorporated into the plot somewhat instead of a girlfriend character that pops up once in a while for irrelevant reasons in movies. The relationship between the two reminded me of Mario and Princess Peach. To spice things up a bit Michelle Yeoh is in this as well and plays the partner in the undercover work with Jackie Chan. And she actually adds a lot to the film and her fighting and stunt works are just fantastic. This movie alone shows how great of a stuntwoman she really is and plus she is a actress. And highly entertaining to watch probably a bit more than Jackie in this case. Maybe it's because I enjoy the female lead kicking ass in movies. Also when it comes to the undercover work there is actually quite a bit of creativity and good humor behind it as well. In a lot of cases the third installment just isn't as good as the previous ones. But in this case the third installment is better...Well until the 4th installment. If your one of the audiences that liked the previous Police Story films there is a high chance you will enjoy this one. This is one of the best buddy cop movie I seen. Although it lacks in bonding development it backs it up with the chemistry between the two and the action sequences.7.910";

Can you think of a movie with a fight scene with so many protagonists? In that whole scene my favorite bit is when Chackie and Michelle are trying to hide by jumping through the window back into the meeting room and Michelle trips the stick holding open the shutter leaving Chackie to slam into and bounce off. Michell then pokes her head out and berates him for fooling around. One thing I also liked was that the film kept in a certain amount of comedy but enough to affect the film enough to make it an outright comedy. Also liked that first kick Michelle does as she jumps up and kicks two guys at once.".

This is a phenomenal action movie distinguished by fine cinematography of the spectacular sequences  and contains nice sense of humor as well as the previous entries. In this outing Jackie teamed up to prestigious actresses and good action stars in their own right  such as Maggie Cheung and Michelle Yeoh or Khan . The first version titled Police story1985 directed by the same Jackie Chan was a perfect action film for enthusiastic of the genre  the following was Police story 21988also pretty violent and with abundant humor touches.

It's probably the only movie Jackie Chan and Michelle Yeo stars together and two best talents in martial arts action movie teams up together to get the drug lord in mainland China. Covertly this is the most comical of all the Police Story series drama but has the most intense action as well. Interaction between Jackie and Michelle is so funny but when they get into the action scene I would dare to say that this is THE best action movie Hong Kong has ever produced.These guys were really Super Cops and it's one of the few movies from the early '90s that still doesn't look dated.Simply fantastic and highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is one detail which is not very common for Jackie Chan movies but which is present here. It has some very tough and serious atmosphere about it while the funny elements are present too. Jackie is menacing and psychotic here. He is not a hero who is attacked and only then fights back in a usual laidback pattern but he is the one who can go and start the tumult. His manner of hitting that evil guy in the glasses is amazing every time it goes crack!. Another highlight is the scene when Jackie goes to the pub and thrashes the villains who had fronted on his girlfriend. It's one of the best blitzkriegs put on screen. Besides the whole scene is shot with the background of some action character painted on the wall it also looks like a poster of rabochiy from the Soviet era and some lines in Russian on the left. That looks terrific and nostalgic for Russian people. I also like when the windows are being smashed in the movies. Here there's a lot of this stuff. It's quite amazing watching the characters fallingjumpingrunningdriving through all manner of panes.All three movies are great. There is no downslide in the quality  it's a perfect trilogy with sense and incredible stunts and not only Jackie Chan's character appears in all three movies  that's also excellent and keeps continuity up.Each movie can be described in a few words No.1  great in all aspects  it is one gripping story from the very beginning to the very end and funny many scenes are ridiculous No.2  raging Jackie is really off the hook here and painful Jackie gets tortured No.3  unbelievable the woman that fights alongside with Jackie is incredible and bombastic should a lot of guns and explosions be mentioned?.As to the rest  much has been mentioned by the others.It's a trilogy that can be watched over and over again at least by me. Its place is in top 10 among action jewels. Yes to me it is a trilogy. Further parts are of no interest while they simply cannot keep the same pace.A solid 10 out of 10. Thank you for attention.".

The film moves a little slower than you might expect but the story holds the attention and the last halfhour is incredible nonstop actionclimaxing with a terrific car stunt. The centrepiece is an underwater fight with martial arts moves. It somewhat degenerates into clowning but is never less than terrific to watch. A shame that Chan injured himself and therefore as with Rumble In The Bronxcould not have a final battlebut never mind.Hugely enjoyable thenwith Chan obviously aware of the Bondisms and having fun doing them his way he even complains that he is missing the gorgeous girls at one point. Sadly the Western cinema release is cut by around 20 minutes. The plot is harder to follow and worst of allsome of the action is cutincluding some great moments from the underwater battle. The original Hong Kong version is superior in every way and it remains a great shame that New Line and Miramax see fit to chop up all the nonAmerican Chan films they release.

Jackie plays Jackie and he plays this character very well. The ladder battle is one of the best fights I have seen in a long while. Obviously you dont have to see the Police Story movies in order because they released them all out of order going something like 3 4 1 2. I recommend seeing them 4 1 3 2. This one is the best and you should check it out right away!".

	schema:headline " A nice introduction to Jackie Chan";
	schema:reviewBody "If you've never seen a Jackie Chan film before this is a good place to start. I speak from experience for it is the first film of his that I saw. I must warn you though his films are not for everyone. The plots are often pedestrian and sometimes incoherent. They also are usually dubbed making them seem cheesy. Sometimes I describe him to people as a guilty pleasure but that may give the wrong impression. What Chan does well is sheer genius. Plot is besides the point. It's not what his films are about.What then are they about? It's hard to put into words. You may have heard him described as a martial artist a stuntman and a slapstick comedian. None of those descriptions do him justice. I could add that he's something of an acrobat and gymnast but even that doesn't sum it up. There is no actor he can be compared to for his style is unique it's like he's developed his own art form. These are not fighting films in a traditional sense. They're more like the types of acts you might see at a circus involving props used in astonishing ways and depending on careful choreography and exquisite timing. For example at one point in this film Chan flips and twirls a heavy stepladder like it was a baton then sets it down and weaves his own body through the rungs while fending off attacks from a group of men.Typically in his films the acts he performs get increasingly formidable as the film progresses culminating in some largescale stunt such as him leaping off a building. But even the little things he does are eyepopping. In this film he's constantly climbing walls with an agility reminiscent of Donald O'Connor. You never know what to expect for he does different things in each film.Well at least that once was the case. Since Rush Hour his 1998 American blockbuster his stunts have become less intricate and he's begun repeating ideas. It may be that he's getting older but it also may be that he's moved from Hong Kong to Hollywood. Undoubtedly the recent films have more polish and better production values which has helped make them accessible to a wider audience. But his earlier work is so full of invention that I'm able to overlook formula plots bad acting and cheesy humor. I do have my limits. A few of his filmsThe Protector comes to mindare so badly done that it doesn't matter that they have cool fight sequences. His films need some measure of competence to work. They are more than a series of routines strung together.Part of what makes them charming is Chan himself. He is a pretty solid actor compared to some of the leading American action stars capable of conveying a full range of emotions convincingly. He is particularly good at expressing panic. The character he plays is not your standard toughguy. He is frequently an inferior fighter to those he confronts. When hit he grimaces in pain. When faced with the opportunity he runs. He survives by a mixture of quick wits and luck. He is far more a throwback to Keaton and Chaplin than a martial arts master.Of course I won't call this film or any other by Chan a masterpiece. Perhaps I'm too conventional. If the purpose of films is to entertain his succeed brilliantly. Whether they appeal to you depends on your taste but one thing you cannot do is claim he's untalented. It may not be a talent you're used to but it's one that's likely to remain unparalleled.".

In order to broaden the star's appeal with the Western market this one has a much more international flavour than many of his earlier films with the action skipping round the globe from Hong Kong to Ukraine to Russia and finally to Australia. The film is also less focused on pure martial arts mayhem with more in the way of straight forward Hollywood style stuntfilled action but when the kung fu does happen it is extremely well handled with Jackie displaying his usual athleticism impeccable timing and flair for physical comedy.The rather messy plot and occasionally slow pacing prevents First Strike from being a bona fide Chan classic but there is still plenty of inventive stuff to make this one a whole lot of fun best bits being a wonderful fight scene in which Chan uses a stepladder as a weapon an exhilarating ski chase down a mountain some underwater shenanigans with sharks and a scrap with two Russian manmountains that involves Chan making a vertiginous leap onto a narrow ledge of a highrise building.".

Thanks largely to the presence of Chan the storyline is pulled off relatively successfully. The ski stunts are impressive and also humorous  but poor Jackie  he really is wearing a couple of layers' clothing! The Australian action sequences are well choreographed and have a sense of occasion. The action is better paced it is not kungfu for kungfu's sake although if you want realism in your stories look elsewhere. As an individual Chan film it works  but it does not deserve being part of the Police Story series which it was in Hong Kong. The Chinese style is watered down in pursuit of the western markets  and the producers would have been better off creating a new character for Chan this time. Compared to the first and third instalments it is lacking. This aside it is entertaining and enjoyable whether you see the original or dubbed version.".

Chan Ka Kui travelling from Hong Kong to The Ukraine to Russia and finally to Australia in pursuit of stolen nuclear material. In the English dubbed version of the film that I saw this character has been renamed Jackie. During the course of the film he will have to fight with heavily armed men in the frozen mountains of The Ukraine clamber around on the outside of a tall hotel while evading two Russian thugs fight off a huge gang using a step ladder as a weapon and fight more Russians in an aquarium which also contains a deadly shark! He must also work out who he can trust as not everybody is quite what they seem.This film doesn't have quite as much action as the other films in the series that I've seen but what there was was pretty good and it was clear that the budget was much higher as the action was far more explosive involving the sort of skiing stunts and exploding helicopters one would expect in a Hollywood movie in fact if it wasn't for the rather obvious dubbing I might have thought it was a Hollywood movie. Jackie Chan does a great job in the lead role providing the fantastic mix of action and comedy that fans have come to expect. The supporting cast were very much secondary to Jackie Chan but seemed to do a reasonably job not hearing the actors actual voices does of course make it hard to judge them fairly. The plot may seem like something out of a Bond film but this is no rip off you'd never see Bond shivering in the cold or wearing 'koala undies'! If you like comedy action this is well worth seeing and as there is little to offend it is probably suitable for younger viewers too.".

He must also work out who he can trust as not everybody is quite what they seem.This film doesn't have quite as much action as the other films in the series that I've seen but what there was was pretty good and it was clear that the budget was much higher as the action was far more explosive involving the sort of skiing stunts and exploding helicopters one would expect in a Hollywood movie in fact if it wasn't for the rather obvious dubbing I might have thought it was a Hollywood movie. Jackie Chan does a great job in the lead role providing the fantastic mix of action and comedy that fans have come to expect. The supporting cast were very much secondary to Jackie Chan but seemed to do a reasonably job not hearing the actors actual voices does of course make it hard to judge them fairly. The plot may seem like something out of a Bond film but this is no rip off you'd never see Bond shivering in the cold or wearing 'koala undies'! If you like comedy action this is well worth seeing and as there is little to offend it is probably suitable for younger viewers too.";

Chan is obviously a good character it is odd that he has to dub himself in a few scenes many of the other actors are out of sync the story is not the most engaging ever in fact I lost track of what was going on but there are some inventive fight sequences with Chan's cool stunt work but apart from that I wouldn't really bother with this action thriller.

	schema:reviewBody "First Strike 1996 Dir Stanley Tong  Cast Jackie Chan Jackson Lou Jouri Petrow Bill Tung Wu Chenchun This film eventually strikes out big time with its horrible dubbing but its first strike is its numerous martial arts sequences that seem to be chain linked. Jackie Chan stars as an agent sent to follow a woman. He discovers that the villains wish to steal a missile off of a warhead. This all occurs during a visit to the Ukraine which isn't exactly his best bet for a vacation site since he nearly loses his life more times than a cat. Director Stanley Tong knows how to present the action and he is backed with fine winter location sites but finding a script worth the time is his problem. Chan is subdued to bad dubbing and at one point held at gun point where his clothes are demanded leaving him in his underwear with only a car door to shield himself. Unfortunately he had nothing to shield himself from the lame writing. He is skilled and creative with these stunts adding an innocent sense of humour but it is all show and little substance. His costars are not exactly hand picked by the Academy Award voters either. Among them are Jackson Lou Jouri Petrow Wu Chenchun and Bill Tung and none of them are going out of their way to give a convincing performance. Conclusion includes bloopers and outtakes but the entire film pretty much sums that up. Score 2  10".

Plenty of comic relief as always and one unbelievable stunt after another make this one of Jackie's best films ever I think.

However what this film lacks in plot it more than makes up for in action.When it comes to action Chan does it better than anyone else in the world. Jackie Chan made classic pure martial arts films in his youth and moved on to action films as he got older. First Strike like Super Cop or Operation Condor is more of an action movie than a pure martial arts movie. First Strike is heavy on stunts and shootouts and explosions and light on martial arts. There are only a few scenes with real Jackie Chan fight sequences which are outstanding. In First Strike you see Jackie ski swim with sharks climb walls walk on stilts ramp cars... It is all well done and fun to watch and puts American action stars to shame. There are plenty of comical moments in the movie which Jackie always does well.If you're looking for a great Jackie Chan pure martial arts film this is not one of them though it does serve as a good introduction to the world of Chan. If you are a big fan of action and adventure films or you are a die hard Jackie fan you will enjoy First Strike. If your looking for a classic Chan film check out Drunken Master The Legend of Drunken Master Project A Police Story or Snake in the Eagle's Shadow. First Strike is a fun and entertaining action film but is light on the ground breaking fight scenes that made Chan a superstar. Action Rating 910Martial Arts Rating 510Over All Movie Rating 6.510".

	schema:reviewBody "This instalment of Jackie's POLICE STORY series doesn't have much connection to the previous episodes other than the welcome return of a cameoing Bill Tung playing Jackie's superior Uncle Bill. Instead this is more of a James Bondstyle tale of international espionage the hunt for a missing nuclear warhead warring factions and of course plenty of Jackie's unique style of action namely martial arts mayhem. As with most of Jackie's films from the 1990s the emphasis is on nonstop stunts chases and action mixed in with a fast placed plot and a couple of HUGE bad guys action cinema veteran Nathan Jones lurking around for good measure. Critics will always complain about elements of Chan's movies whether it be the acting or the storyline but rest assured that this is solid entertainment all the way which  whilst not quite up to the previous three movies  certainly packs a punch in terms of action and is at least as exciting if not more so than the latest Hollywood blockbuster.So my recommendation is to sit back ignore all the doublecrossing agents and confusing back story of the film and instead enjoy the endless action which just gets better and better as the film progresses. Beginning with some action on the skislopes of the Ukraine for a change the film offers lots of adventures in international locations. Jackie is chased by henchmen at the top of a tower block jumps on to a helicopter from a cliff and falls into a freezing cold lake. Then there's the major martial arts fight halfway through in which he takes on a gang of henchmen using all kind of furniture as weapons culminating in his ultimate use of a step ladder to repel the enemy! My favourite moments include the assault on the carnival parade and the ensuing hijinks and the awesome climax which offers tons of the usual kung fu action all taking place underwater in a sharkinfested tank! Plus things are rounded off with the usual stunt work and Jackie being as cool as ever. Not one of THE classic Chan films but very entertaining smooth and recommended viewing for action lovers everywhere.".

However he just happens to notice something peculiar and out of instinct follows the same suspect to an isolated location. When he calls in he is asked to continue surveillance. Things then take an immediate turn for the worse after this. Now rather than reveal anything else I will just say that this particular film was neither better nor worse than the other three Police Story movies. If anything I suppose that the humor was probably more noticeable but the action wasn't quite as intense. Still Jackie Chan was as sensational as ever and he once again demonstrates that he is in a class of his own. In any case while I didn't think this movie was the best in the series I certainly think it's worth a watch for those who might enjoy an actioncomedy of this type. Slightly above average.".

Today I'll be judging First Strike a film starring Chan that I got from a flea market a little while back.As usual the film is a martial arts film that doesn't take itself very seriously resulting in some ridiculously entertaining moments. It's funny and offers plenty of kickass fight scenes.Dialogue is very well written and executed. The plot isn't very great merely serviceable. My biggest problem is that the movie is a bit short. Most movies are at least 90 minutes long which is a good run time. This one's barely over 70 minutes not counting bloopers. However it's well paced and exciting enough that this still is a minor gripe to me. The acting isn't very great outside of Chan. Same thing for the characters. Besides Jackie Chan's he plays himself btw I either didn't care about any of them or I hated them. Some characters have little point and just feel ignored.It feels disjointed at times but it's still incredibly fun and I enjoyed every minute of it. Jackie Chan's First Strike gets an 8.510. It's what I want from a Jackie Chan film. But the short run time acting characters and plot keep it from a higher score.".

This leads Jackie all over the globe starting with Tsui's sister in Australia. The story follows him as he tries to stay alive and capture the villain. This is an unrelated sequel to Police Story. It's the weakest of the lot but as far as action goes it delivers in a big way. Let me tell you something right from the outset. Forget about a solid storyline its not gonna happen. It's very thin plotwise and relies on big action sequences. The dubbing is atrocious and the villains are so poor that they are hardly even noticeable despite a few twists and turns during this movie. Between the opening action sequence involving some snowboarding or some incredible stunt sequences by Jackie on a high building and the amazing sequence involving Jackie and a ladder this movie is quite a thrill ride when the action sequences commence. Jackie Chan is reliable as ever. He doesn't have a whole lot to act with but he has charisma in spades. His character shows some decent emotion at times as well. This was one of Jackie's breakout his in the USA. The rest of the actors are poorly dubbed so it's hard to really say how they did. I also liked the well timed comedic sequences. Jackie knows how to combine action  comedy with the best of them. This is far from Jackie's best hell. It's not even the best in the Police Story series in fact it's the worst. But that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable because it is. Watch it for the action and just have fun6.410".

I am very glad that I went this year because this was one of the most enjoyable experiences I had at the theatre in some time.The Double Hour was billed as a surreal thriller so I was expecting something Lynchian. However this film does not leave any loose ends. Any confusing parts come to a satisfying conclusion and there are plenty of clues along the way that allow you to piece the story together.I also enjoyed how it is two movies in one in a way. One is a scary bewildering psychological thriller and it is contained within an interconnected arc that is part crime drama and part character exploration made rich by the wellwritten and wellacted characters.Standing out obviously is the main character Sonia. She is a very attractive lead both physically and as a performer and carries the movie effectively.The direction of this film is intelligent and fastpaced. Quick cuts are used to jarring effect and a slightly shaky handheld feeling creates a great deal of tension. Overall I would recommend this film for fans of European movies mysteries thrillers and psychological dramas. It is very solid put together well and will leave you sated.".

The two meet at a speeddating event and just as they are beginning to fall in love a crime happens and their relationship is cut short.But before that during their first date Guido looks at his watch which marks 2323 and he tells Sonia that it's a double hour and that she should make a wish.

And it's details such as this one that you need to pay attention to because every one of them is important to decipher this riveting puzzler that won't let you get too comfortable in your seat.Acted to perfection by Ksenia Rappoport and Filippo Timi The Double Hour is making its way quietly now through arthouse theaters in the United States.

Love blossoms for these two until the story takes a very dark turn.

I really enjoyed the first two acts of the movie but felt letdown a bit by the final act. Some of the visuals are very good but the wrap up is just a bit disappointing. Still the first 80 minutes or so are terrific and make the film worth watching.".

I don't know who their competitors were but Filippo Timi and Kseniya Rappoport earned their best acting awards at the Venice Film Festival as did the director Giuseppe Capotondi. Did they miss the deadline for submission into other film competitions? Did they forget to sign the forms? I can't understand why it didn't enter and win more accolades. It could have been an Oscar contender for foreign language film it is that good.";

His pacing editing camera angles and most importantly his script kept logic intact while entertaining and building suspense. There were always concluding set pieces that became memorable parts of cinema history a chase on Mount Rushmore a runaway carousel a fight aboard a high speed train an attack of starkraving mad ravens. As I sat watching the Italian import The Double Hour my thoughts yearned for his deft director's touch on this film's intriguing premise.Directed by newcomer Giuseppe Capotondi the film stars Kseniya Rappoport as Sonya and Flippo Timi as Guido two lonely sorts who meet at a speed dating seminar. She works as a hotel maid and he is an excop turned security guard and both sense a real instant connection there. That's the beginning of a complex labyrinth that held my complete interest for about threefourth of the film's length.This offbeat thriller that becomes more ominous and intriguing every second with plot twists and startling reveals in its intricate plotting. There are twists galore some minor some major and I enjoyed the conceit of the filmmaker in toying with his audience.Now I love a good mystery and this is one that is up until the last few minutes when the mystery unravels and so does all reasoning. Actions are so out of character with Sonya and Guido's arc that the film defies rationality. Incidents that occur in the beginning of the film become random thoughts and really have no bearing in the mazelike structure of the story. The final shot made little sense to me when trying to decode the scheme of events prior to that ending leaving me with a bitter taste of regret.  Plus no memorable set piece is on display when one could have been added in the airport scene to full effect.The movie tagline for The Double Hour reads as follows A Romance. A Robbery. A Mystery. All that is true and for the most of the time the film does successfully involve the moviegoer. But unfortunately the film ultimately disappoints in the last half hour of the film when all the logic gives way to a very unsatisfying ending.Sadly I felt doublecrossed and cheated when the end credits rolled. Yes Alfred would have ironed out all the plot kinks before filming this exasperating thriller. Why have your audience invest their time and emotions in all of the film's intricacies when your overly convoluted plot becomes the major obstacle to the mystery itself. The Double Hour is second rate Hitchcock at best. GRADE BNOTE Visit my movie blog for more reviews www.dearmoviegoer.com".

In fact I suspect that the very last shot of the movie is a clin d'oeil to the last shot of Polanski's Repulsion. That shot is also similar to the end of Kubrick's The Shining but the schizophrenic perspective on reality in The Double Hour is certainly closer to earlyPolanski than Kubrick.So this is not a cheap thriller. Many times I could feel my heart pounding and I covered my neck with my jacket. The entire movie is well worth seeing just for those common suspenseful scenes. The acting is also good mainly because the characters are believable and fun to watch for example there is a Colombotype cop that I was always happy to see coming back.My only disappointment with The Double Hour is with the very last shot. The movie was ending in a simple way a bit like Woody Allen's Match Point but then the last shot appears and we start doubting over the whole thing was Rosemary paranoid or did she really give birth to the devil? Overall a good movie that I would recommend. I would give 9 or 1010 to the early Polanski movies The Shining or other suspense movies like The Orphanage. This one had many weak scenes and the ending was a bit adolescent. Nevertheless a good flick.".

She actually does meet the interesting but remote Guido and the two strangers become two lovebirds. When Guido takes her up to his house in the forest to show her his work as a security agent the house he's watching gets mugged. Both he and Sofia get shot and from then on strange things start to happen. In Sofia's surroundings people are committing suidice by the dozen and she starts to lose her mind. Guido the only she trusts is dead or isn't he? La doppia ora is a smart psychological thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat for 95 minutes. The camera angles in the scenes are just a little bit different than normal and the overall sounds are well applied. The acting is good and very natural. This all together makes La doppia ora a terrific foreign flick. I'm excited to see more of award winning director Giuseppe Capotondi. Italy scores!".

Overpowering Guido and Sonia the man in charge makes a move which indicates he recognizes her. When a shot is fired Guido is killed and the bullet graces Sonia's forehead. La doppia ora directed by Giuseppe Capotondi is not an easy film to sit through because it demands the viewer's full attention. This Italian film who was a favorite in the Venice film festival deserves a second viewing in order to get all the clues that are so subtly placed within the narrative. The screenplay was a collaboration between Alessandro Fabri Ludovica Rampoldi and Stefano Sardo. Much of the confusion a casual viewer will experiment stems from what is in Sonia's mind after she falls into a comalike state at the hospital. As she visits Guido's grave there is a funeral taking place in which a priest looks at the passing Sonia as though recognizing her and later on turning up again in her neighborhood and on another occasion. The screenplay mixes genres. Clarity was not in the mind of the writers or in Mr. Capotondi while the film was being shot. It is a film that relies more on the different styles to create the thriller atmosphere.Ksenia Rappoport the Russian actress makes an excellent impression of her Sonia. She never disappoints as the mystery surrounding her makes her contribution to the film more exciting. Handsome Filippo Timi is wonderful as Guido. There is good chemistry between the two stars to create the passion and suspense that keeps this film going. Tad Ratcliffe's photography is right on target as well as Pasquale Catalano's musical score. Giuseppe Capotondi's film debut impresses.".

This is great example.This film has some extremely positive qualities. The acting is rather strong from what will most likely be complete unknownsto American audiences anyway  even though the lead male looks exactly like Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Javier Bardem... and his acting chops don't suffer much like you might expect given the comparison physically either... even though let's be honest nobody stands up well to Bardem.The DOuble Hour also has as many twists as the top of a coathanger and the audience is likely to guess and likely to be wrong on almost all of them. In hindsite the twists actually make decent sense and add a nice depth and intrigue postviewing.Another impressive quality was in some of the cinematography and sound that really added to the thrilling nature of the film. I don't think it's spoiling much because these are just subtle tricks that some of the filmmakers incorporated  so I'll mention a few.There's one moment where a character feels like someone is watching over them and there's just a sliver of color down the left bottom corner of the screen and only for a splitsecond  it's a really welldone shot.Another 'similar' scene is showing the same character in a similar position in bed suffering the same phobia picturingdreaming themselves alone and then with their partner backandforth and one quick shot in the middle of the character being shown alonein one of the quick flashes incorporates three hands near her face and it is also an extremely nice touch. Just another that kindof separates this from your slightly above average foreign thriller.Yet another occurs in a bathtub and that scene has nice visualsalthough they've been done before in similar scenes AND each of these three shots uses some nice audio tricks.I'll compare this to another foreign thriller that I watched on the same day in case you've seen it. I also ranked the Hidden Face a 767100 but I would say the Double Hour here is about as strong of a 774.4100 as possible. This is a clear notch above even though they score the same on IMDb for me.Given the number one reason the film will get subpar ratings is the genrebending nature of the story and the unlikable characters themselves  the film actually covers it's bases quite well and their actions fit their characters backstory toatea. There's little to no problems with plausibilityor the ending here but people don't like to be wrong.I'd assume that will be the number one criticism of this film and I believe it to be unjustified. This film has quite literally grown on me every hour since viewing it.Recommended.You'll like this if you liked Headhuntersbetter The Hidden Facenot as good or Point Blanknot as good.Thanks for reading.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE DOUBLE HOUR LA DOPPIA ORA is a maze of a film one of those films that seem to have a straightforward storyline until suddenly what has been happening in front of our eyes is not at all the real story. The script by Alessandro Fabbri Ludovica Rampoldi and Stefano Sardo is smart clever in a Hitchcockian wayand succeeds in keeping us on the periphery of a fascinating tale. This is Giuseppe Capotondi's first film as a director and it gives notice of a new talent on the horizon.The setting is Turin. Sonia gifted and stunningly beautiful Russian actress Kseniya Rappoport works as a chambermaid in an elegant hotel and in the opening scene she witnesses the suicide of the woman whose room she is cleaning. Apparently distraught by the incident she seeks refuge in a speed dating club run by the mysterious Marisa Lucia Poli who watches carefully as Sonia encounters the club's most frequent attendee former cop Guido Filippo Timi. Both Sonia and Guido are cautious about involvement but eventually they leave Turin for a country weekend getaway. Guido is serving as a security guard for a wealthy Italian but the house is empty and Guido turns off the security system. While the two are having an amorous tryst the house is invaded by thieves who steal everything and shoot Guido grazing Sonia with a bullet. Events occur that are not as they seem and Sonia's strange past is relived before our eyes  or is what we are seeing the effects of Sonia being in a coma after the shooting? To say more would be to deprive the viewer of the very strange twists and turns this story takes until the final few minutes of the film when the audience realizes they have been part of the charade.Kseniya Rappoport won the Best Actress award in the 2009 Venice Film Festival for the complex and multifaceted performance she offers in this film. The supporting cast is excellent with Filippo Timi being particularly talented in holding together an impossible to believe character study. The musical score by Pasquale Catalano and the cinematography by Tat Radcliffe add immeasurably to the film. For those who appreciate challenging plots and superb writing this film will surely satisfy. Grady Harp".

I do not want to give too much of the plot away because a certain level of secrecy is necessary to enjoy it instead of waiting for preplanned twists. After seeing this film I read the reviews of particular critics and most of them kept the secrets that is except for Stephen Holden of the New York Times. If you read his review before seeing The Double Hour there would be absolutely no need to sit through it because he gives the entire thing away the jig is up.Sonia is a hotel chambermaid in Turin Italy. She is routinely morose most likely from something in her past and the fact that she is strikingly lonely. To help her find a friend or more she tries speed dating and is strikes up a friendship with Guido an excop who is still trying to define his widower status three years after the fact. Sonia and Guido take baby steps towards the semblance of a relationship until their lives are drastically altered during a robbery. This is where my plot description stops. Revealing too much of a film noir thriller does nothing for the eventual audience except take away their guessing games during the film.The couple's relationship and their back and forth interactions are surprisingly effective. Both actors playing Sonia and Guido received best acting honors at the Venice Film Festival but the somewhat noncongruous film and choppy supernatural elements do not match their acting standard. The director and screenwriters show a lot of future promise but the Double Hour just misses the mark. To explain the title a double hour is particular time of day when the clock matches such as 1212. It is said that wishes sometime come true at a double hour.".

Revealing too much of a film noir thriller does nothing for the eventual audience except take away their guessing games during the film.The couple's relationship and their back and forth interactions are surprisingly effective. Both actors playing Sonia and Guido received best acting honors at the Venice Film Festival but the somewhat noncongruous film and choppy supernatural elements do not match their acting standard. The director and screenwriters show a lot of future promise but the Double Hour just misses the mark. To explain the title a double hour is particular time of day when the clock matches such as 1212. It is said that wishes sometime come true at a double hour.";

	schema:reviewBody "MGM pulled out all the stops for this 1948 version of The Three Musketeers. Filmed in color and directed by George Sidney it has a large allstar cast consisting of Gene Kelly Lana Turner June Allyson Van Heflin Cornell Wilde Vincent Price Angela Lansbury Robert Coote Frank Morgan Keenan Wynn and John Sutton. Gene Kelly is D'Artagnan who arrives to join the Musketeers and ends up having to fight three duels in a day with Athos Heflin Porthos Young and Aramis Coote. They all wind up friends.The Musketeers' first assignment is to steal the Queen's jewels back for her  a gift of twelve diamond studs from her husband Morgan. She has given them to her lover the Duke of Buckingham but now needs them back to wear in nine days' time. Cardinal Richlieu Price anxious to reveal the secret relationship between the two dispatches his evil mistress Lady De Winter Turner to steal two of the studs. Richlieu wants France to declare war against England and completely destroy the King's powers.The Musketeers have to get the jewels from the Duke and return with them to Paris. With two diamond studs missing they have an added task of picking up two replacements from a jeweler and getting them to the Queen in time to wear them at a banquet. In the process of all of this D'Artagnan falls in love with the Queen's ladyinwaiting Constance Allyson.All of the acting is wonderful with the role of Lady De Winter expanded from the original book. Lana Turner is perfect as De Winter  gorgeous cool irresistible and deadly. The scenes between Constance and De Winter toward the end of the film are among the best in the movie very suspenseful and different from the book. Turner to me looks carefully made up to hide some extra pounds not to mention being tightly corsetted. The movie was filmed right after Lana had broken up with the great love of her life Tyrone Power which may have had something to do with it.Van Heflin is sympathetic and strong as Athos who has a past with De Winter and still loves her and Vincent Price makes an excellent Cardinal Richlieu. Gene Kelly is the ideal D'Artagnan and his casting is very clever giving him a chance to show the great athleticism that contributed so much to his dancing. His swordplay is amazing really making the swordfights entertaining. Though the role has very serious moments Kelly gives it a lightness and humor when needed. Especially fun is the scene where D'Artagnan in the dark poses as Lady De Winter's lover.There are as mentioned many versions of this Dumas classic. This one is vividly entertaining colorful and energetic with a very attractive cast good direction and a thrilling score. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being only 20 years old it may be strange for me to have a favourite actor who's era of greatness was that of the mid 20th century.  However the 1948 version of Dumas' 'Three Musketeers' continues to remain one of my favourite movies especially with the enigmatic performance of Gene Kelly being at the forefront.The story follows the journey of a young Gascon named D'artagnan who endeavours to become one of King Louis XIV I think musketeers.  I must point out that at this point I always thought that there were only EVER three musketeers.  However I soon realised that the three charcters at the focus of the story are but three of a large cadre of the aforementioned individuals.The reason I liked this movie was not for its intriguing story but for the sword fights.  The only other movie where I have seen sword fighting of such a skillful measure is that of the duel between Mandy Patinkin and Cary Elwes in 'The Princess Bride'.  Even the newer version of 'The Man in the Iron Mask' and the pitifully woeful version of the 'Three Musketeers' starring Kiefer Sutherland fail to master that sleek elegance and skill that is evident in the Gene Kelly version rather they resort to a series of hard whacks and punches to achieve their aim.Even though several of the death scenes involve the swords clearly being passed under armits and next to hips similar to one of my favourite scenes in Cy Enfield's 'Zulu' where Hook a soldier stabs a Zulu with a bayonet under his armpit and we are witness to a clear indent in the wall this movie remains one of the better versions of Dumas's novel.I give it 8.5 out of 10James Durham".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly successful Dumas rewrite";
	schema:reviewBody "The true test of a filmed version of a famous novel is not how close the action is to the plot of the book  it's whether it's faithful to the spirit of the original and above all whether it works. I didn't think casting Gene Kelly as a nonsinging nondancing D'Artagnan would work it does. I didn't think censoring the religious references to suit the US market would work  it does. I didn't think this could possibly rival the 1974 LesterMacdonald Fraser version... well I'm still not sure about that one but it's an unexpectedly close call.Without any question the outstanding performance in this film is that of Gene Kelly. His athleticism unsurprisingly is marvellous his swordplay is dazzling  but most importantly as an actor his characterization of the impetuous susceptible hotheaded but goodhearted young Gascon is spot on the mark. He plays the part with a humour and charm that leave us likewise loving and laughing in his wake and the only character with a chance of upstaging him is that truly preposterous yellow horse... a piece of typecasting if ever I saw one!Perhaps the most disappointing performance in contrast is Van Heflin as Athos the highminded musketeer who drinks to find oblivion from a dark secret in his past. This Athos is a sullen peasant rather than a tragic nobleman perhaps because the scriptwriters chose to demote him from Comte to Baron de la Fere. He has none of the charisma that should have been brought to the part and it's often hard to understand why his three companions put up with him.The fight scenes are excellently staged as is to be expected in a precursor of 'Scaramouche' but I personally did feel that they went on for a little too long. Likewise Anne of Austria was wonderfully imperious but not as beautiful as the legend would have her. Constance Bonancieux by contrast gets a much larger part in this version than in Dumas' novel  and a somewhat less sleazy relationship with the young lodger  and makes the most of it.The pivotal change in the plot during Milady's stay in England features Constance to a large extent and is in my opinion actually very effective. The fact that even those of us who know the source material inside out have no idea how the inevitable is going to happen increases the tension enormously and the change of emphasis to the relationship between the two women rather than the seductive act we have seen several times before gives both actresses a fresh chance to shine.Richelieu shorn of his Cardinal's title to avoid Church offence has relatively little to do in this version and D'Artagnan's nemesis Rochefort barely appears at all though both actors make the most of what screen time they have. There is an effective scene at the end again owing nothing to Dumas where Richelieu reminds the King of his dominion as the power behind the throne only to save face in a graceful manoeuvre as Louis XIII temporarily asserts himself we are quite certain that the King will soon be back under his thumb.Overall I was very impressed by the way in which this film captured the roistering sometimes raucous sometimes melodramatic spirit of its source material. Reading other people's comments about the silent version starring Douglas Fairbanks I only wish I were likely to get the chance to see that as well!".

	schema:headline " Intelligent Version of Dumas's Classic Adventure starring Heflin Price  Kelly";
	schema:reviewBody "The Three Musketeers is unarguably an adventure film of great physical beauty and quite a bit of narrative power. It stands just after The Best Years of Our lives as one of the first Technicolor A films that broadened the palette used by filmmakers to include richness as well as say western or Arabian settings in adventure movies. To director George Sidney goes much of the credit for the film's swiftness of pace and attractive visual elements. With cinematography by Robert Planck art direction by Malcolm Brown and the great Cedric Gibbons elaborate set decorations by Edwin B Willis and Henry Grace and costumes by legendary Walter Plunkett the film moves from rustic scenes to sumptuous interiors via scenes of swordplay that are often stunning. Add makeup by Jack Dawn hair designs by Larry Germain and Sydney Guilaroff sound by Douglas Shearer and Herbert Stothart's original music and use of Tschaikovsy themesand the result I suggest is a quite satisfying viewing experience. But the plot has something more perhaps as well. The original Alexandre Dumas's the father storyline as treated by Robert Ardrey's screenplay comes out as an intelligent but somewhat satiricalcynical look at life in the France of the time of Cardinal Richelieu and King Louis XIII. In adopting an objective lighthearted tone similar to that in North By Northwest' the producer Pandro S. Berman and the writers gain for the film the ability to do memorable comedy as well as occasionally farmoreserious scenes. What is lost in concentrated dramatic power is made up fin such an adventure if the actors are able to invest its goings on with the seriousness of their taking it seriously bringing it to life professionally. I suggest that in the lavish production this level of artistry was almost everywhere achieved. The large cast features such attractive artists as Angela Lansbury as the Queen John Sutton as Buckingham June Allyson verywellused as Constance Robert Warwick as D'Artagnan's father Keenan Wynn as Planchet the servant Reginald Owen and Ian Keith Patricia Medina and Richard Wyler. In featured roles one can enjoy stellar work by Robert Coote as Aramis Gig Young as Porthos Frank Morgan as the King and Gene Kelly as an athletic and often lyrical D'Artagnan. But the acting honors in the film belong to actor worthies Van Helfin who dominates in the role of the harddrinking Athos and Vincent Price who makes immense amounts out of what he is allowed to do as an understated Richelieu. The curious casting is that of attractive Lana Turner as Lady De Winter she is not capable yet of classical work but she suggests some of her part's potential depths. This famous story of the young Gascon joining the three best swordsmen in France and learning more about life than he had bargained for is here given as much power perhaps as it can handle and rich scenes of sword battles interpersonal misunderstandings and a sense of controlled importance makes I suggest the story's dark moments memorable and the fun more important than it might have been. I find this to be a masterly understatement of a truly classic adventure.".

But the acting honors in the film belong to actor worthies Van Helfin who dominates in the role of the harddrinking Athos and Vincent Price who makes immense amounts out of what he is allowed to do as an understated Richelieu. The curious casting is that of attractive Lana Turner as Lady De Winter she is not capable yet of classical work but she suggests some of her part's potential depths. This famous story of the young Gascon joining the three best swordsmen in France and learning more about life than he had bargained for is here given as much power perhaps as it can handle and rich scenes of sword battles interpersonal misunderstandings and a sense of controlled importance makes I suggest the story's dark moments memorable and the fun more important than it might have been. I find this to be a masterly understatement of a truly classic adventure.";

The Musketeers themselves are hugely appealing characters drinking brawling romancing much of the time but fiercely loyal and devoting their lives to their king. This 1948 is perhaps the best version and there are many versions. The 1993 Disney version with Charlie Sheen and Keifer Sutherland and the 1973 version with Oliver Reed and Michael York both entertain but this version has the spirit of fun and wonder that only golden age Hollywood can supply. The actors don't just act the entertain. Gene Kelly shines. The action is dynamic spectacular and outshines every other musketeer movie. The visuals are bold and colourful. The script is witty captures the slightly whimsical boisterous approach of Dumas without the slapstick of the Lester movies.Simply one of the most entertaining movies you will ever see.".

The four find themselves up to their feather plumes in intrigue romance and action. Madame de Winter Lana Turner is a treacherous murderer. Constance June Allyson is a virginal Queen's maid. The King is supposed to rule France but Richelieu Vincent Price is the eminence rouge behind the throne  nasty powerhungry and manipulative. Both ladies are killed but France is saved from somethingorother and the four musketeers get what they want.I managed to follow the business about the diamond studs well enough I think but I got lost later on. There's never much doubt about who is good and who is evil though. Richelieu by this time was a Cardinal in the Catholic church but he's identified only as a politician  I guess for obvious reasons. He's obviously on the bad side because he wants to go to war. It must be the Thirty Years War. I've forgotten whatever I learned in high school about the Thirty Years War. It had to do with Catholics against Protestants and turned political over time and there was a great deal of suffering among innocent people. That's all I know. I'm only happy it wasn't the HUNDRED Years War because I remember even less about that one.The first half of the film is sort of fun in a familyoriented way. This is MGM in its hay day. Gene Kelly overacts outrageously as he did during the send up of silent movies in Singin' in the Rain but it somehow seems appropriate since everybody seems full of ham. And of course it's always exhilarating to see Kelly jumping from roof to roof swinging on ropes and fighting with furniture during sword play. He didn't do his own stunts on horseback though. He couldn't ride well there having been so few chances to gallop a horse through Pittsburgh Pennsylvania when he was growing up there. Aramis and Porthos have little to do or say in the film. Only Athos has pathos. Van Heflin's role is mostly dramatic and he handles it well. Lana Turner's wicked charm has always eluded me. And June Allyson is no Queen's Maid. She's Jimmy Stewart's devoted and patient wife. The part would have suited her well if the film had been turned into a musical  The Dueling Cavalier maybe.The costumes will coagulate your eyeballs. The plumes the flowing capes the floppy boots and hats. And what colors! From Chinese red through chartreuse to powder blue.Kids will enjoy the first half especially since it's mostly constructed of fights horse play and wisecracks among the musketeers. It doesn't try to get serious until the second half which deals mostly with tragic love stories bolstered or undone by one of Tchaikovsky's symphonies.".

Mayer did. Look down the cast list Mayer barely went outside his studio for a player.I don't think I have to relate any of the plot one of the most familiar in the world. Gene Kelly fresh off the farm from Gascony with the usual bumptiousness associated with folks from that area of France gets himself in hot water with three Musketeers of the King's personal guard Van Heflin Gig Young and Robert Coote. But before fighting any duels with them all three join forces to defeat and send packing some of Cardinal Richelieu's guards. The other three like Kelly's style and he's a musketeer from then on.That particular duel is choreographed as Kelly would do in any of his numbers in his musicals. It's so good I expected a song to be coming forth almost any minute. This is where Kelly the dancer and choreographer gets to shine.The rest of the cast is of high quality with Frank Morgan as King Louis XIII Angela Lansbury as Queen Anne of Austria Vincent Price as the clever Richelieu Ian Keith as Price's attack dog Rochefort Lana Turner as Milady DeWinter who attacks in other ways for Richelieu June Allyson who's a little too much like her Americanized girl next door as Constance for my taste John Sutton as the English Prime Minister the Duke of Buckingham and Keenan Wynn as the loyal if not too bright servant of D'Artagnan.Milady DeWinter is one of the most evil women in literature and Lana Turner was up to the job. Watching her it's like she channeled back her performance in The Postman Always Rings Twice for this role.I was curious however that I could find no reference in the film to Richelieu being a Cardinal. In the film he's simply referred to as Richelieu. Note there is no trace of any clerical garb on Vincent Price. My guess is that MGM didn't want to offend the Catholic Church by having a prince of said church shown as the villain. Also as the Cold War was going into deep freeze Pius XII and his church were seen as an antiCommunist bulwark.Though I wish that one of the three stars I cited above had ever gotten to play D'Artagnan The Three Musketeers from MGM in 1948 is not a bad version and Gene Kelly's fans will enjoy it immensely.".

Gig Young and Robert Coote play Porthos and Aramis and Vincent Price is perfect as the always intriguing Cardinal Richelieu who claims to be France. Perhaps the weak link in the cast is June Allyson as Constance Bonacieux Allyson has always done better in contemporary parts assigning her as Turner's jailer is the same as signing her death sentence.The Three Musketeers has not to be taken very seriously but as an all adventure an action swashbuckler though it also has its dramatic parts by the end.

Wasted moments.That is not to say that the 1948 film has no merit.  It starts off brilliantly with a sword fight Fairbanks would have envied and he might also have envied Gene Kelly's extraordinary athletic and balletic skills. But after this initial action the film loses its sense of fun almost entirely.  Van Heflin is relentlessly depressed as Athos and the other two musketeers do nothing.

And June Allyson shouldn't have been in this film at all.  Price is okay but not a Cardinal as he should be which takes the edge off the character.

	schema:reviewBody "The Three Musketeers 1948 is probably the most spectacularly miscast film in cinema history. This will be either hilarious or painful depending on a viewer's senseofhumor perversity quotient. The idea of casting Lana Turner and June Allyson in a period costume drama was absurd on its face but the results are actually worse than you could imagine. Turner was arguably the least talented of the bigname actors of her era. Her appeal was strictly physical and she was serviceable playing herself in Andy Hardy type stuff. But she simply had no ability even with good direction to play anyone else let alone an exotic villainess like the Dumas' Lady De Winter. And by the late 1940's the aging process had hit her particularly hard taking away any trace of the youthful glow that had seemed so magical early in her career. At the time of casting Turner still clueless that she had lost the physical appeal that had made her a star and apparently unaware that her career was already headed steeply downhill was reluctant to take a supporting role. Then there is Allyson she had a clue about acting but her presence brought no magic to the screen. Her most successful roles were as contemporary tomboys not as an inspirational love interest in a lavish costume drama. Allyson was all Bronx and that just doesn't fit the tone of the Dumas classic. As D'Artagnan Gene Kelly at least provides a reason to watch The Three Musketeers. He is physically suited to the role and handles the acrobatic action sequences quite well. But Kelly was more dancer than actor. As someone said his acting is much like Bob Hope without the comedic sensibility. I found it hard to keep from thinking about his faux silent film part in Singing In the Rain. Vincent Price's Richelieu was probably fine in 1948 but his subsequent ghoul movie and Batman fame works against him with today's viewers. You won't recognize him in costume but once you hear the halfwitted Planchet speak you will say Hey that's Keenan Wynn. Unlike Price Wynn's wide range of subsequent character roles don't undermine his performance. The Three Musketeers is set in 17th century France as young D'Artagnan joins the three best swordsmen in Paris Athos Van Heflin Porthos Gig Young and Aramis Robert Coote. Oz's Wizard Frank Morgan plays King Louis XIII another astonishing bit is miscasting but the part is too small for that to be of much significance. The King and Richelieu are at odds over going to war with England but Richelieu has the goods on the Queen Angela Lansbury and hopes to force a war. There is action romance great production design and an excellent underlying story. Unfortunately the humorous casting decisions make it extremely difficult to suspend disbelief and get into the film as anything more than an old movie. Turner's stuff has mock fest potential but she is thankfully only a supporting character. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Three Musketeers 1948 is probably the most spectacularly miscast film in cinema history. This will be either hilarious or painful depending on a viewer's senseofhumor perversity quotient. The idea of casting Lana Turner and June Allyson in a period costume drama was absurd on its face but the results are actually worse than you could imagine. Turner was arguably the least talented of the bigname actors of her era. Her appeal was strictly physical and she was serviceable playing herself in Andy Hardy type stuff. But she simply had no ability even with good direction to play anyone else let alone an exotic villainess like the Dumas' Lady De Winter. And by the late 1940's the aging process had hit her particularly hard taking away any trace of the youthful glow that had seemed so magical early in her career. At the time of casting Turner still clueless that she had lost the physical appeal that had made her a star and apparently unaware that her career was already headed steeply downhill was reluctant to take a supporting role.

His swordly scenes are a highlight and the film's expense is obvious. Perhaps they should have played up rather than play down the sexual situations  it's strange to see Kelly kissing everyone in sight before settling down to one interest.

	schema:reviewBody "I really liked this version of the Three Musketeers. Then again I have liked a vast majority of the adaptations of the novel even the 1993 version which is admittedly my least favourite of the ones I liked but it still entertained me. The novel itself by Alexandre Dumas is superbly written and a truly entertaining read. This adaptation does deviate from it but considering how beautiful it looked and how entertaining it was I am past caring.I only have two real complaints of this movie. The film does suffer from being overlong at over two hours consequently I did feel some scenes dragged but only slightly. My other complaint was that I wished Angela Lansbury and Vincent Price had more screen time. Lansbury is a fine actress but because she is given very little to do she failed to make an impression. Price is another fine actor chiefly remembered for his performances in films like Pit and the Pendulum Great Mouse Detective Witchfinder General and Fall of the House of Usher. Sadly as Cardinal Richelieu he is only in three or four scenes but he was still good.On the whole this 1948 film has its good points. The music score is superb and the cinematography magnificent. The scenery is splendid and I thought the costumes were truly lavish especially Milady's dresses. The film is shot in dazzling Technicolour that still looks amazing even by today's standards. The sword fights are constantly energetic and lively and don't feel clumsy at all. The script is on the whole good same with the acting. Although I did worry that Gene Kelly would be out of character as I associate him mainly with musicals he was wonderfully athletic as D'Artagnan. Van Heflin Gig Toung and Robert Coote all gives spirited turns as Athos Porthos and Aramis. But who impressed me most were Lana Turner who was both beautiful and haunting as Milady and June Allyson as the lovely Constance.Overall this 1948 film does have its flaws but what mattered to me was who stunning it looked it was energetic and entertaining. In these areas that's where the film succeeded. It isn't completely faithful to the book but I do think despite its length it is one of the better adaptations of the book out there though the 1973 film gets my vote as the definitive one. 8.510 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1625 an ambitious youth joins forces with THE THREE MUSKETEERS to save the French Queen's honor from the machinations of the cruel Cardinal Richelieu.Douglas Fairbanks had one of his most popular roles as the swashbuckling hero of Alexander Dumas' 1844 novel. Exulting in his sheer physical vitality he never walks when he can run never runs when he can leap. While a bit melodramatic  stagy Fairbanks is obviously having a wonderful time and he wants his audience to enjoy themselves too.As producer as well as star Fairbanks ensured fine production values  large sets to backdrop his stunts. Notice particularly the Parisian street scenes how detailed  exact they are with the crowds of extras looking as if they had real purpose in what they were doing. Also be mindful of the architectural staging whether it be walls rooftops or monumental staircases they were all built with Fairbanks' physical dimensions in mind so that he could run creep or climb along them effortlessly.To such a degree does Doug dominate the drama that the characters of the three Musketeers themselves remain largely undeliniated. Lon Bavy as Athos George Siegmann as Porthos  Eugene Pallette as a most unlikely Aramis are mere windowdressing to showcase Fairbanks' exuberance. Coming off rather better are British actor Nigel de Brulier as the rapacious Richelieu beautiful Barbara La Marr as the Cardinal's evil agent Milady de Winter  Lon Poff as the sepulchral Father Joseph. Here are three villains worth watching.Lovely Marguerite De La Motte supplies Doug's love interest. Adolphe Menjou does well as the coldhearted vain Louis XIII.Not surprisingly the original story has been streamlined  altered in various ways and at least a couple of notable deaths have been omitted so as to provide a happier fadeout. Fairbanks would continue the tale  and reprise the role of D'Artagnan  eight years later in THE IRON MASK 1929.What were the facts surrounding the historical Richelieu  Buckingham? Since the novel  films make much of their rivalry a closer examination is in order.Both men rose from semiobscurity to positions of enormous power  influence in their respective kingdoms.

	schema:reviewBody "What you see at this point in cinema's history is the maturing of various formulas once considered frivolous. Griffith had done it in the midteens with dramatic filmmaking as a whole. Chaplin's The Kid had shown how slapstick could be melded with powerful storytelling. And now it was the turn of Douglas Fairbanks to develop his unique brand of adventure comedies into the realm of grand mythmaking.Fairbanks had already reinvented his screen persona with the groundbreaking Mark of Zorro transferring his overthetop athleticism and comic timing to the world of romantic adventure. Mark of Zorro is amazing but it is also something of an experiment not too extravagant and quite straightforward in storyline. After the success of Zorro his confidence bolstered not to mention his coffers a little fuller Fairbanks made his followup The Three Musketeers a far more lavish production as well as allowing more time for characterisation and subplot. In other words this was an attempt to move beyond simple genre antics and present a swashbuckler that was also a sweeping historical epic.The broader canvas of The Three Musketeers allows for greater freedom of expression for its director Fred Niblo who had also filmed Zorro. Niblo was an expert at balancing rhythm and motion in crowd scenes but was also a great dramatic director. Here he gets to show off both these abilities providing a realistic and constantly moving backdrop with the masses of extras at his disposal yet also allowing the more emotional scenes to play out at a steady pace giving them dignity and bringing out naturalism in the performances. He still recognises however that this is first and foremost an action picture. He gives a unique look to every action shot sometimes putting figures in the background other times foregrounding them sometimes having them move towards the camera other times across the frame. A great shot is the one in which Fairbanks steals food from the cardinal troops. The guards are placed in the foreground at the right of the frame Fairbanks appears on the left in the background. This arrangement focuses us on Fairbanks and the depth of his position also allows him room to do his stunts without having to move the camera or change angle.Like Chaplin Fairbanks always ensured that he was the star of the show and centre of attention but in this more generous production he does allow some room for great supporting players confident that they will make the picture more enjoyable without stealing it. Of note here are George Siegmann Porthos who can mostly be seen playing villains for Griffith but here gets to show off his comedy skills  check out the casual way he wipes his sword and saunters off after dispatching a guard  and Eugene Palette Aramis also a great comedy player and worth mentioning simply because it's interesting to see him without the huge belly he had acquired by his 30s heyday. Other than that Adolphe Menjou is great as usual although he expresses far too much confidence and smugness for the puppet monarch he portrays. Fairbanks's regular leading lady Marguerite De La Motte is not bad getting a little more time and space to show her acting range than she did in Mark of Zorro.Still there is a problem with The Three Musketeers one which arises from its larger scale and dramatic pretensions  it's a bit slow. The screenplay goes to lengths to allow Fairbanks's character to gradually emerge and takes time to set the scene which is all fair enough except that this is done at the expense of pacing. The first ten minutes are used up establishing the political intrigue and it's a full thirtyeight minutes before we get to the first real action sequence. While I agree it's a good idea to keep us in suspense before showing off D'Artagnan's fighting skills the buildup would work much better if we were treated to a small burst of action at the beginning  a hook screenwriters call it. Also the best fight scenes are weighted to the middle of the story robbing the picture of a satisfying finale. The Mark of Zorro although it is far more simplistic at least has a continuous frenetic pace that makes it extremely watchable. Nevertheless The Three Musketeers did settle once and for all the character of Doug Fairbanks a character that was the same no matter what name it went by  that of the mythical everliving hero.".

Entertaining and fun version based on the classic Dumas novel with an intrepid Douglas Fairbanks. Spectacular swordplay in nifty style  this is the first and superior version of the classic Dumas novel set in 17th Century France . Alexandre Dumas's source for his novel was a book by 19thcentury writer Courtils de Sandraz which was purporting to be D'Artagnan's biography the Musketeers were actually real people not fictional characters created by Dumas .

He is accompanied by Leon Bary as Athos  George Siegmann as Porthos and the notorious secondary actor Eugene Palette as Aramis and of course the nasty Milady Winter compellingly played by Barbara La Marr . This delightful adaptation based on Alexandre Dumas classic novel starts with the youngster D'Artagnan who arrives in Paris to find Mister Treville  chief of Musketeers. But he meets with three twofisted Musketeers  Athos a rollicking adventurer  fighting to live and living to love  Porthos and Aramis . Drtagnan to be aware they are Musketeers and is invited to unite them in their objective to struggle against guards of Cardinal Richelieu well performed by Nigel De Brulier and the astute Milady De Winter who is lovely as a jewel deadly as a dagger the wickedest woman in all Christendom . Meanwhile D'Artagnan falls in love with a gorgeous young  Constance  she is a goldenhaired beauty entangled in a web of treachery and intrigue. Furthermore  there is developed an intrigue between Luis XIII  the prestigious actor Adolphe Menjou  Queen Anne of Austria  Mary McLaren  dazzling as her gilded palace for her men dared a thousand perils  and Duke of Buckingham  and of course the nasty Richelieu  as evil as ever .

Fairbanks executes athletic feats  moving swordplay and spectacular acrobatics similarly he demonstrated in other classics such as The Mark of Zorro 1920 Robin Hood 1922 Three musketeers  Don Q Son of Zorro  The gaucho  The Taming of the Shrew  among others . Douglas performed most of the stunts in his films himself . He was an excellent athlete and used his physical abilities to his best advantage . Adequate cinematography in black and white stunningly showed on the splendorous images . Glamorous production design is well reflected on the luxurious interiors and exteriors stunningly filmed . The motion picture was professionally realized by Fred Niblo Ben Hur. This cool filmmaker provided visual style  comedy  fencing  drama  clangorous action in equal proportions . It's followed by a second part  The iron mask 1929 by Allan Dwan and again with Douglas Fairbanks  Margueritte De La Motta and Nigel De Brulier who plays Cardinal Richelieuhe would also play the role in the 1935 film of the same name  in addition the 1939 film The Man in the Iron Mask. This classy story is subsequently remade on several versions  firstly take on about this classic is the following  1935 adaptation by Rowland V.

	schema:reviewBody "This light but enjoyable version of the oftenfilmed story of The Three Musketeers also offers Douglas Fairbanks plenty of material that plays to his best strengths. While he made several other movies that had more substance to them than this one does the role of D'Artagnan is one of the roles that was best suited to his talents.The adaptation of the Dumas novel considerably abridges both the story and the characters. It does not really attempt to deal with many of the themes of the book instead concentrating on the parts with the most action and suspense.

But to enjoy it you do have to set aside any expectation that the movie might come up to the book's standard which in any case would be a difficult goal for a normallength film feature to accomplish.Fairbanks revels both in his early scenes as the ambitious young Gascon and in the rest of his sequences as the companion of the Musketeers. He also gets lots of help from the supporting cast. Nigel De Brulier has probably his best role as Cardinal Richelieu a role he would also play in several later movies with the austere reserved Cardinal providing an ideal match for De Brulier's style. Marguerite De La Motte is appealing as Constance and Barbara La Marr makes Milady de Winter a worthy adversary.Everything fits together pretty well and while this film version is much lighter than the novel it succeeds at what it intended to do.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think how much you'll enjoy the film will be impacted on how closely you want the film to follow the book which it doesn't as well as whether or not you've seen many of Douglas Fairbanks' films. What I mean by the latter is that I think my expectations were way too high for this movie because I expected a VERY physical and athletic filmbut it wasn't. This was a HUGE surprise because Fairbanks was known for his amazing stuntssuch as in Thief of Bagdad or The Mark of Zorro. I expected to see his great leaps and boundsbut there just weren't very many athletic scenes. Now this is NOT to say that it's a bad filmit's still pretty good. It's just that I think it could have been a lot better. Enjoyable but not among the actor's best filmsthough the costumes and sets were pretty amazing for 1921.By the way the version I saw was the one in the public domain that is linked to IMDb. Oddly this version has reversed the last two reels of the film!! In other words it ends and then continues! I am not sure if you can find a corrected version or not.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another great Douglas Fairbanks film not one of his best but still hugely entertaining. As an adaptation it is rather abridged the details and spirit are there but there are versions since that have had much more depth to characterisation and such the musketeers here are still very fun to watch but can feel like windowdressing. However as a film and a stand alone there is plenty to love. Aside from the abridgements the only real misgiving was the rushed ending. The Three Musketeers though is still beautifully photographed and the costumes and sets equally evocative and lavish. It is wittily written a lot of chat especially for a silent film but it has the Dumas spirit and none of it feels like irrelevant filler. As well as rousingly scored there are three scores available one from 1921 and the others from 1996 the most fitting of the three is Louis F. Gottschalk's from 1921. The story is still diverting and goes at a crisp pace with lots of twists and turns along with a real sense of adventure excitement and suspense basically all the ingredients for a great period adventure. The action sequences are highly athletic with lots of exciting bravado it is edgeoftheseat stuff with no signs of clumsiness or predictability. Fairbanks is great he is full of charisma with touches of arrogance wit and sparkling humour and tackles his stunts with a real effortless ease. Margarite De LaMotte is a touching Constance and Barbara La Marr a sensual and haunting Milady DeWinter. Adolphe Menjou is appropriately cruel and the Musketeers are wellplayed but aside from Fairbanks the standout in the acting department was Nigel De Brulier as a sly and malevolent Richelieu. Overall the 1973 Richard Lester version is still the definitive adaptation of The Three Musketeers but if we're talking about adaptations being judged on their own this is one of the better and most enjoyable ones apart from the Burbank Films Australia animated version and the updated one from the Asylum I don't think any of the adaptations are really terribleyes that is including the 1993 film. 910 Bethany Cox".

He just seemed to have it all together with this one with his character's physical qualities impressing the King and a surprisingly deft battle of wits with Cardinal Richielieu impressing that dangerous man. It is said Fairbanks was a huge fan of Dumas and indeed he showed deep enough acquaintance with the original Three Musketeers to successfully keep the original feel of the book particularly the last section while neatly cleaning it to be acceptable to 1920s morals the Twenties may have roared but they weren't yet ready for the Executioner of Lille the darker side of Milady and Athos Constance's infidelity and tragic end the antiPuritan stereotyping D'Artagnan's becoming not just the talk of Paris but that city's most popular and busy lover of highsociety ladies including just about everybody but the Queen and so forth.The original three musketeers did much to keep all that subplot going and this may be why Fairbanks gives them relatively little to do in the movie. Too he seems to be focusing on the latter part of the book where D'Artagnan does come to the fore though if anything he toned down D'Artagnan's role too if you haven't read the book you're in an overthetop tour de force believe me!.Anyway the physical performances by Fairbanks that stand out here include of course the famous lefthanded handspring during the duel in which we learn what happens when the bad guy not Indiana Jones brings a gun to a sword fight the horsemanship Doug displays the skill shown in the fencing scenes he had come a long way from Mark Of Zorro which was not bad either and the general agility he shows whether he's leaping into a cupboard or through a window or tiptoeing across the tip of a rooftop with a damsel in distress on his shoulder. Two swordfights that stand out besides the duel are the one in the apothecary's shop where not a single jar or bottle is broken in spite of the general mayhem going on between D'Artagnan and the Cardinal's best swordsman and the scene where Fairbanks squares off against Milady is this the only scene where Douglas Fairbanks fought a woman?.".

Most of the sword fights seem to be a little flat which is odd since this follows the spectacular Mark of Zorro. It's a good version of the tale or half the tale since it ends with the saving of the reputation of the queen and dispense with the nastiness that follows but it doesn't have the spectacle one thinks of in a Fairbanks Swashbuckler. I've been looking at the Fairbanks films again thanks to a recent MOMA show here in New York but as with many of Fairbanks films this film just didn't click with me This isn't to say its bad more that I prefer other versions of the story.Worth a look for fans of the star and for those who like the story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Five Miles To Midnight is another of those Alfred Hitchcock type films that could have been a classic had he decided to do them. I think he was busy with The Birds when this came out.Sophia Loren is the star both in billing and performance. She's married to former American GI Anthony Perkins and it's an abusive relationship. Perkins has to take a flight to Casablanca but the plane crashes near Bordeaux and miracle of miracles he survives but is not found.What a golden opportunity for a little insurance fraud. And a battered Sophia goes along with it. The rest of the film is the masquerade that Loren plays as she pretends he's dead like everyone suspects and what she endures with an increasingly unbalanced Perkins.When Sophia Loren won her Oscar for Two Women she showed her acting chops and this film also has a lot more to do with Sophia the actress than Sophia the sex symbol. As for Anthony Perkins he started out playing callow youths with issues. After Psycho he started out playing far more deranged characters with issues although his character here is descending into a bit of madness unlike Norman Bates who was one fully formed whack job.Other men in Sophia's life are Gig Young and JeanPierre Aumont.

	onyx:emotionText "Five Miles To Midnight is another of those Alfred Hitchcock type films that could have been a classic had he decided to do them. I think he was busy with The Birds when this came out.Sophia Loren is the star both in billing and performance. She's married to former American GI Anthony Perkins and it's an abusive relationship. Perkins has to take a flight to Casablanca but the plane crashes near Bordeaux and miracle of miracles he survives but is not found.What a golden opportunity for a little insurance fraud. And a battered Sophia goes along with it. The rest of the film is the masquerade that Loren plays as she pretends he's dead like everyone suspects and what she endures with an increasingly unbalanced Perkins.When Sophia Loren won her Oscar for Two Women she showed her acting chops and this film also has a lot more to do with Sophia the actress than Sophia the sex symbol. As for Anthony Perkins he started out playing callow youths with issues. After Psycho he started out playing far more deranged characters with issues although his character here is descending into a bit of madness unlike Norman Bates who was one fully formed whack job.Other men in Sophia's life are Gig Young and JeanPierre Aumont. Won't give any ending away because in the end we don't know what's to become of the main characters most especially Sophia Loren.";

If they had used the Charles Bronson title 10 To Midnight it would have made a bit more sense.The second thing that will be strange to viewers is the pairing of Anthony Perkins and Sophia Loren. True they were paired together as a romantic couple a few years earlier in Desire Under The Elms but reportedly that worked as well as it does here. How a beauty in the form of Loren could be attracted to the nervous boyish Perkins is hard to swallow to say the least.But even if the title was fixed AND they got two lead actors with better and believable chemistry together I think the movie still wouldn't have worked. I could see this story being told as a short graphic story in the comic Tales From The Crypt. I could see this story working as a halfhour episode with commercials of a show like Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Or even as a full hour. But this telling of the story lasts about 110 minutes. It's VERY slowmoving full of padding like the stuff with the little nosy boy. Plus the ending of the movie is very predictable  I guessed what would happen after reading the plot synopsis before actually starting the movie.Far from the worst movie I've seen but still not worth seeing.

What woman would? In any case she doesn't breathe enough life into her character of putupon housewife and near the film's conclusion she goes overboard in a frankly unbelievable personality transformation. Also the surprise ending was no surprise to this reviewer who wonders why she didn't see the obvious way out of her troubles much earlier.

Creating such an unlikeable character is a complete reversal of Norman Bates who was so endearing you almost wanted him to get away with murder. Sophia Loren not only looks beautiful but turns in a fine convincing performance. Remember English is not her first language yet her phrasing and tone are utterly real as are her reactions. No surprise that she was awarded a Best Actress Oscar two years previously. The Paris we see here is not a postcard view but rather a seedier image captured in stark black and white photography.

You would have at least expected at one time in the movie just to keep from from nodding off to see Lisa or Miss Loren take her clothes off and show off her impressive vital statistics 382437 but she's fully clothes during he entire lengths of the film! All we have left is Lisa trying to somehow get Robert off her back in committing a crime far worse that can end up getting her shot at sunrise then the insurance fraud that he was blackmailing her into doing!As for the love sick David Barnes he blows his big chance in getting it on with Lisa by not only finding out her criminal involvement with Robert but having her give herself up to the Paris Police for it!

I found it hard to take my eyes off of the screen the only disappointment was that I watched this on a UK TV channel that had adverts breaking up the action. If I could find this film on DVD I would buy it without hesitation. Sadly this is clearly a TV movie and it may only pop up on my screen once in a blue moon. If you see this listed in your TV guide set the video recorder QUICK!The Hoff is perfect as the romantic lead and his fellow actors make this movie just wonderful! Watch this if you get the chance its Hofftastic!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "In this German film directed by the Hungarian Zoltan Korda the male lead in Metropolis has another big role. You will find that his histrionic temptationangst defeatism arising from his choosing mindlessly between two women and between the soft life and the workers' life will be mutually and agreeably resolved by the women while he plays ball. The competition appears to be between two teams The Average Joes and Globo Gym or their equivalents the two sportsclubs but the winner is the game of dodgeball or fussball or soccer or whatever it is they're playing on that pretty field. It's a film of great silentfilm photography with cameras riding on trucks interspersed with radianteyed reaction shots.The film was made in the summer of 1927 in Berlin. There is a scene where the underdog team of dayworkers wonder how long it will take for them to save enough to build their own stadium. By their calculations at the rate they are saving they won't have enough money to build a stadium until 1947... What a difference to those calculations the 20 years will make...".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't think of many movies in which soccer was a key element. There's BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM and the ludicrous VICTORY. After that it's mostly twominute actualities from about 1900. That doesn't mean that this type of movie is unknown to me. Movies about people in sports coming to learn the true meaning of their game may not be as common a theme as people learning the true meaning of Christmas but it crops up regularly. As an American it's usually about baseball or our version of football.So this movie about how Gustav Froelich is the best player on a small afterwork soccer team caught between the love of Evelyn Holt and the allure of Lissy Arna and her professional team is pretty much a cutanddried plot. It's also a bit slow and solemn  William Haines or Joe E. Brown would have disposed of this story in 75 minutes with a lot more good humor. Codirector Vincent Korda shoots some interesting soccer moves but the game is assembled through strenuous editing very highspeed for the era longer takes would have been better but between the difficulty of shooting an extended sequence and the excitement of short cuts it was the obvious and cheap choice.".

Among a certain group of former East Germans who are now i.e. 2003 moving into their midtwenties or early thirties this film constitutes their childhood and has gained a cult status.Olli the main character in the movie got a very bad grade a 5 which equals an F and is terribly annoyed. She runs away from home and together with a dog and a horse finds a mad? nutty? scientist in a windmill. They experience the strangest adventures in this windmill and find other interesting characters a lot of excitement and peril.While you may well interpret something as the socialist value system into this movie it is more meant to be a children's movie showing the kids that there are more exciting things out there than the ones that your parents and teachers show you and that you will only find out most of those things on your own if you show enough curiosity. Personally I think that this is a wonderful contradiction to the common concept that only your school grades make you a better person.The East German DEFA film studios produced a considerable number of amazing children's films among them the almostlegendary Sandmnnchen which is a little manikin generously spreading sleeping sand in a nightly tv show to send the children to bed this being one of the most beautiful ones.I give this film a full ten mainly because it's both fun to watch for children and adults it's entertaining funny and terribly cute.".
