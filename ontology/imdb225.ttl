A bridge outage forces them to spend the night in a monastery along the way and during the night they watch in horror as a supply convoy of trucks is bombed by Japanese planes.

	schema:reviewBody "A good tense story and Anna May Wong's leading performance more than make up for this World War II feature's cheapish production and lowbudget look. The story is interesting in itself and it also serves the purpose of illuminating a vital but littleremembered aspect of the world war. Wong also gets support from some of the other cast members although most of them are well below her stature as a performer.The setup has Wong as a schoolteacher who is helping to keep the Burma Road supply line open despite enemy raids and other problems. The main part of the movie comes when she and a bus load of fellow passengers are stuck in a remote monastery along the supply line as it becomes increasingly clear that one of their little group is a traitor who is tipping off the Japanese Air Force so that they can destroy the supply convoys.The story is told effectively and even the lowbudget look often actually aids in setting the atmosphere. The suspense is maintained rather well for an extended time and the story keeps you guessing as long as possible as to just how things will turn out.The down side includes the dialogue which is not nearly as good as the story and some of the flat supporting performances. Dan Seymour is an exception in a smaller role as the kind of lowlife that he always portrayed convincingly. As Sir Roger Leslie Denison gives a rather plain performance for most of the movie but he redeems himself with a fine wordless performance in the tense climactic scene. Nedrick Young has a couple of good moments as an American truck driver and Connie Leon does a decent job of providing comic relief in her scene as a Burmese bureaucrat.Bombs Over Burma and Lady From Chungking both starred Wong and were both made by the same production company at about the same point in the war. Each one has its own strengths and weaknesses but both benefit considerably from Wong's presence and both were worthwhile in drawing attention to the often forgotten part of the war that was fought on mainland Asia.".

	schema:reviewBody "Teacher in a Chinese school goes on the road to uncover axis spies in China. Ending up in a monastery she and her fellow travelers witness the bombing of a convoy of trucks and it becomes clear that someone among them is a spy. Good wartime spy drama suffers from some padding in the driving scenes and an opening sequence of teacher Anna Mae Wong and her students that ends on a bathic note with an air raid with a conclusion that was probably over done when the film was made. Early flaws aside once the film gets on the road and gets to the monastery this is a good little thriller. To be certain its formulaic at times but there are a couple of twists  for example how the spy gets the messages out for example and the fate of the foul villain that make this worth your time especially on a double bill with something else.".

Good wartime spy drama suffers from some padding in the driving scenes and an opening sequence of teacher Anna Mae Wong and her students that ends on a bathic note with an air raid with a conclusion that was probably over done when the film was made. Early flaws aside once the film gets on the road and gets to the monastery this is a good little thriller. To be certain its formulaic at times but there are a couple of twists  for example how the spy gets the messages out for example and the fate of the foul villain that make this worth your time especially on a double bill with something else.";

	schema:reviewBody "Anna May Wong is a Chinese school teacher Lin Yang who is also a spy for the good guys during WW II. She is traveling with an international group who must discover who is leaking information to the Japanese bombers. The story is pretty good but the sound quality is poor in parts of the film with quite a bit of static in the soundtrack. Also lots of stock wartime footage thrown in. I was quite impressed at how the women could keep their hair and makeup just perfect on this long hard roadtrip. Leslie Denison  Roger Howe  was a busy guy in those days  made 12 films in 1942 and 14 in 1943 in large and small roles. Wong had just made Lady from Chunking the year before another AlexanderStern production about wartime China. Astute viewers will recognize the large annoying Dan Seymour Brogranza who had played Captain Renard in To Have and Have Not. Too bad they didn't give him a larger role in this film  might have helped spruce it up. Connie Leon who was actually British provides the only laughs as the Chinese customs agent who taunts each person in the group as they are questioned when leaving town. This was just the third film for Ned Young Slim Jenkins and only the second credited role for lovely blonde Teala Loring who seems to be the daughter of Doctor somebody or other going to Chunking to check on him. Entertaining film quite short at 65 minutes. It was a little odd... in the credits for the film they use the PRC symbol for producers releasing corp but that's also the abbreviation for Peoples Republic of China...".

Since this picture is from the poverty row PRC it's length is a little more than an hour which is just as well since part of the time it seems padded with some scenes of trucks just moving without any dialogue or music to ease the monotony. Still there is some dramatically compelling moments at the beginning with one of her students having some fun in hearing planes flyingnot knowing what their target isbefore his tragic ending and near the end when one of the bus passengers is discovered to be a spy who gets his comeuppance. The print I watched was quite fuzzy with a soundtrack that had some surface noise that made it hard to understand some of the dialogue though whoever ran the film at least silenced it when no sounds were supposed to come out on audio. In summary Bombs Over Burma isn't quite good as a drama but isn't too bad as a mystery either.".

There are some long moment of silence for pretty much nothing happens and it becomes almost impossibly tedious. Of course this all explodes for an action packed finale where locals rush to Wong's aid as the identity of who the villain truly leads to a grizzly conclusion.

The setting was great and some of the locations that the makers shot at were amazing to see. The action was great as well and there were plenty of fight scenes to keep us van damme fans satisfied. after all the fight scenes are what van damme fans are looking for in the first place right? the fighting was well done and van damme gives you all the classic kicks you can think of. For a DTV van damme action flick you can do MUCH worse. I put in the movie expecting nothing but after it ended i had a smile.RATING 710".

	schema:headline " Van Damme's best film since Universal Soldier!";
	schema:reviewBody "It's with great joy I watched THE ORDER. Easily JeanClaude Van Damme's best film since Universal Soldier 1992. The author Les Weldon also wrote Replicant 2001 where he also uses lots of clichs but in this film they work much better. The direction of The Order by Sheldon Lettich is very nice but some is lost in the very uneven editing. The main lowpoint of this film is the music which is awful as best and extremely annoying at worst.Fight scenes are few but good and it seems that Van Damme has tried to get more Jackie Chan looking feeling to this film than he is used too. There are plenty of ripoffs from both Indiana Jonesmovies and Project A II by Jackie Chan 1987.The plot is about an ancient Order with converted muslims christians and jews. And this is not such a bad idea for a film. The Order is not allbad but the bad guys of course have the toppositions trying to use the Order for their purposes.This time Van Damme isn't such a brilliant guy as we are used to see him. On the contrary he is actually portraid as a bit stupid and sometimes even unlucky. This is very nice since the costars  Charlton Heston and Sofia Milos  gets a chance to shine which is rare in these kind of films.This is also perhaps one of the more downtoearth movies Van Damme made lately and it has a really good setting and use of locations. Overall this is an interesting and very good movie which I truly enjoyed watching. And as I said this is perhaps his best movie since Universal Soldier and I actually place it as the number 3 movie of all Van Damme's work.I truly hope that a sequel comes out of this one since they really put it that way in the ending! Great work  if you like Van Damme you can't go wrong with this one!".

	schema:headline " Underrated outstanding Van Damme direct to video action flick!";
	schema:reviewBody "Disclaimer If you are a viewer that mainly prefers arthousetype movies then you might as well ignore this review. In addition if you're not able to take a Van Damme underrated good action flick from Sheldon Lettich ignore this review as well. We'll both be better off.The Order 2001 in my opinion is very underrated hated and bashed Van Damme film. I love this flick to death and it is a not bad movie that was made. I love it no matter what anyone says. This was a good action film a very underrated Van Damme film In my opinion The Order is so much better movie than Knock Off. At least I know about what is this movie about at all. I still don't know what was in Knock Off. This movie is Van Damme's last very funold school action film that is very underrated indeed! Brian Thompson and Abdel Qissi reprise their roles with a new characters and reunited 11.years later with Van Damme from Lionheart 1990. Here they are completely different characters since they were in that movie. I am getting this movie on Bluray disc in two weeks I have pre order it and I will get it by my mail. I also have pre order it Cyborg 1989 another Underrated Van Damme film.Pino Donaggio the same music composer did made a music and edit it for The Howling and Carrie so that's pretty cool. The effects in here are good and I have enjoyed them so much. The Order is one of my favorite Van Damme films. Far much better than Knock Off Derailed and Inferno aka Desert Heat! It doesn't get the attention that it deserves especially the fight choreography. The fight scenes are well executed and exciting. Van Damme actually looks like he's having fun. You can tell he had a ball making the film it shows through his performance. Sadly I don't think we'll ever see him in this type of role again. Love the comedy and action in this here. The new 'zombie' Pound of Flesh 2015 Van Damme sucks. Id love to see him go back to the happygolucky Van Damme from the old days.It is a good movie to watch. This one was neutral...Not too much action Not too much dialogue....but just right. If it were released in theaters I bet it would have done well. This movie has a great soundtrack at the end to listen too. Van Damme is Rudy a thief whose father has gone to Israel but disappears. Arriving in Jerusalem in order to find his dad he must also find a sacred scroll before it falls into the wrong hands... I really have enjoyed watching this movie I still think it is very underrated JeanClaude Van Damme film! I don't understand why is the film so low so bashed off and so hate it I don't think it is a bad film! It is direct to video film I think for the direct to video film it is very fast paced it is under 90 minutes. It has a lot of action you have a car chase trough the runway airport you have a motorcycle chase on the streets. You get a lots of fist fights from old fashion Van Damme fighting style! You get even a small appearance from Charlton Heston for couple minutes. You have other actors and actress in here like are Ben Cross and Sofia Milos. Sofia also played in CSI Miami as M.D.P.D Homicide  Robbery Det. Yelina Salas. This film was also directed from Sheldon Lettich who also directed Lionheart 1990 and Double Impact 1991. This is the third time Van Damme worked with same director from the previous movies they made together. They both later worked together on The Hard Corps 5.years later another direct to video action movie that I like.For direct to video this is far entertaining tons of action it has JeanClaude Van Damme the last time that you will see him acting like he a human been! What I mean by that is he acts like he has a lot of life toohe is up beat he is funny he smiles he try's to pick up on girls like try to get their phone number. After this he played either a zombie and dead eyes or he will be very dark depressed damaged person he will be sad crying or he be frowning or he will had that awful look. This is the last time I see Van Damme been an up beat guy that has a life too kind of you saw it in Double Impact I miss that old Van Damme. He made a pretty good movies in the 90's than he does today. I know he had a problems with drugs and he wasn't in the shape anymore just watch Knock Off and The Quest those movie were terrible. There are a lot Direct to Video Van Damme movies that I have enjoyed Until Death 6 Bullets In Hell Universal Soldier Regeneration Legionnare and The Shepherd Border Patrol.This movie get's by me 8 it is my favorite direct to video Van Damme movie very underrated solid action flick! Does not deserve to be hated.The Order is a 2001 American action film directed by Sheldon Lettich and written by JeanClaude Van Damme who also starred in the film. The film was released on directtoDVD in the United States on March 12 2002.810 Grade A Studio TriStar Pictures Starring JeanClaude Van Damme Sofia Milos Brian Thompson Vernon Dobtcheff Ben Cross Sasson Gabai Director Sheldon Lettich Producer Avi Lerner Screenplay JeanClaude Van Damme Les Weldon Rated R Running Time 1 Hr. 29 Mins.

He can actually handle more than two words and some grunts.  I think he's still got a lot of room for improvement but the acting is definately not such a joke anymore.  I also thought the action was good in this.  One thing I didn't like about Replicant was the amount of action.  It only had a bit at the beginning and end and they didn't do enough with it it was too short. The Order on the other hand had plenty of action from start to finish. Definately the way to go for a Van Damme movie.  I mean isn't that why people watch them?  Anyway I gave this movie a six.  I think it's definately worth more than the 4.6 it has now.  As with all Van Damme movies don't go watch it with high expectations just sit back and enjoy it for what it is brainless action.  On that scale it certainly delivered.p.s. is it just me or is Van Damme not as big as he used to be?  Maybe it was just the lighting ".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always been a fan of JeanClaude van Damme so I've been mad that his recent movies haven't got theatrical releases while the latest Adam Sandler and the current breed of grossout teen movies have. I'd much rather see van Damme on the big screen than another teen movie. Although THE ORDER is far from his best or my favorite of his films those would be HARD TARGET SUDDEN DEATH MAXIMUM RISK and LEGIONNAIRE it's still pretty good even if it does drag in some places and has some hardtounderstand accents. But you can understand enough to know the basic idea of the movie so it doesn't really matter. Written by van Damme the story moves had a decent pacer but the direction could have been a little tighter in some scenes. Van Damme is particularly good and though it's not his best acting that would be MAXIMUM RISK it's better than some of his earlier ones.The film makes good use of its Israeli locations sexy newcomer Sofia Milos makes a feisty heroine and costars Ben Cross and Brian Thompson offer good support in roles that are smaller than they should be. Unfortunately however Charlton Heston is wasted. I kept saying to myself Why go to all the trouble to get a famous bigname veteran screen star to play such a teeny tiny little role? His part would have been better suited for the unknown who played van Damme's father with Heston playing the father. That would have been much better. As I said some parts tend to drag a little bit but the action scenes are welldone my favorite being the entire climactic sequence in the underground tunnel system. There's even some funny bloopers that run before the end credits though only a few some more would have been nice.Allinall one of van Damme's better movies storywise and though I'm not sure if I would actually buy the DVD I would probably make it an occasional rental. Then again I'm a big van Damme fan so I'll probably buy it next time I see it just to have it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film begins with a medieval prologue telling the following  1099 A.D. It was an age of religious Crusades and Holy Wars. After a grueling foryear campaign  the knights of Christendom finally arrive at the gates of Jerusalen. During the furious battle of the Holy City a Flemish knight  Charles Le Vaillant  had a lifechanging epiphany. Le Valliant was struck by the hypocrisy of killing fellow human beings in the same God. The Fazar Le Valliant's account of his experiences for days after that bloody battle until he found the entrance of a cave that ran beneath the length of the Holy City. Inside that cave  he began to record his epiphany which became the basis for a new religious sect. An order that would combine the fundamental tenets of three major religions of his day. His first converts were fellow Christian knights who'd also become disenchanted by the bloodshed. The force of his convictions even won over Jews and Muslims former enemies who now became willing converts to the new faith. Many years completing the original Fazar Le Vaillant had further revelations. He wrote these down intending to add them as the final chapter. Around the same time  he and his followers were accused of heresy by the Crusader authorities. On their way to Syria  he and his disciples were intercepted by of the same Crusaders he had once commanded. During the battle that followed  Le Vaillant died a martyr's death. The final chapter he had written was lost. After that the picture is set in Odessa Ukraine where Van Damme robbing valuable eggs to Russian mafia. The eggs were designed by Peter Faberge a special gift to Czar Nichola with inlay twentyfour carat gold. Later On JeanClaude Van Damme reunites with his fatherVernon Dobtcheff and learns about the lost chapter of The Fazar it happens to be the holy scripture of an obscure MiddleEastern sect called The Order ruled actually by Brian Thompson. Then his father go to Israel but he disappears and Van Damme goes to country to find him. There is received by an old professor Charlton Heston and happen several adventures dangers and risks.This movie exhibited in some countries direct to video packs violent action suspense shootouts and martial arts fighting and results to be quite amusing. Tough Van Damme plays finely a sympathetic thief splendid Sofia Milos as enjoyable police who finally falls in love with him and Charlton Heston plays convincingly a veteran archaeologist in a brief appearance .The movie is pointlessly energetic occasionally fun and entertaining and for that reason will appeal to true devotee Van Damme. It packs an atmospheric soundtrack by Pino Donaggio and colorful cinematography by David Garfinkel. It's produced with middling budget by Milennium with its usual producers Boaz Davidson Trevor Short and Danny Avi Lerner  furthermore by Van Damme's 777 Films Corp .The movie is professionally directed by Sheldon Lettich. He spent several years in the US Marines Corps including a time in Vietnam war. Lettich is filmmaker of Van Damme various hits Double impactLionheart Hard cops besides is author of hunk men vehicles such as Daniel BernhardtPerfect dayDolph LundgrenList patrol and Mark DacascosOnly the strong. Rating  Acceptable and passable. The flick will appeal to JeanClaude Van Damme fans and noisy action enthusiasts.".

Heck I even enjoyed Legionnaire. However when I viewed Desert Heat I was extremely disappointed. When I heard Replicant was coming out I had great reservations but ended up not only liking it but putting it as one of my favorite Van Damme films. With expectations raised I picked up The Order and was  not disappointed. After a nifty little prologue the action starts with a nice little  heist and seems to never let up. The action scenes are top notch including martial arts car  motorcycle chases and shootouts. Van Damme is great in the fight scenes and seems to be in great shape. He also injects some nice humor into the role. Director Sheldon Lettich infuses the flick with some nice energy and good use of slo mofast motion. I also liked the flicks editing especially of the action scenes and also the use of the wipes. Although this flick does not give Van Damme the chance to give a juicy performance like in Replicant or have much character depth it is still a lot of fun. Van Damme is getting back to what his fans want to see him to most and that is kick some major butt. At only 89 minutes The Order is a fun action packed ride. 8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Mention Jean Claude Van Damme to any action movie aficionado and you'll see their eyes beam remembering films such as Bloodsport Kickboxer TimeCop and perhaps even Hard Target.So what happened to JCVD? Well his style of violent action movies has been dead in the water for many years and plus his films although interesting always end up being another 80s styled movie  lots of cheese OTT action and stupid story lines.VD has been relegated to DirecttoVideo and having seen the mess that is The Order  I have to wonder what happened to VD and his movie career.Its refereshing to see an action movie set in the middle east but did they have to resort to so may sterotypes cliches and just pointless chases. For example the cleavage busting police lady joins up with VD to save the world and ain't no jihad gonna stop him from his die hard in the middle east mission....except that this isn't die hard. Those times are long gone.Charlton Heston makes a brief cameo  and ironically gets shot in the stomach  well I thought it was ironic considering his stance on guns.Also in there is the worst bad guy I've ever seen  Brian Thompson his sneering smile reminded me of Gustav Graves in Die another Day  yet Thompson gives no real venom or character to VD's enemy  he's just a heavy who got lucky and now wants to start WW3.Meanwhile JCVD takes on the entire Isralei police force in karate fights  at last I thought a chance to see how JCVD would fare against the handtohand combat skills of the Isralei policearmy force  but it turns out its more of a flashy leg kicking match  another opportunity missed.If I could resolve this story line in one sentence its this A die hard in the middle east meets Indiana Jones. Its unfortuente that VD could not achieve either the gusto of die hard nor the charm of indiana jones and its just a mess.Overall 110.".

Well his style of violent action movies has been dead in the water for many years and plus his films although interesting always end up being another 80s styled movie  lots of cheese OTT action and stupid story lines.VD has been relegated to DirecttoVideo and having seen the mess that is The Order  I have to wonder what happened to VD and his movie career.Its refereshing to see an action movie set in the middle east but did they have to resort to so may sterotypes cliches and just pointless chases. For example the cleavage busting police lady joins up with VD to save the world and ain't no jihad gonna stop him from his die hard in the middle east mission....except that this isn't die hard. Those times are long gone.Charlton Heston makes a brief cameo  and ironically gets shot in the stomach  well I thought it was ironic considering his stance on guns.Also in there is the worst bad guy I've ever seen  Brian Thompson his sneering smile reminded me of Gustav Graves in Die another Day  yet Thompson gives no real venom or character to VD's enemy  he's just a heavy who got lucky and now wants to start WW3.Meanwhile JCVD takes on the entire Isralei police force in karate fights  at last I thought a chance to see how JCVD would fare against the handtohand combat skills of the Isralei policearmy force  but it turns out its more of a flashy leg kicking match  another opportunity missed.If I could resolve this story line in one sentence its this A die hard in the middle east meets Indiana Jones. Its unfortuente that VD could not achieve either the gusto of die hard nor the charm of indiana jones and its just a mess.Overall 110.";

I can't believe how poor an actor Van Damme is some of his lines are atrociously wooden.  But then again IT IS a Van Damme movie and you don't go and see them for their acting or their plots.This one has some good fight scenes but JCVD never really had an opponent who was in the same league.  He simply beats the heck out of everyone.  The action takes place in Israel in the old city of Jerusalem.  Nasty cultists are planning to blow up Temple Mount on the day of the start of Ramadan the Muslem holy fasting month.  That will provoke World War Three the Christians vs. the Muslims.  Of course only JCVD can stop them.  Guess what happens in the end?  No way how did you guess???This movie is filled with action movie cliches.  When the bad guys are shooting at him when he is talking on the phone his father on the other end says What was that? and JCVD actually says I farted.  There is a scene where JCVD is driving an old 2 horsepower deux chevaux Citroen chasing bad guys in a new Mercedes and of course the old warhorse has no problems keeping up with the 300 horsepower behemoth.  Israel seems to employ a great many police officers who are completely inept at hand to hand combat yeah right and who also never draw their guns.  Instead they must think it is a brilliant strategy to outnumber the good guy 20 to 1 but attack his with fists only one at a time.  After all we all know the Israelis have never had any experience at apprehending subversives.  Finally the Israeli armed forces are so desperate for female officers that they have to employ the one and only woman both as a customs officer and as a city cop.  She of course against orders falls for JCVD and helps free him from the Israeli police thereby forever ending her law enforcement career it's so sad sob.....It's too bad JCVD can never come up with any new ideas.  There is the requisite car chase the evil plot the beautiful good cop forced to work for the bad captain the father in trouble and as usual the only one who can save the world is JCVD.  Sigh.At least the fight scenes were pretty good.".

This movie is very good. It started off actionpacked and it ended actionpacked. You could tell that Van Damme had really started to get back into exercising while watching this movie. I know from the video cover that this movie might look like another straighttohome video action flick but give this one a chance. This film clearly shows that Van Damme is still one of the best action movie stars out there today. Van Damme is in dire need of a comeback. Rent or watch this movie on t.v.

THE ORDER is an utterly predictable affair that astonishingly turns into an open ripoff of INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE towards the final proceedings with Van Damme as Indy complete with a bunch of religious bad guys his injured father an ancient underground temple and a series of traps that must be navigated. Before then the film plays its action hand with endless chases illjudged comedy laugh as you see Van Damme dress up as an Orthodox Jew! and some slowmotion martial arts action that fails to impress on every level.The film lacks both the level of violence and suspense from previous Van Damme actioners even the dark and edgy REPLICANT was miles better than this one. The action is plentiful but rarely exciting consisting of poorlyedited punchups some coolbutnotTHATimpressive car and motorbike chases the villains here intend to deport Van Damme rather than to kill him like in previous movies which makes things that bit less exciting. Most of Van Damme's opponents seem to be security guards or policemen rather than genuine evil guys until the ohsopredictable conclusion that is so its less easy to support his violent actions.One astonishing thing about this movie is the budget. Filmed in Israel with plenty of extras and props it looks impressive. Plus there's a score from noted composed Pino Donaggio. Another surprising thing is the supporting cast. I remember feeling sorry for Van Damme when he couldn't get Harvey Keitel or Ray Liotta to star in REPLICANT with him and he had to make do with Michael Rooker not that there's anything to do with cult favourite Rooker. In a 180 degree turnaround here he has screen legend Charlton Heston making a cameo appearance! Although Heston's role is a small moneygrabbing one  not that he can need much money  at least he gets to share screen time with Van Damme.Also appearing is Ben Cross another respectable actor caught up in dross here playing a corrupt police lieutenant now where have we have THAT one before? who makes our hero's life a misery. The female lead is taken by newcomer Sofia Milos making a good impression and mixing good looks with strong acting whilst the chief villain is played by none other than Brian Thompson an established bad guy for many years who is sadly underused and hidden behind a jokeshop beard this time around. THE ORDER isn't that bad a film just that the story and script scream average all the way through. With the level of talent involved  including the return of Sheldon Lettich himself responsible for some of Van Damme's most entertaining if not best movies  I expected a whole lot more from this failed attempt. Yes there is a lot of action but generally its lacking in style content and originality.".

It not hard to understand it's completely hilarious but there's also a very good story and I honestly suggest it to anyone exept young children there's a lot of swearing haha in both languages!  The movie is not too long it lasts about two hours but I never felt tired of any part. It talks a lot about hockey our national sport but the story is not all about it which allows the lessinformed viewers to understand easily There are some inside jokes with our hockey reality but only a few. Seriously I laughed I got scared I jumped I laughed again and I simply loved this movie which I recommend to you all.".

The cast was very convincing and very real.Patrick Huard succeeded in portraying his role as a lighthearted Quebecker and helped take the stress off of some events with his good sense of humor.

Some of the jokes didn't get translated quite right from English to French and I'm sure there are a few French jokes that are funnier if you are from or are familiar with Qubec. The direction was superbly done with some great juxtaposition in one of the scene. The language wasn't that bad unless you are French there's more French swearing than English and there were a couple of graphic scenes so don't take young kids. Also a good spoof of some prominent hockey figures. Rick Mercer and LouisJose Houde provide their typical comedy excellently.Overall a great movie and I strongly recommend it!".

Patrick Huard and Colm Feore are both doing an excellent job. They're supported by a great cast. I especially like Pierre Lebeau. That guy knows how to swear! Of course it's full of clichs and stereotypes that the population from the two provinces English and French have of the other. But that's why it's so funny. I hope this film does very well at the boxoffice. My guess though is that people from outside Canada will not find it as interesting. But too bad!

	schema:headline " Shamelessly uses every clich in the book and yet it works  strangely enough";
	schema:reviewBody "Imagine this scenario an English Canadian movie producer impressed by the strong box office showings of Quebec films like C.R.A.Z.Y. decides to see if he can develop a crossover product that will appeal not only to Quebecois film goers but popcorn munchers from the ROC Rest of Canada as well. So with this in mind he enlists the talent of one of Quebec's hottest leading men and begins to brainstorm how to find the winning formula.Clearly it must contain copious cultural references that bridge the language divide.. hockey! That's the ticket! Swearing yeah we'll add that too. But not just run of the mill English cusses this movie must have French ones because well French swearing is funny. You know where all this would fit in well? A buddy cop movie! Yeah we can't miss with that formula.And so the blender is set to high and the ingredients poured in. The end result is Bon Cop Bad Cop and in spite of all its clichs stereotypes telegraphed scenes and flimsy excuse for a plot the film works on some base level that defies logic.Starring the Shakespearean stage actor Colm Feore and Quebec star Patrick Huard as a quarreling Canuck version of Lethal Weapon's Riggs and Murtaugh Bon Cop Bad Cop throws virtually every hoary clich imaginable at the theater screen. A victim is found dead straddling the QuebecOntario border sign victims are killed with hockey sticks and skates to the head by a villain who wears goalie masks and dresses up as a beaver mascot. I swear the DVD extras will no doubt feature a poutine food fight that didn't make it into the final cut. If it doesn't I bet producer Kevin Tierney is kicking himself reading this Jeeze! I didn't make a poutine reference! Damn! In fact I can count the number of clichs on one hand that DIDN'T make it into this movie.I know I sound appalled by all this but strangely I left the theater having had a few albeit guilty chuckles and a fairly good time. Huard and Feore actually work well together and while I would have liked to see more attention paid to the plot the overall formula and make no mistake about it this movie is ENTIRELY formula works. In fact I actually expect to see this movie spawn a sequel irregardless of whether or not the film is able to hold its own at English Canada's box offices. Quebecers appear to love this movie. The screening I attended at an English theater in Montreal was packed like few Hollywood movies are able to these days. In this respect I think the folks behind this movie have shown they're smart as foxes knowing Quebec box office receipts should return a decent profit on their investment. If English Canada laps it up it's just so much gravy on the poutine hey if they can use the clichs so can I.Note to everyone involved if you plan giving this formula a kick at the sequel can tone down the overthetop aspects of the cultural and thematic stereotypes give Huard and Feore a truly decent mystery to solve and build on their newfound partnership instead of having them bicker over trivialities like who's going to speak what language where. If you do this you may actually have a franchise on your hands. Just one more thing if you decide to bring back Rick Mercer make sure Huard does the audience a favor and have him put a bullet though his head.".

Colm Feore is dependable as always and Patrick Huard does a nice job as a gruff Quebecois cop who lives in the flat above his exwife  so he can continue to be an involved caring dad to their precocious daughter. The film is entertaining in spots but suffers badly from not knowing exactly what it is. It begins as a gritty cop drama as evidenced by the opening torture scene that results in a body ending up on the QuebecOntario border  hence the unlikely pairing of an Ontario cop with a detective from Montreal. But it weaves back and forth between solid action sequences and a host of offkilter and regrettably not very funny comedic segments that are mostly lame and predictable. For example when a marijuana growop explodes into flames our two heroes end up stoned and can't stop giggling in front of the police Captain. Yeah yeah I know. It's about as funny as it sounds. Add a case of the munchies and an uncooperative vending machine and...well you can see where this is going. The film takes a rather unsettling turn toward broad parody when it introduces Harry Buttman as the conniving Commissioner of a fictitious professional hockey league with a penchant for moving Canadian hockey teams to American markets. Buttman is a minilookalike of Gary Bettman the Commissioner of the NHL. Buttman Bettman. Get it?? Golly I can hardly stop from slapping my thigh either. Even the killer's motive which I won't reveal here borders on being so ludicrous it threatens to sink the otherwise solid dramatic elements of the story.What gets lost in this mishmash of styles is a potentially pleasing film that given the appeal of the main characters could succeed SHOULD succeed if only it knew what it was trying to say.".

The only little problem was the drama part. Knowing that Patrick was an humorist more than a drama actor it would have been more advise not asking him too much emotional scenes. Another little problem was the text of Gabriel when she was on the chair with the maniac. She was asking his father to come for her even if he was already in front of her. I don't know if it was a translation problem I saw this movie in French.I'm proud of that film. It is for the first time a really exportable movie.".

What would a movie be like if the main guideline to the movie are the cultural differences between french Canadians from Quebec and the anglophones of Canada especially the Ontarians. Its hard to understand why this subject could be that great unless you are well aware of the situation or if you live directly in it. Basically french from Quebec and English from Ontario kind of...don't like each other. And its not only since the Maple Leafs and The Canadians hockey clubs exist its from way back...Anyways the movie itself has great acting from Patrick Huard The Frenchy in the movie from which the idea of the movie came to and Colm Feore The stiff cop from Toronto. As the movie develops itself these two fellas get in a lot of trouble and trying to work things out through their lack of understanding themselves. A joke doesn't wait another and the twists in the storyline are solid too. And if your a fan of hockey you'll find the story even more interesting since it is the background of the plot and where team names and people names The Montreal Patriotes for examples instead of the Montreal Canadians. In all I think this movie is finally the one and only thing that all politicians in Ottawa wished for...a way to unite Canada and Quebec in a good jolly laugh!!!".

The acting is perfect for the film and the anal Toronto cop is well played as a stooge to the more gallant Quebecois cop. The plot is diverting enough. It unravels nicely to allow some amusing Hockey jokes which will obviously have mass appeal across Canada. I'd advise viewers not to leave too quickly as the dream Canadian hockey announcement is made. The premise itself is believable enough not to affect the film.It's just one of those movies that makes you feel pleasantly entertained with a good few laugh aloud jokes.".

Even the action sequences weren't impossible martial art moves or cars leaping gigantic gaps in pavement they were exactly what you would expect to happen in real life.I hope this movie gets the recognition it deserves as it is one of the best I've seen for a while.

	schema:reviewBody "Bon Cop Bad Cop was a great great great GREAT movie. Definitely one I want to own. It is about 40 in French but don't let that deter anyone from going because there are subtitles and it doesn't go too fast. I preferred listening to the French dialogue rather than reading the subtitles because not everything translates smoothly and it was much funnier in French. What a hysterical movie! It's supposed to be a cop thriller but there were so many truisms and so much humor injected that really there is hardly a minute that goes by when you're not laughing at something.To sum up the premise a killer is on the loose and when a body is found half in Ontario and half in Quebec don't ask! a cop from each province is assigned to work together. The scenes in Montreal take place mostly in French with much swearing and the ones in Toronto are in English. Patrick Huard and Colm Feore are brilliant together and I really hope this becomes a series much like the Lethal Weapon series. The serial killer's motives are a bit unrealistic but it doesn't matter because the movie is so much fun. That's the only reason I took off 1 point I didn't buy the motive. But it didn't matter because I still clearly loved the movie.And let me just say how much I love seeing Montreal on screen when it is actually portraying MONTREAL! Too often our fair city is used to represent places all over the world it is so refreshing to recognize an area and lo and behold it is actually supposed to be THAT AREA. There is a scene that takes place at Spurs a countrywestern bar near my work. I love watching the movie and going hey I know that place! Other scenes took place on Mount Royal on our highways at the Old Port and more.And for a Canadian movie on a Saturday night the place was PACKED. It started at 950pm we got there at 945pm and barely found seats. People were coming in all through the previews and had to split up. Most of the audience was French but I really hope this movie finds a foothold with English audiences too because it really was great.".

I've liked Rutger Hauer since Blade Runner and even though he just keeps churning out the bmovies I just keep renting them tomorrow night I watch Redline!  But man Rutger is looking OLD in this movie  he's sporting an oldguy moustache and some extra pounds and he doesn't DO anything  he argues and drives around and breaks into a jog maybe once before the climax of the film.  Add a lumpen dislikable supporting cast including a dour Barbara Williams as his inhospitable partnerincrimesolving and after a while not only do you not CARE who the killer is but you wish she'd start knocking off a few more people!The grossout factor in this movie is quite high in a couple of scenes that arrive just when you're about to turn it off in exasperation.  The 'Bone Daddy' killer's shtik is to remove the bones from the victims while they're still alive and in this case at least mail them to our hero a former forensic pathologist who made the mistake of writing a book about 'Bone Daddy.'  It really is kinda creepy if you think about it.  It's much more suspenseful if one of your dumb friends doesn't start singing 'de knee bone's connected to de leg bone de leg bone's connected to de hip bone...' during the gory scenes incidentally.This one just screams 'midweek rental.'  Pick it up cheap it's not that bad.  Or maybe I should organize a boycott of this and all Hauer rentals until he finds an agent that gets him some better scripts to read...".

	schema:reviewBody "This formulaic but occasionally diverting thriller starring Rutger Hauer revolves around a serial killer who removes bones from his victims while they are still alive. He stops his killings and disappears. Years later Rutger Hauer's character who headed the investigation against the killer has since written a fictional novel in which the killer is actually caught. This sparks off more murders. Is it the killer returned or a copycat? That is what Rutger must find out.There is nothing really new but it is all professionally done for a BMovie. The main twist is a surprise but is one of those twists that seem unfair to the audience. We have a secondary character who is featured in the film for merely a few minutes who turns out to be the killer. These thrillers work best when you get a character which you get information about who has some impact on the plot so that you can draw up your own conclusions as to whether he or she did it or not. In a who done it such as this you need to be given clues not have the killer pulled from literally nowhere its unfair on the audience and gives them little chance of guessing who the killer is. What this does do well though is lead you up blind alleys where you suspect different people but they are not the culprits. The filmmakers do this well rather than some thrillers that will have a character acting very shiftily indeed to really ham up the possibility they may have done it.Anyway this is by no means very good but is certainly worth a rental. The acting is good and despite a rather lackadaisical ending it is never boring. 5.510".

Hauer's character William Palmer is an arrogant egotistic man who is estranged from his adult son.  His attempts to connect with his angry offspring and his grandchildren are quite interesting and eventually become central to the plot.  In addition Barbara Williams is quite good as the detective assigned to investigate the latest crimes.  I had never seen her before but I was impressed with her performance.The movie is set in Chicago.  Since I live in a Chicago suburb and work in the Loop a couple of things in the movie amused me.  First although there is some stock footage of the city it could be obvious to anyone who lives here that none of the scenes were filmed in Chicago or the surrounding area. That impression was confirmed by the thanks to the Toronto Film Commission at the end of the credits.  Second the movie makes it seem that the Cook County Medical Examiner is a major public figure.  To be honest I doubt that 90 of the people in Chicago could tell you who the M.E. is.  In addition I don't think your average M.E gets paid enough to buy a huge mansion on the lakefront.Those are minor quibbles however.  Really the movie is pretty good.".

The premise is good but it doesn't quite come off which is something of a pity. However there are some truly creepy and gruesome scenes that seem to come when you need them most as others have noted don't watch it if you're at all squeamish particularly if you have a phobia for scalpels and other sharp instruments.";

Known for action movies Hauer is quite different in his portrayal of a former medical examiner on the trail of a serial killer.This is not your average serial killer movies which is only one of a number of things that attracted me to this movie. Another thing that attracted me to Bone Daddy was the fact that the cast didn't seem to miss a beat in their performances. Everything seemed to roll along smoothly. Finally the fact that the writers carefully plotted to disguise the identity of killer until the last scene literally was a stroke of genius. Though some may think it cliche to do this I thought it worked. Bone Daddy is a complex nail biting and suspense filled thriller that combines action with drama. Rutger Hauer is at his best as is Barbara Williams. This deserves a look by everyone who is into mysteries and action. I hope you like it as much as I did.".

Yet another example of the straighttovideo trash which fills out the shelves of Blockbuster these days this is a lethargic silly thriller with only a handful of good scenes to make it worthwhile. Despite having some nice chilly locales BONE DADDY fails to build up any kind of worthwhile atmosphere due to a clichd plot and disinterested performances from the leads.Rutger Hauer has been in some good films in the past so it's sad to see him whiling away his weeks in colourless fodder like this. Hauer's detached performance fits in nicely with the coldly clinical feel to the film half bought on by the medical action on screen and half due to the certain feeling that the makers of this film were in it only for the money. Hauer has definitely been ageing of late and it's sad to see him walk around and do little wasted again in a pointless role. The rest of the cast are awful especially the talentless female lead who offers up absolutely NO sympathy.Mystery fans would be wise to avoid this film as despite having a few whodunit elements the premise is flawed as the killer turns out to be somebody who has been in the film for one scene only. Feel cheated? You should do. There's an appalling lack of characterisation meaning that the cast blur into one and you're never really sure of who the actors and actresses are meant to be and what relation they bear to the plot. I'm not sure if this was cut for television but there is virtually no gore rendering the disturbing warning at the beginning of the film pointless. We get to see a few bloody cadavers and some meaty bones but that's about it. Another thing only one person falls victim to the killer in this film. Talk about rationing this is ridiculous! I liked a couple of the more outlandish moments Hauer running through a morgue pulling out all the corpses and checking them to see if the stitches match with the murder victim plus the fun scenes which have bones being discovered in brightlycoloured parcels. Otherwise this is a strictly middling affair not bad enough to make you cry just enough to make you think why? instead. The premise in itself isn't particularly bad and I'm sure a good film could have been made of it. Pass it over unless you're stuck for something to watch.".

No. Sure there is lots and lots of bloody violence but for the most part it's just prop dummies being ripped apart while copious amounts of watery blood squirt in all directions. The kills are all awful just basically a character falling over and then a close up of a body part being ripped open. Even the one or two deaths that are a bit creative are totally ruined by a 5 budget. 2. Clever writing? No. Don't even try to figure this plot out. By the end you won't be sure if it's black magic zombies or demons. Little if anything makes any sense from one scene to the next there is simply no point to listing all the plot holes and inconsistencies. The entire story is one big WTF?. The ending is no exception. Shave off the entire last half hour and the movie actually makes more sense. 3. Hot sex? No. The girls have a distinct 'hired for their willingness to show skin' feel to them. There are some boobs and even some fullfrontal shots but certainly no sex and hardly anything you might call 'sexy'. For those ladies out there let's just say the guys all looked like closet child molesters. 4. Some good laughs? No. Perhaps the worst part of the movie is its serious tone. No jokes no tongueincheek moments that let you know the people involved weren't taking themselves too seriously. Quite the opposite the movie is extremely heavyhanded and dreary.So what IS good about this movie? Not too much. I would say it's got one or two 'gross out' moments that are memorable and maybe one or two 'gotcha' type scares. These small shining moments are completely drowned in a sea of boring dialog pointless events and nonsensical actions. I can't stress enough that nothing makes any sense.

The rest is a blur of Andreas Schnaasstyle gory retardation that doesn't really deserve much mention...I had been waiting for this film for quite a while and honestly  I wish I'd never heard of it. The only thing of ANY note on display are the few decent gore scenes that don't look totally fake. Acting? Atrocious. Paulin looks like a poor man's Philip Seymour Hoffman but with none of the talent and a horrible hairdo. He's not the only one  NO ONE in this film has a lick of acting talent. Some of the gore FX are OK...but the film is so utterly amateurish as a whole that only fans of ubermicrobudget cinema will enjoy this mess. Sorry kids I'm a gore fan as much as or more than the next guy  but there has to be a bit more than that in a film to make it worthwhile. I got really nothing else to say about this except it pretty much blows. I've seen worse  but BONE SICKNESS is a tired film in a tired genre  and honestly  it took me four viewings just to make it through this  so I'm just tired...I just pray that FETUS is better than this crap...310".

It is an absolute gem for horror fans that can look past or even enjoy a film that has that low budget charm. If you want to watch a film that puts gore before everything else this is a great choice. We get many gore gags throughout the first chunk of the film and then towards the end we get a massive MASSIVE! payoff of cheap but very well done splatter. The zombies are of the slow clunky Fulci variety and the gore is slimy dirty gooey bright splattery etc. It gets really gross.To wrap this up this is a film for low budget splatter fans who have already experienced the likes of all the classic gore films. This one is for those who want to dig a little deeper and explore cheap low budget splatter by the lesser known and established film makers. It's for people who highly regard the classic gore not that it's all about the gore of a Romero Jackson Raimi Argento Fulci etc but can also have a lot of fun with the likes of Olaf Ittenbach type splatter flicks.".

Wow man how any zombie or gore fan could dump on a movie like this when we're given such a remarkably unexpected ending is beyond me. The zombie arrival is an absolute blast of violence and brutality I haven't seen in some time perhaps ever. These zombies rampage through humanity with the force of evil itself riding shotgun. The screen is soaked in blood and organs. I even liked the reason for the zombies...credit for originality as the origin of these maniacal human hating undead swarms is brave and sinister. However...be warned you do have to tolerate the dreadful slow slow burn of a beginning. It drags. The dumping on the girlfriend is pathetic as well. Darya Zabinski is a full figured busty actress and her body is far from obese. Very curvy and attractive...it was refreshing to see a woman I found sexy with her clothes off in a movie for once.

	schema:reviewBody "I've recently read a review of this picture that said The acting in this lowbudget independent zombie film is actually surprisingly good. All of the actors and actresses who get completely naked! actually give great performances and it is obvious that they really worked hard to make sure they delivered the best performance possible. Not only was there great acting... I had to laugh. Look I'm all for giving kudos where kudos are due...but the acting in this picture was not good...it wasn't even decent. Here is a problem with indie movies...people actually think this caliber of acting is good. Acting is just as important as lighting or sound...if its bad the movie suffers. And it does...suffer.Like I said I'll give kudos where they are deserved the gore and makeup effects in Bone Sickness are incredibly good given the microbudget it was shot with. Makeup artists should take note of Paulin's detail and execution. Excellent job in this category.Another area this movie excels is in the nudity. I don't know how Paulin managed to get multiple cute girls completely naked...but he did and I don't think they were strippers. Gore and nudity sells horror films...and the nudity in this film is a great bonus. Too bad the lead girl has to lay down to show her boobs...they are huge and should have been shown with her standing up not on her back. I suppose they must sag and this was the most flattering of positions...but still they are too big to not see standing up. The red head in the film had an especially nice figure and she got fully nude...excellent! It's ashame that other than the nudity gore effects and makeup...the movie slouches to a 1 star picture. The camera they shot it on wasn't very good certainly not HD and the DP and lighting designer if they had one didn't know how to optimize picture quality. There were also far too many slow motion effects which looked horrible and digitizedif it looks bad don't do it unless you absolutely have to. Paulin uses slowmo nearly a dozen times...and they all look like crap.The sound was passable but still suffered from your typical nobudget film issues blips background noise jumping up and down inaudible dialog...I don't imagine they used a boom once I could be wrong.Paulin...take my advice. Go to Hollywood and be a makeup artistyou'll do quite well for yourself. Don't direct pictures. Yes they may sell because your gore and nudity are awesome...but the movies storyline acting lighting and sound need a lot of work. It's really sad that you not only cast yourself as one of the leads but it's even sadder that you're the most natural actor in the cast which isn't saying much.Sorry about the bad review. I think you need to drop directing and focus on what you're good at gore and makeup.".

Unfortunately Thomas has been using bones from bodies he has dug up from graveyards  as such they are infected with parasites look I didn't write this crap OK? which turns Alex's insides into maggots  worms which he starts to puke up  sht out when he goes to the toilet. Then for no reason whatsoever all the bodies in the graveyard come back to life as flesh eating zombies  start to kill  eat everyone...Bone Sickness is pretty much a homemade film shot on a camcorder principally by Rich George  Brian Paulin virtually every credit during the end goes to one or both of them from staring in it to editing it filming it building the sets doing the special effects  just about everything else including the stunt driving! You know sometimes we take things for granted little things like films which make sense  are well made so when a film as truly dire  amateurish as Bone Sickness comes along it makes you appreciate universally hated  panned films like Catwoman 2004 just that little bit more. First off lets talk about the story in Bone Sickness or rather the complete lack of it things seemingly happen at random virtually nothing is explained let alone makes any sense the plot twists are terrible when the guy gets an axe in his head at the start Alex was sick in bed so it couldn't have been him there's no sense of time or location  as for the final ten minutes in the graveyard when those devil looking type creatures appear the film completely loses the viewer  becomes one of the biggest messes in film history. Bone Sickness is a disaster it's a amateur homemade horror film that is really really bad in every way although the fact that the final thirty or forty minutes is wall to wall gore prevents the dreaded 1 star out of 10 it's just a shame the gore effects are so poor.From a filmmaking point of view Bone Sickness is a mess  as bad as any film you will ever see enthusiasm for the genre just isn't enough. I mean I could make a horror film on my camcorder using my friends  family does that automatically mean it should get released on DVD  mean people actually want to watch it? No I didn't think so. The lighting is horrible the photography is strictly point  shoot with no closeups or establishing shots which gives it a really horrible choppy feel the editing is poor  he never knows when to cut away  the special effects are terrible with the worst looking fake blood I've ever seen it's more like red water. To give some credit where it's due there are plenty of gore from ripped off arms intestine eating autopsy scenes stomachs being ripped open branches stuck in peoples necks throat biting face melting babies ripped from pregnant women head smashing decapitations bodies cut in half rotten zombies lots of red water sorry I mean blood splashed about everywhere people blown up with grenades people shot heads ripped in half both vertically  horizontally  all sorts of bodily mutilation but it all just looks so poor  a lot of the same effects are repeated more than once. There's a disgusting moment when Alex spews up a load of worms real worms so the poor guy actually had to hold them in his mouth to shoot the scene. He also eats them back up again two scenes which are hard to watch if your squeamish but when you think about it nothing more extreme than what the Jackass  Dirty Sanchez boys do. The film looks awful as well with poor photography shot on a camcorder  probably edited on a home PC movie making software package.The IMDb lists the budget for Bone Sickness as a mere 3000 which if true is an incredibly small amount to make a 90 odd minute film on no matter how bad it is. The makers certainly get my congratulations for sticking with it  making a film on that sort of money but it's still absolutely awful in every respect. There's a constant buzz on the soundtrack which is noticeably out of sync at times  the whole film is just so amateurish it becomes a real chore to sit through. The acting is awful  among the worst ever committed to film seriously these people are obviously just friends  family of George  Paulin.Bone Sickness is one of the poorest most badly made films I've ever seen  that's no exaggeration. The story is none existent  makes no sense  it's incredibly hard to sit through one worm puking scene is the only gross thing here since all the other effects are so poor. The sort of film which literally leaves you speechless.".

	schema:headline " All we want out of a zombie movie";
	schema:reviewBody "BONE SICKNESS 2004 This one is the fan made cheap zombie movie to end all fan made cheap zombie movies. It starts out with a grave robbery a little too dark and a graphic Axe to the face. So far so good. After the creepy credits we meet Alex Producer Rich George and his wife Kristen Darya Zabinski. Alex is very sick and his wife is feeding him something to help his bones. This is her attempt at alternative medicine. We know the crunchy things are not granola. Kristen snaps at Alex for puking. She goes to meet her grave robberTommy Writer director Triple Threat Brian Paulin one of Alex's best pals. She uses a knife on the bones of the dead to extract the marrow feeding it to Alex to cure his bone sickness. Meanwhile two cops are on spook patrol at the graveyard when something breaks out the windows of their patrol car and murders them both. Lots of screaming and gouts of phony blood later we see the investigation. Two cops and a night watchman have been murdered at the graveyard and someone's responsible!

Refreshing to see some male nudity in these things for a change. With the size of the breasts on the women in this movie I can see that there will be plenty of those things on display later! Did I say later? The nudity and gore are plentiful only twenty minutes in! Kristen has a dream where she's making love to the dead! So disgusting! Yay!! Now a completely gratuitous scene showing Alex on the toilet... pounding out...worms!!! Lots of them!! After puking tons of wormy puke Poor Alex is freaking out. Oh its okay now he's eating the worms he puked. More nudity .....this is shaping up nicely.Forty Minutes in we get our first Zombie. This one is a grave crawler and he's pretty funky too. Well howdy! Now the graveyard is filled with grave crawlers ala Return of the Living Dead and they be a shuffling. More gratuitous t and a and we followers of Zombie movies know that a long sustained Zombie siege is imminent. Bring it on ! This is the first zombie attack in a pool that I have ever seen. Yup all that nonsense about eating the dead really starts to pay off here for the second half. I can see that this is gonna be one Eyetie level zombie after another. The cops are SO stupid! The grue gets thick and deep here with gunshots to the head an Axe and a circular saw variously employed to horrific effect. All sorts of obscurely motivated foolishness later the zombies lay siege to Tommy and Andrea. These are definitely Fulci type Zombies not your Romero shufflers. Which is okay with me I love them all. Alex however is now a living Zombie a first for me. God I love this movie ! There's all kinds of gooey horrific things going on here. The cops are SO stupid! But they ARE heavily armed. Are they making love or being eaten? It's hard to tell but I like it. Guts spilling out fevered dreams gore galore. How nasty can it get? Woo Hoo! Arterial spray really makes my day. Buckets of blood. How long can the blood spray out after one has been decapitated? Not this long I'm sure. This puts Land of the Dead to shame. Oh this must be Alex....Sweet Revenge...Now Tommy's a living Zombie...This is more an homage to the Italian Zombie movies bad acting and all...but hey at least they ACT.The ending is as wild a ride as I've ever seen. It switches abruptly into a Romero movie complete with obviously risky amateur stunts and some of the most effective make up work I've ever seen in an amateur production.I urge all of you living suckers to check this one out.".

	onyx:emotionText "BONE SICKNESS 2004 This one is the fan made cheap zombie movie to end all fan made cheap zombie movies. It starts out with a grave robbery a little too dark and a graphic Axe to the face. So far so good. After the creepy credits we meet Alex Producer Rich George and his wife Kristen Darya Zabinski. Alex is very sick and his wife is feeding him something to help his bones. This is her attempt at alternative medicine. We know the crunchy things are not granola. Kristen snaps at Alex for puking. She goes to meet her grave robberTommy Writer director Triple Threat Brian Paulin one of Alex's best pals. She uses a knife on the bones of the dead to extract the marrow feeding it to Alex to cure his bone sickness. Meanwhile two cops are on spook patrol at the graveyard when something breaks out the windows of their patrol car and murders them both. Lots of screaming and gouts of phony blood later we see the investigation. Two cops and a night watchman have been murdered at the graveyard and someone's responsible! A detective stops Tommy in the graveyard as he is going about his gruesome work but Tommy successfully lies to the cop and gets more bones for Alex to suck on. Lots of worms and bugs add to the overall creep factor in this scene. Tommy s wife Andrea uses the meat from the fridge to make hamburgers. I imagine that this is a big mistake.

Personally I'm cool with it but this s.o.v. badass will force nay sayers to overlook the obvious flaws like that as well as the 30 budget. Earthshattering gore is one thing but was the wormvomiting really necessary? Oh yeah it really really was!! Alex has a rare bone disease and pretty much has no chance of living he is looked after by his hot wife Kristen who is slowly losing hope. Eventually Kristen seeks the help of Alex's friend Thomas the director to help find a cure. Thomas's cure you ask? Why bones of course yeah bones of the dead will now be fed to the sickly Alex. You see Thomas works in a morgue so stuff like that is simple for good ol' Tom. Whatever you need as long as dead bodies are involved. What's funny is that this bonemarrow medication is actually starting to work yay for Alex!! What's not so funny is that the dead do not appreciate people stealing their bones and they're just about ready to rise up and kill everybody in a really gory manner apparently because they're all sore at Thomas. Actually that's pretty funny too.We certainly have a doozy on our hands here don't we? The truth is if any gore film has ever even remotely given Peter Jackson's Dead Alive a run for its money well gang here it is. Not only that but Bone Sickness aside from the gore can actually be kind of interesting and I know why listen to me when there's already so many other negative reviews for this? All I can say is that those people are liars and that they're all probably jealous because none of them could ever shoot something this awesome on video or I don't know they probably just don't dig stuff that was shot on video. But really Bone Sickness is at least as good as Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence or at least a Todd Sheets film. If gory livingdead epics with a hopeless vibe is your cup of tea Burial Ground is also a must see. For something else from Brian Paulin the maniac who directed this atrocity check out Fetus. Well done Mr. Paulin you have created one repulsive work of art that will sooner or later become legendary. Keep up the good work. 910".

That's all there is to it straight up front and aside from some marginally good gore gags there is little to redeem it.That being said this movie is one of those little gems in the genre that is so horrendously bad it's good. It may very well be a turd but it's a turd with a quirky unintentional charm. This is the type of movie you watch with a couple of your friends and a 6 pack or two and prepare to have a laughing good time. There are more WTF moments creatively visually and plot wise than you can even bother to count. From making theories as to just what the hell is happening to trying to figure out the point of a particular character to guessing what the writerdirector was smoking when making this monstrosity of a bad movie it's loads of roaring unintentional fun.As I stated before the gore is halfway decent as a bonus with a few particular moment almost falling just shy of somewhat creative. This is not a good movie not by a longshot but if you're looking for some sleazy garbage cinema to watch with your buddies and generally have a nice good laugh this is for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well this movie is a Bmovie no doubt about it. You know that right away when you noticed that both the producer and director is also on the acting list as starring in the movie themselves.Truth be told then it is not the worst of low budget zombie movies that I have sat through. And for a movie of this particular caliber and budget then the end result was actually fair.The story in Bone Sickness is about a guy who is suffering from a debilitating bone condition and in an effort to help him recover and get cured his wife and friend have come up with an alternative method in an attempt to save his life. But this method has dire consequences and brings along with it something that should be eternally asleep.I have to comment on the DVD cover though because it is truly a great DVD cover that is given no justice by the actual movie. And the cover is possibly as far as from the actual movie as you could get. The artwork on the cover is intriguing and interesting which leads to an illusion that the movie is more than it actually is. So don't get suckered in by the DVD cover. And while on the topic of the DVD cover then it says special edition as well. Wait? So there is more than one version of this movie. And just does this low budget movie offer on the special edition compared to the ordinary version? I am intrigued.There is a bit too much unnecessary and purposeless nudity throughout the movie which just dragged the movie down a notch to a level of immaturity and stupidity that the movie could have done without. It was just like watching a horror movie from the mid 1980's just doesn't work well in even back in 2004.The acting in the movie well yeah it was amateurish but still they did good enough jobs with their roles and most importantly seemed like they were in it for making a zombie movie. So thumbs up on that account.Effectswise then Bone Sickness is a low budget movie in every sense and the effects are not overly great. But you have to admire the effort and creativity put into the movie. The zombies looked like something from the late 1970 to mid 1980's Italian zombie movies so I suppose that is a matter of preference whether or not you like that. The scenes with the worms and insects was interesting and actually cool that they did them but those scenes really didn't help the movie along all that much.The sound in the movie could have benefited from some better equipment or some postproduction work. The sound was a little bit too gritty compared to the overall touch of the movie.Personally then I didn't get the thing with having to show scorpions scuttling about. That had absolutely nothing to do with the story nor did it help promote the storyline in any possible way.Bone Sickness is worth a single watching especially if you are a fan of low budget zombie movies. However if you are in it for a massive million dollar Hollywood budget production you had best find your kicks elsewhere.".

And while on the topic of the DVD cover then it says special edition as well. Wait? So there is more than one version of this movie. And just does this low budget movie offer on the special edition compared to the ordinary version? I am intrigued.There is a bit too much unnecessary and purposeless nudity throughout the movie which just dragged the movie down a notch to a level of immaturity and stupidity that the movie could have done without. It was just like watching a horror movie from the mid 1980's just doesn't work well in even back in 2004.The acting in the movie well yeah it was amateurish but still they did good enough jobs with their roles and most importantly seemed like they were in it for making a zombie movie. So thumbs up on that account.Effectswise then Bone Sickness is a low budget movie in every sense and the effects are not overly great. But you have to admire the effort and creativity put into the movie. The zombies looked like something from the late 1970 to mid 1980's Italian zombie movies so I suppose that is a matter of preference whether or not you like that. The scenes with the worms and insects was interesting and actually cool that they did them but those scenes really didn't help the movie along all that much.The sound in the movie could have benefited from some better equipment or some postproduction work. The sound was a little bit too gritty compared to the overall touch of the movie.Personally then I didn't get the thing with having to show scorpions scuttling about. That had absolutely nothing to do with the story nor did it help promote the storyline in any possible way.Bone Sickness is worth a single watching especially if you are a fan of low budget zombie movies. However if you are in it for a massive million dollar Hollywood budget production you had best find your kicks elsewhere.";

	schema:reviewBody "Yeah like pretty much every other horror movie that hits the theaters this one took a pretty heavy trashing both from the critics and from the audiences who didn't understand it.  However I found Bones to be a highly enjoyable entertaining and at times creepy horror flick that I hope is the birth of a new franchise.  It's very refreshing to see a horror flick that can take a standard premise and make it seem fresh again.  Also I enjoyed the killer being a someone who we can sympathize with. Let me break it down a little bit. Back in 1979 Jimmy Bones was the man of his neighborhood.  Just what all he was into is never fully explained but we do know that he runs a pretty classy little nightclub and loves to dress in fullpimp getup.  Basically Bones is a good guy.  All he wants to do is run his business and take care of his people.  However when he is propositioned to bring in crack he refuses and is doublecrossed then murdered by people he thought he could trust.  Jump twenty years into the future and we get a group of twentysomethings who have just bought the building where Bones was murdered.  Hoping to turn the place into a club they ignore all warnings of the place's evil and pretty soon they mess around and wake the dead.  Now that Bones is back he's upset understandably and wants revenge on the people who did him wrong.That's it.  Kinda sounds like Nightmare On Elm Street right?  Well it's a lot like it and a lot of others you may have seen.  What set this one apart for me was the lead.  Casting Snoop Dog as Jimmy Bones was perfect.  I've never been a big fan of his acting but here he pulls it off great giving us a villain that we can sympathize with care about and root for.  We know where he's coming from and watching him take his revenge on the dispicable villains was fun fun fun.  I also enjoyed the romantic angle brought to the film by the chemistry between Snoop and Pam Grier.  I don't think that it would have gone down near as well had there been a different set of actors but it gave a real soft side to Bones and made me like him that much more.I really loved the cinematography and having the blood look intentionally fake was also a nice touch.  Unlike some others I really enjoyed the shifting in tones. The first 23 of the picture had a really dark and gothic tone to it while the latter third had a little bit of comic relief thrown in.  Yes it went WAY over the top the severed heads that whole world of the dead bit but for me that added to the overall joy of the film and made it that much more.  It also made it  VERY hard to take it serious. It's pretty hard to find a good horror flick these days and a mainstream one at that and I'm sure that I'll be adding this one to my dvd collection pretty soon.  Oh I don't think I'm giving too much away here the door is left open for a whole slew of sequels.  I can't wait.".

As anyone who's read any of my other reviews can see I like cheap thrills just as much as a good movie and although Bones certainly was cheap cheesy silly and not in the slightest bit scary I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd thought I would.The reasoning for this is that Bones is exactly like any other directtovideo midnight cable fare only at theatrical release midday payperview pricing.  The reason I like other cheap films so much is because they are just that  cheap.  I'm biased I expect a lot more from a movie that I shell out 9 for in a theatre than a 2 5day rental.In 1979 Jimmy Bones Snoop Dogg! is your friendly neighborhood numbersrunner.  A crooked cop a drug dealer and his business associate try to convince him to bring crack to the hood.  Bones is a numbersrunner with morals and a love for his people and won't allow it.  The business meeting ends with his murder.In 2001 the neighborhood has gone to hell especially Bones' old mansion which is currently haunted by a big black dog with bloodred eyes.  A group of teen wannabe DJ's who also just happen to be the children of Bones' old associate decide to fix up the mansion and turn it into a happening nightclub.  They discover Bones' skeleton buried in the basement and a stray dog whom they name Bones how original!.  This dog just happens to be the same killer incarnation of Jimmy Bones' ghost and every life he takes adds life to the bones in the basement until Jimmy is resurrected from the dead and he sure is angry!This film equal parts horror comedy and blaxploitation begs you not to take it seriously.  If you do like most films of this type you'll notice the atrocious acting and cheap special effects.  If not however you'll be intrigued by bleeding pool tables talking severed heads and a climax in the city of the dead that is actually well done and far surpasses the rest of the film.  Unfortunately it lacks the campy charm of any of the above mentioned three genres.I knew from the trailers and movie posters not to take this movie seriously. Even taking it as nonseriously as I could I just couldn't enjoy it it's a lowbrow wolf of a film trying to pass itself off in theatrical sheep's clothing.  Honestly if I had found this on the back shelf of some cheap video store I would've loved it.  In a theatre I just expect more from films.".

	schema:reviewBody "An attempt to make a moderndress Gothic melodrama that is just not successful. Ernest Dickerson has a good grasp of the iconography of horror films but he can't put them together well enough to make a good scary movie. He borrows concepts and images liberally from Clive Barker Dario Argento and Mario Bava  but all it shows is that he's a good copycat not that he's a good stylist. From the idea of evil reviving itself by consuming a victim Barker's Hellraiser but cinematic ally dating at least back to Hammer's Dracula Prince of Darkness from 1965 thru the rain of maggots Argento's magisterial Suspiria to the disembodied hand reaching out of the darkness to torment the dead man's lover Bava's masterpiece Whip and the Body there really is nothing here that we haven't seen before and better. The conceit of setting it in a ghetto with an allblack cast promises an interesting variation on your basic revenge from beyond the grave scenario but beyond the music and fashions it's still a pretty clichd film. One of the problems is that Dickerson just can't seem to leave well enough alone  like the maggot scene. OK it's raining maggots and it's terrifying we get it already is it really necessary to go for the grossout by showing people EATING them? Or the scene where Maurice is killed  again the dogspirit eats Maurice to give form and substance to Bones' cadaver we get it it's not necessary to linger on the details of the chowdown. It's never scary  just disgusting. Even his attempts to inject humor are forced and heavyhanded with the idiotic scenes of Bones carrying the heads of his victims and having them carry on an interminably pointless conversation. And again he doesn't show it to us once there's at least three long scenes with the chatty heads so whatever humor there was is pounded into unconsciousness thru repetition. But the most glaring problem with this movie is that we are asked to sympathize with a character who is at bottom just as big a bad guy in life as the crack dealers who murder him. Dickerson tries to show us Bones as the protector of his 'hood but come on  he's exploiting his people just as much with his numbers game or did it never occur to anyone to ask how Bones got the money for his supahdupah fly crib when everyone else around him lives in complete poverty? For a MUCH better horror movie that reflects the black urban experience rent Tales from the Hood instead.".

And his ghost floats around this bizarre abandoned mansion that is suddenly claimed by a handful of neighborhood teens who want to turn the pit into a party palace. Bones Snoop is terrorizing the people in the house as his ghost floats around in pergatory aiming to take revenge those who stabbed him in a drug deal gone wrong. Why he chose that moment to take his revenge or why he goes after the teens is unclear. Bone's old woman played by Pam Grier a good actress wasted in yet another trashy movie is psychic and can tell that something bad is brooding in the air. There was a special effects paradox at work in this film. On the one hand the production crew goes out of their way with some fantastic if not innovative special effects moment and you need plenty of them with a story so thin as this. And towards the end of the movie they really take advantage of all of this. On the other hand for all of the bloodbath scenes the production crew is very generous with this cheap looking fake blood which is nothing more than bright red paint. How stupid. Actually the whole movie was pretty stupid. But at least they did try here and there to do something a little different both in story elements and special effects although it was still a bad movie. And at least it was something you can really laugh at whereas the other movies I mentioned can just really make you homicidal they're so dreadful in story and special effects.".

If your answer to the above question is I agree then you could have been or may well be part of the team of monkeys that came up with the idea for wrote and cast this movie. It's a huge shame that stuff like this gets made when there are screenwriters and directors with good ideas and just need some money. Speaking of money if you want to waste it Bones is as good a film as any to waste it on. Well if you like to waste money and you enjoy pain that is. Bones is notable for one of the most incredible reasons a film can be notable for and that is that it stars a rapper. The rapper in question is Snoop Dogg a.k.a. Dogg Snoopy Snoop Doggy Dogg Snoop and just about every other lame variant of the words 'snoop' and 'dogg' that you can come up with. The tired blend of Hellraiser and rubbish movie starring a rapper see Snoop Dogg get to flex his acting muscles and he proves with his onenote performance in this movie that he is just as adept at the art of acting as he is at the art of music making. If you catch my drift.To be quite frank despite his best efforts to look cool Snoopy Doggy Dogg ends up looking like just as much of an idiot as his name suggests he is. I mean seriously who goes by the name of 'Snoop Dogg' when they don't have to? Aside from it's star this film has a number of other problems. It's plot is very tired and it follows the exceedingly boring and familiar tale of someone who was killed being resurrected and then taking their revenge. The tacky dialogue duff acting and illogical plotting don't help this and not even the murders can save the film as it's easy to say that even they manage to score maximum points on the dull scale. I will never forgive the people responsible for this movie for wasting all that time and money on it when it could have been put to better use. How about giving one of the more experienced directors who could produce something good if given a budget? I guess that's one of the many problems with things like rap music if it sells it will continue to be made.".

I mean seriously who goes by the name of 'Snoop Dogg' when they don't have to? Aside from it's star this film has a number of other problems. It's plot is very tired and it follows the exceedingly boring and familiar tale of someone who was killed being resurrected and then taking their revenge. The tacky dialogue duff acting and illogical plotting don't help this and not even the murders can save the film as it's easy to say that even they manage to score maximum points on the dull scale. I will never forgive the people responsible for this movie for wasting all that time and money on it when it could have been put to better use. How about giving one of the more experienced directors who could produce something good if given a budget? I guess that's one of the many problems with things like rap music if it sells it will continue to be made.";

	schema:reviewBody "The name Jimmy Bones strikes fear into the hearts of all who hear it. Back in 1979 he ruled the street now after his death over twenty years later Jimmy Bones is still in charge. After a group of teens buy Jimmy's building and turn it into a dance club his sprit is released and he goes on a bloody rampage seeking revenge on his killers. Sounds like a horror movie doesn't it? It even looks and feels like a horror movie. But if it's a horror movie your expecting you may be in for a little disappointment. We spend the entire film switching back and forth from 1979 to the present day. The 1979 scenes seem to be knocking on blacksplotion flicks. The present day scenes are a parody of new age fright flicks. Between the two settings everything seems to be played for laughs and it works wonderfully well. Back in 1979 there is everything you would expect to see in a blacksplotion flick the afros the sideburns the stylish clothes and they even use phrases like kracker Saturday mourning special and you know what? It's pretty darn funny. Now we move to the present day. Seems like everyone in the film knows that they are ripping off House on Haunted Hill there is even a reference to Vincent Price in there somewhere. You can also see all of your favourite old school horror cliches projectile vomit made of maggots the pipes that bleed the severed head that still talk even after they have been decapitated the pool table that bleeds after it is cut and the perfect silhouettes of blood that splatter on the wall. But what makes it so enjoyable is not the fact that we have seen it all before it is how we get the feeling that film makers don't want us to take the film seriously they just want us to sit back and enjoy. The film has a very fun atmosphere surrounding it and that is something that you don't find often in horror flicks today. The script is so clever you almost have to let out a chuckle because everything that happens is so predictable. What do you think will happen when a turn table group called the Resurrection Brothers enter a haunted house or when you find a dog with glowing red eyes that attacks you and you keep him and call it Bones? It's almost like the fact that everything is so stupid and cliched that it comes off as being smart. Now I'm not saying that everything is all fun and games. Director Ernest R. Dickerson throws in some very distorted camera angles and creepy imagery to keep the horror fans please and the meek on the edge of their seats and it comes off rather effective. Snoop Dogg is wilding over the top and entertaining as Jimmy Bones who could very well have been making the next Crow film right here without anyone knowing and blacksplotion queen Pam Grier can also be seen as Bones' girl. The special effects are very enjoyable whether they are serious the night club explosion or amusing the talking head or even just plain bad the fake looking blood and not to mention there is never an absence of gore through out. If I didn't know any better I would have to say that this is a feel good movie. So if you are looking for an entertaining nod to the old school that doesn't require and thinking or logic than you are in for one of the summers best horror flicks it not you'd better just pass this one by.".

I want to review this film as a movie that tells a story like every other film. I don't want to review this as a film that tried to beat its preceding film adaptation. I myself have read the book and have always been so intrigued with the character of Gatsby and when I heard a few years back that he would be portrayed on the big screen by DiCaprio I couldn't wait. The character carries such a mystery about him that was delivered so excellently by Leonardo DiCaprio and made it so fun to watch. It was almost like I didn't know what the ending was because I was so immersed in 1920s New York and in the lifestyle of The Great Gatsby. The film itself as a film was awesome! The visuals and soundtrack were captivating and lavish. The acting was great overall as you can trust these actors to deliver.I read somewhere on IMDb message board or another reviewer I can't remember that Leonardo wasn't a good fit for the role of Gatsby. I think this statement couldn't be more wrong. If you have read the book you must have some idea about the depth of Gatsby's character the depth of his mind his desires. The false smiles the phony handshakes the uneasiness in being in public the way Jay Gatsby conducts himself in front of Daisy and in pursuit of her. All these things are delivered so well by DiCaprio. His nerve his frustration his determination...all so eloquently portrayed. But most of all his passion and as Nick Carraway our narrator so emphatically reminds us his hope. The character development of Jay Gatsby and the development of all those surrounding him gives us such a deep look at the relationships of such a diverse category of people.The storyline is obviously interesting A man realizes his new neighbor is a mysterious and incredibly wealthy man. Like how awesome is that? Throughout the whole film as the relationships between all the few main characters become deeper and deeper and the questions become answered you just can't help but feel so into the characters' lives. Great writing for the characters great directing great great great acting. Overall this is just a great film. If you go into the theater thinking oh this'll suck compared to Robert Redford or I bet the book is way better you're setting yourself up for a bad 143 minutes. Don't be so close minded and try to view it as just another film that tells a fictional story and a great one at that.".

	schema:reviewBody "Baz Luhrmann really has outdone himself in this film. The cast is beautiful as is the script. The scenes are a visual feast. It is as if Luhrmann reached into Fitzgerald's vision of the 20's pulled out the heart of it and merged it with what society is today over nine decades later. Alongside personal strife we see social inequality abuse of drugs and alcohol political and moral corruption and the failure of financial institutions and their responsibility to people. This film will make you feel that these issues will always be relevant and that not much changes from generation to generation.The achingly romantic and hopeful Gatsby is played impeccably by DiCaprio. He has aged into a beautiful man while still possessing those boyish good looks. The beginning of the film has the viewer itching to see Gatsby and hear him speak and when he finally appears he holds on and captivates throughout the film. The film may awaken something in you a memory of when you were crazy in love with a person or in love with an idea for what your life should be. DiCaprio embodies a dream and makes you root for him even though he is shown to be a liar and a man who is desperately trying to steal another's wife all that does not matter because we see the gentle childlike frailty in him and identify with it. DiCaprio is an excellent actor and was perfect for the role.I must say that I didn't think that Mulligan can pull the role of Daisy who in my mind was supposed to be a flawless beauty. However she didn't disappoint. It made Gatsby's love and desire for her even more fascinating she was beautiful to him and that's all that mattered. Mulligan was able to play the spoiled and dazed rich girl well while adding an emotional dimension to the character. Tobey Mcguire definitely held his own and his story line had an interesting deviation from the novel which was enjoyable. All in all I think it is a must see this year for movie buffs.".

Giving away nothing the film begins at a brisk and overly flamboyant pace but after a bit it hits what I like to call Baz's golden point slows to absolute perfection. That first half hour will leave more than a few shaking their heads but power through it and you will find The Great Gatsby in all its glory. Luhrman stays as true to the source as he can and Dicaprio gives yet another glorious performance. If I'm going to be honest I think a lot of the negative reviews coming in are due to the classic status of the book people want to act like the hours of school discussions should make this film less fanciful and serious 100 percent of the time. Thing is we have that version twice over in the 1974  2000 adaption. Gatsby 2013 is beautiful over the top heart wrenching and thoroughly enjoyable flick that I shall always highly recommend.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE GREAT GATSBY There is no movie I have been more prepared to dislike than this one. How dare some Aussie come over here and tell us about the meaning of one of the great works of American literature. Especially this Aussie Baz Luhrmann who is known to overload overhype and overcook his theatrical product into a glittery miasma of small meaning and little consequence. i.e. Moulin Rouge But I was wrong.Jay Gatsby has achieved success in a fashion beyond most imaginations excepting his own. In true Horatio Alger tradition he has worked hard to improve himself but when his past creeps up on him and threatens his well crafted self image he suavely and effortlessly changes it his past and he inhabits the change until it becomes the reality. He is the self made American man in every way. He is the American success myth both personified and perverted.Unlike Alger's heroes he has not followed the straight and narrow. He has acquired his fabulous wealth through bootlegging and stock swindles. This belief that he can change his past to correct it as it were has given him a veneer of respectability that has put him in good stead with his underworld connections. But it is not for them that Gatsby has made this remarkable metamorphosis. No he did everything and I mean everything for the love of a woman. Daisy was Gatsby's great love but he lost her and now in one final herculean effort he is going to correct his past this one last time. He is going to win her back and make things as they should have been.Leo DeCaprio is the only actor of this generation that could play Gatsby just as Robert Redford could only play Gatsby the previous generation. Redford's Gatsby seemed reticent and insecure about his past regretful that he must live a lie in order to accomplish his goal. DeCaprio's Gatsby is forceful decisive he is a determined man of significant accomplishment and great ability. He has a plan and he is going to execute it and as far as he is concerned for all the right reasons. For myself it is DeCaprio's best and most powerful performance. This decision both DeCaprio's and Luhrmann's to take Gatsby down from some ethereal literary icon into a flesh and blood human being gives the movie an intensity that the 1974 version and most of the literary criticism of the book that I have ever read never perceived. This is not a shining white knight rescuing a damsel in distress this is a bare knuckles brawl for the hand of Daisy and she is going to have to choose. Tom Buchanan Joel Edgerton is Gatsby's antagonist. He and Daisy were married when Daisy could no longer wait for Gatsby to prove himself worthy of her. Tom is as rich maybe even richer than Gatsby but his money is old he is an aristocrat with a deep sense of entitlement. He has status and wealth because he's supposed to have status and wealth and he's not about to give up all that and certainly not his wife to this new money usurper Gatsby without a fight.Bruce Dern played Tom as a kind of loopy Dern's specialty racial conspiracy nut but Edgerton gives Tom a much harder edge. When Tom espouses his vile racial philosophies one might think that someday he might actually do something about it.Daisy Carey Mulligan is a tough role. For all the time that Gatsby spends trying to prove he is good enough for Daisy the audience for the book or the film is led down the path that she is not good enough for him. Mia Farrow played Daisy as an airhead and a dingbat but Mulligan gives Daisy a bit more spine and fashions a character that has a pretty good idea where her selfinterests lay. Luhrmann and cowriter Craig Pearse stay pretty close to the text with a few additions and devices most notably to those of us who read the book know that it is Nick Caraway Tobey Maguire who tells the story and is a firsthand witness to all the events but we never knew from where he tells the story. Luhrmann tells us it is from a sanitarium where Nick is drying out from excessive alcoholism. As for Luhrmann's reputation for excess Well he certainly visualizes Gatsby's parties as excess but they are supposed to be excessive excessive materialism is part of the point of the story. There are times when Luhrmann can't resist himself and feels the compulsion to punctuate matters with some visual flourish but I did not find it too distracting. His decision to go 3D however I think was wise. The characters seem to come out of the screen and get next to you. You get to know them personally and after all this is a very personal story.I think this story has survived the test of time so well because it is basically a love story. Whatever the viewers or readers opinion of the characters are Gatsby and Daisy do love each other but Fitzgerald was not interested in boy meets girl boy loses girl boy gets girl and they all live happily ever after. Where Fitzgerald reached his own aspiration of creating high art is in wondering if living happily ever after is even possible in an age of class consciousness even class warfare that is driven by a compulsive materialism in a world changing so fast that we can't even formulate the question before we have to come up with an answer. Luhrmann stays true to these themes and displays an avid curiosity about them himself. What he has created is a work of art that stands very well on its own.check out httpblognmovies.tumblr.com".

	schema:headline " The Great Gatsby Review";
	schema:reviewBody "Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby is fairly accurate to the classic novel and keeps most of its themes intact. However Luhrmann's own flair adds a new dimension to the story. Visually this film is incredibly stunning. From grand sets to the detailed period dresses this film is a treat for the eyes. Never once does it not take your breath away from its impressive scenery. Many people might be worried about the updated music but there is nothing to fear. JayZ's track works incredible well with the film and complements the era in which it is set.The direction in this film is impeccable. The cinematography is marvelous and really lets the viewer absorb the sheer artistry that has gone into making this film. Luhrmann keeps a high level of energy throughout the film and the party sequences are choreographed and edited in a way that it makes you feel envious of not being apart of it. Editing in the film is seamless and really keeps the viewer engaged. A common criticism the film receives is that it is more style than substance however I must disagree. This modern interpretation doesn't forget its themes and morals from the classic F. Scott Fitzgerald tale.Performances are phenomenal by the entire cast. Carey Mulligan's Daisy is every bit as careless as one would expect but she also manages to show some complexity in her role. Tobey Maguire is a great avatar for us to take on as we enter this film. He is very much the viewer as he sees everything happening but is ultimately helpless to change anything. The true standouts in the film are Joel Edgerton and Leonardo DiCaprio. Edgerton as Tom Buchanan brings a lot of personality to his character that I thought was absent in the book. He's a bit more tender and more vulnerable especially when he finds out his wife's secret. The true award recognition worthy performance comes from DiCaprio's Gatsby. He hones on being a respectable but idealistically insane man. His performance is not only compelling but also charming and quit hopeful. He truly deserves some recognition come Oscar season.Overall The Great Gatsby is a fantastically entertaining and enthralling film. It is horribly underrated as it is filled with awards worthy visuals sets costumes direction and performances. It is a great time at the movies for anyone that enjoys the classic novel or who haven't even heard of it. Not only is this film dramatically satisfying but also quite humorous and a spectacle like no other. I give it 4.55 a great adaptation of one of the greatest novels ever written.".

In retrospect as in halfway through the movie it just clicked Leonardo was perfect. He wasn't Redford but in my humble opinion better! He nailed it portraying Gatsby as this truly multidimensional character. At first we're introduced to Gatsby the wellrehearsed old sport telling his canned story about studying at Oxford Montenegro medals etc. etc. but then slowly that forced veneer peels away and he gives us this angsty desperate sohappyinlove we can remake the past tortured soul. Much much better than Redford. And the same goes with Daisy. Mia Farrow's Daisy was all flighty and light as a feather pretty pathetic and selfabsorbed you wonder what's the big deal with this woman who everyone loves....but with Carey Mulligan you get it. The scenes of the two of them as young lovers explain it all. Finally Tobey McGuire....I love him as Peter Parker Homer Wells and now Nick Carraway. I thought the idea of having him author Gatsby from a hospital was very clever allowed him to read long passages directly from the book. As for JayZ et al. I really didn't mind it as far as I was concerned it didn't distract and certainly worked to illuminate the frenetic energy of the 20's. Please give it another try see it again. From my experience a Baz Luhrmann movie is always better the second time around Moulin Rogue.".

I thought DiCaprio understood a complex character and was adequately convincing.I Love Carey Mulligan and thought she was mostly convincing as Daisy.I liked it when the story stuck to Fitzgerald  which was about 75 of the time. having just read the book again in the last 6 months I recognized most of the Dialogue as true to the bookI thought the Costume Design was exquisite. Catherine Martin has done costume work for all of Baz Luhrmann's films and won an academy award for costumes in Moulin Rouge!as well as being nominated for Romeo  Juliet and Australia. Her work is again superior here  one of the real strengths of the film...I thought the 2nd half of the movie was much better than the 1st. While I generally did not like the soundtrack I loved that Gershwin's' Rhapsody in Blue' snuck in there in the first scenes in Manhattan.The Valley of Ashes and the Dr. T.J. Eckleburg Occulist sign are really well done  but sadly the scenes there are so rushed and so downplayed as to prevent that location from being the symbol of death Fitzgerald intended it to be...The scene in Nick's house where Daisy is invited to tea and remeets Gatsby.What I did not like about itEvery scene with Tobey Maguire in it. His Nick Carraway is too much of Gatsby's lapdog. He is too wideeyed throughout the story. By the end of the movie I was praying for George Wilson to shoot him.Luhrmann's story telling device Nick Carraway in a Sanitarium telling the story to a Doctor who encourages him to write it  Really Baz Luhrman you're gonna improve on Fitzgerald?Luhrmann's other story telling device the words on the screen. Yuck!The Artdirection. Everything was too overthetop and garish. Gatsby's house looks like a Disney creation. One might argue that this is okay because the newrich are often garish. But part of the character that Fitzgerald wrote was that he was convincing as a monied man. The soundtrack of the 1st half of the movie. Typically Luhrmann and I have loved it in other contexts. It did not work in Gatsby. After the last party scene the soundtrack was much better and the rest of the movie felt like Fitzgerald to me.BTW  I generally am a fan of Baz Luhrmann's work. I loved Romeo  Juliet while it was being panned by professional critics. And I found Moulin Rouge! delightful..Moet Champaign which apparently bought huge stock in this movieJoel Edgerton 'nuff saidThe overthetop garishness of the production is so distracting that the great social themes of the day are almost completely lost. They are so subtle int he book and they must be subtly depicted in cinema. They are so subtle as to be almost entirely lost in this production. When I first read the book I felt such sympathy for almost every character except Tom Buchanan. I did not really care about the characters in this movie at all.That Damn green light  much too much. It is a powerful but subtle symbol in the book. Let a symbol be a symbol without having to constantly refer to it and without hitting your audience over the head with it.Because I did not think it entirely sucked I will give it a 5. Adolescent girls will disagree with me even as they are failing their Gatsby finals because they based it this mediocre retelling of the story. Fitzgerald and Gatsby fans will think I am being too generousNote to Hollywood  If you are going to make a movie based on a great work of literature respect and humbly submit to that greatness and make a movie worthy of the original.".

	schema:headline " Famous scenes and symbolism reimagined beautifully but also problematically";
	schema:reviewBody "In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone' he told me 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.' I have been frequently convinced that Baz Luhrmann does not know how to read but I do have the advantage of literacy. However I am not Nick Carraway and am not compelled to follow his father's advice that opens Fitzgerald's classic novel The Great Gatsby.The first big problem with this movie version is that Tobey Maguire's Nick is not the same Nick that we know and love from the novel. This Nick is a quirky agitated simpleton who has gone insane and has decided to become a writer. His voice and disposition was all wrong. Nick is no longer our credible vantage point into the selfish boorish ways of the old money and new money of Daisy Tom Jordan and Gatsby in East Egg and West Egg. Much has been said about the lavish style of the film's sets and imagery and even more about the ludicrous soundtrack. But it mostly works. I don't think anyone can deny that the unrestrained money extravagant mansions brilliant costumes and choreography with a lively score just make the whole story seem more fun. I still have no idea what the point of the 3D was. Nick's bowtie and the strange shooting style mostly prominent early on just made everything look cartoonish. At times it looked like they were driving Gatsby's yellow car through the set of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The cartoon stylings mostly affected Nick Gatsby's parties are always supposed to be at least slightly surreal.Problems definitely arise in the beginning when Luhrmann chooses to use his typical flash editing and put some party scenes out of order. The randomness of it all and Nick becoming even farther removed from the narrator we once trusted was only reconfirming that this was in fact the disaster many expected it to be. But then we met Gatsby. And more importantly we met Daisy. And even more importantly Gatsby met Daisy. It is literally impossible to live up to the expectations about Gatsby  both the man built on wild whispers of him being a war hero but also the literary character so ingrained in popular culture that he has earned the adjective great in front of his name. Leonardo DiCaprio does as good a job as anyone could reasonably expect of him. He drew me in and since Nick couldn't do that it was even more than I could ask of him.One of the significant themes glowing throughout the novel is that of hope. Luhrmann even recognizes this with Nick referring to Gatsby as the singularly most hopeful man he has ever met. And then we would get a shot of the green light glistening off the water and through the fog from the end of Daisy's dock. The one thing missing from DiCaprio's interpretation of Gatsby was that earnest hope. I felt like a photographer on a model shoot Now give me a look of hope! No that's anger. Give me hope! No that's sadness. Give me hope! No that's frustration. Fine just give me another look of despair.Gatsby yearned for Daisy. And so do we. Carey Mulligan's Daisy was probably the most accurate character reimagined from the novel. Starting from her introductory scene where she lay on the couch and the wind rustled her white curtains and her diamond ring sparkled in the daylight and then she turned to stare at Nick she filled the screen with her ethereal beauty and faux innocence. I don't think it's surprising that the film takes its best form in the scenes where it's just Gatsby and Daisy.It's hard not to get wrapped up in the grandiosity of Gatsby the grandiosity of the story and the grandiosity of the film's visuals. It's a beautiful story and it does look beautiful on the big screen but then comes the nagging suspicion that Luhrmann never actually read the novel. After all half of the quotes are just paraphrased and are not the actual lines from Fitzgerald and all of the scenes and famous imagery are only the ones that have seeped into the public consciousness straight from the Cliffs Notes perhaps. It should work well as a way to introduce another generation to this accomplished work of art and I do applaud them for that but it doesn't serve those who already know the book well.".

	onyx:emotionText "In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone' he told me 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.' I have been frequently convinced that Baz Luhrmann does not know how to read but I do have the advantage of literacy. However I am not Nick Carraway and am not compelled to follow his father's advice that opens Fitzgerald's classic novel The Great Gatsby.The first big problem with this movie version is that Tobey Maguire's Nick is not the same Nick that we know and love from the novel. This Nick is a quirky agitated simpleton who has gone insane and has decided to become a writer. His voice and disposition was all wrong. Nick is no longer our credible vantage point into the selfish boorish ways of the old money and new money of Daisy Tom Jordan and Gatsby in East Egg and West Egg. Much has been said about the lavish style of the film's sets and imagery and even more about the ludicrous soundtrack. But it mostly works. I don't think anyone can deny that the unrestrained money extravagant mansions brilliant costumes and choreography with a lively score just make the whole story seem more fun. I still have no idea what the point of the 3D was. Nick's bowtie and the strange shooting style mostly prominent early on just made everything look cartoonish. At times it looked like they were driving Gatsby's yellow car through the set of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The cartoon stylings mostly affected Nick Gatsby's parties are always supposed to be at least slightly surreal.Problems definitely arise in the beginning when Luhrmann chooses to use his typical flash editing and put some party scenes out of order. The randomness of it all and Nick becoming even farther removed from the narrator we once trusted was only reconfirming that this was in fact the disaster many expected it to be. But then we met Gatsby. And more importantly we met Daisy. And even more importantly Gatsby met Daisy. It is literally impossible to live up to the expectations about Gatsby  both the man built on wild whispers of him being a war hero but also the literary character so ingrained in popular culture that he has earned the adjective great in front of his name. Leonardo DiCaprio does as good a job as anyone could reasonably expect of him. He drew me in and since Nick couldn't do that it was even more than I could ask of him.One of the significant themes glowing throughout the novel is that of hope. Luhrmann even recognizes this with Nick referring to Gatsby as the singularly most hopeful man he has ever met. And then we would get a shot of the green light glistening off the water and through the fog from the end of Daisy's dock. The one thing missing from DiCaprio's interpretation of Gatsby was that earnest hope. I felt like a photographer on a model shoot Now give me a look of hope! No that's anger. Give me hope! No that's sadness. Give me hope! No that's frustration. Fine just give me another look of despair.Gatsby yearned for Daisy. And so do we. Carey Mulligan's Daisy was probably the most accurate character reimagined from the novel.

	schema:reviewBody "Adapting famous and wellrespected classic literature can't be easy. The film industry's track record attests to this for every Ran there are five misfires that people quickly forget. The filmmakers behind this year's adaptation of The Great Gatsby make the task seem impossible. This movie is a disaster.Much has been made of director Baz Luhrmann's overblown style in The Great Gatsby but that is just one of the movie's many issues. Actually let's start with the production design. This movie is super polished and glamorous but everything looks so blatantly fake. CGI stands in for actual set design and shooting locations. One of the movie's few redeeming features is the scope of the production but even that is unimpressive when considering most of the movie was made on a computer. Admittetly the costumes and makeuphair look nice and the movie will surely receive some award attention in that department. The script and the acting are where The Great Gatsby really falls apart. There is no depth of character for anybody involved. The central three characters don't come across as real people. Nick Carraway has nothing to do but stand around and watch Gatsby and Daisy court each other. His frequent narration is baffling pointless often describing the events exactly as they happen or directly telling the audience the movie's themes as if we are too stupid to notice them. Carraway frequently stands in the corner watching the action unfold instead of driving the plot forward with any interaction with other characters. This is a huge problem because Carraway serves as the main protagonist Gatsby isn't introduced for over 20 minutes. Gatsby and Daisy don't fair any better. Their romance takes up the majority of the screen time in acts two and three but there is no chemistry nor do they display any emotional connection with each other. Instead Gatsby and Daisy just tell each other how they feel with laughably clunky dialogue. There are no scenes showing the intense feelings they supposedly have for each other. They speak at each other instead of having actual conversations.The actors cannot handle the script's horrible dialogue. The central three actors Maguire DiCaprio and Mulligan deliver the cornball dialogue with misplaced self serious melodrama making many of the conversations draw laughter from the audience. Several members of the supporting cast take the material and ham it up causing a jarring inconsistency in tone. Lurhmann shows no motivation to rein in his actors.Speaking of the supporting cast some of the prominent characters from the first act completely disappear for most of the movie. The only person who shows some level of depth and complexity is Elizabeth Debicki's Jordan Baker but she vanishes for over an hour before coming back to do absolutely nothing. Isla Fisher's Myrtle Wilson suffers a similar fate.The use of music should be mentioned if only because it is drawing some criticism. Using modern music in this movie wasn't a bad idea but the execution is nothing remarkable. Instead of using contemporary pop for any dramatic or stylistic purpose it just seems like Lurhmann picked some songs off his ipod and threw them into the movie.The Great Gatsby is a failure on nearly all levels. It's individual flaws could be overlooked if the movie came together to form something cohesive and meaningful but the whole affair feels hollow. Any symbolism or larger thematic goals get lost in the glossy extravagance. The filmmakers seem to be aware of this so they pound the themes into the viewers with nothing resembling subtlety or grace. It's truly baffling how anybody in Hollywood could greenlight a script this poor and then throw millions of dollars at the production. The Great Gatsby is a soulless movie that covers up its lack of passion and heart with computer generated spectacle. All signifying nothing.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all let me say that F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is absolutely one of my favourite novels. Additionally though it has been years since I've seen it the Robert Redford film was brilliant and I loved it. From the moment I saw the trailers for this version I was heavily skeptical. Heaven knows that someone like Baz Luhrmann needs to make things flashy and extravagant and put a modern twist on a classic story. He did some brilliant work with Romeo and Juliet nearly 20 years ago. However I was worried and now seeing it it has been confirmed that his version of Great Gatsby is an excessive chaotic bright jazzy mess that completely misses the entire concept of Fitzgerald's classic. The modern day rap music and remixes weren't awful but also weren't necessary either. The elaborate and admittedly brilliantly done set pieces of a bizarre almost apocalyptic New York and surrounding area seemed to just take away from a story that should be entirely character driven. The story does mostly follow Fitzgerald's story and yet at the same time completely misses its mark and the pacing felt off entirely. There is no doubt that The Great Gatsby is not an action flick or anything but parts of it dragged.This is a talented group of people and yet in my opinion completely miscast and that includes the legendary Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio was so miscast as Gatsby and he tries so incredibly hard that it comes off as fake. If I had to hear him excruciatingly and awkwardly say Ol' sport one more time I was going to scream. DiCaprio is a brilliant actor as long as he has the right role and this was not even close to right for him. He was too young or at least baby faced awkward and didn't fit the bill. Same could be said for Tobey Maguire. I don't know why they chose to cast these baby faced actors for the film but it doesn't work. Maguire carries the film decently but just not good enough. Joel Edgerton is probably the best cast in his role as the abrasive womanizing Tom Buchanan. He is definitely the most watchable and the most convincing in his role. Carey Mulligan carries herself well and certainly has this subtle sexuality that is perfect for Daisy and yet the character comes across as near boring. The chemistry between her and DiCaprio is okay but not timeless and passionate the way it should be between Daisy and Gatsby. The cast work well together but not as good as I think it should have been.The single issue with this version of The Great Gatsby is that all this flash and jazz has been created without any thought to the true heart of the story. This story is all about greed pride obsession and gluttony and the threads of each one of those is barely existent in this story. I'm actually very surprised that the film is doing as well as it is especially after being delayed for a year before release. One of the most powerful scenes in the original film was Gatsby's death and once again it is handled well and powerful and its also artistically done. I simply felt that the cast tried far too hard and came across as unconvincing and the film had more modern glitz and glam than was necessary. The pacing was nearly excruciating at times as it stumbled through an otherwise classic story. I had very low expectations going into this and it met those low expectations but barely and did nothing to exceed them. 410".

This story is all about greed pride obsession and gluttony and the threads of each one of those is barely existent in this story. I'm actually very surprised that the film is doing as well as it is especially after being delayed for a year before release. One of the most powerful scenes in the original film was Gatsby's death and once again it is handled well and powerful and its also artistically done. I simply felt that the cast tried far too hard and came across as unconvincing and the film had more modern glitz and glam than was necessary. The pacing was nearly excruciating at times as it stumbled through an otherwise classic story. I had very low expectations going into this and it met those low expectations but barely and did nothing to exceed them. 410";

F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel is considered an American literary classic a staple in high school English courses. To tamper with greatness could spell disaster for the film and disappoint fans. With this in mind Luhrmann took the details that made the novel so successful and generously applied them to his film.The result? Beautiful visuals awkward editing and overblown symbolism.The adaptation is narrated by Nick Carraway Tobey Maguire who recounts his adventures on Long Island to a doctor while at a sanatorium. Using wordforword passages from the novel Carraway describes his move to New York to try his hand in the bond business. There he reconnects with his cousin Daisy Buchanan Carey Mulligan and learns his nextdoor neighbor is none other than Jay Gatsby Leonardo DiCaprio the secretive millionaire known for his lavish parties and fantastical reputation. Little does Carraway know that Gatsby acts this way in hopes of winning back Daisy's love despite five years of separation and her marriage to another man.Hoping to live up to its hype the movie tries to be as fantastic and flawless as Gatsby himself. Servants open doors and move about the house like choreographed dancers. The grand landscapes of New York City and Gatsby's estate look pristine. And the parties are a flapper's dream with the vibrant outfits and music for dancing although the occasional rap songs seemed a bit out of place.Unfortunately the flawlessness stops with the visuals. Reminiscent of Moulin Rouge Luhrmann's excessive cuts put cinematic emphasis in all the wrong places. The opening scenes fly by with exaggerated zooming and cutaways that disturb the flow of the script. Yet during the climactic standoff between Gatsby and Daisy's husband the camera comes to a virtual standstill. Without the dialogue it would appear no different from any other scene.The film was also keen to draw on and overemphasize some of the novel's best traits. Carraway speaks Fitzgerald's words like poetry which fans of the book will appreciate. Yet seeing them additionally written on the screen is distracting and unnecessary no matter how artistic the font is. Likewise the symbolisms that added such value to the novel do not translate as well on screen. We can only see the green light so many times before its significance starts to fade. Luckily the lead performances keep the plot comprehensible even when the camera is having a spaz attack. Few if any actors would be better suited as the suave slightly obsessed Gatsby than DiCaprio. He and Maguire enliven the unlikely relationship between Gatsby and Carraway with their occasional comic relief and intimate conversations. Mulligan also gives a strong portrayal of Daisy and her struggle to choose between Gatsby and her husband.There is potential for the film to be marginally close to par with the novel.

	schema:reviewBody "I've now watched The Great Gatsby a total of three 3 times one in 3D. Though there are plenty of harsh critic reviews for this film an yes I said film and not movie is because they are too focused on the length of the film and the complex story line and not understanding fully the range of the time period set.The Great Gatsby is a touching tale of an interloper person on the outside looking in from the perspective of a young coming yuppie. Truth be told it is another star crossed lovers tale of missed chance and opportunity and the lengths one goes to rewrite the past and mend the wounds felt for years. Like all tragedies this film does no better in having hopes up. Staying true to the book the characters lives all end tragic one way or another. The fond and curiousness felt by the main narrator Nick for the infamous Gatsby fuels the story along intertwining the 'Golden Girl' Daisy a minx'd bombshell villianized by her brut 'polo' playing husband the ever unfaithful and racists Tom. Upon meeting Gatsby Nick is enthralled by the complexities of Gatsby's demeanor and back story as well as enjoying the ever entertaining side to the secretive bachelor. The plot to rewin Daisy's heart and fulfill the empty void in Gatsby's broken and tired soul didn't come easy. Along the way the other challenges were both infidelities and the accidental murder of a mistress. After all of this Nick is still recovering pierces of the Gatsby puzzle and figuring out ways to make complete sense of all events take place when in the end some gaps are left unfilled.I enjoyed the intense performances by Leonardo Dicaprio and Tobey Maguire. Both playing cozily off one another and both gave superb vocal and facial workouts. I really liked the easiness of Carey Mulligan's character Daisy. She spoke eloquently enough to pull of the soft and rough tone of a 1920's wealthy east coast flapper gal. Joel Edgerton as Tom what can I say? Born to play the role of a thick and broastic richmistresshaving knowitall who can't stand to lose anything not even a potential side sway with a beautiful actress. All in all I enjoyed the film production value. Also I am sad that the film waited so long to be produced and released but a little happy because it gave enough time to include Lana Del Rey to the film soundtrack and score. I enjoyed the film despite the critics. All I can say is reread the book and watch the film again and tell me that Baz Luhrmann didn't try to make an emotionally driven artistic masterpiece with great actors and amazing focus shots. I give this film 1010 but that is my own opinion based on many different category factors.I hope you enjoyed this review. Thank You.".

The actors struggling to compete with this distraction and bring Fitzgerald's characters and themes to life are at a serious disadvantage before they even appear and Leonardo DiCaprio simply isn't up to the task. His seems to be alternately trying to channel Robert Redford and Marlon Brando the former being an improvement and the later a particularly inappropriate source of confusion about the character. Gatsby is supposed to be an enigma but this is ridiculous. And when those resources seem unable to sustain him he drifts off into something more reminiscent of Orson Wells an impersonation that is way out beyond his ability though in harmony with his bloated and dissipated appearance. The silly device of scattering bits of text into the snow or rain and then assembling them to float in front in front of the screen is no competition for Sam Waters sensitive reading of the same texts. The interjection of a psychoanalytical frame story to explicate Nick's character would be totally unnecessary if a more suitable and capable actor than Tobey Maguire had been cast. I went home and watched the 1974 version which I had underestimated. In contrast Sam Waters Robert Redford and Karen Black were nothing less than brilliant. Poor Fitzgerald. What a disservice.

Really?FAIL!!Was the music of the era not good enough for the film makers that they had to drown the film in generic modern crap music?Why do directors think that everything needs to be current to be successful?Why do we need super fast editing as if we all have ADHD?Why do we need shaky cameras in every other scene?Yes the movie has nice art direction sets and costumes but everything was lost the minute modern music started playing. Takes any immersion of the period right out of you.I stopped watching this travesty after the first 30 minutes.Simply horrible.";

I think the producers were on drugs when they release this piece of garbage. If you are among the twenty somethings that liked Moulin Rouge or enjoy the annoying Quentin Tarantino movies you may like this. If you enjoy good movies this is not for you.

	schema:headline " Some thoughts from a Fitzgerald fan.";
	schema:reviewBody "I am a great fan of F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing which I think is some of the finest literature that exists in English. Adapting it to film necessarily loses some of the magic of his words. I'm too young to have seen the 1974 film so I came to this without preconceptions of how Gatsby could be adapted to the screen.This is a complementary piece of art that sometimes captures what's hinted at in the novel yet falls short of its richness and depth. It is however a visual feast and comes across as a tenderly crafted love letter to the novel and to the Roaring Twenties.Nick Carraway is a framing device for Gatsby's story as he is in the novel but here he's in a sanatorium recounting his season at West Egg for his psychiatrist by writing it out in a journal. This device allows for showing off some of Fitzgerald's evocative sentencesincluding of course the famous final line of the novel. There's also a clever scene where Nick amends the title of his justcompleted novel which is one of those bits that was not in the original novel yet somehow captures its spirit.There are transcendent moments throughout the filmJay and Daisy reuniting is gloriously funny and painful the beautiful shirts scene is breathtaking and the final argument between Jay and Tom in the hotel is a powder keg of tension that's impossible to look away frombut there is also a disappointing sense of literalness when it comes to symbolism.For example the film opens on a silent shot of the infamous green light at the end of Daisy's dock. I thought Good so they're going to allude to it subtly and leave the audience to figure out what it means.But no. The film then proceeds to beat the viewer over the head with that green light. It felt like sitting in a high school English class and painstakingly hashing out the theme until the slowest kid in the class got it. Fitzgerald I think would have cringed at such hamfisted repetition. It felt like an editing mistake to meat least two or three of those green light shots should have been dropped.Technical annoyances the hyperactive camera especially in the first act which refuses to stay still on a shot even in a languid scene like dinner with the Buchanans. This had the effect of blurring and fragmenting the lavish sets which is a shame since they deserved to be pored over and savored. It also made me feel a bit drunk which was probably the point. But that kind of visual metaphor tends to annoy me more than anything. I know what drunk is like. You don't need to show me with camera movements.The tragic climax is also somewhat spoiled by ostentation. What comes across as brutal and shocking in the original novel is here transformed into a drawnout grotesquely sentimental event complete with choppy slowmotion. What is with the choppy slowmo by the way? Why not just shoot in highspeed and slow it down smoothly? I can only assume it was used for aesthetic effect but to me it came across as cheapening.These complaints aside I found a lot to like in this film. The acting was incredible particularly Joel Edgerton's insufferable Tom. Carey Mulligan's eyes deserve an Oscar. Leonardo DiCaprio is by turns magnetic and pathetic. And Tobey Maguire brings a quality of innocence and wonder to the film which grades slowly and elegantly into disillusionment disappointment and despair. It was gutsy to end on a note of pure sorrow and I applaud Luhrmann for taking that risk.This is a good solid adaptation that respects its source material if not quite trusting the audience to get it. It isn't flawless but it's clearly loving of and intimate with Fitzgerald's work and that counts for a lot in my book.Oh and that soundtrack. Masterful. JayZ was a brilliant choice. The parallels between modern hiphop culture and Jazz Age flappers are obvious.".

Hospital tests confirm that following this incident Pascal's days are numbered and his life expectancy is not expected to be longer than six months.Confronted with such a terrible perspective Pascal's father is determined to let Pascal pursue his interests to the fullest extent during the remaining short time imparted to him by God to remain on this earth.

Pascal has a special way with wolves and is able to communicate with them. He enjoys driving the tractor. He knows he is going to die and is far more at ease speaking about it than his father who cannot accept the fact and is secretly hoping a miracle will occur all the time.Pascal will die on Christmas day whilst opening his presents and the wolves will howl throughout the house to mourn his passing ! Before this fateful day however he will have spent many happy moments with his dad with Verdun and with Catherine his dad's lady friend.The film is extremely emotional and if you have seen it when young you will never forget it ! I did not have that privilege and only saw it for the first time in 1992. It passes occasionally on French television and is in the French language surprising when you consider that William Holden was an American. I have it on a VHS cassette and enjoy occasional viewings but have to prepare psychologically for the end each time ! Most of the film is made in snowy surroundings and this remains in your mind after the initial viewing rather like with Love Story and Dead Zone both of which also have sad endings. Is there a correlation between snowscapes in film and an unhappy ending ? Food for thought to be sure. Anyway emotion guaranteed for L'Arbre de Nol.".

Bataille's novel which I eagerly devoured after seeing The Christmas Tree the first time on CBS' The Late Show in December 1975 is an OK read but not too much betteror more interestingthan Terence Young's maudlin filming in which there is little if any emotional involvement. William Holden as the multimillionaire dad looks completely embarrassed. He has I just wanted to work with Terry because he did such a good job on the Bond flicks and 'Wait Until Dark' written all over his fake expressions of concern. The best thing about TCT without question is Brook Fuller. Contrary to previous opinions IMO he was a very talented young man  if you check him out on IMDb you'll note his career was cut short early on recovering from this dirge must have been difficult for him. But he gets the best line  Live happy  Every day a holiday! That's certainly advice we can all use but that's as good as it gets meanwhile Mario Feliciani as Le Docteur casually nonchalantly reminds us that we're all mortals. Ho hum...... The alarm about nuclear accidents is hammered home repeatedly. From the beginning of the film we spend the whole time waiting for poor Pascal to expire. When he does it's more than just an anticlimax it's hollow and catatoniainducing. He has made a plaque for Daddy wishing him Good Luck  to me it was Good luck trying to get this sticky pointless drivel out of your mind. Final note Georges Auric wrote some of the incidental music but the pseudosad guitar that weaves its way in and out of the soundtrack is clearly lifted from Les Jeux Interdits by Rene Clement  a much much better example of how to get viewers to cry.".

Mind you this does provide the double threat of being an allstopsout 'weepie' with child interest  of which quite a few oddly enough were made in Europe around this time including MISUNDERSTOOD 1966 and THE BALLOON VENDOR 1974 which was a big hit when released in theaters locally! By the way I now caught up with this on Italian TV and incidentally in spite of a British director and an American star William Holden this is a FrancoItalian coproduction with those countries represented in the principal cast by Bourvil and Virna Lisi respectively. Actually only the last act deals with the titular decoration and the period itself and given the subject matter I am sure it was chosen with ironic intent in fact here we have a boy who is fatally stricken with leukemia when exposed to radiation  in a scene virtually replicating the one in the scifi classic THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN 1957!  on the coast of Corsica where he had gone ostensibly to spend the summer holidays with the industrialist father he barely knew. The latter was nearby albeit safely underwater when a plane exploded on top of the child sitting in a dinghy and while killing its occupants managed to release a parachute containing an atomic bomb into the sea! Upon learning of this condition which he naturally keeps from his son at first by pretending he is the sick one! the star dedicates himself to the boy unconditionally by taking up residence at a French countryside chteau he owns with widower Holden's new girlfriend Lisi coming to visit from time to time. Looking after this property then is wellmeaning but cantankerous handyman Bourvil  in fact it is during an argument with his boss which is unwittingly overheard by the boy that the latter gets wind of the true nature of their isolation! Anyway at this point Holden cannot refuse the kid anything  even when he requests a wolf for a pet. Since his father and Bourvil had served in WWII together they were no strangers to dangerous missions  and so it is that they infiltrate a zoo and steal a male and female wolf Bourvil having read in a book they would not survive apart!. The scene of their capture itself is pretty vivid as the beasts do not take kindly to the intruders and fight back injuring Holden  later there is a suspenseful moment while transporting the stolen 'cargo' at a gasstation as a couple of policemen want to inspect their vehicle and the men have to use their wits in order to get out of this scrape!Speaking of animal violence another strong scene involves the vicious attack by the wolves on a 'mad' steed who has run away from under his own master a Holden acquaintance played by Friedrich Ledebur  with the horse being eventually put down actually an act of empathy by the star! To be honest though it is this element above all else which renders the film palatable though Henri Alekan's cinematography and the score by Georges Auric also help in this regard. The antinuclear message on the other hand is laid on too thick  with recurring noises of jets flying overhead at which Bourvil utters accusingly but also rather desperately Assassins!  ironically enough the actor would himself die the very next year at just 53 of a rare disease! As for the child's inevitable death scene surprisingly he is not shown to be suffering all that much considering but I should point out here that the copy I watched ran for just 97 minutes against the film's official length of 110! this thankfully occurs offscreen  with Holden alerted to the tragedy by the howling of his two loyal pets for the record the film was released on VHS in the U.S. under the title WHEN WOLVES CRY!.".

Even still I don't think that I would show this movie to a child as young and sensitive as I was. Just thinking about it this movie is still a very memorable and emotional movie to think about. It just shows very well the lengths that a parent will go to to make their dying child happy when they don't know what else to do. It shows the assumptions that people will jump to without knowing the facts It also shows the loving bond between a child and his pets. If you enjoy tearjerkers then this one will do the job.

Excellent pace and non stop engaging plot keeps you alive throughout.Two scientists invented a formula to increase the volume of any kinda liquid. So these Chinese scientists begin the quest to find their biggest shareholder who is in Thailand. But they got different agenda one to get a funding contract to study further and another to sell it to a French company. In the race they encounter each other's trap which drag them a simple expedition to long lasting.This has been the highest gross movie ever in China and breaking all the previous records including James Cameron's 'Avatar'. I have seen many similar movies from Hollywood and Europe but not that many from Asia so I found it a nice one. The lead actor himself directed it for the first time and did a wonderful job. The movie had captured lots of beautiful places from interior Thailand. If entertainment is your top priority then it will fulfill your wish. If you are expecting good story still it will convince but depends on the way you take it. Chinese and Hong Kong movies are famous for presenting martial art in it. That is how many from west know about movies from these places so if you wanna try other than that it will do a justice.".

The differences between Lost in Thailand and The Hangover is that LiT is far more family friendly and far more emotionally involved.

Fortunately though this isn't enough of a factor to stop anyone enjoying it. In fact if you're willing you might learn something new.Sure the script and the acting on more than one occasion could be more subtle and artistic but that's not what this movie is about.

On the way back to their homes the Amazons are attacked and they drive off the men. Once home they decide to pillage the villages of the tribe that ambushed them.

At that time the movie was rated 18 years but lucky that I get in. Why this movie was rated 18 years have I never understood. You don't see any pornography or parts of human body in blood. But maybe the idea that the Amazon women must killed the men after they have mate. Also they killed the babies when it's a boy but you don't see anything.It's now 30 years later that I've seen the movie but still it's in my mind. The beautiful women who fight in a training camp and battle against men. Never have I seen so professional women fighters as in this movie. They fight with sword and are dressed in a erotic war clothes. There a an lot of Latin lookalike women in this movie and is a pleasant to see them. The sexual parts of the movie are not very great. You see some parts of nudity and that's it. Enough to see the movie with your children if you want to tell them how children became to this world.The 2 sequels of this movie The second is poor followup and have not satisfy me. It go about killing more men without any reasons. The third is great but have an another kind of genre. It's a comedy about an karate fighter and a large men who come in the area of the Amazon women. In a funny style they fight against the Amazon women. It have impressed me not very much. IF SOMEONE KNOW THE TITTLE OF THE THIRD MOVIE PLEASE LET ME KNOW.".

And you will be most impressed with the three battle scenes that show a high amount of training in horsemanship throwing the javelin and fencing with the short sword. Sadly they aren't shown wielding the labrys and their shields are round and not halfmoon. But their bravery and ferociousness in battle are great examples of what a real Amazon of the Bronze Age would be like.There is some gratuitous nudity which I didn't' care for but overall this movie was fantastic.

It has the looks of an expensive film. The story line of Antiope finding affection of a man and being troubled by it is not very interesting but believable in a sense also thanks to the reasonable acting by Angelo Infanti. All other acting is not very good but never the cringing kind of bad.But how to watch this? It is not too bad to get the predicate 'camp'. It is not funny enough to be a comedy only a slight bit when women are torn between aversion and lust for men. And it is certainly not factual to be enjoyed as an historical drama as many others already have pointed out.And what about an erotic film? There are pretty women in it often naked. But the characters themselves HARDLY seem to enjoy sexuality. They have to ENDURE it in order not to die out.

In particular the little five or six year old blond Amazon played by Mary Scott O'Connor was heartwarming She came across as feisty vibrant and ready to challenge the world compared to the Queen who walked through her role as if she were with 'valley girls' on a shopping spree.The 'Greek Army' portrayed by actual Spanish Army soldiers and extras was a far cry from the Greek Warriors of an antiquity we all come to expect on the screen. For my money I'd give the little blond Amazon star billing over most of the other socalled warriors out to exterminate all but the breeding stock of the male gender. The repetitious axe visuals might be more suited to the next generations 'Texas ChainSaw Movie' ... give the kid credit and move on.

	schema:reviewBody "There is no sense of fun or logic or pacing to this movie. The first half is pretty much as bad as they come then Luciana Paluzzi shows up for about ten minutes then the rest is lousy again. Terence Young Bob Simmons both did some of the best Bond films Simmons being stunt mancoordinator. I hope they were off drinking and whoring around and aren't responsible for most of this movie because that's about the only explaining it. There is virtually no style to the film barley even C grade film school work and F grade acting other than Paluzzi who does her own dubbingbut sadly keeps her clothes on. All the fight scenes are poorly done with people pretending to be impaled on spears and the ladies struggling under the weight of their own armor. Certainly women can be athletic but I guess none could be found to be in this movie. Humor? The fact that it's unfunny when it's supposed to be doesn't make it a success. It's just so shoddy. Composer Riz Ortalani at least doesn't shame himself and turns in a fun main theme and a few other good tunes but his music is choppily edited. There is a fair amount of mostly brief nudity but most of it is shot from far away with no erotic or exploitation generatedit's like they didn't' even care about showing off the nudity. Best scene is a naked fight during a thunder storm which has a bit of style and exploitation almost nothing else in the movie works. It's inept though the sets and number of extras are large what they do with them is poor. 2 decent glass matte paintings. The DVD from world class bad filmmaker Fred Ray is full frame scratched up choppy and froze in my DVD player when I desperately tried to fast forward to the next badly staged battle scene or through the horribly acted non funny talk scenes that outnumber battle and gratuitous nude scenesthis print is missing the opening joke titles other reviews refer to. It's just about totally worthless. Lead non actress has large natural breasts and no ability to carry a scene let alone a whole movie lead dark haired villainess has large fake ones. A few dolly shots very feware the only attempts to direct a scene and again the cast of women can't act and can't fight and the nude scenes are usually shot so blandlythere is just virtually no reason to watch it. Shockingly it's listed as Terence Young's fill in the blank for the title as there are several to choose from perhaps the producers insisted on using this credit or for some reason Young actually wanted to possess this film in that way. Wow hard to believe he ever did anything worthwhile from seeing this it's almost beyond understandingother than perhaps whatever big parties the cast and crew may have enjoyed and their pay checkstoo bad they kept all that fun to themselves. I'd really like to know what they were thinking or perhaps they were hoping the movie would go unseen Sad sad. Young has made other bad films but rarely one so inept and clunky.".

Terence Young Bob Simmons both did some of the best Bond films Simmons being stunt mancoordinator. I hope they were off drinking and whoring around and aren't responsible for most of this movie because that's about the only explaining it. There is virtually no style to the film barley even C grade film school work and F grade acting other than Paluzzi who does her own dubbingbut sadly keeps her clothes on. All the fight scenes are poorly done with people pretending to be impaled on spears and the ladies struggling under the weight of their own armor. Certainly women can be athletic but I guess none could be found to be in this movie. Humor? The fact that it's unfunny when it's supposed to be doesn't make it a success. It's just so shoddy. Composer Riz Ortalani at least doesn't shame himself and turns in a fun main theme and a few other good tunes but his music is choppily edited. There is a fair amount of mostly brief nudity but most of it is shot from far away with no erotic or exploitation generatedit's like they didn't' even care about showing off the nudity. Best scene is a naked fight during a thunder storm which has a bit of style and exploitation almost nothing else in the movie works. It's inept though the sets and number of extras are large what they do with them is poor. 2 decent glass matte paintings. The DVD from world class bad filmmaker Fred Ray is full frame scratched up choppy and froze in my DVD player when I desperately tried to fast forward to the next badly staged battle scene or through the horribly acted non funny talk scenes that outnumber battle and gratuitous nude scenesthis print is missing the opening joke titles other reviews refer to. It's just about totally worthless. Lead non actress has large natural breasts and no ability to carry a scene let alone a whole movie lead dark haired villainess has large fake ones. A few dolly shots very feware the only attempts to direct a scene and again the cast of women can't act and can't fight and the nude scenes are usually shot so blandlythere is just virtually no reason to watch it. Shockingly it's listed as Terence Young's fill in the blank for the title as there are several to choose from perhaps the producers insisted on using this credit or for some reason Young actually wanted to possess this film in that way. Wow hard to believe he ever did anything worthwhile from seeing this it's almost beyond understandingother than perhaps whatever big parties the cast and crew may have enjoyed and their pay checkstoo bad they kept all that fun to themselves. I'd really like to know what they were thinking or perhaps they were hoping the movie would go unseen Sad sad. Young has made other bad films but rarely one so inept and clunky.";

I did understand though that this would be a western comedyspoof of some sort. George Hilton on the other hand was familiar to me due to his appearances in other Italian Westerns.Now the first five minutes after the credits were easily the best part of this film. A fake bounty killer Ingrassia kills the bandit Franchi to earn the reward money the two of them split the reward in the scene after that. Now this shootout part in a Mexican village was actually one of the better beginnings I've seen in an Italian western. It was quite funny and even cool. There was also a closeup of the hit when the fake bandit was shot which was interesting as squibs aren't that frequent in old Italian Westerns. At this point I had high expectations for the rest of the film. Next our socalled heroes relocate to the U.S. to continue their game and we are introduced to the real bounty killer Joe played by George Hilton. All is still good here and Hilton is OK in his part.But then the problem starts. I must have a problem with this kind of Italian humor since I cannot understand what's supposed to be so funny with Franchi's different facial antics. The facial expressions made by him weren't funny at all they were annoyingand this continued all through the film! To me humor is something else than just a funny face which was what this film appeared to rely on.On the positive side Gloria Paul was gorgeous and Ignazio Spalla as Pedro Sanchez playing the bandit Indio was a relief to this film which would've otherwise been a total pain to watch.Possible SpoilerThere were also some cool scenes such as the bank robbery scene somewhere in the middle of the film. And it was nice change to see the girls take more charge towards the end. And oh that twist in the end! It really did amaze me! Well actually no since at that point I really didn't care anymore I just wanted it to end.end of spoilerSo what's the verdict for this film? A cool beginning and some but few good scenes. It didn't save the film though even if I really tried to like it.I'd give 8510 for the first 5 minutes 210 for the rest. That's 510 overall.".

This movie looks like it had a somewhat higher budget since there are more speaking roles and a wider range of locations. However things are somewhat more cruder in this movie from the violent sequences to the style of direction though there are a few striking images here and there. Also there are a few dull spots.

The sweaty unsavory villains shoot anybody without a second thought. They show no mercy for even unarmed handicapped men. As far as that goes the solitary hero displays a similar predilection to violence motivated primarily out of vengeance. The character of the undertaker emerges from the background for a change and participates in the action not necessarily on the side of the protagonist and this is a difference between My Name Is Pecos and runofthemill European westerns. Swarthy Robert Woods is convincing enough as the resilient swiftdrawing crackshot shooting protagonist forged in the Man with No Name mold. After all a passel of Spaghetti westerns among them the sequel Pecos Cleans Up Savage Guns Five Thousand Dollars on One Ace Johnny Colt Seven Guns for the MacGregors The Belle Starr Story Machine Gun Killers Challenge of the McKennas and A Colt in the Hand of the Devil topbilled Woods as the hero. Although he is unbeatable on the draw he suffers the wrath of the villains in a moment of vulnerability just as Clint Eastwood did in the first two Dollars epics.Interestingly what sets My Name Is Pecos apart from most Spaghetti westerns is that its hero is Hispanic. Mind you Mexicans are largely the heroes in the politicallythemed oaters about the numerous revolutions that rocked Mexico between the end of the American Civil War in the late 1860s to the 1920s. Occasionally the villains refer to the protagonist as a Mexicano which sounds like he is the son of Mexicans that gave birth to him in the U.S. andor its territories. Unfortunately the two terms Mexican and Mexicano are used interchangeably so Pecos cannot with surety be called either. One thing is for certain the bad guys fare abysmally when they oppose him in a fair fight. My Name Is Pecos benefits from One Damned Day at Dawn . . . Django Meets Sartana! composer Lotto Gori's lively little score and the ballad sung during the opening credits has a rhythmic quality that sounds like the pop song House of the Rising Sun. A lone gunman with neither a horse nor a gun trudges through the desert with a blinding sun glaring unmercifully down on him. Eventually he reaches a Mexican hovel where he can get water but an unfriendly American gunslinger stands guard outside. When the sombrero wearing peon and his wife stick their heads out at the arrival of the stranger the blackclad American gunslinger slings a couple of slugs their way driving them back into their whitewashed adobebrick house. Dropping his saddle the hero ambles up to the hombre who offers him a scoop of water. The American gunslinger warns him about being unarmed It's not very healthy to travel without a gun around these parts. Pecos pays him twenty dollars in paper money for a Colt's .45 revolver. As our hero walks away with his back to the him the villainous American gunslinger replaces the gun that he sold to the stranger with another. Just as the gunslinger shoots him the stranger whirls and guns him down then identifies him They call me Pecos. Pecos Robert Woods of The Battle of the Bulge orders the peons to bury the dead American gunslinger. The villains that Pecos Martinez tangles with enter as they pursue a man furiously whipping a team of horses hauling a wagon piled high with beer barrels. Pecos watches them as they storm through a pass from Laredo to Houston. The wagon driver reaches Houston before the Kline gang and stashes a barrel stuffed with 80thousand in the saloon. He runs back outside and tries to ambush the outlaws led by Joe Kline Pier Paolo Capponi of Commandos who is determined to recover the loot they stole from the Bank of Laredo. In fact Kline and his murderous cutthroats spend the remainder of My Name Is Pecos searching for the money. Kline refuses to leave until they find the cash even though the Texas Rangers may be on his trail. Kline wears a deep rope burn around his neck from when the authorities tried to hang him. Anyway the Kline gang confronts Pecos who manages to blow four more of them away in quick draw contests. Pecos discovers the location of the loot. Meanwhile the devious undertaker Morton Umberto Raho of Duel of Champions informs Kline about Pecos' whereabouts under the saloon. The villains capture Pecos and beat him black and blue just as Clint Eastwood got beaten up in A Fistful of Dollars. Nina the Mexico senorita who works in the saloon smuggles Pecos a knife while Kline's man is guarding him. She operates a spinning wheel upstairs above the room where Pecos is confined and she lowers knife by twine through a crack in the floor. Pecos kills the guard with the knife and Nina helps him escape. They take refuge in Dr. Berton's office. No sooner have they done so than Tedder the saloon keeper brings over a barrel of wine that secretly contains the 80thousand. Kline and his men discover that Pecos is missing as well as the Mexican girl so they ride out to where her parents are working in the field and start killing. Eventually Pecos confronts the evil Morton and guns him down. Later we learn that Pecos came from the same village and he is seeking revenge against Kline who wiped out his family. Turning your back on the villains in a Spaghetti western is a surefire way to get a bullet in the spine. My Name Is Pecos is your average continental western with a catchy musical score.".

My name is Pecos to me was a gritty film that had a great variety of musical scores in it by Lallo Gori. The camera work was done well by both Giuseppe Ruzzolini and Armando Nannuzzi. Great acting by Robert Woods Pecos Martinez and the creepy Morton character who can read the future and make predictions through a deck of poker cards lol.. The opening scene started off great of Pecos walking to Houston no gun carrying a saddle and slowly dying of thirst making us wonder how this could be. He comes up to a sinister looking man in all black who gives him water and a gun only to be killed and after hes been killed the drifter reveals his name Pecos. The two problems I had with the movie was one the girl who played Nina amazing body but a butterface terrible shame. The second was a weak rushed back story of Joe Kline the lead bad guy killed Pecos Martinez's family as he stated three years ago but when he looked at him it didn't dawn who the Mexican was until he finds out late in the movie who he is then it hits him duh. Three years is not a long time ago! Other then this the movie was fun and great music worth watching and enjoying!".

Here is a link to see how it looks like. www.rottentomatoes.commmavieenlair The blackandwhite poster has nothing to do with the movie. At first when I decided to watch 'Ma vie en l'air'' I did not have high expectations but then it turn out that the movie was far more interesting than I thought. The movie follows the story of Yann Kerbec an instructor for an airline company who uses flight simulators to evaluate pilots' abilities to handle in extreme conditions. Ironically Yann himself is afraid of flying. This becomes an issue when his girlfriend considered to be the woman of his dreams was offered an job in different country. Compared to most French romcoms this is joyful and entertaining worth seeing. The film provides a pleasing romantic story. Vincent Elbaz and Gilles Lellouche playing childhood friends are a fantastic duo. Even though the script may seem to be rather predictable I enjoyed every minute of the film. If you are looking for a pleasant and emotive story with downtoearth characters funny and true to life situations something rather different than an ordinary American romcom but also gripping that is the film for you. It would be a shame not to mention how pretty stunning Marion Cotillard was as Alice. She was probably in her late 20s when the movie was shot however she looks even younger. And so beautiful! I really enjoyed watching her as Vincent Elbaz's lovebird. They make such a nice couple. Perhaps they were both rising stars of the French cinema at back then. The director Rmi Bezanon has an eye for the details. The senior pilot' s story was touching too. Well done!".

	schema:headline " Enfuriating movie  but Monica Vitti ...";
	schema:reviewBody "In Michelangelo Antonioni's famous movies l'avventura l'eclisse il deserto rosso this extremely beautiful actress always seems remote and unapproachable. But she also has a great talent for comedy general slapstick and pratfalls included. In this movie she can show off this side of her talents. She really is the center of attention other big Italian stars like Gassmann Cardinale and Giannini are more like a support. She has a lot of screen time and frequently speaks to the camera explaining some story points.The story unfortunately stinks. It is about relationships between men and women  i. e. basically wife beating. Women are slapped around a whole lot and mind you it is supposed to be a comedy. Vitti's character has to stand trial because during a fight she pushed her lover into an open sewer. During a re enacting of the crime an inflatable flesh colored doll is thrown into the deep brown liquid and then shown floating toward the turning spirals of a purification plant. One spiral catches the doll and squashes it until it bursts. This is shown in every detail like some great joke. It should give you an idea of the mood that prevails here. I must say however that on the whole it is a stylish and well photographed movie.As a matter of fact it is one of those flicks one would like to re edit and shorten to about half of its lentgh. Then I think it could be good entertainment especially for fans of Monica Vitti. According to the data available on IMDb she was well above 40 when this movie was made Giannini her partner here is more than 10 years younger which is hardly believable. They really put her in a very good light here this I have to admit.".

It is about relationships between men and women  i. e. basically wife beating. Women are slapped around a whole lot and mind you it is supposed to be a comedy. Vitti's character has to stand trial because during a fight she pushed her lover into an open sewer. During a re enacting of the crime an inflatable flesh colored doll is thrown into the deep brown liquid and then shown floating toward the turning spirals of a purification plant. One spiral catches the doll and squashes it until it bursts. This is shown in every detail like some great joke. It should give you an idea of the mood that prevails here. I must say however that on the whole it is a stylish and well photographed movie.As a matter of fact it is one of those flicks one would like to re edit and shorten to about half of its lentgh. Then I think it could be good entertainment especially for fans of Monica Vitti. According to the data available on IMDb she was well above 40 when this movie was made Giannini her partner here is more than 10 years younger which is hardly believable. They really put her in a very good light here this I have to admit.";

Gratuitous nudity and closeups of big breasts.  What we have here is a feminist's nightmare.  What we also have is an absolute blast!!!I'm sure women won't enjoy this as much and will probably btch about the overdose of female nudity but for all you guys who just don't give a damn and just want to kick back and have a good time  You will love this movie!! This is like a mix of Wes Craven and Howard Stern.  A supreme guilty pleasure!I enjoy deep artistically brilliant films like American Beauty and Magnolia but there's no reason I can't enjoy a campy shallow sleazy horror flick like this.  I don't ONLY enjoy these types of flicks but I can enjoy it as long as it's done in a fun tongueincheek unpretentious manner.  I just want to get that straight.  OK I'll go on. Dennis Miller provides great comic relief in his lead role.  Those who are fans of his schtick should look forward to this movie.  The horror sequences though sometimes cheesy are great fun to watch.  There's a spectacular sequence at the end with excellent usage of the song Ballroom Blitz.  There are other great classics like All Right Now and Jailbreak.  That's why I bought the soundtrack.  It's awesome!So this movie fits the guy flick stereotype like a glove.  If you're not in the mood for excessive violence gore and female nuditydon't watch this movie!  Don't say I didn't warn you.  My score  7 out of 10".

	schema:headline " Funny...trashy but funny";
	schema:reviewBody "Before I write this interview I wanted to just explain that I have been a Dennis Miller fan since I was 11 1994 and he was the only reason I saw this movie. I also think he was one of the aspects of this movie that held redeeming value. In addition purchased it new for less than 10 a few years ago and it is in my Halloween movie collection. With that out of the way I'll start my review.Vampress Lilith Angie Everhart is brought to life again after a long rest in one of the far corners of the world by Reverend Jimmy Current Chris Sarandon and his partner Vincent. The two establish a bordello disguised as a funeral home to attract evil local young men. The men can get stiff among the stiffs but men start disappearing. This disappearance of local young men hits close to home for Katherine VerdouxErika Eleniak when her rebellious younger brother Caleb Corey Feldman goes missing. So she hires a Rafe Guttman Dennis Miller a wisecracking seedy private investigator with good intentions and a quite unusual caseall involving this mortuary with secrets. Rafe and Katherine put themselves into a mystery that crosses the boundary of the living and the deadrather the undead.This movie thought quite funny is a bad movie. That's just how it is. Going into this movie the title itself is an indication of how trashy or bad it really is. But man is it a fun trip! I found myself laughing at pretty much all the right scenes and all the right lines. Its as though the lines are tailored for Miller himself it is perfect shtick for him. Most of the movies he's been in had parts written especially for him but this was perfect. My first impression of Rafe is that he's a jerk but I discovered rather quickly that he is rather goodnatured and goodintentioned and that he truly wants to help Katherine out.There are two scenes I absolutely loathed about this moviethe scene where Lilith encounters Rafe in his office I turn the channel off or fastforward the tape and the opening scene of the movie where Lilith is discovered by Rev. Current and Vincent this is only watchable once. Otherwise this movie is quite funny and interesting if you plan on getting into it. My biggest beef spoiler is that we don't even meet our hero until roughly 20 minutes into the movie! When you're first billed doesn't this mean you'll show up earlier in the film? I guess someone missed one of the most important parts of filmmaking or at least credit order. But its OK really it's not the worst thing about the film.This is essentially a bad movie. I read another review that says that it seems Dennis Miller is letting the viewers know this. He sure is! This is one of those sobadit'sfunny kind of movies why it used to be in the horror section of the video store I have no idea. However Dennis Miller is hysterical in it!! I loved his momentshe had a lot of good ones.I liked when he goes to the Cunningham wake and watches as the men lift the coffin out of the room but struggle with it. Guttman observing the scene says Wow she really was a heavyweight. He does make some of the most classically bad facial expressions I have witnessed in a long time honestly after seeing this I want to know what acting school I have to go to just to learn to Act the Dennis Miller Way. My favorite scenes are the Super Soaker scene I won't divulge on this too much not to spoil it but it is a classic scene not to me missed the scene where he sneaks back into the mortuary to investigate and when Rafe heads into the coffin drop to visit the Bordello.So why 7 out of 10 stars? One point deducted for the opening scene which tends to be long and drawnout. Watch this once and you'll understand what is going on. What redeems this film is that after this point in the film it becomes better and the plot begins to move a little. One the same point the entire first twenty minutes of the film is a complete drag. Skip the introduction on the next viewing. Another point deducted for the scene where Lilith encounters Rafe in his officethis scene is just a complete turnoff to me 2 4 6 8You can watch me masturbate!yuck. And a third point deducted for the nudity. Yes I know it's a bordello yes they're supposed to be nude. But I 'm a female and I don't take pleasure in watching naked women prance around. But I'm flexible so I pushed past that dislike and ignored it. The bad acting isn't even a negativeit adds to the movie's silly nature.This is a great Halloween movie but nonDennis Miller fans may be turned off by it. Maybe not I don't know. The acting is pretty bad but that's the pointit's not Oscarcaliber material. I highly recommend this movieit has its moments that make is memorable probably not for all the right reasons but it tries. Some classic scenes make it funny and you just may watch it more than once I have!. Just try not to read too much into it. It really is quite an enjoyable diversion.".

	schema:reviewBody "While I enjoyed the humor and the Crypt Keepers puns more in this than in Demon Knight the overall experience of this is just slightly inferior. This one suffers mainly under not having such an entertaining villainmain monster as the first one Lilith does have some decent lines but almost all of them were sexual innuendos which gets old a little too fast. The Collector was more entertaining with his cynical and sarcastic personality. There's also less action in this one though there might be slightly more gore. In this one the plot also moves along a little too slowly considering the fact that it's only meant as entertainment with that in mind you have to wonder why it takes so long to tell the story and get to the gore and blood. The ending sequence was also slightly less entertaining and exciting than the one in Demon Knight. Like Demon Knight the film manages to bring in plenty of both sex and violence often both at the same time. Apart from RafeDennis Miller there weren't really any interesting or entertaining characters. Miller does a really great job portraying the type of character he usually does a slimy sarcastic jerk. That is the Miller that we fans know and love. It's nice to see him in a role that compliments his talents so well. The film like Demon Knight is very gory and violent although apart from the Crypt Keepers puns and some of Miller's lines this didn't have that much to offer. It's good enough to watch if you've got 90 minutes to kill and you don't want to see Demon Knight don't want to rewatch it or can't find it. The films are both worth watching but I'd suggest Demon Knight over this one. I recommend itlike the first to fans of gory horror films and people who just want to be entertained for 90 minutes without having to think very much. 610".

It turns out that the women of the bordello are vampires and the place is being run by a Reverend Chris Sarandon who wants to get rid of sinners.Lots of comments deal with the fact that this movie is gory and filled with nudity it's true and I think there is a scene that captures its spiritDennis Miller and the Reverend decide to kill Lilith Angie Everhart the leader of the vampires. Of course they have to deal with the vampire women in the house first so the decide to carry...Waterguns filled with Holy Water!!! Then all hell breaks loose they shoot their water guns at the nude women who explode into guts or get caught on fire after being hit. This happens while Ballroom Blitz is being played.Overall Bordello of Blood its not as scary as it is silly. Dennis Miller is great as the detective and there is a cameo appearance by Whoopi Goldberg as a patient in a hospital.".

Did I miss something? In Demon Knight there was a strong plot great acting Especially Billy Zane... And funny gory exciting etc. but this was just... pretty plain. If you are expecting a good vampire movie out of this go watch something else... may I recommend John Carpenter's Vampires? A more serious believable vampire movie  but hey COME ON... this movie isn't THAT bad... is it?

They learn that there is an amazing brothel at 325 Beaumont a funeral home where they should ask for the Cunningham Wake. They are received by the mortician McCutcheon Aubrey Morris and soon they go to the brothel. However Lilith runs the place and the girls are vampires. Caleb's friend is killed by Lilith that that rips his heart out of his chest and then Caleb is attacked by her.Katherine goes to the precinct to report that her brother is missing but the police officer does not give much attention to her. The private investigator Rafe Guttman Dennis Miller overhears her conversation and offers his services to Katherine. The snoopy Rafe tracks Caleb's path and he discovers that the brothel seems to be a lair of vampires. But Katherine who works with Reverend Current Chris Sarandon that has a business connection with Lilith does not believe in his word. Now Rafe is seeking evidences to prove to Katherine that he is telling the truth. Bordello of Blood is an underrated gore comedy of vampires. The plot is funny with beautiful and hot female vampires and also with a great unexpected conclusion. The comedy is a funny parody of horror and crime genres with the sexy Angie Everhart and Erika Eleniak. But Dennis Miller steals the movie in the role of a sleazy but efficient private eye. Lilith's tongue reaching the heart of her victims is hilarious however the funniest scene is when Rafe teams up with Reverend Current and they use squirt guns with holy water to defeat the female vampires exploding them. When the viewer expects a happy ending with the good guy and the good girl together there is an unforeseen conclusion. My vote is seven.Title Brazil O Bordel de Sangue The Brothel of Blood".

By the way I am completely serious. Bordello of Blood is a crazed mess that is so hilarious because of its stupidity that it nearly becomes a deceptive winner. This is the second film of the mid1990s from The Tales From the Crypt HBO series the equally underachieving Demon Knight was released in 1995. I personally like this picture a little more because it does not take itself too seriously and almost works better as a parody. However the film never rises from its very odd premise as its tone is unclear and the immensely funny situations are sometimes overshadowed by very graphic violence and constant sexual situations. Arguably Miller's finest performance go figure that one too and the steamy vampires are not quite enough to keep Bordello of Blood from needing a shot for its STDs Seriously Tedious Dilemmas. 2 stars out of 5.".

Rafe's search leads him to a brothel run by centuriesold vampire Lilith Angie Everhart. The second of the 'Tales from the Crypt Presents' movies is nowhere near as good as the criminally underrated Demon Knight. It's not a scary movie nor does it really try to be. It's a comedy with Dennis Miller having a ball throwing out one liner after one liner. If only the rest of the movie matched his performance. The story is so slight you'll wonder if the entire script was jotted down on a napkin. The movie's primary selling point is sex and nudity of which there is not a lot. Especially disappointing when you consider that the two most wellknown women in the film Everhart and Eleniak never appear nude. Still a fun tone with a great turn by Miller makes it worth watching once.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bordello of Blood does offer some undemanding B movie entertainment even if it's never quite as much fun as one might like it to be. At least it never pretends to take itself very seriously and star Dennis Miller playing wise ass low rent private eye Rafe Guttman apparently concocted much of his sardonic dialogue himself. Rafe is hired by uptight Katherine Verdoux Erika Eleniak to locate her indolent brother Caleb a well cast Corey Feldman and tracks him to the mortuary doubling as a bordello where Caleb is last seen tangling with evil boss vampire Lilith Angie Everhart and teaming up with slick televangelist J.C. Current Chris Sarandon. While it's not really all that funny the attempt by Miller and company to give their material that tongue in cheek flavour is still appreciated. Things get off to a fine start with The Crypt Keeper joined by a mummy played by the ever dependable William Sadler the hero of the first 'Tales from the Crypt' movie Demon Knight. The actors are all quite entertaining to watch. The casting of Sarandon is a decent injoke seeing that he was the charming vampirenextdoor in Fright Night and is one of the vampire slayers here. Feldman fans may be disappointed that he's only around for the first and final thirds but he IS a hoot and makes the most of his brief screen time. Sexy Everheart clearly is relishing the role of the blood sucking babe she Eleniak Kiara Hunter Leslie Ann Phillips and Juliet Reagh provide delectable eye candy. Supporting performances by Aubrey Morris as McCutcheon and Phil Fondacaro as Vincent are quite amusing. The gore effects are very entertaining and the soundtrack features some solid vintage and thencurrent rock tunes. Gilbert Adler one of the producers of the TV series made his feature film directing debut here and does a decent job. Overall the movie is a perfectly acceptable combination of sex gore and humour and the pacing stays pretty consistent throughout. It's not as good as Demon Knight but it's not bad either. Be sure to watch out for the uncredited cameo appearance by Oscar winning actress Whoopi Goldberg. Seven out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was the second Tales From The Crypt film released only a year after the first the excellent Demon Knight with Billy Zane and William Sadler. That film was truly an excellent start but I think they rushed it a bit by throwing this one out less than a year later. The Crypt Keeper needs to rest too...And maybe if this film hadn't failed at the box office we might have got another season out of the show. At this stage it was still running strong with guest actors like Ewan McGreggor and Joe Pesci. Anyhow yeah the movie.What's evident from the start is that Bordello of Blood is totally tongueincheek. It's all slapstick humour wittysharp lines there's nothing serious here  no room for any of the trademark Crypt horror or tension from the first. It's about a placid detective Dennis Miller kickin ass I must say investigating the disappearance of some horny young fella played by clearlynotateenanymore Corey Feldman  haha he's in a movie again! which leads him to some kind of vampire brothel where the girls don't just take your money they bleed you dry! From the trailer I had my doubts about Dennis Miller but I must say he's rather charismatic as the sarcastic sleazebag Detective Rafe Guttman. He doesn't show too much depth but that's not what this films about he's just there to keep you smirking away. Chris Sarandon plays some cop.. I don't remember who he is but his name sounds familiar. Hey look it's Corey Feldman!! I'm glad to see he's getting a role in something decent in the 90s but this guy was.. well really crap. Maybe it's just how his character was written but come on Corey. Ya gotta stop sucking if you want more roles like The Lost Boys. Get your own adult animated comedy or something just forget about the past. You're too old to be playing The Kid Who Killed Jason in Friday the 13th Part 4 by now. The female stars are the vampires including supermodel Angie Evahart and there's a solid main performance by Erika Eliniak Corey Feldman's sister  but ya gotta wonder why Corey's parents aren't too concerned about his disappearance. Why does his sister have to cover his ass? Also present is Tales From The Crypt veteran William Sadler. Ya gotta love this guy for his devotion! He's appeared in more than one episode I think and both films by now! Although he was just a mummy and I don't remember him it kicks ass that he's there!...man! John Kassir plays the Crypt Keeper and ya gotta love how the films are introduced and ended exactly like the episodes are with Kassir's appearance. I know many dislike the Crypt Keeper and I can see where they're coming from but I've always dug the guy. He's as sharp as ever here with his usual legendary one liners.. Quit while you're ahead.. Neither of the Crypt films truly captured the show but that's probably because of their length that the screenplays get a bit drawn out to fill it. And like the first film this runs short at only 87 mins  a good thing too any longer would have been too long.This was great fun to watch and much better than I'd anticipated after it's score here. I recommend buying the Region 1 DVD which has this and the first film Demon Knight. Two films on one disc for 15 that's value right?".

One of the film's better points here is the rather lighthearted and silly tone present here which gives this one quite the fun and enjoyable setup. It's a lot of fun to watch as a goofy entertaining effort featuring the idea of the funeral home working in conjunction with the sanctity of the church which isn't that original but it still works here in giving this one the kind of ironic and goofy setup required for one of these efforts. Going alongside this is the manner of this one featuring the outside relics that are featured here from the ancient talisman that controls her to the use of the protective applications to allow them to walk around in the daylight without injury and the manner of how they go ahead recruiting victims to their hideout which all makes the storyline incredibly fun and adds some nice sleaze to the proceedings. From the concept of the bordello offering plenty of fun here with the topless workers parading around for the unwary victims the several attempts to engage in tortuous sexual acts using the different devices to hold them in order to feed and the numerous scenes involving them around the strippers or topless clientele gives this one quite a strong sleaze quotient which has a lot to like overall. That also likes the fact that the fun vampire antics here are rather fun with the initial attacks on the patrons inside the brothel the initial scene of the detective working through the investigation which gives this a solid and workable middle half that keeps this moving as well as some enjoyable vampire action in the finale as there's the fun of the massacre of the club workers the different brawls in their underground hideouts and the final assault at the TV station has a lot of great moments with the vampire in control and the main resolution to stop them. Alongside the nice comedy and rather fun gore there's a lot to like here to hold it up over the minor flaws featured. The main issue to be found here is the fact that there are way too many scenes that go on way too long to really let the jokes fizzle out before they have a chance to land. The opening in the tomb is quite overlong and lets the joke of his stature compared to the men go on way too long before she finally awakes and the continuous jokes about the girl being in the stripclubs in the area makes for a onenote joke that takes up a whole scene of her interviewing the vampire and it just leaves this with overlong scenes that hold up the running time somewhat. Likewise the amount of goofy cheese featured here might be too much for some to take because of this and they really are what holds it back.Rated R Nudity Graphic Violence Extreme Graphic Language fetish sexual acts and mild drug use.".

I remember watching a behind the scene documentary on this film that interviewed the great John Milius who told a story about the two pitching the script to him and Milius telling them it was the most socially irresponsible script he'd ever read. The story in this Crypt story involves private investigator Dennis Miller hired by Erika Eleniak to do a missing persons case that leads to a nest of vampires in the titular bordello led by supermodel Angie Everhart. Although this film had a theatrical release it definitely feel more like a directtovideo quality of horror film.

	schema:reviewBody "Tales From The Crypt Bordella of Blood1996 StarringJohn Kassir Dennis Miller Erika Eleniak Angie Everhart Chris Sarandon Corey Feldman Aubrey Morris Phil Fondacaro and William Sadler Directed ByGilbert Adler Review Hello kiddies your pal the cryptcritic here let me tell about a film so disappointing it had barely any blood to show for. The film is about a detective named Rafe who is on the search for the brother of a woman named Kathryn. During his investigation he makes the discovery that the woman in charge of all the missing men are seductress vampires. He must stop these vampires from spreading their business and eating the entire town. The movies not so fun premise is not the kind of lusting vampire film that I would want to sink my teeth into it just feels like their could have been more or something. But there is one amazing sequence at the end that I'm going to go into detail but let's just say it has something to do with water guns. This was the second Tales from the crypt movie that was ever released the first being demon night which is my favorite so far but bordello is more for the adultwatching lust having vampire horror viewers out there and it if that's your thing then you can really sink your teeth into this. But if I want vampireaction I'll stick with Fright nightboth of them and Bram Stokers Dracula and the Bela Lugose one. This tale from the crypt is not as impressive as the last onebut it does have it's moments. I'm giving Bordello of Blood a two and a half out of five.".

Casting is drab but does include 80's horror comedy star Sarandon and 80's teen star Feldman both of which raise the film slightly Angie Everhart looks delicious as 'Lilith'.You know what your gonna get with this franchise so your either gonna love it or hate it. Personally I view these films as a great opportunity to see fantastic examples of handson horror makeup effects normally without much CGI plus they are always good fun on a nobrainer level.610".

One of them is kidnapped by humans believing in human sacrificing to the spirit Nganga. The cult leader is based upon The story of Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo! The socalled Godfather of Matamoros.

The colors are gritty made with color filters like many Latin American film has been lately. In this film it's very suitable. Sometimes maybe a bit too much as it is sometimes difficult to see clearly outdoors in the sun. Indoors it's better.The film is made terrifying as it should be. many actors are doings terrific job. Maybe not so much Brian Presley and Jake MuxWorthy as Rudef Strong. But the Mexicans are doing great and I always admire Damian Alcazar amazing in 2004film ChronicasChronicles. The crook Marco Bacuzzi is amazingly terrifying as a violent evil man. One of the scariest I've seen on film ever. The bad guys here are really disgusting all of them. Well played.I find this a very good film Though I don't like this kind of violence. I hate watching it and definitely more do when it is a true story. This is of course it's not everyone's porridge. If you trouble with graphic films this is no film for you. It's no constellation this is just film 'cause it isn't just.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1989 Mexican officials discovered the bodies of 12 people including a 21 yearold University of Texas student buried on a desolate ranch just outside of Matamoros Mexico. The ranch dubbed Rancho Santa Elena served as the killing grounds for a cult led by Adolfo de Jess Constanzo nicknamed El Padrino de Matamoros or The Godfather of Matamoros. Constanzo was a practitioner of the African magic palo mayombe. The people buried on the ranch had been victims of human sacrifice which Constanzo and his followers believed would secure occult protection for drug deals shielding them from the police. Various body parts and even the brains of their victims would be mixed with dead animals in an iron cauldron called a nganga.Borderland is based on these gruesome events and while there are the typical liberties taken the film sticks remarkably close to what really happened. Three college students from Texas head into a Mexican border town to celebrate spring break. Amidst drinking and picking up women it isn't long before one of them is abducted for the cult's sinister practices leaving the others to search for him. It's an understatement to say that they won't like what they find.This is an outstanding film. I was looking forward to it well before After Dark added it to their lineup so I was quite pleased when I saw that they had acquired the rights. The film has some beautiful visuals loved the dreamy editing in the carnival scene and cinematography but in spite of this it manages to pull off a very gritty hopeless feel throughout. The characters aren't the usual annoying teens either. For instance I liked how the tough guy wound up being anything but in the face of what he was up against. It felt real. I wound up feeling really sorry for these people. The sadistic torture of Phil Rider Strong made for an especially tough scene to watch as I had grown to care about what happened to him and his friends. It affected me far more than any scene from a Saw movie could ever hope to. This cult meant business and each demise had a brutality to it that really struck a chord.As such this is the rare film where I truly despised the villains and wanted to see them get severe comeuppance. I felt that the lone remaining cult member at the end the one who lured Phil in got off far too easily. Ed had him at his mercy and I was hoping for some major pain to be dished out. Speaking of the cult it was great seeing Sean Astin as a sadistic follower of Santillan. He nailed it making me forget all about his countless goodytwoshoes characters from films past. I also have to mention Marco Bacuzzi the man who does most of the group's dirty work. He is a vicious bastard with an intimidating look that has been compared to that of Michael Berryman. The comparison is apt though I'd say he is even creepier since Berryman usually played bumbling types.Bravo After Dark. Continue saving these independents from obscurity for as long as you can. Some will be losers but this one's a winner through and through.".

It's a terrific film. It has one of the most nerve shattering horrific opening. Borderland is a great horror film that gets under your skin. I highly recommend it to those with strong stomachs. The script was solidly scary. It is loosely based on the true story of a drug lord and the leader of a religious cult that practiced human sacrifices. The tension in this film is very high and the atmosphere is genuinely scary. The direction by Zev Berman was really good. I don't know y he ain't doin any more movies.Decent acting by Rider Strong Tooth n nail Cabin fever. Was surprised to see Sean Astin Lord of the rings trilogy The goonies Rudy.

	schema:reviewBody "I have a problem with the new genre of torture porn that has muscled its way into the horror movie limelight with such movies as Hostel and Touristas. It's sick repugnant and of virtually no redeeming value and yet like a moth to a flame I can't bring myself to not watch it even though I end up cursing myself for subjugating my mind to its imagery afterward.Such was the case when the 2007 edition of Montreal's Fantasia Film Festival scheduled a screening of Borderland. I found myself driving downtown muttering to myself how I was going to regret this. And truth be told I almost did except that the movie came packaged in a fully fleshed out story pun intended that had the added impact of having been based on a true story.In 1989 Mexican police unearthed 12 bodies in the town of Matamoros. Their brains and spinal cords had been removed. It was later determined that a gang of drug smugglers had been practicing their own form of Santeria a religious hybrid of Catholicism and African religions similar to Voodoo. The leader of the gang Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo was worshiped as a living god by his followers and practiced the ritual sacrifice of wayward individuals in the belief that the gods would make them invisible to the police as they went about their drug smuggling operation.This is the backdrop that Borderland sets itself against as it tells the tale of a trio of Americans from Texas who head for a short stay in Mexico to indulge in some fast women and cheap booze. Along the way they hook up with a stunning and resourcefully independent Mexican barmaid played by Martha Higareda soon to be seen alongside Keanu Reeves and Hugh Laurie in The Night Watchmen and as fate would have it cross paths with members of the gang. The movie also delivers some truly twisted casting as Sean Austin of Lord of the Rings renown takes a villainous turn as the lone American member of the Santeria drug gang.Director Zev Berman for whom this movie marks only his third stint holding the directorial reigns does a remarkably good job keeping the pacing tight and focused blending a nice mix of story action and I hate to say it gore even though it's this latter part that I dearly wish could be toned down. The version I saw had not yet been rated by the MPAA so if there's any hope the more unnecessarily gory parts of it will be excised before it gets given its cinematic release. While I'm no advocate of censorship some of the gorier shots were just plain gratuitous. Berman would do well to recut the movie taking a cue from the original Saw as opposed to the sequels which illustrated just how gory you could make a movie while showing so little.Still Borderland plays out to a satisfying pay off and never let my interest flag along the way even if it did have me watching large chunks pun intended again through my fingers which I suppose is a good thing for some folks.".

	schema:headline " Brutal  gory flick based on the sacrificial murders of Adolfo de Jess Constanzo";
	schema:reviewBody "Released in 2007 Borderland is a horror film about three college guys Brian Presley Jake Muxworthy  Rider Strong on Spring Break in Galveston Texas who decide to skip over the border to party with the prostitutes. Their vacation goes awry when they run afoul of a brutal drug cult led by a charismaticbutdiabolic occultist Beto Cuevas. Damin Alczar plays a Mexican detective while Martha Higareda appears as the potential girlfriend of one of the Americans. Marco Bacuzzi plays the top cult henchmen with Sean Astin an American enlistee. The opening epilogue involves a gory torture sequence which is unpleasant to say the least but the story soon switches to the three Americans and their trip to Mexican strip joints where a couple curvy seoritas are highlighted. I could tell this was shot on the West Coast of Mexico rather than the East Coast. The city scenes for instance were shot in Tijuana substituting for Matamoros. The story is loosely based on the 1989 abduction of American premed student Mark Kilroy from outside a Mexican bar where he was taken to Adolfo de Jess Constanzo's ranch in the desert about an hour drive from Matamoros  the border. Fifteen mutilated corpses were discovered buried at the ranch one of them Kilroy's who was hacked to death by a machete. Constanzo's cult practiced sorcery in the form of Palo Mayombe engaging in torture and human sacrifice for supernatural power e.g. for their drugrunners to appear invisible to border guards. Constanzo was a known homosexual but the movie surrounds the Constanzobased character Santillan with Mexican babes. I doubt this was done to be politically correct I'm sure the filmmakers simply wanted to give him cinematic appeal for the target audience most of whom would run away screaming if Santillan was depicted with hunky dudes attending to his amorous needs.While the movie's sometimes unpleasant for obvious reasons it's gritty engaging and wellacted particularly the first half. I'm sure the director Zev Berman is a fan of films like Apocalypse Now because you definitely see glimmerings of that kind of greatness. Unfortunately this was the last movie by Berman as of this writing. He could've gone on to be a contenda like Coppola. The picture runs 100 minutes and was shot entirely in Baja California Mexico. It was written by Eric Poppen  director Zev Berman. GRADE B".

	schema:headline " A horrifying gory thriller that chills to the bone";
	schema:reviewBody "I attended the World Premiere of Borderland at the 2007 SXSW Film Festival. The fact that this was in the midnight screenings section should say a lot right off the bat. But what made this horror film so horrifying is that it all really happened. Borderland is based on the true story of ritual sacrifice killings conducted by a group of drug dealers in Mexico a few years back. The story centers around Phil chillingly played by Rider Strong Boy Meets World Cabin Fever. Phil and two of his college buddies are spending some quality time just across the Mexican border before shipping off to grad school. Strong is one of those actors who having started very young has such a naturalistic acting style that his performance here was frightening on many levels. The QA with director Zev Berman and cast members Rider Strong and Brian Presley ended close to 3 AM about as long as any I can remember and could have gone on all night. It was amazing how much of a stickler Berman was for being faithful to the story. It's hard to believe that some of the torture scenes really took place. But that's what makes it so gripping. It's one of the most gruesome films I've seen and would be right up there with some of the most shocking horrorslasherthrillers to come out lately if not for the fact that it all really happened. There have been many films at recent festivals which have been very hard to watch and this was no exception. It was an intense experience. But it absolutely has to be known going in that it is a true story because otherwise some of the scenes would strain credulity. I hope it can find an audience because it might be too tough for the highbrow crowd yet not as darkly comedic as most slasher flicks are to satisfy the horror crowd. I did see one film similarly horrific this year An American Crime at Sundance. It also plays out a shocking true story without pulling any punches. But Borderland is more entertaining if that makes sense because there is at least a genre that it falls into neatly. Anyone who loves a good gory thriller will enjoy it. But once they are aware it all really happened they will be chilled to the bone.".

I was not expecting much to begin with as I have that feeling going into every Afterdark Horrorfest film because I never know what I will get and the opening is really not that exciting so I got a little disheartened.After awhile after the movie spends enough time creating it's setting and theme that is it picks up pace and by now you have gotten the concept and are beginning to become interested in how exciting and well done it is becoming. It is a little slow paced considering that the first half is basically made up of showing how the three friends are wanting to have a good time by getting wasted until one of them is kidnapped to later discovered be used for a human sacrifice so that might throw some people off.The film has some points of really high interest however and even though it is slow paced after a disheartening opening it is nonetheless extremely entertaining throughout the remainder. The acting is really likable if not wonderful acting it is tolerable and the characters are manageable and the story while caught up in itself at times is fun and thrilling. The movie just manages to entertain so well that I could watch it again many times to come for how entertaining it is. It is a pretty basic film with nothing new to add but that does not matter when compared to how interesting and amusing it comes off as. At least I thought it was amusing highly amusing.".

Well not to detract from the verywelldone slashing elements of the movie and the supernatural pretensions of some of its protagonists it turned out to be a very neat beautifully realized crime thriller with a very sharp edge.The film begins with a tensionfilled scene that sets the stage for what is to come as two Mexican cops investigate a sinister dark mansion in search of the mysterious Santillan. We don't know who he is at this point only that his house bears testament to strange rites and animal sacrifices. When one of the cops discovers human remains among the animal ones the action begins in earnest and we learn very quickly that Santillan is not your average drug dealing psycho killer. No his selfstyled religion based on African PaloMayombe rites involves ritual sacrifices of a particularly gruesome order requiring not only blood but abject terror to appease the gods who then grant him favors to protect himself his minions and his drug trade.Then the main story commences as three recent college graduates from Texas decide to head across the border for a wild night or two of partying before going their separate ways. Through a seemingly random series of events their lives collide with that of the cultcartel in unimaginably terrifying ways and to no good end.Dialogue was crisp and realistic throughout as were all the settings. Acting was quite good exceptional in some cases and in some moments in particular. Brian Presley's final screen shots were excruciating depictions of a man turned against his own beliefs by brutal overriding experiences.But all the acting was notable Sean Astin acting against type as a brute and brutal follower of Santillan's camp Martha Higareda as Brian Presley's love interest and Rider Strong whose descent into terror convinces every nerve of the horror of his experience. And as Santillan Beto Cuevas exudes a silkily seductive but deeply sinister presence. In his portrayal Santillan's overblown ego is always apparent he believes himself to be invisible and invincible a neargod himself as long as he provides the sacrifices his bloodthirsty gods required. But most remarkable is his ability to convey what can only be described as compassionate cruelty. In one scene he tenderly caresses a chained victim who has been roughed up by one of the kidnappers stating bloodchillingly I don't believe in violence pause without a purpose. .Zev Berman as cowriter and director exercises his trademark sensitivity to setting and tone with clear and focused guidance and exquisite attention to detail. One episode that stood out for me took place in an amusement park where four of the main characters ingest hallucinogenic mushrooms a scene leading up to several pivotal moments in the story's development. It's always a challenge to depict experiences that are largely internal even more so to do it convincingly. In this case it was spot on. But that is just one example. Throughout the slow buildup to the movie's climactic and hugely terrifying denouement is perfectly paced. And the camera work dark and gritty adds much to the overall feeling of impending horror.I can't imagine why this movie did not receive a wider release. I hope as a Variety reviewer said that word of mouth will bring enough attention to it for blockbuster DVD sales. It deserves a great deal more than it is getting.".

I really like the basic strategy starting with a really nasty brutal scary torture scene introducing the horrifyingly sadistic and creepy Gustavo then for a fairly lengthy time we have this wonderful story full of indirection and feints and suggestiveness including all kinds of cultural misdirection and confusion during which I kept looking for a new horror along the lines of the initial scene of horror and finally after this long fearinducing buildup we get an even more horrifying torture scene and a bloodbath to go along with it. To me this all works very very well and the script gets top props for this arrangement and for really solid scenes throughout. The script is even sprinkled with some really great lines The border has no memory. I'll be back when I know what I'm doing. The script was executed very convincingly. The acting was consistently solid. Brian Presley's Ed was excellent and convincing and Jake Muxworthy gave us an excellent rendition of partyloving Henry. Valeria is attractively portrayed by Martha Higareda.As for the cult and cult members the script as executed gives the cult as such a strong flavor while giving us convincing portrayals of several very distinctively wicked members of the cult. The leader of the cult Beto Cuevas' Santillan was not for me nearly as salient as Marco Bacuzzi's Gustavo. Bacuzzi gives us a Gustavo who is to me so sadistic so creepy and so scenedominating that I would really put him in the same pantheon of nasty horror characters as Jason and Michael Myers and Hannibal Lector.The cinematography is consistently outstanding and there are some really great visuals. I especially liked the scenes in the amusement park and some of the indoor scenes such as the early scene of a policeman looking down a blue corridor with a statue of the Virgin Mary in a niche in the wall behind him and then another in which one of the female characters is climbing an indoor circular staircase. But really almost all of the scenes were really composed very effectively and the gory scenes were as gory and creepy and scary as one could wish.The only really big objection I had was to the sound which was just horribly washed out obscure and sometimes almost nonexistent as in the case of several gunshots that sounded like pencils tapping on a table. I couldn't really believe that the movie's sound could be this bad except that another audience member in my theater said he talked with theater staff which did try to make adjustments of some kind utterly unsuccessful.And I'll admit that I'd much rather see Gustavo as the top cultcreep.But all in all this is a wonderful horror movie that deserves a lot wider recognition as such IMHO.".

The plot concerns a trio of college friends who decide before they each move on to different schools to take a last minute trip over the border for some uninhibited debauchery. Things soon turn into a hellish nightmare when they become targets of a violent drug ringcult. What keeps this from being another Hostel knock off is Borderlands realistic approach to the material what makes the proceedings even more terrifying is that they are based on actual events. Also I was impressed by the quality of the film making and especially the acting which helps add to the realism look for an actor you might remember from the Lord of the Rings in very convincing unhobbit like role. From the nerve shattering horrific opening to the finale Borderland is great horror film that gets under your skin. I highly recommend it to those with strong stomachs.".

Which it does literally at the end.The three main male characters all way older than yettobe college freshmen are introduced as the usual narcissisticstupid jerks with one exception  they're human flesh and bone individuals. Petty selfinvolved unpleasant but real. And it's that sense of realism that raises Borderland to the status of 'serious' cine  a real movie not just a splash of images designed to pick teenage pockets.The secondary characters are just as real from the working girls on the street to the strippers in the bar to the primary villains and their henchmen. The extras are given little pieces of business that humanize and individualize them while the main characters like those overaged college males come across as being unique flesh and blood characters. So much so that even the overagedness of those males dissipates and loses its potential as a flaw. In reality Borderline's debt to slasher movies is slight just those males going off to Mexico to raise hell. Once that allusion is made Borderline turns the genre on its head in one short take  the virgin male talking and holding hands in the far focus with an underage and very cute hooker. Already a Real Movie that scene seals the deal and emphasizes that Borderline should be a filmschool staple  as demonstrated by its use of a lot of Eurocine techniques extreme closeups dizzying angle shoots strobe effects rapid cuts etc.  to effect to helping drive the storyline. A storyline that is about as horrific as imaginable. Real fleshedout characters being treated like the disposable teens of slasher movies.Cinematically from character development those three male are very much shocked out of their narcissism made very much aware of their vulnerability to pacing to framing to editing all dedicated to telling the story Borderland is virtually perfect. The only change I'd make is dropping the 'flyers' declaring that Borderline is based on a true story.The true story Borderline is based on is truly depraved but its villains were pathetic damaged spineless little critters deluding themselves into believing that they could fill the holes in their psyches by mimicking evil.Borderline is an exposition of true evil. It's to slasher films what Blood Simple is to revenge movies  both transcend far transcend the genres they spring from.Bottom line if you're expecting a shockfest adjust your expectations. Borderline is not about excuses for grabbing your date's boobs or sliding eager fingers under her skirt it's a real movie that demands serious attention.Some reviewers have mentioned flaws especially in the plot line. They may be there but you're going to have to dig deep to find them and even then it's a fuzzy call  like the status and motivation of the cop who survived the opening scene and which fall more into the area of 'suspension of disbelief' than storyjarring audienceyanking mistakes. One of Borderline's strengths is the seamless flow of its storyline beginning to end.".

	schema:headline " Run Away from the Border!";
	schema:reviewBody "I've had my share of bad experiences in Mexico. Four to be exact. This movie Based on a True Story is a bit extreme but I can definitely see it happening.It's allbut Hostel South of the Borderland. Three American dudes run into a cult of really really bad hombres and not the kind our foolish leader speaks of. While I am usually skeptical of True stories brought to cinemas this one from my own experiences there seems very and sadly plausible. Still the movie takes some leaps in dramatic effect since some of the characters don't survive and I highly doubt CSI records were kept of their demise  so how do we really know what happened to them?Though I'm ten years late in seeing this it felt a tad clich and predictable at times even for back then. That said for horror fans it's worth checking out. It's extremely gruesome with outrageous bad guys and good guys turned psychotic with justifiable motives. It will please most fans though if it is real it's hard to take this as just entertainment.Final thoughts As mentioned I've had my bad experiences inwith Mexico. Incredibly long stories short here are my four progressively bad tales southboundA My roommate borrowed my expensive camera without permission and took it to Mexico. Their hotel room was broken into and you'll never guess which singular item was stolenB My first trip to Mexico with a group of friends one of which took her stripper girlfriend with her that no one else liked. She ended up smuggling cocaine with her to the shock and disapproval of ALL of us. Luckily nothing happened and mercifully we never saw her again after that.C Went again with a new duo of friends. Both of them thought it would be a good idea to hang out with locals whom I strongly disapproved of and yada yada they almost got us arrested I had to bail us out and one of them fistfought my friend who in turn wanted to fistfight me for not defending him against the very people I warned him against.D Final trip to Mexico of my life February 1821 2000. After a successful night of partying with my supervisor and her husband we ventured out to a desert bar on rented quads the next morning. My first time on one and it was defective and I crashed sliding me 25mph across the sidewalk with the quad in tow. First I was taken to an ER where the doctor who pretended to not speak English wildly misdiagnosed me said my perfectly fine ribs were broken but my hand that was clearly broken was OK and he proceeded to drop me off the examination table onto the floor and then overcharged me for stuff he could've done without doing. Next I was hauled off to the police station and almost arrested for drinking and riding but I hadn't been drinking  it was an accident. So the police decided it best for me to drain my bank account for a bogus causing an accident charge  they escorted me to the nearest ATM and required me to withdraw all my cash available. My face was halfcharred from the sidewalk scrapping my hand ballooned out and I was out 500 for fraudulent hospital charges and unlawful police bribes. No offense against anyone that lives there peacefully but F your country. For as long as I live I will never enter your country again. It's been 17 years since I last was there and even that's too soon.".

	onyx:emotionText "I've had my share of bad experiences in Mexico. Four to be exact. This movie Based on a True Story is a bit extreme but I can definitely see it happening.It's allbut Hostel South of the Borderland. Three American dudes run into a cult of really really bad hombres and not the kind our foolish leader speaks of. While I am usually skeptical of True stories brought to cinemas this one from my own experiences there seems very and sadly plausible. Still the movie takes some leaps in dramatic effect since some of the characters don't survive and I highly doubt CSI records were kept of their demise  so how do we really know what happened to them?Though I'm ten years late in seeing this it felt a tad clich and predictable at times even for back then. That said for horror fans it's worth checking out. It's extremely gruesome with outrageous bad guys and good guys turned psychotic with justifiable motives. It will please most fans though if it is real it's hard to take this as just entertainment.Final thoughts As mentioned I've had my bad experiences inwith Mexico. Incredibly long stories short here are my four progressively bad tales southboundA My roommate borrowed my expensive camera without permission and took it to Mexico. Their hotel room was broken into and you'll never guess which singular item was stolenB My first trip to Mexico with a group of friends one of which took her stripper girlfriend with her that no one else liked. She ended up smuggling cocaine with her to the shock and disapproval of ALL of us. Luckily nothing happened and mercifully we never saw her again after that.C Went again with a new duo of friends. Both of them thought it would be a good idea to hang out with locals whom I strongly disapproved of and yada yada they almost got us arrested I had to bail us out and one of them fistfought my friend who in turn wanted to fistfight me for not defending him against the very people I warned him against.D Final trip to Mexico of my life February 1821 2000. After a successful night of partying with my supervisor and her husband we ventured out to a desert bar on rented quads the next morning. My first time on one and it was defective and I crashed sliding me 25mph across the sidewalk with the quad in tow. First I was taken to an ER where the doctor who pretended to not speak English wildly misdiagnosed me said my perfectly fine ribs were broken but my hand that was clearly broken was OK and he proceeded to drop me off the examination table onto the floor and then overcharged me for stuff he could've done without doing. Next I was hauled off to the police station and almost arrested for drinking and riding but I hadn't been drinking  it was an accident. So the police decided it best for me to drain my bank account for a bogus causing an accident charge  they escorted me to the nearest ATM and required me to withdraw all my cash available. My face was halfcharred from the sidewalk scrapping my hand ballooned out and I was out 500 for fraudulent hospital charges and unlawful police bribes. No offense against anyone that lives there peacefully but F your country. For as long as I live I will never enter your country again. It's been 17 years since I last was there and even that's too soon.";

I was contemplating watching it due to the Average rating on IMDb but I decided to watch it on Netflix and it was a great choice. This movie is factual and is based on a true story about Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo which did make this more interesting than most horror movies I have seen. This movie isn't a typical horror movie that just kills people to kill but is a big part of the movie and makes perfect sense. Some might be disturbed by the opening scene but the rest of the movie is totally worth it. The intense scenes in this movie made me get antsy and I love the feeling of thrill and excitement in a movie and this had a lot of it. I will be watching this many more times in the future for sure. I give Borderland a 9 out of 10.Joe".

	schema:reviewBody "I've noticed that many of the torture movies are either American or European based Europeans and Americans aren't the only people who enjoy that pleasure what about south of the border? Mexico is the home and setting for this film. Essentially telling the accounts of three college students who go to Mexico for beer and girls and end up getting tangled with a sadistic cult. This was based off a very similar incident in the town of Matamoros in 1989 where the cult members removed the brains and spinal cords of the human sacrifices. This movie depicts the gross and gruesome bits of the story to full and blood red detail. The acting and emotions seemed very real and the most horrible part was the killings in the sense that they were real at one point or the other. Whether or not these American teens really lived and died didn't matter but the fates of those 12 people are.Lets get down to brass tax the acting seemed pretty real and very emotionally driven. The chemistry that Brian Presley and Martha Higareda have together on screen was amazing and their characters were played off with dedication to the part. Jake Muxworthy and Rider Strong play Ed's Presley friends who accompany him. Muxworthy's performance was outstanding and seemed to have really gotten into his character. Rider Strong's performance during the first half of the movie can be debatable but when he gets kidnapped by one of the cult members and tortured his somewhat mediocre acting skyrockets to amazing. Damin Alczar plays Ulises a detective who seeking redemption and to avenge his partners death. His performance was outstanding and almost believable especially in the prologue. Marco Bacuzzi who plays the sadistic butcher of the cult does a phenomenal job brining this calm evil character to life on the big screen. Through out the movie he guts people takes their heads arms and eyes and backstabs them. His speaking parts were somewhat limited as well as his character's on screen time but the parts that he did show up were amazing. On an average all of these actors and actresses did an amazing job giving life to such clichridden teenagers. Their acting enhanced the illusion that these teenagers are real and that what is happening to them is realer.The plot as well as the way that the whole thing was shot reminded me of Eli Roth's Hostel. In this case this was a Mexican version of Hostel with a deeper subtext than Hostel. I don't know something about this movie gave it depth feel emotion and style but I can't put my hand on it. Even though the storyline kids captured by cult members has been milked so many times through out history there was some key ingredient that made this movie work. There where parts where you can feel what the actors and going through especially the torture and points where you feel for the actors and actresses after loosing someone close. This film utilized closeup shots to the extreme which in the process reminded me of Robert Rodriguez's El Mariachi trilogy El Mariachi Desperado and Once Upon A Time in Mexico. Coincidently they all take place in Mexico and one has a cultlike group. I can also see a heavy influence of Texas Chainsaw in this film including both recent and original. Teens being hunted down and brought to a house where they have to face torture and where the family of this house eat and make things out of human appendages. The only difference between these two films was that Texas Chainsaw was based off of Ed Gein who killed for an unknown reason while Borderland's satanic group was killing for a false god. The camera angles and they way that this movie was shot made it seem like there was somebody following around these teens with a camcorder and the establishing shots as well as the social angles were magnificently played out. This movie had a great warm tone to it the way that any South of the Border movie should me shot. The characters gave this movie depth and feel while the plot slowly drives you into mayhem and inevitably into a final confrontation of good and pure evil a battle that is reminiscent of old spaghetti westerns and John Wayne movies. Overall this movie was not jump out scary but more Oh my god that can't be happening. What are they doing? scary. It of coarse had to have hot Mexican girls and beautiful looking Americans which for me is a bit clich and at points the movie seems a bit over the top but I like it. I would recommend this movie to those who enjoy torture horror Texas Chainsaw Hostel and early Robert Rodriguez flicks. I certainly like it.".

Yes the situation is terrifying but that doesn't necessarily make it horror. From the hype I had heard I was expecting Hostel in Mexico. Thankfully the filmmakers went another direction. Borderland is simply a really engaging thriller with some visceral and bloody moments. But horror fans should not be put off by those comments. It's actually a good movie which is more than I can say for the majority of the Horrorfest movies. It involves three friends who go to Mexico to live it up for a few days before returning home and possibly going their separate ways through life. One friend is kidnapped and tortured by an evil cult who operate near the border. The other two buds are left to their own devices when they get no help from the police or any of the scared townsfolk. The biggest surprise here is the acting. After coming off the disappointed Tooth and Nail another Horrorfest flick Rider Strong returns to my good graces with a wonderfully vulnerable performance. He plays the kidnapped friend and does a great job. Equally good are Brian Presley as the voice of reason among the friends and Jake Muxworthy in the role of the group's ahole. One actor going very much against type here is Sean Astin. He plays one of the cult's deranged followers. Now this is a guy I love to love. This is Rudy...freakin' Samwise! I'm impressed that he was willing to try something different but I just don't want to see that out of my Goonies. One other complaint comes at the finale. I wasn't as satisfied as I should have been at the end. Comparatively speaking the villains did not get as good as they gave. Though nothing I would buy I enjoyed the viewing experience and would recommend this to others.".

	schema:headline " Disturbingly Realistic Crime Horror.";
	schema:reviewBody "Borderland follows three male friends Ed Brian Presley Henry Jake Muxworthy and Phil Rider Strong who travel down to a Mexican border town to party and enjoy themselves. All is fun and games until Phil goes missing one night kidnapped by a humansacrificial religious cult that is lead by a crazed madman. Held by an American redneck follower of the cult Randall Sean Astin Phil endures violent abuse and struggles to save his life while Ed and Henry with the help of a local bartender Valeria Martha Higareda search for him as the cult begins to ensue with their rituals in a race against time.This is the first film of Horrorfest's 8 Films to Die For 2007 that I've seen and I had heard it was pretty underrated and I personally have to agree. While I haven't seen any of the other Horrorfest films this year Borderland was a surprisingly wellmade disturbing horror movie. I'm surprised it didn't get a wider release actually because it was very good. The story itself is flatout disturbing because it is based on real ritual murders that took place in Mexico in the late 1980s. Now I'm sure the writers did elongate some of the truth for entertainment purposes but the reality that the storyline is rooted with fact and that something like this happened takes the disturbing factor to a greater level.One thing I really admired about this movie though was how unbelievably realistic the violence was portrayed in it. I can handle watching violence in most horror movies because a lot of the time it's glorified overthetop or doesn't look convincing enough. But I can say I was cringing and looking away at times during this film that rooftop scene was beyond brutal. Not only that but the character's actions and reactions were all very real as were the action scenes  this movie really managed to attain a solid sense of realism which most horror movies don't do. The DVstyle cinematography similar to the style of Wolf Creek and often reminiscent of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre adds to the gritty realism of it as well and enhances all of this giving the feeling of almost being 'there' to see it all happen. Toss some voodoo and witchcraft aspects into the mix being the crazed sacrificial cult plus the fact that the villains are for once not masked superhuman beasts but are very real people and it makes things even eerier.However there are a few pitfalls here. There is the outofnowhere character who has a past and information on the villains in the case the cult and rallies with our protagonists which is pretty clich. At times the acting is also a bit uneven which does throw off the threads of realism. For the most part though the performers do a good job. Rider Strong TV's Boy Meets World and Cabin Fever and Sean Astin Lord of the Rings trilogy The Goonies are the most notable of the cast with Astin in a role you'd probably not expect him to be in. He does a great job though as does Strong and the rest of the cast. They're all pretty solid overall but there's a few bad line deliveries. The final sequence was excellent and very wellchoreographed too and the ending was abrupt and unrelenting just like the ninety minutes that lead up to it.Overall Borderland is a surprisingly good horror movie. Ignore the negative comments here and give it a try for yourself. It's miles above films like Hostel which it seems to be often compared to and is one of those rare horror flicks that manages to attain a sense of reality. The actual crimes that it's based off of are disturbing as well and it makes the movie even more chilling when kept in mind. It does have a few minor flaws here and there but of all the Horrorfest movies I've seen Borderland ranks up there with the best of them. It's gritty realistic and consistently frightening. Worth seeing for any horror fans it's a lot better than you'd probably expect. 810.".

	onyx:emotionText "Borderland follows three male friends Ed Brian Presley Henry Jake Muxworthy and Phil Rider Strong who travel down to a Mexican border town to party and enjoy themselves. All is fun and games until Phil goes missing one night kidnapped by a humansacrificial religious cult that is lead by a crazed madman. Held by an American redneck follower of the cult Randall Sean Astin Phil endures violent abuse and struggles to save his life while Ed and Henry with the help of a local bartender Valeria Martha Higareda search for him as the cult begins to ensue with their rituals in a race against time.This is the first film of Horrorfest's 8 Films to Die For 2007 that I've seen and I had heard it was pretty underrated and I personally have to agree. While I haven't seen any of the other Horrorfest films this year Borderland was a surprisingly wellmade disturbing horror movie. I'm surprised it didn't get a wider release actually because it was very good. The story itself is flatout disturbing because it is based on real ritual murders that took place in Mexico in the late 1980s. Now I'm sure the writers did elongate some of the truth for entertainment purposes but the reality that the storyline is rooted with fact and that something like this happened takes the disturbing factor to a greater level.One thing I really admired about this movie though was how unbelievably realistic the violence was portrayed in it. I can handle watching violence in most horror movies because a lot of the time it's glorified overthetop or doesn't look convincing enough. But I can say I was cringing and looking away at times during this film that rooftop scene was beyond brutal. Not only that but the character's actions and reactions were all very real as were the action scenes  this movie really managed to attain a solid sense of realism which most horror movies don't do. The DVstyle cinematography similar to the style of Wolf Creek and often reminiscent of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre adds to the gritty realism of it as well and enhances all of this giving the feeling of almost being 'there' to see it all happen. Toss some voodoo and witchcraft aspects into the mix being the crazed sacrificial cult plus the fact that the villains are for once not masked superhuman beasts but are very real people and it makes things even eerier.However there are a few pitfalls here. There is the outofnowhere character who has a past and information on the villains in the case the cult and rallies with our protagonists which is pretty clich. At times the acting is also a bit uneven which does throw off the threads of realism. For the most part though the performers do a good job. Rider Strong TV's Boy Meets World and Cabin Fever and Sean Astin Lord of the Rings trilogy The Goonies are the most notable of the cast with Astin in a role you'd probably not expect him to be in.

Though he started out humbly enough cranking out vanity videos for German sex starlet Angela Baron the ROBOFOX movies GUESS WHO CAME AT DINNER ? THE BITCH etc. as ordered by her late mobster husband Perry Ross his filmmaking fate would become inextricably entwined with that of Vivid Video head honcho Steve Hirsch. It's a tough call to decide whether Vivid flourished as one of the top dog carnal companies because of P.T.'s creative contributions or vice versa. Though the studio still shoots quite a lot of its features on film compared to many of its competitors it produces but one or two lavish flagship titles per year  designed to clean up at the AVN Awards  and those are strictly Thomas territory. So it was also with BORDERLINE back in 1995 Vivid's most expensive endeavor to date and they weren't shy about letting the public know about that as their publicity department stands as one of the most effective in an already bustling field. It has a huge cast  though many big name performers like Missy and Nici Sterling only turn up briefly in orgy action  and extensive location footage in Mexico. Though far more thinly plotted than the director's subsequent masterpieces like BAD WIVES the MASSEUSE sequels and THE AWAKENING it may just be his most erotically effective work.Giving his trusting wife Brandy the radiant if sadly underused Sandra Margot aka Tyffany Million the goodbye thrust cantankerous executive Daniel superbly played by Steven St. Croix at his most annoyingly bratty takes off for a business trip with extracurricular playmate Julia trophy wife of wealthy Ross character actor George Kaplan. Never noted for acting ability lovely Celeste nevertheless turns in a career performance as the laidback lay to Steve's whining and therefore clearly undeserving paramour. Her dialog delivery may still not be the greatest but there's a whole world of emotion behind those gorgeous eyes as expressed by all the caressing closeups DoP Ralph Parfait bestows upon her. Once their car breaks down South of the border and the local mechanic doesn't seem in too much of a hurry to get things fixed the first cracks in their relationship begin to show. While this is just a dirty weekend for Daniel it seems much more for Julia stifled by a loveless marriage and waiting to break out. The carefree sensuality that seems to spill from every dimly lit corner of the picturesque village has very different effects on the both of them. Daniel pretends to be shocked by each wanton display which adds more grist on the mill of Julia's impending liberation. It doesn't take a genius to figure out where this is heading. Naturally there's a mysterious local stranger who intuitively seems to know all their deepest darkest secrets  the charismatic Jorge as portrayed by the frequently underrated Tony Montana in a rare meaty role  who takes on the role of catalyst in the movie's inevitable denouement throwing a sex party where all the masks come off.What's so special about BORDERLINE is its deliberate breaking away from staid sex scene structures as laid down by present day dictates. As in the more unpredictable adult movies of the free form '70s sex occurs infrequently in spurts if you will not always in complete encounters taken from foreplay to cum shot but in tiny fragments that pop up from nowhere and whose cumulative effect proves ultimately overwhelming. Probably the best illustration of this technique comes courtesy of streetwalker Bridgette Monroe one of the most unjustly overlooked starlets of the '90s taking care of local law enforcer Gino Grant in a dimly lit doorway their raw animal passion startling the central characters. More of a mood piece than a tightly constructed narrative the movie gradually builds erotic momentum through each successive sex scene or snippet thereof. Celeste is the first to relent to horny hotel maid Toni aka Dorian Grant who did a memorable threesome with Christy Canyon and Krista Maze in P.T.'s THE SHOW on a wooden staircase imaginatively framed through the banister. Tellingly Steve only gives in to the amorous advances of haystack honeys Alicia Rio and Tabitha from the fiery double penetration bit in Ernest Greene's PLAYTHING 2 when sanctioned by his onlooking lover and still finds it necessary to apologize for this transgression afterwards. Never the twain shall meet indeed and their eventual breakup is a foregone conclusion.

	schema:reviewBody "It is wellknown that those with money do not ever speak of moneytheirs or anyone else's. Jamie Johnson admirably shattered this longstanding taboo despite pleas from his own father and lawyer not to make the film and discovered the hard way what happens when the secrecy curtain is lifted from the uberwealthy. Born Rich is ostensibly Johnson's way of finding normalcy whatever that may mean to those born into wealth unfortunately he was ostracized from the GenX upper class for turning a mirror onto the real lives of his blueblood friends.The most fascinating part of Born Rich isn't what is seen on camera but what took place offscreen. Luke Weil sued Johnson to have his footage cut from the film claiming that hean Ivyleagueeducated adultwas tricked into signing a release. Weil's lawsuit was thrown out and it is now apparent to the world why he didn't want his footage seen. Among other gems Weil tells the interviewer that any woman who wouldn't sign a prenup is an ungrateful little bitch brags of coasting through Brown University without attending class and how he would taunt classmates with I can buy your family. Sadly Weil is not even the most odious of the film's assembled characters. That distinction belongs to Carlo von Zeitschel a minor European royal who claims to be a descendant of Kaiser Wilhelm II strangely his name does not appear in the Kaiser's family tree. With his chainsmoking and foreign flippancy he sneers I have no intention of being loyal to any woman anytime soon not that I probably ever will be... One day I'll fall in love and I'll get married whatever. I'll probably get divorced a couple of years later. In the DVD's deleted scenes he dismisses his American peers as so cheesy they're like the fcking Brady Bunch. Weil's and von Zeitschel's contributions to the film are embarrassing to watch and epitomize everything that is wrong with inherited wealth. The other heirs in the film do not fare much better Stephanie Erklentz quit her job as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch so she could spend her days shopping and sipping Bellinis with her friends. Cody Franchetti is an Italian textile heir who works as a model because he doesn't want a real job. Juliet Hartford fancies herself a starving artist minus the starving part who when asked what she would do with a million dollars in cash says I'd give it to the homeless then bursts out laughing and spurts Just kidding! However these vignettes also speak volumes about the sense of narcissistic confusion that stems from having enormous wealth handed down without integrity or values. The real problem with some of these kids is poor parenting not excess. It is very clear that wellrounded responsible adults come from proper mentoring not undeserved wealth or social status.And despite soundbites like these Johnson manages to make you feel sorry for his subjects despite their grossly excessive lifestyles their wealth is tremendously isolating. These children are locked in their own private world surrounded only by others like them. They have been trained to never socialize or date outside the upper crust and while most attended college their trust funds give them no incentive to make a meaningful contribution to the working world and no mentors to provide guidance. When Johnson asks his emotionallydetached father for career advice he is vaguely advised to become a collector of historical maps. He goes to great lengths to show the perils of having too much money using his grandfather's messy life as an example.The bright spot of Born Rich is Ivanka Trump who is witty and articulate and balks at the notion that the rich have no problems. She along with S.I. Newhouse IV and Josiah Hornblower appear to be the most welladjusted of the bunch. They have contemplated the bizarreness of their lives and seem to be aware of the trappings of decadence and materialism. Newhouse chose to live in a shared college dorm instead of his father's plush Manhattan penthouse. These three have no pretenses they are just young adults with big bank accounts and huge legacies to fulfill.The film is very short  barely over an hour  and Johnson doesn't attempt to delve into the more meaty issues characterizing the class war. He simply turns the camera on his friends and allows them to expose the classism on their own. Some seem refreshingly average others troubled others spoiled arrogant and mean. But they are all human and face the same struggle for selfidentity as anyone else.This is why it is extremely important to remain thoughtful and openminded while watching and not to categorize all superrich as elitist snobs or naysayers of the rich as jealous. If you have such preformed opinions you will find little here to change your mind or encourage you to think deeper. Still every viewer will have a strong reaction to the film in some way because inherited wealth is at odds with the capitalist principle of worth by way of achievement. That idea will undoubtedly rankle you regardless of sympathies.It took enormous chutzpah for Johnson to make this film. Though it is unlikely to change high society's hushhush attitudes about wealth or the public's reaction to class clash this film is a daring experiment and hopefully a promising start to a great filmmaking career.".

Jamie Johnson deserves so much credit for being a young man of privilege who dares to think about what his good fortune really means much like the rest of humanity is forced to think daily about what their poverty and debt really means. Frankly I never would have expected such an evenhanded treatment of the subject from one of them.The biggest barrier to learning how the superrich really think is access. To gain access you must either be one of them which usually precludes talking about money publicly or you must be a member of the mainstream media which only offers favorablyedited politicallycorrect glimpses of reality otherwise the media too would lose their access. Johnson has produced an essential work here by bridging the gap and allowing the rest of the world to witness largely unedited the way in which these extremely wealthy young people view their own fortunes. I can only hope the day will come when older generations among the superrich will agree to be similarly interviewed although I suspect we will all be deeply saddened by what they have to say.Just like on skid row a few of the young people here especially Johnson himself seem above average in terms of humanity most of them are just average and the remaining few seem to be useless wastes of human flesh that would bring shame to any family rich or poor. That's pretty much the same bell curve you'll find in any other social strata of society proving once again that money is ultimately irrelevant except to those who are obsessed by it.Much has been written here about Luke Weill's contribution to the film which I found simply embarrassing to watch. If he is the ambassador of our species when the gray aliens finally land I won't even argue with their decision to wipe humanity off the face of the earth without a trial. He makes a great case that there is nothing wrong with extraordinary wealth but everything wrong with inherited wealth. Most important Weill proves that whether you are rich or poor the quality of the person become is your own choice. I've seen little whiners like that come from plenty of poor families so his disturbing behavior has nothing to do with his family's wealth. The gene pool in the Hamptons seems as muddy as it is everywhere else in the world.But it is Juliet Hartford who deserves the contempt award here for her answer to the question of what she'd do with a million dollars cash. Laughing at the homeless? I've worked with the homeless for years and most of them are far superior in character and personality to Ms. Hartford and from what I can tell the homeless are more talented as well. Thank God she is locked in her own zoo surrounded only by her own kind. I hate to think of how much damage a woman like this could cause in the real world where real people live.Surprisingly Ivanka Trump comes across as fairly downtoearth. Ordinarily I would argue with a billionaire's decision to use that money to simply build more ugly concrete and steel when she has so much potential to build a better world instead. But at least she justifies her ambitions with a genuine interest in real estate development it's in our blood. That's better than nothing.The only sympathy I can feel for these kids is the fact that they have been deprived of reality all their lives and I don't see any way they'll ever experience that. They are so terrified of dating outside their own circles despite the incredibly boring people they have to choose from I can't see them ever making a truly meaningful connection with the masses that define their own species. Concepts such as honor sacrifice and simplicity seem to be completely foreign to them. Their parents really stole a lot from them and it's a shame they don't recognize this and forsake their wealth for a better life. After all they can always earn their own fortune laterit'd be as easy for them as it is for the rest of us right?".

	schema:reviewBody "The supposedly inane problems of inherited wealth are reframed quite well in this film. I felt that there was an important contradiction made clear. America's 400 year old flight from Europe's monarchies and class systems is both long over and yet still taking place. I don't believe that this contradiction has anything to do with money.Personal dignity is the prize at the end of the American dream. And yet dignity is far more elusive than we'd like to believe. This has a lot more to do with practical parenting and the real value that children have to their parents and how it's shown NOT how much they spend or can spend on their children.Americans have steadfastly in principal defined personal worth by personal achievement. Whether you began your days in humble circumstances or not you can with effort create the wealth and comfort for yourself and your family that you need. This is the American Idea. And yet this principal becomes mere theory for those whose lives are defined utterly by someone else's effort often long before they were born. The problems of these people are somewhat anachronistic to the rest of us. And also quietly disturbing because there is a wound that the American identity struggles with on the subject of wealth power history and privilege royalty. Americans are both attracted to the glamor of privilege and repelled intellectually. Some part of our problem is universal how to define personal value when those with power apparently don't need to worry about it. There is an important moment in the film where in a candid remark a young man describes a sense of pique he'd experienced where he had said to himself about someone he was annoyed with we could buy your family and he believes it. This says volumes about the sense of narcissistic confusion that stems from an identity where basic values have not been passed down and personal dignity is not fought for. What more compelling is that the young man also seems to be aware of that fact.A few of these people seem to be trying to reset their values to relate to the rest of us. This is a specifically American virtue and it separates them from the rest who have delusions of relevance bloated even more by this film's interest in their lives they wouldn't be out of place in the courts of Europe a century ago.A fascinating film.".

I had such a strong reaction to it that it's hard for me to even write this review. Try to view it as I did with open ears and an open mind and one may feel a reaction that I myself was surprised to feel sympathy. Right... you're thinking. Sympathy for those little devils born rich.No really. I felt a bit of sympathy and a bit of disgust just listen to Luke Weil yakking about little bitches who won't sign prenups but my true reaction was one of Oh... So that's how they live that's how it is and if I were one of them the socalled elite I'd probably end up a drugged up boozedup mess. Why would that life be so bad? The main theme I found running throughout the film was one of despair especially from the thoughtful and determined filmmaker himself Jaime Johnson heir to the the Johnson  Johnson throne. This kid is so honest in his searching he even gets himself into a bit of legal trouble in the end I won't ruin the rest of that tidbit for you. One thing that a viewer of modest income will be shocked to learn is that talking about one's wealth among the fellow wealthy at least is taboo. Many of these kids learnt of their parents fortune through the outside world and not from their parents themselves. I could even understand why some of these kids felt betrayed by this. What I think is disconcerting to most of these kids is that coming into that knowledge of their own wealth and whether they realize it or not they were born without a certain something that every nonrich human on the planet has... that tension of survival that struggle of having to work to survive that struggle of knowing that all of our youth and most of our lives are literally wasted on working hard to gain money. The scary thing I thought of while watching this is that not only is money power but money is also freedom and ultimately too much freedom can bring disaster.The kids in this film are all interesting enough to listen to they're talking about their fabulous lives after all. Most are shallow mentioning how they have to have that Gucci purse or those 600 shoes. But a few are thoughtful Johnson Ivanka Trump and Josiah Hornblower especially and some downright angry S.I. IV Newhouse. All said and done this film is a good look into how these kids function how they think and how regardless of wealth what kind of people they actually are. It goes without saying at the end of the day if you can't live with yourself then your life is utterly hopeless.".

	schema:reviewBody "The documentary Born Rich is an interesting analysis of how people are born into money. In this time of economic crisis as many of us struggle to pay our bills on a regular basis it is both interesting and maddening to hear about the problems of the super rich. There are certainly moments in this film where you realize that the absurd society in which these kids were born into has transformed them as they aged and you feel bad for them.They start out so innocent as they describe their childhoods unaware of the massive wall that the upper class has built around them. And as they mature and grow into adulthood the money twists them and burns away all true moral value. And by the end of the film they are portrayed as snotty brats who complain that it's hard for them not to walk into a boutique in Hollywood and buy a 700 handbag. Or how the first two things they think of when entertaining the thought of marriage are prenuptial agreement and divorce. Oh the challenges we face in life. It all makes for a sickening experience. And the way they cling to their entitlement is quite interesting as well. One character in the film discusses going to college so that he can make something of himself. He talks about the day that he can rub his parents faces in the fact that he did something on his own and made something of himself. Which would mean something if he weren't attending an ivy league school on his parents dime. The whole film reeks of selfgratifying posturing that these rich elitists immerse themselves in day after day. It is an interesting film however if you have the stomach for it.A. Leonhardt".

Even if he was tricked which I don't believe he was if that is his outlook on life I am glad I never have to worry about coming in contact with him. He is an embarrassment to the elite population and should be sanctioned for the way he acted in this movie.

Luke Weil well enough has been said on him that I should not waste a keystroke more on him. He makes his own case for why folks are disgusted by the idle heirs of fortunes.I was sad for the WhitneyVanderbilt kid Hornblower??. He looks like a tragic scarred young man. I suspect he probably would have been that way whether rich or poor.My favorites were Johnson himself Ivanka Trump and the Newhouse young man. These three make no pretenses to be anything but themselves young folks with big bank and huge legacies to live up to or shoulder the burden of. I trust them to make something of their lives that will do something for others even if it is limited in scope with how it will impact others.But overall? I'm glad they all stick to the same gene pool. Best to keep them separated...Great documentary. Hope he makes more! Hope he doesn't listen to his Dad who recommended he collect historic documents for a living?!?!".

I earned everything I have and it's made me a richer deeper more spiritual person. I don't live every breathing moment with the fear that I'll upset someone and have my money cushion yanked out from under me. Still I shook my head sadly as some of these kids Weil Bloomberg the Europeans the AP heiress wait does AP even exist anymore? really are clueless. They are so oblivious to their narcissism that would otherwise be laughable if one didn't remember that narcissism is really only a mask for crippled selfesteem and an extraordinarily damaged sense of one's purpose in life.Some of the others particularly Ivanka Trump appeared more grounded and in touch with the way the world really works than the aforementioned kids. Kudos to them!Although I'm not rich I have a few friends who are from the Palm BeachHamptonshave a place on the Upper East Sideold money clan and although I sometimes don't get their lifestyle a 3 million dollar beach house with Mercedes as a gift from mommy and daddy when one friend graduated college another who hops his dad's corporate Gulfstream to Brazil every couple of months to have his suits made because he really likes the tailor I can honestly say that they have worked hard at their own jobs and are becoming successful in their own right my beach house friend is a social worker and her paycheck is donated to a charity that provides college scholarships for lowincome kids. I would like to see a sequel where these kids have to live for three months with no inheritance in a lower class neighborhood and see who learns the most from it.

He is thus faced with the question what does one do when one can do anything or nothing at all? Born Rich is whether intentional or not the result of Johnson looking up to his parents down to his legacy all around to his peers and most importantly within himself for the answer. If such introspection isn't hard enough for the common folk it appears to be exceedingly difficult for the ultrarich who habitually measure themselves by status rather than personal achievement.Unavoidably guided by the weight of such measurement Johnson gives us a glance at what everybody else is doing to answer that ageold question. No more than a glance is granted by the participants  other wealthy heirs and their parents  thanks to a deep sense of exclusivity and a hearty helping of insecurity prevalent within ultrarich societies. But alas no more than a glance is needed. With exceptions their words and behaviors commonly reveal poor judgment and a unique lack of morality bred by a world in which moral dilemmas are handled by family attorneys. Perhaps that's why Jamie Johnson was sued to have one heir's appearance removed and waivers voided it didn't work. By the end of it all the moviegoer has passed out more letters of approval and condemnation to the parents and their children than he had come prepared to give. It is no doubt a movie which makes the viewer feel better about himself.And yet the question looms what does one do with his life when he doesn't have to do anything? Jamie Johnson seems to have found a spark. Despite the shortcomings of a firsttime filmmaker Johnson deserves more kudos than criticism for his work. One should applaud the intestinal fortitude to lift the veil  albeit a bit but a coveted bit  on the lives of those born ultrarich and the society in which they live and also for making a legitimate effort to seek fulfillment and selfactualization in his life. In doing so Johnson has actually accomplished something. He has overcome an often troublesome sense of life which deceptively presents itself as a mere dare to ultrarich individuals who don't have to do anything if they don't so desire.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was a very interesting movie that provided an accurate insight into the lives of wealthy teenagers who inherited their families money. Most of the kids were very open and willing to give their story and talk about what they do knowing they are rich however some are skeptical and afraid to be open about talking about their family and money. Most people associate wealth with happiness. The more money you have the happier you are. This is not true because they talk about the fear of somebpdy using them just for their money and wealth. I admire the fact that Jamie Johnson wanted to get his dad to talk about money although he always avoided it. He wanted to prevent any problems that he may encounter when he is older. It is very eye opening the fact that these kids can go without having to work a single day in their entire lives. This movie either gave you a new perspective about wealthy kids or not but it was a very well produced movie.".

All of them were spoiled rotten but some of them are respectful and others are arrogant and disdainful.

Does money buy happiness? I guess you'll find out. But like Ivanka Trump said wealthy people are still people and they  while having an easier life  feel pain just like everyone else. Jamie's directing skills in his debut aren't anything special and it sometimes looks like a homemade film. But the content itself is good and that's what matters.".

A scene featured a painting over the fireplace that might have been his but the studio scene made it clear that the father did not want his art on this film.

You go in expecting a cheap forgettable experience and the majority of the time that's exactly what you get. Thankfully 'Absence Of The Good' is actually decent. Here we find Caleb Barnes Baldwin as a Salt Lake City homicide detective trying to settle back into his job after losing his son. His wife is still somewhat shattered by it but Caleb puts on a strong face and tries to move on. Naturally soon he and his partner become entangled in a series of murders who's linked nature only becomes apparent as they pick up the pieces but it's time they can't afford as the killer continues to strike out at the innocent.Now I know what you're thinking. At first glance 'Absence' seems like any other serial killer movie to come along. What sets it apart is it's tightly filmed acted and shot. Never once does it become bogged down in overcomplicated plot  character points or try to be something it's not. It has something to say gets in says it then leaves.Stephen Baldwin turns in his usual self and while that has been a detractor in other movies for once his mannerisms don't sink the movie but actually fit in nicely. With a supporting cast of Tyne Daly as a psychologist and Robert Knepper strong as Caleb's partner. Under the direction of John Flynn who also directed 1987's Best Seller  one of my favorite sleeper films the story is somewhat slow going but it builds to a fine end that hits the right note. For a low budget DTV television movie starring Stephen Baldwin of all people  the results are decent.".

In short the person is pure evil.Already suffering from deep emotional trauma in his 12 year old son Michael getting shot to death in school by a friend who tried to show off his father's gun Caleb is now involved in a deranged serial murderer who after murdering his victims tidies up the place as if he didn't want the victim's blood to dirty up the house. It takes a while but Caleb soon discovers that the killer was someone who just happened to live as a boy in the very houses that he's now committing his horrendous crimes in.The stress of Caleb's investigation as well as Michael's death soon takes it's toll on his wife Mary who's at the point of being committed into a mental institution. Trying to get Mary help Caleb asks police psychiatrist Dr. Marcia Lyons to treat her which goes nowhere in Mary feeling that she'll be declared insane by Dr. Lyons and put away for good. Together with his police partner Det. Glen Dwyer Caleb narrows down the killer to the now grown up Gaskin kids Jack Brad and their sister Julie who fit the bill in having lived in the places where most of the killings were committed.As things turned out the Gaskins were brutally abused by their father Mr. Gaskin when they were young and that may have lead to them or one of them to have grown up with a serious mental disorder that lead to murder. What puzzles Caleb is why murder those living in the places where the killer once lived if only to retrieve items that he hid there when he was just a child?SPOILERSHeart stopping final with the killer coming out of the shadows just when Caleb felt that he finally solved the case and captured the real killer. Bludgeoned almost to death with a hammer by the totally crazed psycho Caleb was saved from having his skull smashed in the favorite method of doing in his victims by the shadowy lunatic by non other then his wife Mary who after being held hostage by who at first was thought to be the serial killer had the presences of mind in all the confusion to blast him before he could finish off her by then after being hammered almost unconscious helpless husband.".

The biggest shock of the film comes at the very end in the credits when it is revealed that the female psychologistpolice consultant is played by Tyne Daly!

Another aspect of Born in East L.A. is that it can make people think about the struggles and poverty that happens just over our boarder this serious issue is presented in a comedy though so it's easier to take and people don't have to put their guard up for preachy morals while they're looking for a good laugh.

I read all the reviews and most people didn't like this film but i think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread! The best part of the movie is when he tells the prison guard Philsays Rudy you still owe me 100! Cheech says Yeah Heres one of them FK YOU! I wish IMDb allowed curse words! This gets a 710.

They think cheech is one of them and they send him to mexico. If he had only took his wallet with him he wouldn't have been sent down south. I read all the reviews and most people didn't like this film but i think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread! The best part of the movie is when he tells the prison guard Philsays Rudy you still owe me 100! Cheech says Yeah Heres one of them FK YOU! I wish IMDb allowed curse words! This gets a 710.

After some humorously done attempts at crossing the border fail he goes to work for Stern some sort of thumbinseveral pies businessman in Tijauna.

He puts Marin to work encouraging passers by to enter a bar or has him selling oranges on a street corner and in one of the films best gags teaching a bunch of dopey nonEnglish speaking foreigners how to carry themselves in LA. The wasssappening boys will be well remembered. There's also a hilarious encounter with two prison perverts thats interuppted by a perfectly Igorvoiced actor who unfortunately is not mentioned in the credits under his character name Phil.  But when the well runs dry at several points Marin resorts to an extensive amount of musical numbers to suck up time. He throws in a halfhearted romance with the cute Kalama that doesn't really go anywhere which may have given the film a little more to chew on. But its well worth the wait for the truly ingenius ending that I wouldn't dare spoil only to say it cleverly incorparates Neil Diamond's America. I would guess that Marin came up with the ending first and tried to come up with enough antics to reach that point. If you're patient it should pay off well for you. Marin also contributed the memorable title song as well.".

This was written directed and stars Cheech Marin and he did a great job making this film and as the leading man. In an attempt to pick up his cousinwho is in the country illegally he ends up getting deported to Mexico and this is his story about trying to make it back home. The DVD box describes this film as a comedy bordering on insanity which I find to be pretty accurate. Born In East LA is hilarious and while there is no shortage of outrageous material the film is cohesive and has a lot of solid performances. Cheech especially gives a great showing here and is very likable as our hero Rudy. The story is pretty straight forward but flows well and does not come off like a long comedy skit. In my opinion this film is very underrated and holds up well. 30 years later Born In East LA is still funny and relevant in modern times where Trump implements policies of mass deportation.".

The film does not try to offer a single solution or plan of action as a definitive best way forward and so avoids tempting oversimplification of a complex set of issues.  Rather than negative or unhelpful I found this approach incredibly refreshing in a medium rife with happy endings and simple fictional solutions.Born In Flames doesn't have an answer but it has many many questions and many many voices.   These voices and the regular delivery of discourse straight to camera and audience has regularly led to critical disapproval and claims that it is overly polemical.  I don't find Born in Flames overly polemical.  I don't agree with many of the opinions and strategies given voice and action in the film but I found the experience of being directly addressed by a female character on issues that are largely invisible in mainstream cinema energising and inspiring.  This film won't change the world but it made me start writing for my fanzine again and get on the phone to my bandmates to get a practice organised.  Enough films debate writing and noise and we'll get somewhere.".

If one thinks we have come a long way in overcoming gender discrimination then take a fresh look at this film. I particularly appreciate the feminist analysis that seems to be missing today from women's activism and politics. Every activist ought to view and take heed of this movies message.

It's about trying to make change when you have almost nothing and its own production values help keep the focus on what feels like a real struggle.Second this movie is BRILLIANTLY edited cutting across three or four different plot lines rapidly to encourage us to connect the dots to try to figure out how the various characters and perspectives can be seen as a whole. Example a montage consisting of female hands doing various tasks filing papers typing putting a condom on an erect penis !!!!! rinsing dishes. No commentary on this string of images but what a message this lack of commentary sends! If you've never thought of prostitution as labor you will after seeing this film.Third the bad acting works. Revolutions don't have perfect adequate actors who are up to the task of fulfilling their roles. They have regular people who are struggling to play their part.

	schema:headline " Edgy film about radical feminist politics.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a very radical political film. As a black lesbian feminist I could relate to the premise of this film. The plot unfolds in a semidocumentary style making this film all the more interesting. Set against the gritty backdrop NYC the film has a distinctly apocalyptic feel to it. This movie harks back to the militant leftwing revolutionary fervor of the 60s and early 70s. Despite the changes in society resulting from feminism gay rights and the civil rights movement in the last 40 years this movie shows that there's still much work to be done to achieve real equality for all. It's not surprising to me that the radical political movement in the film is led by a workingclass black lesbian. Women who happen to be lesbian bluecollar and of color are still the most oppressed people in our society.Jean Satterfield is superb as Adelaide Norris the dedicated member of the Women's Army. Jean conveys the militant stance of Adelaide in a very visceral way. The supporting cast of this film was also compelling. Especially Honey as Honey the feminist revolutionary radio DJ. The film was slowmoving at times but packed an emotional punch.Rights of the oppressed in society have been rolledback by rightwing conservatives for the past 28 years. So we could use a radical political strategy that addresses the rights of the oppressed again like we did in the 60s and 70s. History has been known to repeat itself. In this day and age a radical uprising by women in pursuit of equality is needed more than ever. This movie could very well be a sign of things to come in that regard. I recommend this film to all who take women's rights seriously and want to become more aware of women's oppression in society.".

Her death sparks a women's revolution that turns the city don't recall if they named it upside down. There's a squad of whistleblowing women on bicycles who hunt down rapists and scare them off their victims. There's a funky black woman DJ who narrates the action like a sports announcer as things heat up. This film is really really bizarre. And yet it's a whole lot of fun.

I get I suppose radical socialism and I get radical feminism. As a straight white...dude...I guess I have trouble understanding radical lesbianism. I couldn't figure out why given the fairly ludicrous premise for this movie a women's army such as this would be mostly lesbian. Is it because the people who conceived of this film were lesbians and this was kind of a political fantasy of theirs or was it a comment on radical feminism that only lesbians for reasons I don't understand but kind of want to  if this is indeed the case would be militant enough to get it together and get down to business? Or was it that the feminist struggle of the time resembled this in some way? I am quite obviously not the audience for this movie but I'd be lying if I said I didn't find it interesting. The politics here are inescapable and unavoidable  if you can't tolerate the Left's extended cinematic trips and this is one long one you're not going to make it through  there's not much else to glom on to. It is impossible to suspend disbelief or was for me especially considering this film is really a polemic thinly disguised as a fictional drama. And I don't mean that as criticism. It is what it is. This film is about ideas and it doesn't equivocate.The movie does have a genuine punky indie underground feeling to it that might appeal to some who otherwise wouldn't be interested in something this ideological. The soundtrack is interesting and kind of weird. Not quite punk but not quite anything else either which maybe makes it more punk I don't know. Oh  I disagree with other comments that this movie is somehow confused or unfocused. It's not. If anything it is as subtle as a sledgehammer. I mean I for one know exactly where the filmmakers stand. The plot seems to be fairly logical if strangely paced.This film is low budget and wears it on its shirtsleeve rough around the edges and frankly I think this movie would be a complete failure if made with a big budget  if for no other reason than a large budget would sabotage through overproduction and glossiness the undeniably radical position the film takes. Possibly the film's most compelling attribute it is that it is wholly uncompromised for comparison see The Spook Who Sat By The Door  which is not as low budget but is similar in its revolutionary fervor.In any case this movie is not for everyone. The summer blockbuster crowd isn't likely to enjoy this and I doubt those on the right side of the political spectrum are likely to make it through though I can imagine some of them maybe rubbernecking in a voyeuristic way  so this is how the other half lives eh?.Oh and it ends with the World Trade Center being bombed well the transmitter on top and Eric Bogosian shows up and has exactly one line and I guess that's worth seeing if you're a Bogosian fan I am.Anyway  recommended with strong reservations. If you like double meat and cheese on your ideological pizza you'll probably dig this or at least find it worth your time.".

So therefore I don't want to recommend it to anyone. I can understand that some people find this film interesting because they are interested in the questions that it deals with. Questions of equal rights for women and homosexuals are very important to talk about. They were hot issues back in 1983 and they are still important.

The whole plot of the movie is pointless why is there a socialist revolution? The whole idea of a revolution makes the women revoloution in this movie seems pointless and the government doesn't seem to be different overall than it is now. Overall the revolution is pointless to this movie's overall goal. When women are arguing with one another over starting up the women's army a few women point out that change comes slowly and that the government was already set up to change things. The Women's Army people just sort of wave this argument off without an answer. If the government was socialist every one would be paid regardless just laying that one out there... The movie is too random and unclear for any point to come out clearly. The militancy that shows up really has no real foundation if the society is Socialist. The movie argues against problems of the current government. The good things that come out of it are the problems that women faced in the before like the rape scene. It is a powerful scene and the only one in which the issue is clearly marked but it just leads to male bashing not directed towards the rapists but towards others. As a movie it is an interesting look at Feminist movement but is too dated to be taken seriously now. If anything what I got out of this movie is that feminists are just jackasses and there are women in the movie that I'd think would agree with me.".

Where do all of these issues  I put that word in quotes for almost ironic purposes as worker's rights equality for women equality for black women homosexuals and other women who have been made to become second class citizens as their quasioriginal sin based on their gender andor who they were born to in society  intersect and become amplified or have the chance to? You gotta be on television dummy! Borden's use of TV as this dangerous insidious medium where the great damage is reallyoften by these men and sometimes bourgeois white women in their glasses and suits seeming to have authority when dismissing attitudes and just ideas of the other is staggering. I think this even more than the title song is the glue and spine of how this all can stick together.I say stick since this is really experimental and punk rock cinema at its fiercest and dirtiest. Borden at first gives this the appearance of a documentary  Chris Hegedus and DA Pennebaker turn up in the credits though the latter I think was a special thanks it shouldn't be underestimated his influence here  but it is not quite that. Sure that is blood flowing through this stylistically but there are many scenes shot and meant to be scripted with actors as well. Then you throw in archival footage of demonstrations and other things  actual marches police beatings and rages against the system from what appears to be the past ten years  and it takes on a shape that is all its own. It's like if you had dropped Peter Watkins in the lower East side and he hadn't been born Peter but well a woman and one who understands her place is total shit in society.Is it messy as all get out? Could any bits be cut? Im sure if I saw it again id find a place or two. Would I dare tell her where? Not a chance. This has the energy of revolutionary cinema and I dont mean that more polished but didactic kind one may have seen from Godard in the 60s albeit that sense of ambition is there. This has a big cast of characters from the black section of the women's army to the white middle class seeming including Kathryn Bigelow?! journalists trying to meet the women halfway to the agents hounding the women on their trail these scenes carry the kind of authenticity that made me think of how the FBI also infiltrated and tried to put the kabosh on the Black Panthers which was also full of women and the women in the pirate radio stations giving fuel to the fire on the streets and so on. Sprinkled in are vignettes showing right at street level women being oppressed economically and with their bodies. Early on the first action taken by the womens group is to bicycle around to police attacks when no one else will. And then well the guns become a necessary evil for them.Is there some wish fulfillment and flights of fantasy? I'm sure there are. At the same time everything is of the same piece which is Borden saying there is already economic suffering for everyone but if you don't come to our help there cant be equality in a country  regardless of if this post liberation as this is meant to be set ten years after I thought of Hunger Games except Born in Flames would eat that dystopia for lunch  whether it is construction workers or sex workers or a waitress or whomever. And Borden goes goes the extra provocative step of... Violence is not something preferable but well what else is there to do if you men wont stay by our sides in the fight against the corporations?One might say that this isn't as relevant anymore the women's marches last and this year were full of men not only supportive but possibly empathetic to the struggle which is constant in an America that values wealth and whiteness and the MALEness and all that horseshit bag of chips just look at the president. With the exception of the last scene which hasn't aged well for what will be obvious reasons to anyone who's been alive since this film came out it actually is even more relevant than ever. When a piece of science fiction satire about the falsehoods and depravity and decay of society is made it's about when it is written  1984 is about the 1948 Orwell was in Huxley in 1932 with Brave New World many of Dick's works Hunger Games too to a lessor extent  and Born in Flames is Borden looking at Americans in the time of that New America of Reagan saying no things aren't right things are really worse despite the women's movement that did little and if you don't see the class issue above all else then you'll never come to see through our eyes.In other words any of the technical amateurism here acting too though theres more good and natural performing than not especially from the black actors is all not of concern when substantively this is one of the richest works of volcanichot PompeiitheEarth satire that has existed from an American filmmaker.".

	schema:reviewBody "Made over six years between 197783 this film reminded me strongly of the films labelled the No Wave. These were underground lofi movies made primarily in New York in the late 70's  early 80's. They often had political messages and were uncompromisingly uncommercial. I'm not sure but I would think that Lizzie Borden's feature Born in Flames must surely qualify as one as this is a wilfully challenging and direct bit of underground cinema which is a rallying cry to women generally. It has a scifi premise. In the near future America is celebrating the tenth anniversary of a socialist revolution but despite this many issues remain the same such as racism homophobia and sexism. A militant group called the Women's Army have been formed they take direct action to fight for women's rights. Their leader is arrested for a minor offense and mysteriously dies in custody in prison leading to further revolution.I'll come out and admit it straight away that I didn't fully enjoy this one. Not on ideological grounds but merely because I did not find the film fully engaging due to its fragmented experimental presentation. Having said that I do respect what it was doing and it does have an unmistakable energy to it which I found interesting. It's clearly lowbudget as underground films always are but it definitely has ambition for sure. It takes the form of a pseudodocumentary and mixes in some real news footage in with staged material. The actors are all amateur but this does ensure the feel remains more radical and less watered down. It focuses on feminist politics primarily and it does have to be said that many of the issues discussed still exist today so it does still have a relevance in terms of what it is saying. I also enjoyed the punk soundtrack which had a sort of proto riot grrrl feel to it. So while I cannot pretend to have fully engaged with this one I do respect it and admit it has a certain unique feel.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie on the cable video store and it caught my eye. I'm a car guy and have seen the Fast  Furious franchise movies amongst others. The movie starts off like FF movie in particular Tokyo Drift with the LA Street Race scene. The kid ruins his life and makes a turn around I'll leave it at that and you can get more from the synopsis.What makes this movie great is they do use a mixture of Domestic and Import cars. The opening credits have one race with a late model mustang and late model Monte Carlo which then has your imports. There are more scenes like that including a new 5.0 the last generation camaro and some oldies including a street race with a Belair and a Grand National. This Definitely something that does stand out from the other movies by not having just imports or having one single American muscle car.Also another plus is the final scenes of the movie take place at the race strip which in my opinion and through out this movie is trying to get the underlying message that knuckleheads need to start taking this race scene back to the track instead of the streets.Another point which no one has pointed out is the use of the 2011 Mustang in this movie. Older car buffs might see this. 20 yrs ago the the competition was the Late Model 5.0 and the Buick Grand National which are seen in this movie. The director does show that this rival lives on with the new 5.0 Mustang and now with the WRX Subaru. Just a little something to note nothing to write home about. Overall this movie is definitely worth renting or buying whether your a fan of the illegal race scene or fan of the FF franchise. The movie holds its own and is not a let down like the Asylum movies Street Racer and 200 MPH".

In summation the cars car jargon and car culture has a greater more accurate representation than most Hollywood racer films.The other large failing of many street racinggenre films is the catastrophically canned acting the leads and support dole out. While the script is nothing short of generic high school hero stuff the acting is of an unusually high caliber. Lead Joseph Cross of Running With Scissors fame delivers a solid if slightly weedy performance and the big bad bully played by Brando Eaton does well with what he's given to work with. My personal favorite character the father of the protagonist played by veteran John PyperFerguson puts forth an excellent effort managing to be lovable despicable and humorous all at once.Where other street racer movies are a complete mess of poor acting and Wikipedia knowledge Born to Race manages a solid cinema experience for a fraction of the cost of the big boys.

You can tell they went into great depths to keep the technical parts accurate and the details of sounds matching the cars were done well too.

I must admit I enjoyed this movie although it followed the usual template of obnoxious young bullies father who is mean in his son's eyes for not giving in to every little whim of his sonand teenage romance. The acting was not first rate but passable. I would have liked to see more hard core car racing beyond mountainside twists and turns and drag strip straightaways. For example the drifting in the parking garages in Tokyo Drift was amazing and not seen in this movie. Although the movie was not a great love story not a great car movie and not a great revenge movie against bullies it somehow worked in the end  and I thoroughly enjoyed it.".

I must admit I enjoyed this movie although it followed the usual template of obnoxious young bullies father who is mean in his son's eyes for not giving in to every little whim of his sonand teenage romance. The acting was not first rate but passable. I would have liked to see more hard core car racing beyond mountainside twists and turns and drag strip straightaways. For example the drifting in the parking garages in Tokyo Drift was amazing and not seen in this movie. Although the movie was not a great love story not a great car movie and not a great revenge movie against bullies it somehow worked in the end  and I thoroughly enjoyed it.";

I'll admit considering that it probably had a budget of a penny and a piece of string the production value is okay and the screenwriter clearly knows his car jargon. The story is where things fall apart for me. Its like the first 5 minutes of Tokyo Drift but even stupider stretched out to 90 minutes. Who would want to watch that? A lot of the characters are unlikable and don't act logically. Why would Danny risk ruining his image with a sponsored racing company and his professional future by intentionally bringing their car to an illegal street race knowing there's a risk of wrecking it? I guess the movie wouldn't have a plot if he didn't. Jake is an egotistical jerk with an asshole father. Why would Danny's father let him compete in the drag race if he was caught street racing and he said earlier that he wouldn't sign him up for the race if he was caught street racing?There are some technical flaws too. In one scene a 2011 car is shown about to crash but the car in the actual crash is a 200406 car of the same model and its pretty obvious too. I guess they couldn't afford a newer one or even a bodykit for the crash car. There's also a shot of Danny's Subaru at a stop sign with his turn signal on and you hear the clicking of the turn signal even though we're outside of the car. Why would they put that in?There are other Fast  Furious ripoffs out there like Redline which is also terrible but those movies are at least fun popcorn entertainment with characters you can route for. I'm giving Born To Race such a low rating because it plays up this dumb high school drama with characters I want to punch in the face played by actors who all look like they're 25 and tries to make it more serious than it is.".

One of the dumbest parts about Tokyo Drift was how many cars that kid burned through there was no respect for the vehicles they way they respected the cars the tuning and the performance in this movie. Now if you're not a gearhead a lot of the lingo will go over your head but if you're not really into cars or racing movies then I don't see why you would be reading reviews for a movie about cars and racing? Anyways the writing is actually several times better than most Hollywood flicks. They don't have easy answers for everything and most scenes fade out instead trying to drag on and force characters to resolve things. Mostly because in real life we don't always resolve things in one sitting.I also liked that the movie stayed true to the character direction even with its clichs...It was easy to both hate and root for the protagonist in this film because you could understand why he did the things he did but at the same time he was a young idiot so the director and writer did a job of balancing it out.Also I just have to say that 2011 Black Mustang was a freaking beast and the Subaru was a true standout star. I'm glad they also kept the races realistic with real cars and not all that crappy CG stuff.This was a good lowbudget film for car enthusiasts and racing fans.".

It had just enough action romance and all that. I watched all the Fast and the Furious movies and this one is becoming a favorite! I love that they partnered with subaru. This movie didn't contain any inappropriate seens which is very nice and does not contain swearing. Literally the best movie I ever watched! Hope they make a sequel! 1010!!!".

Sure there were fast cars and racing. However Born to Race was done on a lower budget but was as equally enjoyable and stands on its own merits.Just taking the time here to recommend this film.

	schema:reviewBody "This film really drives home how good low budget films can be. Watching this movie and then looking at the garbage that the ScyFy channel makes it's really a nobrainer. For starters the story while not very original works very well and even the borderline clich characters are pretty likable and even realistic. You find yourself understand how the characters feel rather than them having a larger than life element. The dialogues does fall on its face a few times but no film is perfect. There's plenty of action which is clearly where most of this film's budget went. Plenty of car crashes maybe an explosion or two. The real thing that drives this movie home is the cars  rather you're an import or tuner guy or even if you like old school muscle there's plenty of eye candy in this film. The racing itself is also pretty realistic unlike The Fast and the Furious TFATF films which often feature shifting through 17 gears in a 5 speed car during a drag race. There's real car talk that real car guys will get. Go into this movie open minded and you'll enjoy it. It tries to steal some of TFATF franchise's lightning in a bottle but it does well standing on its own. I didn't have very high expectations but even if I did this film wouldn't have disappointed me. A great film for guys who like cars. I wouldn't mind watching it again.".

	schema:reviewBody "I only found out about this film after a fellow reviewer reviewed it. Did this even get a cinematic release? anyway I liked the poster and it seemed to centre around import racers so that's me in. Yep as you may have guessed after what I just typed I'm a Jap car fan so be weary that I will most definitely be biased in my review of the automobiles on display here broad grin.OK so the plot...well lets just skip this shall we I think we all know very well this type of film is not gonna have a deep plot. No one goes to see a film about boy racers expecting a solid story line they go to see sweet super saloons melting tarmac. But if you really must know a young tearaway teen who just happens to own a super turbo charged Subaru Impreza WRX STi goes to live with his divorced dad because his mum can't handle his dangerous driving antics. He must content with a new school new bullies new temptations and his poor relationship with his father. So naturally he ends up getting into more trouble racing and causing much friction but at the end of the day he overcomes all adversities with an all round happy ending. Yep its the standard 'Karate Kid' plot with cars.OK I won't linger on the story much but the one thing that always makes me laugh with these car racer flicks is the fact the characters have easy access to these super cars. In the Fast n Furious franchise there is literately a never ending stream of them here the main character is 17 years old and still goes to school!. How the hell can he afford to run a Subaru with no job??. The fact he's a whiz kid with mechanics helps of course because he can mod his own car but he still needs money to pay for equipment and parts. The other thing that kinda surprised me was the fact his high school has a high performance car modification class? and a fully equipped garage to host it? is this an American thing?. Oh and this class encourages pupils to take part in a highly dangerous drag racing competition?...wut?! do they need permission slips from their parents for this death ride?.This leads me to the fact that the main character a really sulky po faced ugly little creep is trying to get his life on track and stay away from dangerous driving. His father mother and teachers are trying to help him yet one teacher wants him to race in this competition. Doesn't that present a conflict of interests? surely getting the kid involved in a drag race competition will surely get him more involved in street racing or taking risks the temptation will be high no?.Moving on...the cars the competition the street racing...it does the job well. Yes believe it or not this film is solid in terms of actual racing just like the first and third Fast n Furious films. The visuals aren't quite as slick as said franchise you can tell the cars aren't going at genuine speeds in some sequences and the actors aren't really driving. But the cars on show are lovely and they do get shown off well.The finale competition is also quite well done again expect the typical 'Karate Kid' scenario I'm afraid no surprises here you know who's gonna win. That aside the cars get good cam time and you get a really nice range of models. The film is basically import vs American muscle which I find amusing really. The race commentator refers to the Subaru as 'the little Subaru' just like they referred to the VW Beetle in the Herbie franchise because its the underdog of the competition. Dear oh dear they have no clue.Half of the American cars on show are old battleaxes in my opinion they look like they just rolled off the set of Happy Days. Most of these cars look like bricks and probably handle like it too all show and no go noise before power in my humble opinion any properly modded 370Z Skyline or Evo would kill all of them quite easily...let alone the Subaru. There's even one race where the young protagonist must race a flippin' pickup truck! looks like some hick hay bale carrier laughable.So basically if you like fast cars slutty bitchy cheerleader types a good stereotypical asshole bully and a good stereotypical brooding hero...or if you just wanna see fast cars then you will like this. I think its holds its own against the Fast n Furious brand because its more grounded and a little more believable kinda. 'FnF' has lost its way recently and become a comicbook superhero flick in my eyes its no longer about the cars. Yes this story is unbelievably predictable unbelievably clichd and generally poor but it does what it sets out to do which is provide good racing action with a nice explosive final crash stunt at the end. No big stars and not many big flashy show off stunts or effects its basic racing and it works pretty well. 6.510".

I went in expecting a dumb car movie that's a knockoff of any number of other dumb car movies and was treated to a wellexecuted thoroughly enjoyable fun dumb car movie.I say dumb because the teen drama part of the film is really predictable. It's a paintbynumbers movie that hits all the required tropes and stereotypical characters but it's very well done.You know the tropes when you see them the actors know them the movie is conscious of them but it plays it well and moves on.Dumb things the movie does including dumb character actions are forgivable because it's a fun movie.On to the cars...I'll preface this by saying I'm more of a fan of older generation car movies Vanishing Point Dirty Mary  Crazy Larry etc. and tend to be an American car guy who finds imports dull. Chipping a car doesn't have the same appeal to me as wrenching on one so I'm a viewer with a bias. BUT...That said I was very pleasantly surprised. There were plenty of new and old cars to look at some less common some more common some domestic some import. One of the people I watched the movie with was a huge import buff and enjoyed it for the imports that were highlighted. I enjoyed it for some of the lesscommon domestics in the film.The good racing scenes are done well and the speed of the races is done well also. There's not a huge amount of time distortion done to most of them during drag racing sequences just good editing to add to the feel of the movie. The road racing sequences are done pretty well edited well and are engaging and even if one or two may fall in the dumb category it's still a fun movie so you can forgive it.The car techspeak I'm familiar with nonimport stuff struck me as showing the movie hired at technical adviser at least and also elevated itself a bit. So it wasn't completely dumb.Overall it's a wellexecuted thoroughly enjoyable fun mostlydumb car movie that left me smiling.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here we go again another Seagal DVD made in Romania where low taxes mean it's cheap to film there. Steamroller ProductionsVoltage Pictures have been cranking out these lowbudget timekillers quickly and because I've been watching Seagal's movies since I was a kid I can't resist renting them when they pop up at the video store.Born To Raise Hell is not an improvement over Seagal's recent DVD releases but it does have its good points. It has a more structured plot and better music than some of his previous work. The fight scenes were a little short but adleast Seagal was more involved in them than his body double. The obligatory climactic fight was also over pretty quickly and the main bad guy didn't meet a very satisfying death. The shootouts were okay. I liked the gunsmoke in the air during the climactic shootout but there was absolutely no recoil or kick when Seagal fired his shotgun. For such a powerful weapon this looked a little odd.These formulaic films always leave room in the budget for a small explosion or a car crash or both. In Born To Raise Hell a balcony blows up sending two guys to their death and as far as stunts go it looks okay.If you didn't like the look of Seagal's previous DVD efforts then this movie will not win you over. If however like me you've become used to the look and style of these films then you know what to expect. So just go along for the ride and take it for what it is. A lowbudget formulaic Seagal action film. The StorylineSeagal is a drug enforcement agent in Romania. He's going after a fairly sadistic midlevel drug trafficker named Castel who enjoys bashing raping robbing and killing rich people. Using information from a lowlevel dealer and also a highlevel trafficker Seagal closes in on Castel. As expected in these type of films Seagal's partner is killed making his mission more personal.I'd also like to mention Seagal's body double again. I've noticed in a lot of these DVD's that Seagal will be talking to somebody then a rear head camera shot will reveal the body double before the camera cuts back to Seagal's face. You don't need sharp eyes to spot this because the double's hairstyle never quite matches Seagal's hair. I'm pleased to say that in this movie the double is less obvious because Seagal wears his jacket collar pushed up. This hides the neck and hairline making the double less of a standout. This was a good move on the production teams part to help hide this annoying problem. There is also a little bit of voice dubbing in the film mainly at the start but adleast the voice sounds similar to Seagal unlike some other films of his.P.SI hadn't watched Seagal's first movie 'Above The Law' in quite a while so I decided to put it on the other night. I noticed that his hair looks like it's balding from the front his hair also looks very thin. His hair these days is very thick and full as if he's wearing a hair piece or uses spray on hair maybe he had some kind of surgery? His hair is just so thick and fake and he doesn't have the high forehead thinning hairline that he had back in 1988.Also in 'Above The Law' Seagal sure could run and he looked thin healthy and fit. Nowadays he can only manage a short lumbering jog and his face and stomach are bloated. Sometimes his face is so puffed up that it looks like he's had an allergic reaction to some bad shellfish.Well enough about that. Lots of people put on weight as they get older. I like Seagal and I'll continue to watch his DVD's and other projects he brings out. He is less than a year away from turning 60 years of age and I wish him all the best for his future endeavours.".

Their prime interests are a Gypsy gang leader named Costel Shahlavi and a Russian gang leader called Dimitri Dan Badarau who shares a striking resemblance with Marlon Brando. When things get messy Axel is forced to resort to unconventional measures in order to get the job done.Like I said Seagal is credited for writing the script but it's basically just parts of a dozen other movies pieced together. The story is irrelevant and about as forgettable as they come. The action scenes are entertaining none the less. A much better fight scene could have been choreographed between Seagal and Shahlavi though. What we get is routine and could have been filmed with anyone opposite Seagal. What a waste of talent! Still the movie was made for just 10 million and say what you will about Seagal's career but his movies continue to be profitable successes. This is just one of many that will soon blur in with all the others but during the 90 minutes I spent watching it it was mildly entertaining.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpyoutu.beIe33IbZzmi0".

I'm pleased to say that there were some clear exchanges in this movie.For anybody who cares In my mind this movie is a guy film. Seagal wrote in a sweet young thing for himself And who can fault him? Ahhh the perks of being both actor and writer but her role was not that significant. The most time they spent on the screen together was maybe 5 minutes if that. They talked a little about their relationship how work was coming between them or something like that. I dunno. I might have nodded off. Then after that supposedly they made love.

I am no expert on the film career of Mr.Seagal but in everyone of his films that I have seen he appears to play the same person. In this film Steve is transported to Eastern Europe to take on a Russian Drug Dealer called Dimitri and another gang led by a very unpleasant fellow called Costel. Dimitri is supplying drugs to Costel but it soon develops that these two fall out with very unpleasant consequences to follow. The job for our hero becomes personal when Steve's partner is killed and the usual gun fights and fist fights ensue. In between all the action there was a tender moment between Steve and his girlfriend however as Mr.Seagal is not in the first flush of youth he might well be advised in the future to avoid love scenes with topless young womenas it looks a little unattractive. Born to Raise Hell is basically the usual Steven Seagal movie under another name but nevertheless I enjoyed it.".

Seagal feels like nothing more than a bit player and a bored one too. Spending more time sitting about pondering having a heartfelt chats or if he has to  walking from 'a to b' to shoot someone or casually crack some bones. So when it comes to the explosive bursts they do lack any sort of punch or adrenaline despite the seedy scene. Here he plays a streetwise American Interpol agent assigned to a drug  weapon trafficking task force in Eastern Europe. This is one rather generic action drama which thinks it's tough but comes across as violently spiteful and sluggishly paced with a bogged down script. The director keeps it rather kinetic with the filming techniques being slickly dressed up with sped up visuals slow motion and titled camera angles. The performances are nothing to write home about but the cast do acquit themselves well enough. Not terrible but a very hohum Seagal vehicle.I like your style.".

	schema:reviewBody "I go into this review admittedly having not watched a lot of Seagal's DTV stuff which there are hundreds of but I have watched a few as well as all his theatrical releases so I think I'm pretty clued up on what to expect by now.And for the most part Born to Raise Hell fulfills the expectations you have of a Seagal movie  Seagal plays his usual role as a cop or some other sort of governmentmilitary official some bad guys pop up Seagal chases them down and deals with them. Usually this combination of factors leads to a good watch where you can just sit and enjoy without thinking too much but there are a few things that pull this film down from the usual Seagal standards.Firstly the cinematography and camera work is pretty terrible  unnecessary shaky camera and slow motion effects freeze frames on really ridiculous moments such as one on the main villain's face in the middle of raping a woman the lot. It reminded me of that you wouldn't steal a car antipiracy advert except imagine that for whole actiondramatic sequences.Another issue is that there is pretty extensive dubbing over of Seagal's voice  it's there from the very start and happens every so often throughout always reminding you that it's there that ol' Steven just can't deliver his hardhitting lines anymore if he ever could. One fairly hilarious example is near the end when Seagal says a line I'll be out in 10 15 minutes with the word minutes dubbed over. Did they really need to dub over the word minutes to give it that extra authority it needed? There usually is always a little bit of dubbing in Seagal DTV flicks and it's fine but there's just way too much here.The other main criticism is the other characters  one of whom a Russian drug lord living in Romania is originally pursued by Seagal and his team but then Seagal sees fit to make a deal with this drug lord who has killed or ordered the killing of multiple people throughout the film in order to pursue the main drug lord villain. There is a scene at the end where Seagal is talking to this morally reprehensible guy like they're friends. According to the film's logic it's OK because the other drug lord does home invasions where he murders people and rapes the women while the other one isn't as bad.There is also one of the most cringeworthy scenes I've seen in a Seagal movie yet where the overweight ageing Seagal makes love with his young Romanian girlfriend. The shoddy camerawork with Seagal wearing clothes while his girlfriend is basically naked and quick cuts to make it look like they're having sex but not really just makes this scene unintentionally hilarious.Overall Born to Raise Hell is a less than passable Seagal DTV flick. Don't get me wrong it's still enjoyable to watch and Seagal's usual action sequences with martial arts are as good as what you'd expect from the guy's DTV movies. But poor directing dubbing and some choice plot scenarios let this one down.".

I would use BORN TO RAISE HELL here as an example being sure to compliment the film's strengths but also making clear to him exactly what about it sucks. I'm not so nave to believe that Seagal is in total creative and technical control of each of his features but perhaps I could convince him to take a more handson role in their production and perhaps aikidochop the idiots who are truly responsible for the lackluster nature of some of these movies.The plot An international drug task force operating out of Romania headed by exInterpol agent Samuel Axel Seagal sets its sights on bringing down the operations of a deadly and sadistic gang of drug traffickers...People who don't like Steven Seagal by default are going to hate this movie. Seagal occupies most of the scenes perhaps still making up for his absence throughout most of AGAINST THE DARK? and his character is boisterous arrogant and most of the other characters cow to him in one way or another. Surprisingly I found myself appreciating this a supercilious Steven is still more fun to watch than the detached boredlooking dope he played for a while in movies like FLIGHT OF FURY. However whatever effort he seems to have made for this film is marred by extensive dubbing of his voice  something not present in his movies to this degree since the picture I just mentioned. There aren't any other real technical snafus to be seen but further postproduction addins like nonstop slow motion freezeframe shots galore and way too many timekilling collage scenes continue to have the movie feeling more like Seagal's trash pictures of yesteryear moving him further and further away from the high standard he had achieved with URBAN JUSTICE.The action scenes are composed mostly of boring shootouts but there are a couple handtohand encounters which while not too flashy feature Seagal doing just about all of his own moves and getting some good aikido throws in. There's also an impressive instance wherein he kicks a thug so hard that the man flies about six feet through the air before crashing through a bench. These lead up to the finale with martial artist Darren Shahlavi who had been running around the rest of the picture as the necrophilic drugdealing main villain. This is where things get really disappointing to the point of costing my rating an entire star. Shahlavi had consistently delivered great physical performances in the past and one of his most recent movies at the time  IP MAN 2 released on the same day as BORN TO RAISE HELL  featured him in some very good fights with Donnie Yen and Sammo Hung in this one however he has one very brief fight halfway through the film before getting absolutely manhandled by Seagal during the climax. The fact that Shahlavi had just been in an internationallyacclaimed martial arts masterpiece makes this ugly and onesided encounter more disappointing than Seagal's similar exchanges with Gary Daniels and Byron Mann at least they didn't have any recent major successes behind them to live up to.At this point in our conversation if I had been able to speak freely and if the rumors concerning Seagal's temper and ego were true I figure he'd either have left the room in disinterest or he would have me by my throat. I'd quickly try to point out that the acting is decent in general and despite being shot in Romania the film's cinematography is less grey than I expected and pretty fun to look at...but would this be enough to save me? It certainly isn't enough to save the movie which I fear can be shelved along with the growing number of failed DTV outings starring the Buddhist Bonecrusher. I doubt that I'll ever actually have this conversation with Steven but I'm still holding out on the hope that he's going to get back on the horse and make it worth being a fan of his again when this one came out it really wasn't.".

The entire movie is cut in a very choppy manner which I personally am not too thrilled about. The plot is forgettable to say the least and the entire movie is just a copypaste job of standard scenes and actions sequences from start to finish.The action scenes are not too bad and what makes the movie not be a total waste. Do not try to find any logic in people's actions though. There is none. When Seagal felt he wanted some tough talk then he plopped it in and so on. I guess he likes scantily clad ladies as well since the movie is liberally sprinkled with them. Too bad only the bad guys seems to have the hard hitting chicks working for them though.Someone said that this was a guy movie and I would say that is a correct statement. It is filled with elements that would appeal to the stereotype of some beer belching male person doing most of his thinking using the reptile parts of his brain. I do not mind action though talk and scantily clad ladies in the movies but I do prefer when there is a script worth talking about to string everything together instead if just throwing them into a blender and serve the slop that comes out.Not a total waste of an evening but close.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just watched BORN TO RAISE HELL and i've got mixed feelings about it. I won't bore you with the plot partly because they wasn't much of one anyhowBut first off let me say the cinematography was good. The locations and camera work were crisp sharp and better than most DTV releases. It could have done with less of the as VERN calls them Avid Fart technique of jumpcuts speeded up slowed down shotsSeagal was OK extremely foulmouthed i might add but and as usual with these Eastern European releases he only had about 70 screen time as the rest was filled up with either seminaked female dancers Avid Fart stuff or other character plotsThe dubbing as previously mentioned is rife throughout not as bad as ATTACK FORCE but almost near enough The doubles are also there in the movies 4 or so fight scenes not particularly noticeable but for nearly every shot of Seagal fighting there's another 'Below the neckline' or 'From behind' to match it. And it's all the more infuriating because Seagal does some fast handywork punch kick and flip combos himself in this movie...so the doubles weren't really needed. The fight scenes also consist of a lot of fast closeup edits also.The plot is like i previously stated waferthin....which consists of Seagal leading a strike force police unit in Romania...getting the drop on some drug dealers who rat out an even bigger criminal not to mention psychopath to get a lighter sentence. This Psychopath likes to commit 'home invasions' on rich couples and rapes the wives before killing them both.Then Seagal teams up with another mobster and they both go after the psychopath.......The end.Despite the fact that this is a bythenumbers Seagal effort nowhere near as good as A DANGEROUS MAN URBAN JUSTICE or DRIVEN TO KILL it does have a few interesting points. The plot however slim has parallels to early 70's Italian 'Polizia' movies in that it shows the Law teaming up with the lesser evils to bring down the greater onesAnd Seagal adds real police procedures to the 'raid' and 'arrest' sequences probably picked up from his stint as a real life deputy A mixed bag for sure but not without interest....but a step back from A DANGEROUS MAN. The one good thing about a less than memorable Seagal movie is that when i watch it again in about 6 months time i'll barely remember a thing about it thus it's like watching a new movie and chances are i'll either see something i didn't notice before or it'll just plain grow on me. Either way it's far from the turkey it could have been but could have been better. I suppose it's A DANGEROUS MAN's fault for being so good".

This is why I hate eating out he groans as he walks out of the place.And he is so right.

Don't do it kids stay in school! Don't do Steven Seagal. Well not unless you're 18 or until you're 16. Or before you're totally awesome.

Because not only is Steven Frederic Seagal an outstanding thespian in his own right and time and place in time and space he's an excellent auteur as well. So there is absolutely no in him quoting a fellow playwright. Hah!

Something else which makes that a positive is the simple fact that the movie isn't really about him. It's more about a drug war between cops and Eastern European mafia. Seagal is just one cop out of a handful. As a screenwriter Seagal chooses to write him self out rather than in and subsequently we spend more time with the mafia.The fight scenes come with a crunchy sound mix and they allow us to see more Seagal than Stunt man but they reek of bad editing. the people who direct movies like Born to Raise Hell are not qualified for anything except music videos. this movie implements a very miscalculated Goddardian style of cutting and a severe overuse of slow motion. We don't need to see a guy ripping a bedroom apart for jewels at five frames per second. The last scene is kind of touching at least for a Seagal movie. It was around that part when I realized that the movie is not really about Seagal. That and the fact that we only here his name about five times. I don't wanna mislead anyone however. Born to Raise Hell will probably do the job for whatever fan base the old man has left. He's done better but he's also done way worse.".

	schema:reviewBody "Born to Raise Hell is set in Romania where tough American narcotics cop Robert 'Bobby' Samuels Steven Seagal works for the International Drug Task Force in an effort to stop the flow of illegal drugs  the revenues created by it funding terrorism. After a routine drugs bust Samuels is given the name of local drug lord Dimitri Dan Badarau who supplies several large scale dealers with their drugs one of whom is the crazed  sadistic Costel Darren Shahlavi. As Samules  the task force close in on them Dimitri  Costel start to turn on each other in order to save themselves  things get personal eventually Dimitri  Samules form an uneasy partnership to take Costel  his gang down for good...Directed by Lauro Chartrand this Easten European set crime thriller not only starred Seagal but he also produced  wrote the thing as well I have to say I found Born to Raise Hell a throughly dull way to spend 90 minutes. All the usual low budget Seagal ingredients of recent times are present  correct a cool sounding but meaningless title a tough cop character a few European bad guy's  lots of slow motion during the fight scenes. The plot as it is is rather dull with Seagal basically just tracking a couple of drug dealers who end up fighting between themselves  Seagal sort of steps in to pick up the pieces  sort everything out. There isn't much of a cohesive story Seagal just sort of wanders around  crosses paths with the two dealers every so often the film has no real purpose  secondary character's are poor of the clichd bad guy with a gun type. Also isn't Seagal's character supposed to be the good guy cop? What's with this pact with Dimitri the drug dealer at the end? So Dimitri has morals as far as drug dealers go while Costel is much worse has he raps his victims  shoots kids as well in fact Seagal  Dimitri even spark up a bit of a friendship that goes against everything his character should stand for. The dialogue is poor the pacing is poor with various lame shootouts to pad the time out  it's throughly predictable  unoriginal.As usual for most Seagal films these days Born to Raise Hell went straight to video but even that is too good for it the film looks pretty drab as well with dark lighting  dull locations although I will say there are some really hot women in this so I suppose I can give it another star for that. The fights all annoying slow motion image blur freeze framing  other such trickery which just got on my nerves  looks cheap. There's no great thinking behind it  the makers just seem to have thought 'we haven't had any slow motion shots in a while so lets just put one here' without much regard to the scene in question.The IMDb says Born to Raise Hell had a budget of about 10000000 which is total crap there's no way this cost that much. Filmed in Bucharest in Romania. The acting is poor Seagal mumbles his way through the film as usual while everyone else is just bad.Born to Raise Hell is yet another crappy low budget European Seagal film with nothing to recommend it a lack of decent action or a decent story really kill it. Sure there are a few good looking European girls but nothing else one to avoid.".

The plot as it is is rather dull with Seagal basically just tracking a couple of drug dealers who end up fighting between themselves  Seagal sort of steps in to pick up the pieces  sort everything out. There isn't much of a cohesive story Seagal just sort of wanders around  crosses paths with the two dealers every so often the film has no real purpose  secondary character's are poor of the clichd bad guy with a gun type. Also isn't Seagal's character supposed to be the good guy cop? What's with this pact with Dimitri the drug dealer at the end? So Dimitri has morals as far as drug dealers go while Costel is much worse has he raps his victims  shoots kids as well in fact Seagal  Dimitri even spark up a bit of a friendship that goes against everything his character should stand for. The dialogue is poor the pacing is poor with various lame shootouts to pad the time out  it's throughly predictable  unoriginal.As usual for most Seagal films these days Born to Raise Hell went straight to video but even that is too good for it the film looks pretty drab as well with dark lighting  dull locations although I will say there are some really hot women in this so I suppose I can give it another star for that. The fights all annoying slow motion image blur freeze framing  other such trickery which just got on my nerves  looks cheap. There's no great thinking behind it  the makers just seem to have thought 'we haven't had any slow motion shots in a while so lets just put one here' without much regard to the scene in question.The IMDb says Born to Raise Hell had a budget of about 10000000 which is total crap there's no way this cost that much. Filmed in Bucharest in Romania. The acting is poor Seagal mumbles his way through the film as usual while everyone else is just bad.Born to Raise Hell is yet another crappy low budget European Seagal film with nothing to recommend it a lack of decent action or a decent story really kill it. Sure there are a few good looking European girls but nothing else one to avoid.";

The sound effects when Seagal lands his arsenal of blows and martial arts techniques to subdue his opponents make him sound superhuman. As usual Seagal hurls men into furniture and glass with bodies breaking and shattering whatever objects they are thrown into so that he looks like a million dollars. The same editing wizardry is applied so that Seagal appears to be unstoppable such as when he takes apart a group of Dimitri's men outside a van during a stakeout or the final handtohand combat with Costel more like handtoface as Costel is essentially a punching bag. Sadly you can tell that some of Seagal's dubbing is through someone who attempts to impersonate the way he talksthe man can't even bother doing his own dubbing.

Seagal plays another tightlipped onedimensional narcotics policeman who goes through partners like sand does a sieve. You know that the partner is slated to die the moment that he reveals that his wife is pregnant. The action suffers from a predictable plot that tries to appear more sophisticated than it is. Director Lauro Chartrand directs this adequate exercise in suspense and tension as it if were a rock music video desinged for an attention deficient audience. He loves to freeze the action insert a special effects graphic and accelerate the pace in a frenzy not unlike a montage to promote spontaneity. In other words Born to Raise Hell looks as busy as hell. But again little is going on. The chief villain is a sadistic fiend but he does nothing that you have not already before seen. The most interesting character is a Russian mobster who lives by a sense of values. The Steven Seagal screenplay does not deviate from the conventions of the genre. Each character is established with some concern for credibility. A topnotch International Drug Task Force investigator targets criminals who traffic in drugs because terrorists obtain their financing through illicit drug sales. Seagal plays everything very lowkey dresses in black and has a couple of awkward scenes with his high maintenance girl who is angry that he puts his job before her. A Russian gun runner enters the fray and deals with a rabid Gypsy who cannot restrain his villainy. He kills without a qualm. Indeed most of the characters here were born to raise hell but the hell that they raise isn't so exciting that it sets new standards for this kind of gritty shoot'em up. Chiefly what is lacking is a sense of charisma. None of the characters are chummy and nobody has been kidnapped.".

It's sad really because the guy used to be kind of a poster child for how cool Aikido is. But now he goes around calling men bitches. I don't think O Sensei would be proud of that.

What happened to a shootout in an art gallery or a dentist office or a clothing store?Personally I would love to see Steven Seagal hook up with an overweight woman i her mid 40's and he should have a shootout in a shoe store. or a bakeryThese gangsters and mafia members deserve to get shot and killed and arrested for being as stupid as they are.If they didn't all dress the same and walk around like clones of each other in other movies  they would live longer.I wasn't expecting some massive major story development in a Steven Segal movie  but this is so rehashed from so many other movies  it puts a damper on the entire genre of action.An action movie could be real fun and entertaining and funny and everything else at the same time  these have become so drab because casting and locations is almost entirely the same for hundreds of films like this.The blame relies more on them than on his limited acting and story telling.The director and producer is at fault  more than the headlining star.I'm sick of seeing strippers and strip bars for no other reason than to throw in some hot chicks and do a 5 minute strip show because the story lacks originality.I'm sick of seeing bad guys dress in black leather jackets with slicked back hair and sunglasses  when they can dress in jeans tshirt and runners and be even more threatening.".

I watched the original French version without English subtitles and although I struggled a bit with the language it was easy to follow even though my French is not fluent. What really surprised me is that the ratings for Borsalino so far have not been higher  as far as French gangster movies go I would consider it within my top 5. It is pacey with lots of action and unlike some French moviesI was never bored once watching it. The combination of Jean Paul Belmondo and Alain Delon as Capella and Siffredi worked very well and Michel Bouquet's performance as Rinaldi was also very good. My only criticism of Borasalino was that there were too many female characters linked with Capella and Siffredi and we never really learnt more about them as the story progressed. Otherwise a movie I would recommend.".

Well this is the genuine article more Marseille than the real city perhaps 70 years or so ago so just enjoy the great dialogue and scenarios IF YOU EVER MANAGE TO GET YOUR HANDS ON THIS TAPE OR BETTER DVD NOT DUBBED but with subtitles s'il vous plat. The soundtrack by Claude Bolling sporadically available on CD is the perfect accompaniment and the combination of the French cinema's two most popular young actors made this an all time favorite in France. In the final analysis style certainly triumphs over substance and you'll never forget you are seeing Delon and Belmondo.

The secondary characters are interesting somewhat but clearly overshadowed by the two leads. As for the script it manages many enjoyable moments wandering between funny and tragic bits however it is too hammy to totally convince and is not helped by a very dated type of editing.

The movie looks pretty good with nice period clothes cars and decor and the guys look the part in their 30's gangster suits especially the darkhaired guy. And Lola the girlfriend is pretty hot. And there's some decent tommygun violence. But the characters seem cardboard and undeveloped and the dialog is not very interesting maybe something was lost in the dubbing. I sensed they were trying to imitate an oldstyle Hollywood gangster movie a la Cagney was 30's France really this much like Capone's Chicago? So although I am a big fan of old gangster movies I wouldn't rate this one too highly.".

	onyx:emotionText "For some reason my little local library in Minnesota has this movie. Its about a pair of smalltime criminals in 1930s Marsielles France who rise to be gangster bosses. The movie looks pretty good with nice period clothes cars and decor and the guys look the part in their 30's gangster suits especially the darkhaired guy. And Lola the girlfriend is pretty hot. And there's some decent tommygun violence. But the characters seem cardboard and undeveloped and the dialog is not very interesting maybe something was lost in the dubbing. I sensed they were trying to imitate an oldstyle Hollywood gangster movie a la Cagney was 30's France really this much like Capone's Chicago? So although I am a big fan of old gangster movies I wouldn't rate this one too highly.";

Propaganda films are morale films and the omissions and distortions which have been cited in Mission to Moscow are beside the point.  Of course Stalin was a monster before during and after World War II.  Of course Joseph E. Davies was a naif and a pompous one at that.  Perhaps that's why he only lasted a year as ambassador.On one hand there is an absolutely ludicrous review here praising Mission to Moscow as dispelling the terrible calumnies against the great Soviet achievements.  On the other hand there are those on the opposite side who though far more accurate about Stalin and about how this film whitewashes his atrocities seem so rabid in their responses they fail to understand or conveniently ignore that propaganda films as documentaries are more or less bull and that it's stupid to criticize a propaganda film because it's a propaganda film.What is interesting about Mission to Moscow is not what it is trying to say or do which requires little insight to divine but how well it does it. This is a Hollywood A film enlisted in the service of propaganda.  Top cast direction and production values should have made for a very strong message to 1943 American audiences whom the government wanted to think of the war against Germany as We're all in this together.As to the outrage of Stalin's show trials I think that the sinister menacing demeanor of one of the great Hollywood heavies Victor Francen as prosecutor Vyshinsky versus the rather meek contemplative demeanor of the defendants suggests that the film knows what's going on even if Davies doesn't.Yes the relentless proSoviet propaganda is a bit hard to take for those who sit smugly in the light of hindsight.  But if you look at Mission to Moscow as document rather than documentary you will gain an insight into the kind of public mindset called for by our government at a crucial moment in our history.".

It's no surprise that Howard Koch was the screenwriter for this rather sorry effort to promote Soviet propaganda or that he was later cited by the HUAC.  Propaganda can be fun  try North Star or Days of Glory.  This movie is not an effort to raise morale or promote a cohesive war effort.  It's purpose appears to try to justify any and all the barbaric atrocities committed during the Stalin regime. Example  The show trials were interspersed with remarks by allied journalists approving of the same judicial perversion for which we condemned Germany at Nueremburg.  We agreed with the Soviet position that Trotsky was responsible for undermining the good works of the Soviet. We blame ourselves for the RussoGerman alliance.  The fact that Russia absorbed half of Poland in payment isn't discussed.  This movie actually claims it was strategic move to buy time.  Davies Walter Huston spends the entire movie trying to convince us that the Soviet Union performed a miracle 5 yrs at a time.  Big business is portrayed as greedy capitalists anxious to do business with Germany and Japan in pursuit of the Almighty buck.  Russia invaded Finland as an act of self defense etc etc. The examples are too numerous to mention.Michael Curtiz' direction as usual is exciting and flawless.  It is this movies' only saving grace.  The early scene when Davies arrives at the Hamburg train station was precious.  There are Swastikas everywhere. In typical Curtiz style shadow troops marched passed the camera.  Mein Kampf was for sale everywhere.  Pathetic deportees are on the platform  number tags on their chest  waiting for transport to the camps.  Hitler Youth marching like toy soldiers.  If you can put the politics aside I couldn't you can really enjoy the visuals.

	schema:reviewBody "An odd little movie. Mission to Moscow was brought to my attention by a BBC documentary on Stalin in the war years WWI Behind Closed Doors. It describes the intense diplomatic efforts made by the allies during WWII to bring the Soviet Union into the war against Germany. Leaders in the West were willing to cast a blind eye to Soviet brutality and repression including the massacre of Polish military officers at Katyn and the establishment of puppet governments in the territories they controlled in order to keep them on the side of the West. This effort involved swaying public opinion in Western countries and Joseph Davies' Mission to Moscow was cited as an example of this effort. There is an excellent article on Davies in Wikipedia which describes how keen he was to see only the positive in the Soviet Union. Ironies abound in this film. Molotov appears as a kindly old professorial gent Stalin is a hopeful visionary yearning for world peace. The glimpses of daily life in the Soviet Union include ice skating parties with piles of food high fashion for the ladies Englishspeaking railroad workers with nothing but love for their country and American expatriates expressing admiration for the inventiveness of the Russian hosts they are there to help. In fact while Davies was ambassador a large number of American expats were being imprisoned by Stalin as counterrevolutionaries despite having voluntarily emigrated to the Soviet Union to contribute to building a new society. Many petitioned the US Embassy to have their passports restored and Davies refused to intervene. At one point the US embassy staff in Moscow threatened to resign en masse. When Stalin consolidated power with the purges of his former associates in 1936  1938 Davies attended several of the show trials and in Mission to Moscow he is shown nodding knowingly when Bukharin and the other defendants confess to their antiSoviet activities and conspiratorial association with the now archenemy Trotsky. In the movie Davies repeatedly insists that his mission is to see the real Soviet Union firsthand yet in his visits were said to have been highly scripted and organized by the Soviet authorities. In retrospect Davies comes off as a nave fool but seen in the larger context perhaps someone a little more competent would not have been able to supplied the West with the kind of proSoviet view Davies could supply. But let's put history aside for a moment. This is just a bad film. It is stilted overscripted and whatever points it is trying to make are spoonfed to the audience. Davies had control over the final script and his scenes come off as highly selfserving Davies warning of the dangers of war over the objections of more experienced statesmen Davies being congratulated at every turn by one world leader after the next for his insight into the coming war in Europe. You know pretty much at the beginning of each scene what is going to unfold  a vacation with the family to get away from world affairs ends with a phone call from the White House a meeting with senators expressing doubt about the strength of Germany will end with Davies convincing them with facts to the contrary. And Walter Huston is just overworked here  he has to carry virtually every scene because really Mission to Moscow is mostly about Davies himself. A just plain awful movie and yet fascinating to watch especially for a glimpse into this brief period of time when the US actually tried to like Stalin and fascinating also for the fantasy views of Soviet life in the late 1930s. And particularly worthwhile if you also take the time to research the persons and events portrayed in the movie and juxtapose these against the events portrayed in Mission to Moscow. It is a very educational experience. At the time I saw this movie it was not available on DVD but could be downloaded from the Warner Brothers movie archive.".

	schema:headline " If you like a film that glorifies and falsifies the dictatorship of Joseph Stalin then this is for you";
	schema:reviewBody "This film was made to patronize Joeseph Stalin and warm USA audiences to AmericanSoviet relations. Warner boss Jack Warner called it the worst mistake of his career. Warner was a supporter of FDR and Roosevelt asked him to have this film made based on the 1941 book by former Ambassador to the USSR 19361938 Joseph E. Davies. Several films were made during this time to achieve the same effect like song of Russia North Star and Counter Attack but this was a film for Stalin to see himself hand delivered on a yet another mission to Moscow by Davies. This film portrays the brutal dictator Stalin as a fair and just man who has turned his backward country into a progressive industrial and agricultural giant that is moving toward democracy and desires peace and protection of it's borders. It mentions nothing of the one million deaths in the Soviet gulags that happened during Davies' ambassadorial tenure on his mission to Moscow. It glosses over the infamous purge show trials where Stalin rid himself of prominent party leaders where he had 50 of the 54 of the three trials executed under the guise of traitors who were conspiring with Germany and Japan to weaken the USSR. Stalin wanted absolute power but this film portrays these as fair and just trials. The costly RussoFinnish War of 1939 is described by Davies as simply the Soviets wanting to annex Finland to protect Finland from the Nazi's. 23000 Finns were killed and 43000 wounded in this socalled effort to protect them. 127000 Soviets were killed and 265000 wounded. There is no mention of Stalin's manmade famine of the 1930's that resulted in the genocide of millions of Ukrainians. Stalin is portrayed as everybody's favorite uncle and FDR wanted Stalin to see how sympathetic we were to to him by having him actually view this film to maneuver a FDRStalin meeting in Alaska. FDR sent former Ambassador Davies on another mission to Moscow with this film and a message to Stalin from Roosevelt as to how much he respected him. Davies' successor in Moscow Ambassador William H. Standley was not in the loop on this mission and furious and resigned. Davies screened this film for Stalin. Stalin wasn't that impressed with the film or FDR's intentions and stalled on the Alaska summit. FDR was forced to send Secretary of State Cordell Hull to Moscow and Stalin agreed to a summit in Teheran instead of Alaska which would also include Winston Churchill who FDR didn't want for his proposed Alaska summit.Michael Curtiz is the director and the film looks good from an artistic standpoint. Curtiz was best known for Casablanca and after starting out as an important European director in the teens and twenties he moved to Hollywood and became an important filmmaker. Howard Koch who wrote screenplays for such films as Casablanca adapted the Davies' book for the screen which later got him blacklisted from Hollywood. Bert Glendon who did such films as Hotel Imperial and The Ten Commandments in the 20's Kidnapped and Young Mr. Linclon in the 30's and One Night in Lisbon and Our Town in the 40's is the film's cinematographer. This film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Art Direction and stars FDR's favorite actor Walter Huston as Ambassador Davies. Also in the talented cast are Ann Harding George Tobias Oscar Homolka Eleanor Parker Gene Lockhart Frank Faylen and Cyd Charisse. You can enjoy the documentary style approach to this film and the skills of it's renowned filmmakers and big studio production but you can't get past a propaganda film that glorifies the Stalin dictatorship. I would give it a 4.5 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " FDR's Man In The Kremlin";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the most controversial films ever made Mission To Moscow was not good for anyone's career who got involved with the making. Like Song Of Russia made over at MGM Mission To Moscow was a film made specifically to improve SovietAmerican relations in facing the common enemy they had.The Soviet Union no matter how much the American Communist Party trumpeted their virtues still had a real image problem in a lot of quarters due to the purges that Joseph Stalin conducted due to the tremendous dislocation his five year plans created due to the misery caused by the collectivization of agriculture and the systematic slaughter of Kulaks. Kulaks roughly translated could be anyone who owned a large estate to someone who might own a slightly bigger piece of land and maybe some farm animals. Stalin slaughtered thousands of them to force collectivization.Our first ambassador to the Soviet Union was William C. Bullitt who was sent there in 1933. The Republican post World War I presidents did not diplomatically recognize the Soviet Union Franklin Roosevelt's first foreign policy initiative was to extend recognition. Bullitt was a guy at first enthused but then got very disillusioned by what he saw. He and FDR had a falling out and he left Moscow in 1936.Joseph E. Davies was an industrialist and large Democratic contributor who did go back with FDR to the Wilson administration. He was appointed US Ambassador and after that became a cheerleader for the Soviets. As is shown in the film Davies just blindly accepted every piece of propaganda handed to him. Films made in 1943 were not going to cast a critical light on the dark underside of Communist Russia.Walter Huston dusts off his Sam Dodsworth persona to play Ambassador Davies. Ann Harding plays his dutiful wife and Eleanor Parker their daughter. Vladimir Sokoloff is President Kalinin Gene Lockhart plays Prime Minister Molotov and Oscar Homolka plays Foreign Minister Litvinov all well known personalities of the day. In the Soviet Union like other countries Davies would have been required to present his credentials to the president and Russia did have a figurehead president who was a great deal less than Mission To Moscow makes him out.At that time Joseph Stalin was only the Secretary of the Presidium of the Communist Party but as such wielded the real power. The People's Republic of China adopted a similar set up that never changed with Mao Tsetung as Party head and holding the real power while Mao lived. Stalin is played by actor Manart Kippen and is only seen once as Davies is prepared to leave the Russian embassy. He's so shy and retiring the portrayal is so absolutely ludicrous that it leaves me laughing. But Davies sitting through the purge trials and accepting without question all the testimonies and forced confessions is also ludicrous.After his time was up as Ambassador Davies wrote the book on which this film was based and did go on a speaking tour promoting RussoAmerican cooperation. He was doing this on behalf of his friend and president FDR but Davies had also become a real true believer in the 'miracle' that was Soviet Russia. When the Cold War started three films became the targets of the House Un American Activities Committee they were ripe targets that the conservative members were grateful for. The three films were The North Star from 20th Century Fox Song Of Russia from MGM and Mission To Moscow. None got more criticism than this one. Screenwriter Howard Koch who had won an Oscar this same year for Casablanca earned a place on the blacklist because of Mission To Moscow. Whatever Koch's personal political convictions were in this case all he did was translate to the screen what was in Davies's book.Davies was held up to ridicule and in some measure deserved a bit of it because of Mission To Moscow. Time and the end of the Cold War have given us a proper perspective of the Russian contribution towards defeating the Nazis. In fact it was the lion's share in Europe. Policy decisions were made on the basis of keeping the Russians in the war before the Americans and British and respective allies got on the European continent with forces to make it a two front war first in Italy and then in France. There was a justifiable fear that Stalin would make a separate peace with Hitler just as he signed the nonaggression pact with him before World War II started in 1939.Of course the reports that Davies wrote off about the brutality of the Soviet Union were also true. The reactionaries had a field day with him he was never taken seriously again. For that reason Mission To Moscow has not worn well either as history or entertainment.".

	schema:headline " Strange Propaganda Film From Warner Bros";
	schema:reviewBody "A few months ago I saw a documentary called BEHIND CLOSED DOORS which focused upon the machinations and political intrigue in the Kremlin during the second world war . A clip from MISSION TO MOSCOW was shown and is a habit of mine I decided to look it up on this site only to notice that despite being directed by the great Michael Curtiz it was lowly regarded but decided to track it down anyway There's an old saying that  My enemy's enemy is my friend  and nothing proves this more than the second world war where the capitalist democracies of Britain and America supported the Soviet Union during the second world war . The film revolves around painting the Soviet Union as a country Britain and America can do business with and a key ally against the aggression of the Nazis and imperial Japanese . There's nothing wrong with this of course and 1943 had seen massive defeats for Nazi Germany at Stalingrad and Kursk which put the writing on the wall that Nazi Germany was going to lose the war The problem with the film is that it doesn't celebrate the bloody victories won by Soviet blood but starts before the war where ambassador Joe Davies visits the USSR and finds it completely like the United States . Soviet workers only give a proportion of their pay to the state similar to taxation and there's even American advisers working in the socialist state who have become bored living on a diet of caviar The only real difference between Soviet Russia and America is that the Soviet state is being held back by a conspiracy involving Trotskyite agents and Nazis who are embarking on a campaign of sabotage against Stalinism . We know this must be true because it's pointed out by an American adviser and later Davies states that the trial of the saboteurs is no different from a trial held in the USA . There is no doubt that the defendants such as Tukhachevsky and Radek are guilty as charged . Davies says it's a fair trail so if an American says that it must be true There is a bitter irony in portraying the Soviet Union is such a light and that was that the film was targeted as being communist propaganda in 1950 by the House Of UnAmerican Activities that led to Jack Warner himself being questioned by congress . It seems strange that nations suffer from a collective amnesia where politics is concerned . The film is nothing more than a propaganda piece for an anti Nazi ally though not a very good one and remains a curiosity more than anything else".

Davies of course never disagrees but instead launches into another speech in which he assures his friends that he will tell America or the world what's really going on in the Soviet Union.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is pure red propaganda. I sure hope Joseph Davies was not as naive and stupid as this movie portrays. Obviously it was important in 1943 to make movies with an antifascist slant but that does not excuse this piece of left wing propaganda that glosses over the great soviet show trials of 19371938 and Stalin's purges. To show Uncle Joe himself as a great humanitarian who just wanted peace  how pathetic. Since the USSR was a vital ally at the time this movie was made maybe it would have been best not to have made this movie at all if we were afraid to offend the Soviets with the TRUTH. This movie ranks right up there with 'Battleship Potemkin' and 'Triumph of the Will' as big production propaganda but it is not as well made. I am a little curious as to the future careers of people involved in this movie were any of them black listed in the 1950's?. After seeing this film it makes you think twice about the Hollywood black list in the 1950's. Perhaps a necessary evil during the cold war against leftist who could make MarxistStalinist crud like this movie. If you want to counteract this left wing movie I recommend 'The Green Berets'  a horrible piece of American rightwing propaganda.".

	schema:headline " The first casualty of war is truth";
	schema:reviewBody "Both the book Mission to Moscow by the late Ambassador Joseph M. Davies and this film are severe attacks on intellectual honesty. Near the conclusion the narrator speaks over a scene with the flags of members of the United Nations starting with the flags of the United States Britain the Soviet Union and all the world's free nations. Wow. To imply that the U.S.S.R. under Marshal Joseph Stalin was anywhere close to a free nation is as breathtakingly dishonest as any author or screen writer can be.Now it is true that many Americans did not like Russia under Stalin and it is true that FDR wanted to justify American aid for the Russian Army because it was fighting on a second front to defeat Nazi Germany. It is also true that the Russian people suffered terribly more than any other nation from Hitler's attacks. The loss of Russian life both military and civilian on the eastern front was massive beyond comprehension. As bad as Londoners suffered during the blitz Russian people suffered much greater loss of life.But none of that justifies the incredible proSoviet lies in this film. Lies such as one where Ambassador Joe Davies played by Walter Huston justifies the Russian invasion of Finland by saying it was self defense. Lies such as Davies saying that it was British delays that would drive Stalin into Hitler's arms. There was plenty of duplicity in both Moscow and Berlin over the shared occupation of Poland when the MolotovVon Ribbentrop Pact mutual nonaggression treaty was signed by Germany and the U.S.S.R. in 1939.There are repeated references in the film by Huston as the narrator by a voice of President Roosevelt and by others to profascist propaganda as being responsible for antiRussian feelings in the U.S. Without any help from Hitler many Americans in the late 1930s saw the Stalin state for what it was a repressive monstrosity. A humorous but dark view of the U.S.S.R. was on display in Ninotchka in 1939 starring Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas directed by the great Ernst Lubitsch. A similar 1940 film was Comrade X starring Clark Gable and Hedy Lamarr directed by King Vidor. Those stereotypical views also mild distortions still came far closer to the truth about the Stalin government than this 1943 film did.There is a side issue in some user comments about the screen writer Howard Koch and whether or not he was fairly treated as a black listed writer in the 1950s when he and his wife wrote under different names in England. Whatever the merits or demerits of that separate debate may be the writing in this film is not only laboriously proSoviet direct from the party line but it is also stilted. Almost every monologue by Walter Huston as Davies is a speech that constantly recovers familiar Communist Party talking points of that era.It is rumored that FDR wanted this film to be made based on the book in an effort to drum up public support in America for the allied effort. This might be true. But by the time the film came out in 1943 American public opinion had already made its peace with the idea of a temporary tactical alliance with Russia for the limited purpose of defeating Hitler. That is why this film's blatant proSoviet drum beating is so puzzling even in the context of World War II and in 1943.Americans understood that as Churchill put it if Hitler invaded Hell we would say nice things about the devil. Perhaps a hundred years from now the crimes of Joseph Stalin will be as famous as those of Hitler. But in 1943 it was in the interest of the grand alliance that American films downplay Soviet crimes and praise the bravery of Soviet troops. The latter effort was honest the former was not.Even so this film went way too far. One can legitimately admire the Russian people themselves and their army for a valiant struggle against the Wehrmacht without fawning over a cowardly drunk and militarilystupid Stalin. The film even fawns over the always lovable Vyacheslav Molotov of Molotov Cocktail fame so improbably played by Gene Lockhart of Bob Cratchett and the judge in Miracle on 34th Street fame.There is the key difference. Davies was not just proRussian in the context of a necessary war time alliance. Davies used the war as his excuse to become an all out an apologist for the repressive Communist dictatorship of the U.S.S.R. and rationalized everything that government did no matter what. Whether he was a dupe or just a gullible fellow traveler is beside the point. It is the extreme extent of the ideological rationalizations that makes this film so dishonest.".

There is competance of courseit's a Warner Bros. film in the 1940s with Michael Curtiz directingbut it's so burdened by its message it never becomes an actual movie about conflicts characters and plot.It's pure propaganda. Knowing that you can watch it with historic curiosity. It is truly weird enough to warrant a look if you follow the RooseveltStalin comparison and the general American attitude to the Soviet Union in the 1940s. You will however get bored. It begins with a series of speeches including an opening explanation by the author of the book the movie builds on. Even when the scenes have some interest as when the diplomatic family tours the USSR there is such an obvious attempt to make the Russians wonderful people with a terrific political system it turns your stomach. Not that I need to agree or disagree I just don't want to be preached to.And so it goes. There are factory visits parades ballroom affairs and lots of preachy talking. It's impossible to care or get absorbed but it is revealing of one large oddity of WWII the need of the US to work alongside the USSR in defeating Hitler. The Germans come off badly of course the trains are so efficient they won't wait for people who get to the platform late. The Japanese even worse caricatures who have made a mess of China. The second half of the movie is a different beast a kind of judicial series of confrontations. It also has the feel of information instead of drama. It's well made fairly well films and edited with clarity but it can't make a silk purse out of you know what.Warner Bros. fans might enjoy the appearance of an amazing number of actors. Because of all the shifting scenes from country to country there was a need for a great number of secondary but familiar actors like the detective from Mildred Pierce. A good half the actors will seem familiar even if you can't place what movies you've seen them in. If you love Curtiz the reason I watched you'll have trouble seeing his brilliance. Finally we might expect some kind of political revelation hereand what we see is a kind of admirable but perhaps naive American acting as ambassador to the USSR in the late 1930s. That's the guy who wrote the book Joseph Davies and you can see all these good intentions and homespun Wisconsin style Americanisms. It doesn't hold up well against the tough characters he was up against all around from Stalin to Churchill.".

	schema:headline " An Astonishing Film";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the most astonishing films I've ever seen not because of the content but because of what it reveals about its subject. That would be one Joseph E. Davies chosen by President Franklin Roosevelt before World War II as one of his personal ambassadors to the Soviet Union. FDR believed in the personal touch when dealing with other countries so he would send his untrained cronies overseas for little factfinding missions. Wendell Wilkie for instance went on one such mission at the height of the war. This film shows how well this tactic worked out.This film records Davies' grand tour of Europe in the crucial 19371939 period. It opens with the real Davies giving a heartfelt and very long speech in which he describes himself as Godfearing and so forth i.e. not a Communist. Then we segue to the actor playing Davies Walter Huston and follow his increasingly odd journey in which he talks to all the movers and shakers in Europe at the time with the notable exception of Hitler who refused to see him because he was so busy presumably planning his next invasion.Now this film was intended as a pure documentary of what Davies saw and learned. Davies himself obviously approved every single scene and every piece of dialog. That is what makes this film so astonishing.Astonishing because Davies is revealed to be an absolute bumbler and inept fool who had no business touring Europe much less representing the United States or having his opinions used to any purpose by the United States government. There are so many jawdropping moments that one almost begins to think this was a parody. But alas it was no parody this is the actual sort of information that the US had about Europe on the eve of a war in which more than 20 million people died.Davies laps up whatever fiction is served to him and uses each morsel to regurgitate wrongheaded pronouncements about the state of the world. Virtually every conclusion he utters is based on information spoonfed to him by people purposefully deceiving him. The truth about what was going on around him was discoverable but he never bothers. As such this film documents just how taken in Davies was by the Soviets or put another way how successful the Soviets were in snookering the naive American.Let's give a few examples. Davies makes a big deal about finding out that Soviet factories were being sabotaged by opponents to Stalin generically referred to as Trotskyites. Conveniently these saboteurs were rounded up during his stay and put on trial. When some of his associates start questioning what is really going on Davies piously opines We'd all just better wait for the trial so we can learn the real facts. Ha! Innocent abroad indeed. Indoctrinated in the US legal system which was actually designed to get at the truth of a matter Davies obviously had no idea what a Soviet show trial was all about. Obviously as proved later it was all an elaborate setup. Soviet Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky had become too big for his britches and Stalin wanted him dead so he concocted the whole story about sabotage for Davies' and everyone else's benefit. Davies sits there lapping up every lying word of it unquestioning and practically inert intellectually.At another moment Davies' security people worry that their quarters may be bugged. They want to check the place out. But no Davies will have none of it. Let's give them the benefit of the doubt he decides. One physically gasps when seeing this. Yes this is the guy I want representing American interests abroad.There are all sorts of propaganda moments that are delightful in their naivet. The Soviets obviously put on a real show of their military might for the stupid American with some particularly nice flourishes. A big deal is made in the film of the fact that there are women soldiers women paratroopers women this and that. This must have been to give an appearance of some kind of monolithic quality to Soviet forces. Yet students of the war will search in vain for the exploits of these hordes of Amazon warriors. It was all a show kind of like those given at the Bolshoi. Hermann Goering bragged about doing the same thing to foreign visitors it was a fairly common tactic among sophisticated diplomats. Somebody with a penetrating mind might have seen through such shenanigans but that was asking too much of Davies.Anyway the film is such a farce that it's fascinating. Stalin looks so pleased with himself after feeding Davies more lies lighting his pipe and smirking. Now we realize he wasn't happy because he had found such a fine fellow. Instead he would have been smirking because he realized he had found the ultimate sucker. FDR himself caused the West endless grief at Yalta because he acted similarly to Davies just giving them the benefit of the doubt and so forth. Stalin is said to have thought little of this film and it is painfully clear why. He must have been embarrassed at the sheer ridiculousness of it his choreographed charade immortalized on celluloid. It's possible that observing the sheer stupidity of the West may have contributed to his thinking he had more in common with the decidedly notnaive Hitler leading to the NaziSoviet pact mentioned in the film and explained away by Davies as Stalin just protecting his country yeah I'll buy that for 100 Alex.Worth watching for a hoot and to see how a reputation can be gutted by a person's own hand. I enjoyed it but it also is agonizing seeing how much a fool it makes Davies look.".

	schema:headline " Terrible film but not for the reasons you might expect.";
	schema:reviewBody "Joseph Stalin certainly wasn't a builder for the betterment of mankind the millions he sent to the gulag are a testament to that. 'Mission to Moscow' is a terrible film but not because it tries to glamorize Joseph Stalin. If someone wanted to make a film canonizing Stalin I'd say all the power to him. Art is a concept deeper than political ideology. I'd have no problem giving a good review to a film that thought highly of Stalin the problem is 'Mission to Moscow' isn't a good film.The problem with 'Mission to Moscow' is that it assumes it's audience is incredibly stupid. One general rule about propaganda is that the audience should be able to suspend their preconceptions to be subjected to it's message. You know while watching 'Mission to Moscow' that you are watching a propaganda piece. Compare that to say 'Saving Private Ryan' which is a very good film but has a blatant fetish for the military. Or if we wanted to stay in the realm of the Soviet Union any of Sergei Eisenstein's films. Even a film critic that believes Communism is a philosophical evil will say that October or Battleship Potemkin are great cinematic achievements. 'Mission to Moscow' goes for cheap emotional triggers. The performances are so over the top and tongue in cheek to have any credibility to them whatsoever. The fourth wall is consistently broken. Walter Huston who was by all accounts a very capable actor is terrible in this picture but then again what could he have done with this terrible script? Americans are more susceptible to images than they are to anything else. If 'Mission to Moscow' wanted to truly glamorize the Soviets it wouldn't have Huston narrate everything. Images are more powerful than words with propaganda.And if we want to talk about negative propaganda why don't we talk about how the film portrays FDR? Franklin Roosevelt has an almost Stalinist Cult of Personality in this film. We aren't even allowed to see his face. The only thing Stalin and Joseph Davies can agree about America is that it has a great President. If you learn one thing from the terrors of Stalinist Cult of Personality in Russia learn this no man or political ideology is God like.".

	schema:reviewBody "Extremely proStalin  Soviet Union movie made in Hollywood at the very hight of WWII when Germany was on the verge during the battle of Stalingrad of knocking the USSR out of the war. Based on the book Mission to Moscow by the former US Soviet Ambassador Joseph E.Davies who in fact introduces the film were shown how the Soviet Union under the leadership of Premier Joseph Stalin was the envy of the free world in it's heroic struggle against Nazi Germany. It was the Soviet Red Army who that during the course of the war lost an estimated 9 million of its fighting man and women battling Nazi Germany.Given the job as Ambassador to the Soviet Union in 1937 by Pres. Roosevelt Jack Young Davies Walter Huston is given the assignment to check out what's going on in that country and report back to the president if it will be a reliable ally if a future conflict between Britian  France that breaks out with Nazi Germany. In what seems like no time at all Davies develops a love affair with the USSR and it's ruthless dictator Joseph or Uncle Joe as President Roosevelt calls him the Man of Steel himself Joseph V. Stalin played by the kind sweet and fatherly looking Mamart Kipper. The what seems like very naive Davieswho should have known betteris completely blown away by Uncle Joe's great accomplishments. That's in him bringing the backward and 19th century Russia into the 20th century with his series of 5 year economic plans. Plans not originated by Uncle Joe but his late boss and first leader of the Soviet Union Nickolai 'Nicky Lennin.Even though very proStalin the movie surprisingly doesn't skip over the notorious 193738 purge trials conducted by Stailn's henchmen in the Soviet Ministry of Justice and the dreaded NKVD. It was at those trials that the almost entire Soviet diplomatic and Red Army office corps were convicted and executed for treason. They were all accused in them planning with the exiled and deposed by Stalin Leon Trotsky Sam Goldenberg with the Hitler's Germany and Imperial Japan of trying to undermined and overthrow the Stalin regime. As It turned it wasn't treason that they were guilty of but Stalin's hysterical paranoia of feeling threatened by anyone close to him trying to throw him out of power!The movie goes on making excuse after excuse for Stalin's crimeslike the invasions of Poland Finland and the Baltic Statesin that they were needed to get his country ready for the coming invasion by Hitler's Germany which he was certain was soon to come. Yet when the Nazi invasion finally came in June 1941 Stalin's well prepared for it Red Army was caught flatfooted having the German Army reach the very gates of Moscow before the year was out. Davies now back in the US and a private citizen does his best to get the American people who at the time was very isolationist ready to both supply the Soviet Union with military hardware as well as join it in it's battle against Germany. But as fate would have it it was japan's sneak attack on Pearl Harbor six months after Hitler invaded the USSR that did the trick for both him and President Roosevelt. It was Pres.Roosevelt who's behind the scenes actions was doing everything to incite a German UBoat attack on US shipping in order to get the US into the war. What was so ironic about that is that it was Hitler's Germany who did everything possible to avoid a conflict with the USA even having his Uboats not return fire after being fired upon by the US Navy not the US that was the first to declare war!Despite the Soviet Union being an ally of the US at the time of the films release it in fact bombed at the box office not even making back half of the 1.5 million dollars it took to produce it. when shown to Russian audiences in Moscow people watching it in them knowing what a horror Uncle Joe Stalin really was could't refrain from laughing out load when ever Davies showed his enthusiasm for the Stalin regime as well as Uncle Joe himself! Even if it meant a one way ticket to a Siberian gulag or Soviet firing squad if they were ever identifiedwith the lights in the theater turned on of showing disrespect to Uncle Joe and his great accomplishments for the Russian people!P.S No matter how ridicules and historically inaccuratein covering up Stalin's crimes the film Mission to Moscow is the one thing it got right is that without the help of the USSR the US and its western allies would have never won the war against Nazi Germany. According to official German casualty statistics the German military lost an astounding 2400000 killed and missing together with almost 3500000 wounded in the fighting on the Eastern or Russian front alone! And that's only up to November 30 1944 when the German military stopped keeping casualties statistics! That's without even counting the enormous losses that the German army suffered fighting against the Red Army from December 1944 to the end of the war in May 1945! Those tremendous losses of manpower as well as military equipment against the Soviet Union would have fully equipped and manned as much as 400 Nazi infantry and armored divisions! A German army of almost 6 million strong which could have been thrown against the US Britain and their allies in not only North Africa and Italy but in the savage and bloody battles of Western Europe in 19445 which would have well turned the tied of battle in Hitler's favor! In fact there would have been no possibility of a Western Front without an Eastern Front tying down as much as 80 of the German Army needed to engage the advancing some 8 to 10 million strong Red Army!".

In what seems like no time at all Davies develops a love affair with the USSR and it's ruthless dictator Joseph or Uncle Joe as President Roosevelt calls him the Man of Steel himself Joseph V. Stalin played by the kind sweet and fatherly looking Mamart Kipper. The what seems like very naive Davieswho should have known betteris completely blown away by Uncle Joe's great accomplishments. That's in him bringing the backward and 19th century Russia into the 20th century with his series of 5 year economic plans. Plans not originated by Uncle Joe but his late boss and first leader of the Soviet Union Nickolai 'Nicky Lennin.Even though very proStalin the movie surprisingly doesn't skip over the notorious 193738 purge trials conducted by Stailn's henchmen in the Soviet Ministry of Justice and the dreaded NKVD. It was at those trials that the almost entire Soviet diplomatic and Red Army office corps were convicted and executed for treason. They were all accused in them planning with the exiled and deposed by Stalin Leon Trotsky Sam Goldenberg with the Hitler's Germany and Imperial Japan of trying to undermined and overthrow the Stalin regime. As It turned it wasn't treason that they were guilty of but Stalin's hysterical paranoia of feeling threatened by anyone close to him trying to throw him out of power!The movie goes on making excuse after excuse for Stalin's crimeslike the invasions of Poland Finland and the Baltic Statesin that they were needed to get his country ready for the coming invasion by Hitler's Germany which he was certain was soon to come. Yet when the Nazi invasion finally came in June 1941 Stalin's well prepared for it Red Army was caught flatfooted having the German Army reach the very gates of Moscow before the year was out. Davies now back in the US and a private citizen does his best to get the American people who at the time was very isolationist ready to both supply the Soviet Union with military hardware as well as join it in it's battle against Germany. But as fate would have it it was japan's sneak attack on Pearl Harbor six months after Hitler invaded the USSR that did the trick for both him and President Roosevelt. It was Pres.Roosevelt who's behind the scenes actions was doing everything to incite a German UBoat attack on US shipping in order to get the US into the war. What was so ironic about that is that it was Hitler's Germany who did everything possible to avoid a conflict with the USA even having his Uboats not return fire after being fired upon by the US Navy not the US that was the first to declare war!Despite the Soviet Union being an ally of the US at the time of the films release it in fact bombed at the box office not even making back half of the 1.5 million dollars it took to produce it. when shown to Russian audiences in Moscow people watching it in them knowing what a horror Uncle Joe Stalin really was could't refrain from laughing out load when ever Davies showed his enthusiasm for the Stalin regime as well as Uncle Joe himself! Even if it meant a one way ticket to a Siberian gulag or Soviet firing squad if they were ever identifiedwith the lights in the theater turned on of showing disrespect to Uncle Joe and his great accomplishments for the Russian people!P.S No matter how ridicules and historically inaccuratein covering up Stalin's crimes the film Mission to Moscow is the one thing it got right is that without the help of the USSR the US and its western allies would have never won the war against Nazi Germany. According to official German casualty statistics the German military lost an astounding 2400000 killed and missing together with almost 3500000 wounded in the fighting on the Eastern or Russian front alone! And that's only up to November 30 1944 when the German military stopped keeping casualties statistics! That's without even counting the enormous losses that the German army suffered fighting against the Red Army from December 1944 to the end of the war in May 1945! Those tremendous losses of manpower as well as military equipment against the Soviet Union would have fully equipped and manned as much as 400 Nazi infantry and armored divisions! A German army of almost 6 million strong which could have been thrown against the US Britain and their allies in not only North Africa and Italy but in the savage and bloody battles of Western Europe in 19445 which would have well turned the tied of battle in Hitler's favor! In fact there would have been no possibility of a Western Front without an Eastern Front tying down as much as 80 of the German Army needed to engage the advancing some 8 to 10 million strong Red Army!";

	schema:reviewBody "In 1976 in the Napa Valley the perfectionist vigneron Jim Barrett Bill Pullman is the owner of the Chteau Montelena that is full of debts and near bankruptcy. Jim is unsuccessfully racking his wine trying to reach perfection. He has a problematic relationship with his hippie son Bo Chris Pine and his Mexican foreman and connoisseur Gustavo Brambila Freddy Rodriguez is secretly producing wine with his father Mr. Garcia Miguel Sandoval. Jim hires the free spirit intern Sam Fulton Rachael Taylor from UC Davis to help him in the production of wine. Meanwhile in Paris the wine expert Steven Spurrier Alan Rickman that owns a specialized store has few clients. His friend Maurice Cantavale Dennis Farina advises him to promote his store and he decides to organize a blind tasting competition between the French and the American wines. He travels to Napa Valley to find the best American wines to bring to the dispute. He has a troubled meeting with Jim that refuses to participate in the competition. However Bo foresees the chance of survival of his father's business and gives two bottles to Spurrier. But soon he finds that the color of all the 500 bottles of chardonnay have turned into brown. Is Jim Barrett's business doomed? Bottle Shock is a delightful movie based on a true story. This little but charming movie is not available on DVD in Brazil but only on cable O Julgamento de Paris meaning The Paris Judgement but I bought the American DVD following the advice of a friend of mine from California. The story has a pleasant screenplay with entertaining subplots that might or might not really happen such as the triangle of love among Sam Gustavo and Bo that keeps the plot never boring. The cast has good names associated to the beautiful locations that make this little movie worthwhile watching. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Not Available".

	schema:reviewBody "Bottle Shock Bottom Line Rocky for wine aficionados. By Stephen Farber Jan 29 2008Sundance Film FestivalPARK CITY  When a film opens with the title Based on a true story one wonders if the filmmakers are trying to bolster a flimsy premise with claims of authenticity. But Bottle Shock which had its world premiere at Sundance enshrines an irresistible story that happens to be mainly true. It takes place in 1976 the year of the American Bicentennial and in these cynical times it is nice to be reminded of an American victory that is actually worth celebrating. This might not have been a momentous world achievement but it was a gratifying victory all the same.The contest takes place in the world of wine in a time when California wines competed for the first time in a prestigious competition in France. One of the competitors was Chteau Montelena a vineyard owned by Jim Barrett who dropped out of the corporate rat race to pursue his dream of cultivating grapes. Jim is just one of the engaging characters in this tale of American hayseeds taking on French connoisseurs. Because of the wine backdrop some will compare the film to Sideways but the comparisons are not really fair. This is a different kind of movie a classic underdog tale with lots of humor and heart. With the right handling it could be a hit on the specialty circuit. The film begins by introducing an intriguing ensemble. In the Napa Valley Jim Bill Pullman is locked in constant battle with his slacker son Bo Chris Pine who works for him at the vineyard. Another worker Gustavo Freddy Rodriguez the son of a Mexican field hand hopes to launch his own label. Both of the men are infatuated with Sam Rachael Taylor a new arrival in town. Meanwhile in Paris Steven Spurrier Alan Rickman hopes to revive his failing wine business by sponsoring a competition and a friend encourages him to visit California to add a new gimmick to the contest.The film is very leisurely in establishing all these characters  a mite too leisurely. The first half would benefit from tighter editing. Another problem is that the characters  the tyrannical father and the rebellious son the snooty European wine connoisseur  are a bit stock and the personal stories are not as well developed as they might be. But the film keeps building in intensity and the payoff sizzles.As he showed in Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing  Charm School director Randall Miller has real affection for actors and he brings out the best in performers who haven't always had an opportunity to shine. Miller wrote and produced both films with his wife Jody Savin. Pullman has his best role in years and he captures the fury as well as the passion of a man in thrall to a dream on the verge of collapse. Pine has enormous charm and Rodriguez confirms the promise he showed on HBO's Six Feet Under. Rickman also has one of his juiciest roles in recent years and he's able to satirize British haughtiness without falling into caricature. Watch his reactions as he samples California cuisine  first a vat of Kentucky Fried Chicken and then a glob of guacamole  and you'll savor the mastery of a truly subtle actor. Two beautiful young actresses  Taylor and Eliza Dushku as a ballsy bartender  give equally winning performances. Once the film gets past the exposition it brings off a number of delectable scenes. A high point comes when Rickman and Pine inveigle a bunch of airline passengers to transport California wine in their carryon bags. And the climactic competition where the scrappy American interloper has to stand up against generations of French tradition is as rousing as any finale you'll see this year. Cinematographer Michael J. Ozier magnificently captures the Napa countryside. This intelligent affectionate beautifully acted movie gives crowdpleasers a good name.".

Even the buzz on the shuttle buses between venues was only positive. I loved it. With an incredibly strong cast the beauty of the California wine country showcased in the camera work and a great collection of 70's music to compliment the musical score Bottle Shock is a pleasure to watch. The movie is based on the true story of how a Napa winery's 1973 Chardonnay won a French tasting contest that sent the wine world into a frenzy. The story is about the Barrett Family of Montelena and their Chardonnay. Jim Barret a father at odds with his son Bo is played by Bill Pullman. Steven Spurrier is played by Alan Rickman whose performance is fantastic as can always be expected. Rickman's Britishness and the Californina wine makers not being able to tell the difference between British and French is hilarious. There's a love triangle involving Bo BarrettChris Pine an intern Rachael Taylor and a winery employee Freddy Rodriguez with Eliza Dushku as the local tavern ownerfriend. All of this pulls together beautifully for the sake of the wine. For me the scenes of the confused French tasters trying to tell the difference between the French and California wines was unforgettable and in the words of a reviewer this movie even has a charming aftertaste.".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently got a chance to see Bottle Shock and I have to say I thought it was great. It's really charming and interesting in a very different way from Sideways although because of all the beautiful Napa Valley photography it still reminded me of it. It also has great characters and hilarious moments the way that film does. I highly recommend this film. Based on a true story it chronicles how California wine makers became serious contenders in the world competition of wine an honor previously assumed to be rewarded always to the French. It centers around a town of quirky up and coming wine makers each with their own challenges to face. It's got a great cast including Bill Pullman Chris Pine Freddie Rodriguez Rachel Taylor Eliza Dushku and the hilarious Alan Rickman. Rickman plays an English wine seller in France who's desperate to find the best wines to sell in his store. He travels to California to see if the rumors are true about California's wines. His performance alone is worth seeing this. It's a charming heartwarming movie that I think will do very well when it opens 88. Check it out you wont be disappointed. 910".

It's really charming and interesting in a very different way from Sideways although because of all the beautiful Napa Valley photography it still reminded me of it. It also has great characters and hilarious moments the way that film does. I highly recommend this film. Based on a true story it chronicles how California wine makers became serious contenders in the world competition of wine an honor previously assumed to be rewarded always to the French. It centers around a town of quirky up and coming wine makers each with their own challenges to face. It's got a great cast including Bill Pullman Chris Pine Freddie Rodriguez Rachel Taylor Eliza Dushku and the hilarious Alan Rickman.

	schema:headline " Pullman Rickman and Rodriguez are stellar. A nice break from all the summer action.";
	schema:reviewBody "The ensemble dramedy is always a potentially great film and what it ultimately comes down to is the writing and whether or not the film is heartfelt enough for its audience to be moved. While Bottle Shock won't be winning any Oscars it certainly accomplishes the aforementioned goals. In short the film is very honest heartfelt informative and enjoyable. It will draw its comparisons to 'Sideways' because of the subject matter and some of the characters Bill Pullman in BS and Paul Giamatti in SW have similar characters but what sets Bottle Shock apart is that it looks at the wine itself as a character. You care just as much about the wine as you do about the characters.Bottle Shock may be categorized as a comedy in some listings but I felt that this isn't right. It's more of a drama than comedy but it does have its light hearted and funny moments most of which center around Rickman's British man getting involved in 1970's California culture. The film does a great job of setting up an atmosphere in which we can get lost in not to mention shows a part of the USA rarely seen. The cinematography and physical landscape of the film is beautiful. It also is smoothly edited.The acting is always a topic of conversation in this kind of movie and I found the film to have a lot of subtle and powerful performances especially from Bill Pullman and Alan Rickman. Pullman's character is quite the specimen. A man who's quit his job as a lawyer and partner of a firm to grow grapes essentially and is having a hard time watching it fail. I felt that Pullman nailed the nuances and little emotions he needed to. He also had a good dynamic with Chris Pine. The restrained anger was especially well done by the veteran. Alan Rickman gives yet another interesting and intriguing performance in a part that was probably written for him. In the hands of any other actor the character is bland at best but Rickman gives Steven Spurrier a certain depth that makes him likable despite his snobbish attitude.Surprising me with yet another great show after his wonderful performance in 'Bobby' Freddy Rodriguez gets a lot to chew on here. This guy has got to be one of the most underrated and rare talents in the business. I appreciated his Oscar worthy turn in 'Bobby' and he probably gives the most difficult and well done performance after Pullman. Chris Pine is acceptable but is nothing special. Rachael Taylor has a certain likable charm about her she has gorgeous hair and eyes though the fact that her strong British accent slipped into her obviously fake American one a few times bothered me. Dennis Farina and Eliza Dushku are nice additions in smaller parts.Bottle Shock certainly isn't for everyone. You won't find super huge action sequences or psychotic bad guys here but you'll find a remarkable character study with a compelling enough story to keep a viewer interested. It is a movie that doesn't require a ton of thought but some attention is needed. I will give our director and writer some props for keeping the movie going smoothly. It never dragged or was boring. If this one is playing at your local cinema I advise you to give it a chance.".

The Batman's and china mummies.. The summer of prequel thrillers and sequel killers. This movie has culture and I dare to say reality but a great true story..Although most of the people in the theater were about 1020 years older then me.. I think anyone at any age and especially if you like the taste of winepersonally I don't drink alcohol would love this film even more.I would call it a fantastic drama with loads of comedy and a love story for not only two people but ones quest of greatness. It really shows how us as humans we are impacted by not only who we are but what we do that helps define us.It doesn't hurt that we were able to rub it in the face of the French who sometimes think they can be superior to everything and everyone else.At about 13 of the way through the movie I really had to go.. but I didn't want to miss a thing and opted to wait it out. You won't be disappointing by anything in this film.. Acting A Writing A Directing A.. No I don't work in the film industry I am just a regular guy mid 30's who loves to go to movie premiers and I felt it as my duty to recommend this film to others. I didn't post anything about Tropic Thunder or the new Mummy movieany other premier I have seen recently..

Out of all the movies I saw I can easily say that it was the best. It was really something to see two bigwigs like Alan Rickman and Bill Pullman go toe to toe with each other. To see these two mammoth talents opposite each other is almost reason enough to see the movie but the great performances don't stop there. Freddy Rodriguez delivers on some very strong and moving parts in the film that literally had tears forming in my eyes Freddy is one of the best young actors Hollywood has to offer. As someone already commented Dennis Farina is absolutely priceless. You will fall head over heals in love with Rachael Taylor who carries herself with a classic silver screen charm. And Chris Pine shows why he is destined to be put on the fast track to fame but don't take my word for it he is Captain Kirk in the new Star Trek franchise. As a whole Bottle Shock is simply wonderful. Oh and not to forget one of the biggest characters in the film the Napa Valley itself! This movie is so beautifully shot and set that it will take your breath away. This is one you MUST SEE!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Everybody loves a success story particularly one with an underdog. Hard as it is to believe the underdog here is the U.S. of A. Rewind to Woodstock if you are old enough to remember the Hippies era and then 7 years after it. The vintage year is 1976 and this is a true story best for people who appreciate a glass of good wine but hopefully are not wine snobs but should also be enjoyable to anyone who appreciates good and fine things in life. This is the story about the end of France's domination and the beginning of opening up the world's wine market to the new world the American and Australian continents with even a futuristic nod towards Asia.The movie opens with panoramic aerial shots of the Napa Valley landscape with relaxing music that moves between languid and bouncy. Right away the tone is set. Consciously or otherwise the audience sits back in the presumably comfortable seat and looks forward to a light and hopefully charming movie. Unless it is a particularly hardtoplease audience Bottle shock generally delivers.This is a true story albeit not particularly well known and therefore offers no suspense. Although a wine layman may not know exactly how it happened he knows for a fact that today when you walk into any wine store you can get Californian wine and for that matter Chilean Australian and many others just as easy as you get French wine. The climatic finale of the huge surprise of the Barrett family wine winning a blind tasting contest in France will not be a surprise to the audience. What delights them is the process and the characters involved.The premises and relationships are all too familiar. There is the divorced father with a postHippie era son who is generally labeled as a loser. His way of educating the son is getting into a homegrown boxing rink with him donning gloves and slugging it out. There is a girl who seeks internship in winemaking this family bringing romance along the way. There is the ethnic Mexican assistant who knows even more about wine that the fatherandson who is struggling against financial odds to try to make their wine something the Napa Valley can be proud of. And everybody has a burning passion for wine sunshine captured in water as one quotes from a famous saying. With just the right touch the audience is made to like but not quite fall madly in love with these characters. Consistent with the general tone set for this movie Bill Pullman Chris Pine Rachael Taylor and Freddy Rodriguez make it work.But it is inimitable Alan Rickman that will make you remember this movie. He plays the English wine store owner in Paris who set out to California to explore business opportunities for American wine. Initially skeptical and snobbish he gradually develops into the endearing hero who rewrites the history of wine for the modern world and in the process rescues the Barrett family from the jaws of failure. Rickman's performance is as close as you can ever get to superb vintage wine.".

It put me more in the mood to drink a good bottle of white with my wife and...well you get the idea. The movie is not without some quirks but I think a noncritic will like it a lot as Freddy Rodriguez says about his wine. It is a feast for the eyes. I can't wait to see it on BluRay!".

It put me more in the mood to drink a good bottle of white with my wife and...well you get the idea. The movie is not without some quirks but I think a noncritic will like it a lot as Freddy Rodriguez says about his wine. It is a feast for the eyes. I can't wait to see it on BluRay!";

Bottle Shock was a delightful playful telling of the story of Chteau Montelena which won the 1976 Paris blind tasting in regards to Chardonnay. There is just enough comic relief to keep viewers happy and the story has its ups and downs keeping the viewer engaged as well. Not to mention this is by all means a star studded feature. Just because you do not see Brad Pitt or George Clooney does not mean this film is lacking in star power. Chris Pine who is now captain James T. Kirk and Bill Pullman he's the guy who always plays our president in blockbuster films e.g. Independence Day do just fine on their own. Throw in Dennis Farina Law and Order and Alan Rickman Snape in Harry Potter and you have more star power that most movies can hope to gather. Long story short the correct cast was billed for the telling of this wonderful event in American history. You do not have to be a wine enthusiast to enjoy this movie.".

	schema:text "    Buddy Affleck has just signed an airline in Chicago as a big client but is ironically delayed at the airport waiting for a flight to LA on that same airline. He meets fellow passenger Greg who opts to be bumped even though it means missing an activity with his older son. When the flight gets resumed Buddy thinks he's doing a good deed by swapping tickets with Greg so he can get home to his son. Sadly the flight crashes. Buddy conspires with his friend the ticket agent that night to take his name off the passenger list and put Greg's on. Once he's back in LA his new client dictates that the company run a series of feelgood ads about the crash. Buddy feels very hypocritical and completely loses it when the commercials win a Cleo. After going through rehab he decides he needs to check on Greg's widow. But he doesn't plan on falling in love with her.";

	schema:reviewBody "Bounce' is an utterly winning romantic drama replete with an intriguing storyline believable characters and honest emotions. Ben Affleck stars as Buddy Amaral an arrogant hotshot advertising exec who in a rare moment of kindness offers his seat on an airplane to a young writer desperate to get home to his wife and kids for the holidays.  When the man dies in a plane crash Buddy is suddenly sent on a mission of soulsearching trying to sort out the complex emotions he is now forced to deal with.  When drinking provides no solution he feels himself compelled to seek out the man's widow Abby played by Gwyneth Paltrow and their two young boys.  Buddy keeps his connection with them a secret as he begins to fall in love with Abby and to become a part of their wounded family.In its bareboned detailing the plot may smack a bit of incredibility and contrivance.  But thanks to expert writing and directing by Don Ross every detail in the film feels just right.  Take the opening scene for instance. Ross gives the chance encounter between the two strangers who will be forever tied together by fate the loose casual and offhanded quality one finds in real life.  Nothing in this film ever seems forced least of all the romantic feelings these two hurt vulnerable and attractive people feel for one another.  In fact it is the complexity of the characters that helps Bounce' to rise above the superficiality of most films in this genre.  In addition to Buddy's characterbuilding we see Abby trying desperately to overcome the bewildering tragedy that has befallen her unsure of how to deal with her own feelings of loss guilt and anger that inevitable arise from such a situation.Affleck and Paltrow bring such an air of thoughtfulness and maturity to their roles that we find ourselves genuinely caught up in their predicament and rooting them on all the way.  It's nice for a change to see a romantic film truly centered on a pair of likable grownups as opposed to the superannuated adolescents we usually find in films of this type.  Here are flawed often weak individuals who nevertheless contain cores of genuine goodness and innate warmheartedness.  The movie also achieves additional depth and weight in its exploration of the vagaries of fate as many of the characters examine the what if' scenarios that haunt anyone caught up in a situation like this one.Bounce' is well written directed and acted.  Even those who don't normally go for love stories should definitely check it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "A tragic brush with fate sets a man on a road to self awareness and discovery that drastically alters his perception of himself and the world in which he lives in Bounce' directed by Don Roos and starring Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow.  In  Chicago on business waiting at the airport for a flight back to L.A. just before Christmas Advertising Execsalesman Buddy Amaral Affleck gives his ticket to a man he's met that evening in the lounge Greg Janello Tony Goldwyn who's just been bumped from his flight. A writer in Chicago for the opening and sadly the closing of one of his plays Janello has a wife Abby Gwyneth Paltrow and two kids waiting for him at home and is grateful for Buddy's apparent random act of kindness. Far from being a benevolent gesture however Buddy's motives are purely selfserving and have to do with another passenger Mimi Natasha Henstridge who's also been bumped and who has been given accommodations for the night by the airline.  It seems that everything has worked out well for all concerned until later that night when the news breaks that the plane carrying Janello has crashed somewhere in Kansas and that there are no survivors.  For Buddy who should have been on that plane it's an awakening and for probably the first time in his life he is forced to look inward.  And he doesn't like what he finds.  His confrontation with the demons within ultimately leads him to Abby Janello and another unexpected turn in his life. Director Roos has created a richly textured drama that is both captivating and credible the story is well written by Roos developed with precision and expertly paced which makes it all entirely believable.  Much more than a simple love story it's about a man forced to confront what he sees in the mirror and how he must cope with what he finds there and about a young woman with two children suddenly widowed who must come to grips with an unsure future while dealing with such a devastating loss.  What follows is an examination of a relationship forged by fate and born of need a fragile precarious situation at best.  And what makes this film so good is the gradual way the relationship between Buddy and Abby is formed neither hurried nor forced with a couple of truly poignant moments along the way. And it all rings true courtesy of a great script Roos directing and the engaging performances of the stars.  Affleck brings real depth to his character and most importantly a sense of true sincerity that makes him real he illuminates Buddy's imperfections to perfection.  And Paltrow is absolutely disarming as Abby gentle and vulnerable to a fault winsomely charming and beautifully played.  Also there is a definite chemistry between Paltrow and Affleck that cannot be denied. The supporting cast includes Jennifer Grey Mrs. Guererro Joe Morton Jim David Paymer Prosecution Lawyer Alex D. Linz Scott and Johnny Galecki.  A touching memorable movie Bounce' is a reflection on the journey of life we all must take and it makes you realize that it's something you have to work at.  It's a film that makes you stop to reconsider choices made in the past while recognizing that in the end perhaps love and happiness is the bonus for doing it right.  I rate this one 910.".

Still at least they let Affleck make a sarcastic comment about the gay guy's role a bit of unexpected but ultimately insufficient irony. Paltrow is annoying Affleck is blah  so nothing new there. He is a weak actor because he is Ben in every movie he plays. Sure Clint Eastwood is Clint in every movie he plays and the same goes for Bronson and some others but with a big difference those guys have charisma i.e. we want to see Clint be Clint and so on but we don't ever want to see Ben be Ben because Ben isn't charismatic but simply a 90s Hollywood brat. In fact I don't want to see Ben Affleck AT ALL. The thing I mentioned earlier about malefemalestar pairingups is getting downright tiresome. There is a list of male and a list of female actresses who are paired up every now and then read far too often for various romantic dramas or romantic comedies that are always based on clichd scripts movies that promise cash once the women and the girls in the audience start taking out those handkerchiefs out usually towards the end of the movie so that they can wet them with their tears of soapoperatic selfdelusion.The men The women George Clooney Michelle Pfeiffer Bruce Willis Salma Hayek Ben Affleck Jennifer Lopez Keanu Reeves Sandra Bullock Matthew MacConaughey Winona Ryder Richard Gere Gwyneth Paltrow Hugh Grant Meg Ryan Tom Hanks Julia Roberts Nicolas Cage Charlize TheronPair up any of these randomly placing them in a movie about onoff love in which usually someone has a terminal illness or someone is from a different social class than the other etc and you can make your own 90s soap movie with very little entertainment or cinematic value. Try it. It's very very easy. You might even get a feeling of dejavu because some of these pairs already made films  with fascinating brilliant results.

She appeared as herself with natural brown hair and no makeup. Most actresses would be too vain for this. I still remember a closeup of Raquel Welch in 'One Million B.C.'. She was playing a cave woman with enough eyeliner and lip gloss to stock a cosmetics counter. Anyway Gwyneth's look was entirely convincing for a harried single working mother.Ben Affleck did alright as the bad 'Buddy' of the film's beginning but didn't sell me as the remorseful 'Buddy' trying to do better and hold on to 'Abby'. Ben and Gwyneth had decent chemistry together so that aspect held up for the length of the film. Ben had slightly less chemistry with the two child actors playing 'Abby's' children. His attachment to them was never quite credible.The director deleted some great material from the film. The scene where 'Mimi' and 'Abby' view the video tape from the Chicago airport meeting of 'Greg' 'Buddy' and 'Mimi' was too powerful to lose. The scene made 'Abby's' rejection of 'Buddy' much more credible.The deleted scene where 'Buddy' meets 'Janice' in Chicago right before they both testify in the trial was profound. 'Buddy' has tried to redeem himself by helping 'Abby' but he has destroyed 'Janice' by convincing her to board 'Greg' in violation of airline rules. 'Janice' faces ruin of her whole life as a result of accommodating 'Buddy'. The scene was deleted to make 'Buddy' a more sympathetic character before the end of the movie. Jennifer Grey gave an outstanding performance here only to have it cut from the final version of the film.Still the film gives a glimpse of the effect our choices can have on the lives of people we may well never meet. Despite the weak spots the film held together. Perhaps a directors cut of the film with the choicest deleted scenes reinstated will be issued.".

Tony Goldwyn is also puts in a small but good performance as Abby's husband Greg Janello. Bounce is an enjoyable film. Don't expect anything to extravagant but you will be satisfied.

They are both great as Buddy Amaral and Abby Janello and have some good chemistry in the film. Well they did used to be couple. Tony Goldwyn is also puts in a small but good performance as Abby's husband Greg Janello. Bounce is an enjoyable film. Don't expect anything to extravagant but you will be satisfied. I give Bounce a 710";

So why is he all broken up over it? They don't even touch on that in the movie. He got super lucky that's all. Woohoo!This is yet further evidence to back up my contention that all bad acting in movies is the director's fault. Always. If you don't like something then shoot it again until you get what you wantor cut it out. In Bounce actors simply can't win when faced with a scene direction like you just learn that your husband is part of a smoking hole in the ground in Kansas. Now get out there and act!Maudlin doesn't even begin to convey how awful some of these scenes are at least for me both Paltrow's grief and Affleck's pain. They are hard to watch. I'm sure even their proud parents can't watch these scenes without wincing.And then there is the story itself which is mindnumbingly stupid and precipitated on the most bizarre coincidence the guy who gave away his ticket in the unlucky death flight just happens to work at the company which handles the crashed airline's PR. What if the wife of the dead guy had been a fat ugly cow? How would his guilt have played out in that uncinematic scenario?".

The film ends with Buddy asking Abby to sell his house for him as they walk towards the ocean and hold hands.The DVD extras are quite interesting. The several gags show the casual interactions of the actors. Of the deleted scenes a particularly funny one was the picnic where the nosy neighbor insists on talking about Abby's settlement and how she should now feel free to spend more money. Abby's putdown at the end of that scene is refreshing.Two other scenes are of particular interest. The writerdirector had a bit of a tough time figuring out how to end this story. Two different endings were shot at the airport one during the day the other at night where Buddy looks up Abby and kids as they are flying to a new home in Portland. However they just didn't work with test audiences which resulted in the quickly added final scene which to me works very well.  It leaves the future open whether Buddy and Abby actually end up together is not important. Of importance is that they each were able to get past the crisis and Buddy has discarded his boyish ways to become a man.Not for a second did my wife or I think this a sappy story. It is a very real story very well presented in this movie. The title comes from a comment made to Abby by her friend regarding her wisdom that after a tragedy like loss of a spouse you have to bounce instead of crashing and dying. I rate this somewhere between a strong 7 or an 8 of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Given Tom Cruise's recent unstable behavior it might be the right time to revisit 'Bowfinger' Steve Martin and Frank Oz's highly underappreciated satire of the side of Hollywood we mere mortals aren't supposed to see.In Hollywood there are no secretseveryone knows who's secretly gay or insane and who's slept with who when where and what they got out of it.

Given Tom Cruise's recent weirdness and the fact that he openly travels with a cadre of Scientologists who function like a Secret Service detail it's not hard to suspect that Kit Ramsey was written with Tom Cruise in mind the role was originally written for Keanu Reeves but was ultimately changed and offered to Murphy.Murphy's presence ironically may have undermined this film in its initial release as audiences many audiences left theaters disappointed having expected more of a traditional slapstick comedy with Murphy in a larger role his scenes are easily the funniest but Kit and Jiff or secondary characters.

	schema:reviewBody "Bowfinger is one of the funniest movies I have seen in years.  It works because it allows the laughs to build from the way the characters play off each other's personalities without becoming puppets of the script.  It is for people who love the movies as well because that's what it's really about how the movie industry works on such unlikely coincidences and how the truly desperate are sometimes successful against their own natures.The movie is basically about a group of folks who want desperately to make a movie to break into the big time.  They are led by Bobby Bowfinger of Bowfinger International Productions a hack film studio in a ramshackle office in an L.A. suburb.  Bowfinger is the right man to head this team he's unscrupulous infinitely resourceful and isn't daunted by the fact that his budget will come from the dollars he saved up each week since he was a kid stashed in a box in his attic.  He collects his film crew from illegal immigrants trying to cross the border.His accountant has just written a script about aliens hiding in raindrops.  Don't ask just watch the movie.  The movie is called Chubby Rain.  Bowfinger wants Hollywood's leading action star Kit Ramsey to play the lead.  As Ramsey Eddie Murphy turns out one of his best performances. Ramsey is wildly egotistical and emotionally unstable to a fault. He is a member of Mind Head one of those many Scientologistlike groups where he goes often to discuss his many insecurities and paranoid fears like that of of course aliens.Naturally Ramsey refuses to be in the picture.  That doesn't stop Bowfinger.  He comes up with a clever if risky idea follow Ramsey around shoot him surreptitiously from a distance using his own actors to play their parts with him without Ramsey's knowledge.  This leads to many very funny scenes in which Ramsey comes to believe his paranoid fantasies about aliens are in fact real while the actors in the movie praise Ramsey's style.Eventually a stunt double is needed for certain scenes and a Ramsey look alike named Jiff is brought on board.  Jiff is an entirely unique character played also by Murphy as a slowwitted innocent with a sheepish grin and a nasal voice.  He is lovable and yet annoying at the same time to Murphy's credit and a great movie character.I liked a lot of things about the movie especially the eye it has for the way Hollywood works.  I really enjoyed a scene early on where Bowfinger stages a phony call with a car phone in a restaurant to create an opportunity to pitch his script to a highpowered executive played by Robert Downey Jr.  Downey is surprised to see the cord dangling from Martin's phone he may not take him seriously but he's not likely to forget meeting him.I also liked the way Ramsey complains to his agent about not having a catch phrase the way white action stars have.  His agent points out a scene where he pushes a guy named Cliff off a cliff.  That's too cerebral for an audience shouts Ramsey.  We're making a movie not a film!  He points out that in the script he is reading the letter k appears a number of times that is exactly divisible by three so KKK appears 486 times!What is best about the movie is the way Bowfinger goes for broke improvising all the way.  He proceeds with a determination fueled by the insane notion that this scheme could actually work.  You have to respect the chutzpah of someone who wants to succeed that badly even if he bends a few rules along the way.".

Jiff is an entirely unique character played also by Murphy as a slowwitted innocent with a sheepish grin and a nasal voice.  He is lovable and yet annoying at the same time to Murphy's credit and a great movie character.I liked a lot of things about the movie especially the eye it has for the way Hollywood works.  I really enjoyed a scene early on where Bowfinger stages a phony call with a car phone in a restaurant to create an opportunity to pitch his script to a highpowered executive played by Robert Downey Jr.  Downey is surprised to see the cord dangling from Martin's phone he may not take him seriously but he's not likely to forget meeting him.I also liked the way Ramsey complains to his agent about not having a catch phrase the way white action stars have.  His agent points out a scene where he pushes a guy named Cliff off a cliff.  That's too cerebral for an audience shouts Ramsey.  We're making a movie not a film!  He points out that in the script he is reading the letter k appears a number of times that is exactly divisible by three so KKK appears 486 times!What is best about the movie is the way Bowfinger goes for broke improvising all the way.  He proceeds with a determination fueled by the insane notion that this scheme could actually work.  You have to respect the chutzpah of someone who wants to succeed that badly even if he bends a few rules along the way.";

Is there an end to this guys talent? i look forward to seeing Nutty Professor 2 soon. Heather Graham was again at her sexy best as Daisy. The other stand out actor for me in this film was Terrence Stamp. Can you remember him from Superman 2? That's right he was General Zod and in Bowfinger he is Terry Stricter Kit's Councillor. His role was also well done.  A final mention to one star but with four legs Mindy aka Betsy who was used perfectly. Animals who star on any movie or TV show have a special talent this dog is no exception. Bowfinger is also a movie within a movie which at any time must be hard to shoot but thanks to Aussie director Frank Oz Bowfinger comes out beautifully. Bowfinger Scores 3.55 Stars or 710.

While the humor is not terribly cerebral there is so much heart in the story and the enthusiasm and love for film shines through. By the end we understand the joy that comes with the filmmaking process. It's one thing to make a brilliant film and to be recognized as a wonderful director but lacking that talent the joy is not decreased by making an average or poor film by overcoming obstacles and producing a piece of work. The biggest weakness in this film is not in the premise or the acting at all  it's in a few touches of the script that make it a little closer to being predictable. Regardless if you can get in touch with the love of film presented a good time is there to be had. If you want your comedies without heart a la American Pie then you'll be bored.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bowfinger' is a very original and instantly likeable comedy spoof that shines among other recent dross to come out of Hollywood. The plot is quite simple. A low budget director must try and cast a popular movie star in his film without him being aware of it. The concept does seem flawed and a little dumb when looking at it but when its on screen it's very entertaining. The film has an excellent comic timing and remains on a consistent pace throughout the film. Luckily it aims for laughs instead of sappy sentimentality. But the film really capitalises on its two lead performers who are accomplished comedians.Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy work as an excellent comic duo and sometimes overshadow the witty material of the movie. The rest of the cast are fun in their roles but this really is Martin and Murphy's movie.I don't think Bowfinger received its full credit and some people misunderstood it. It's a farcical comedy not one to be taken seriously. Yes it is unrealistic but it wasn't attempting to be a classic. What were we expecting? Gone With the Wind!!!!!!Although it's underrated Bowfinger is clever witty and enjoyable. A film that should please all moviegoers. I give it 7.910.".

I'm sort of guessing here that the wannabees awarded it very high marks while the typical Eddie Murphy fans  casual film goers and those people who claim THE MUMMY RETURNS is the greatest film ever  And no I'm not criticising anyones opinions and tastes  would have given it relatively low marks . I'm guessing that it's a possibly a film that unfortunately went above a lot of headsFirst off is the title BOWFINGER . What sort of image does that conjure up ? Possibly a James Bond spoof ala AUSTIN POWERS with lots of slapstick ? If you enjoy that sort of schoolboy humour you'll be very disappointed . Likewise if you're an Eddie Murphy fan because Murphy's dual performance is very restrained here and all the better for it . It also has an opposite effect for people who don't like Eddie Murphy  Or for that matter Steve Martin  very much but are people not keen on either Murphy or Martin going to watch this in the cinema ? I was very happy that the movie did relatively well on its initial release in 1999 because it certainly had the potential to be a flop at the cinema The premise is very simple Film producer Bobby Bowfinger  Martin  has a knock back from Hollywood star Kit Ramsey  Murphy  so Bowfinger decides to secretly film him anyway and edit it into his movie . Thankfully the screenplay of BOWFINGER is developed well enough for maximum comic effect  Bowfinger is making a scifi movie so Kit finds himself facing aliens at one point and yes he genuinely believes they are real aliens . Bobby Bowfinger himself seems to have been based on the infamous Ed Wood while watching Kit attend the MindHead classes one is perhaps reminded of John Travolta or Tom Cruise and I don't care what the critics say  Some of the gags like the scene with the dog in the underground car park are laugh out loud funny without ever going OTT All in all a fairly amusing satirical comedy that enjoys taking pokes at the American film industry and certainly one of the better films that have either starred Martin or Murphy".

This could have been a clichd nightmare of a movie but it works beautifully on all levels. Another great plus is Heather Graham and Jamie Kennedy. Both of these in supporting roles almost threaten to steal the limelight away from the bigger names. Kennedy's character in particular as the shy guy who likes to pretend he knows it all is a brilliant stroke of casting genius. Steve Martin has written a gem of a comedy without the grossout bodypart can this really be happening humor that seems to be the standard of late. Eddie Murphy is equally funny as both Ramsey twins finding new and fresh ways to play paranoid and nerdier.

	schema:reviewBody "Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy team up to bring us this quirky comedy that's short on story but big on laughs.  I attended a press screening of Bowfinger not quite sure what to expect and although I was amused by the silly antics I felt as if the film's main goal was to make a statement or two about Hollywood and what it takes to get a movie made.  First of all while Eddie Murphy is in the film quite a bit this is definitely Steve Martin's movie.  I left the film feeling that Eddie was not much more than funny set dressing rather than being a star.  Martin plays Bobby Bowfinger a washed up film director who gets a script from one of his employees that he feels is great movie material.  He soon realizes that the only way anyone will pick this film up is if he gets a big name star for the lead.  His focus turns to Kit Ramsey played by Murphy who happens to be the hottest star in Hollywood.  But Martin fails to get Ramsey behind the film even though in some ways this is just the kind of script Ramsey wants.  So Bowfinger decides he'll shoot the film's scenes with Ramsey even though Ramsey doesn't realize he's in the shot by having his actors walk up to him in public and say their lines as if they're playing out the scene.  This works for a while but soon Ramsey gets freaked out by all the strange behavior and hides with his friends at the manipulative Scientologylike center which is headed by Terance Stamp.  In the meantime Heather Graham's character a struggling actress begins to sleep with every member of Bowfinger's crew including Bowfinger in an attempt to increase the length of her scenes.  With Ramsey in hiding Bobby casts a lookalike to fill in for his scenes only this guy portrayed as the ultimate nerd by Murphy can barely stand still much less play his scenes.  The movie goes from one silly scenario to another without having much direction with the story all the while keeping the audience amused.  But I got the feeling I had seen all this before with Tim Burton's Ed Wood and once I reached the end of the film I knew I had.  So in closing there's nothing really new here and not a lot of story to analyze but plenty of laughs.  Bowfinger is an amusing and entertaining comedy but I can't help but feel that it falls short of it's true potential.  Not a bad film but not a great one either.".

Viewing it is a pure magical experience and the unique thing is that for every viewing I have found something I didn't find before. Always something great. Maybe this is the reason it is so underrated because there is so much to discover about this film that actually requires a second or even third viewing. Tom Dicillo's follow up to Living in Oblivion has Turturro playing Al Fountain a strict by the books engineer who as one character says goes through life like a robot.  He doesn't know how to enjoy life and is lost in a world of clockwork.  But everything is about to change when he meets a freespirit named Bucky AKA Kid played by Sam Rockwell who gives the performance of his career.  They learn from each other and discover before unseen elements of life. It succeeds on many levels but most importantly has such a rich multilayered character study.  This includes its characters' sprititual growth maybe even without finding God yet as the film suggestsself discovery and setting loose of life's boundaries and morals. There are excellent performances all around notably Rockwell and Turturro and Katherine Keener. Not to mention Dicillo's brilliant writingdirection and outstanding cinematography and music.".

But his advantage over his peers is that his works are permeated with a genuine and very winning romanticism realized best in Real Blonde.The premise of Box of Moonlight is indeed a romantic one. Two complete opposites who by all accounts would steer clear of each other are instinctively drawn together when destiny wills a chance encounter. They will learn important life lessons from each other and part the richer. It is in effect a delightful spin on the buddy movie.John Turturro and Sam Rockwell are the least likely buddies one could imagine. Turturro plays the rigid time obsessive and orderly engineer against Rockwell's wild irresponsible back to nature outcast. Turturro's Al Fountain senses much is not well in his life and subconsciously perceives that Rockwell's The Kid might just be what he is so much in need of someone to release those parts of his personality which adulthood and its encumbering responsibilities has suffocated. The Kid indeed accomplishes this in a variety of ways including coaxing Al to reach his inner child in the wonderful tomato throwing scene and luring him into an touching adolescent one night stand with Floatie played beautifully by Catherine Keener a DiCillo favorite. By the end of the movie Al will return home a far better husband and father.Just how Rockwell's The Kid will be effected is less clear. He is clearly a severely deluded character functioning more as a symbol rather than a credible person. In lesser hands it could have come off ludicrous but Rockwell nails it perfectly in what would be his break through role. There's a palpable chemistry between the buddies which is so vital for making this story work.Box of Moonlight is a modern day fable a cautionary tale reminding us not to allow adulthood smother us. It's a tale told with tremendous charm and a movie to be cherished.".

	schema:reviewBody "We first meet Al Fountain John Turturro at a remote construction site in the country where he is the foreman. Immediately we recognize who and what he is The Boss obsessive and meticulous about the work tenacious in regard to detail. At the same time it is obvious that he is sorely lacking when it comes to his relationship with his crew. Not that he is a bad guy neither overbearing nor abusive with his employees he is in fact somewhat personable in his own way. It's just that everything in his vision is so clearly cut in black and white. In the world of Al Fountain there are absolutely no shades of gray. This is further established when he phones his wife and young son to check in and give her an update on the job. When he tells her that one of the guys has invited him to play poker that night much to the chagrin of the rest of the crew she is ecstatic and encourages him to go. Clearly she loves him but knows how he is. When he quizzes his son on his multiplication tables and the response is unacceptable flash cards are ordered. When Dad gets home there will be another quiz. In a brilliant metaphor we see the flash cards as they are perceived by the boy they are huge nearly as big as he is Marley's chains he must carry wherever he goes without respite. When the job is abruptly closed down Al finds himself with some time to reflect on his life which he uncharacteristically embraces prompted by an incident at the poker game the previous evening. At this point the story really begins and we follow Al on a drive through the country which ultimately becomes a journey of selfdiscovery. Along the way he meets 'The Kid' Sam Rockwell a charismatic though somewhat naive young man who lives alone in the remnants of a trailer situated on a secluded parcel of land far off the beaten path. It is a lifestyle that Al initially simply cannot comprehend. When The Kid explains that he lives 'off the grid' it is beyond anything Al can fathom. In the end this movie is a textured tale of awareness and the importance of setting one's personal priorities. Extremely well presented and acted it is touching and poignant without the unnecessary burden in this case of undue sentiment. The supporting cast includes Catherine Keener Lisa Blount Annie Corley and Dermot Mulroney. In 'Box of Moonlight' writerdirector Tom DiCillo offers us a journey that is well worth the taking. I rate this one 910".

Because of this his workers make fun of him and his little boy is a little intimidated.Once Al gets to the boonies the work contract is cancelled.  Al decides to try and find a lake he went to as a kid.  This is the jest of the whole movie for me.  Al realizes he is acting too adultlike and wants to find the innerkid in himself.  I think we can all relate to this on some level.I won't ruin the whole movie because you REALLY need to see it but by accident Al meets Bucky the Kid and remembers what it is like to be carefree and childlike.  I think in turn that helps him with his familly life.  Kudos to John Turturro and Sam Rockwell for their roles in this movie!".

It was honesty that led him to show Sam Rockwell frontal nudity instead of  typically  stripping the women. But this led to an R rating and may have been a box office turnoff.

I think you have to be the right kind of person to watch this film someone who likes to watch something that can really happen and how people find moments of epiphany in very simple acts and objects. Like the Box of Moon Light life is what you make it you can see the box full of something or think catching moonlight in a box is stupid but that means that are two kinds of folk out there.The characters are interesting as the main character tries to find a lake area he once had fun at as a child. He finds the lake polluted and as he leaves he helps a guy with his car and then the adventure starts. The director has a way of making the normal seem quirky and I enjoy that.The video box on this one is a bit misleading though and says it is a romantic comedy. It is more of a road picture with much road. It is more about The Kid and Al's friendship than it is about Floaty and other romantic interests. Plus I don't think Catherine Keener or Dermot Mulroney clocked in enough scene time to be on the box when Sam Rockwell wasn't. The movie up to the last 10 minutes or so is about Al and The Kid.Or yeah and I kept laughing myself silly seeing those huge flash cards Al's son has. He tells him to get some flash cards and they are HUGE. I was like wow those are some insanely large cards you got there son!Little things like that the deer in the car with Al Doris the key lady etc make the film very charming. Worth a few watches as are all of DiCillo's movies. 910 for me.".

On the higher level it made me think about society and how the simple things in life are great.  One does not need to be an electrical engineer and have the big career to be happy. Things about life can be learned from the simple people that are out there and eyes can be opened spiritually.  We really need to keep spirituality alive and the Indians that still live on the land in the u.s. still have things to teach that people in complex city life can become oblivious to.  Just as those out in the woods become oblivious to what a city slicker thinks are important in life.  In the end when the two intersect both characters gain a lot of insight and the viewer has an open invitation to procure insight and facilitate wisdom as well.A very charming delightful and entertaining movie to watch!".

I found myself enjoying a very subtle lighthearted film about a man John Turturro struggling with a midlife crisis and eventually liberating himself from the normal stiff clockwork persona he had become. Sam Rockwell gives a great performance as Kid and Catherine Keener is wonderful as the simple southern girl a 180 degree turn from her role in Being John Malkovich. Turturro is excellent as Al and you can feel the emotions he is having during his transformation. Everyone should be able to relate to his disappointment when he returns to the fictional Splatchee Lake only to see that it is no longer what he remembers. You begin to understand how much he needs someone like Kid to break him free from the life that he so obviously loathes but not until the final scene do you understand how much Kid needed him to stick around and be his friend maybe Kid wasn't as slowwitted as we were made to believe?.

I only saw the last half of it on IFC by accident while aimlessly channel surfing this afternoon. I knew in 2 seconds that this was one of the best movies I'd ever seen. In fact when I went online and was bummed to see that it wouldn't replay again on my satellite before the end of the year I just bought the DVD and the Lawn Dogs DVD too on the spot.I guess as a contract systems admin I'm sometimes a little too much like Al Fountain for my own good. I'm more aware of the problem than Al was at least before his big weekend. The terrific character development and very observant line made it so easy to completely bathe in this film and actually feel it as it progressed. I was charmed by this film and will definitely focus on some other Tom DiCillo films.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's interesting how different people can look at the same thing and come away with such diverse reactions. I decided to watch this based on the many positive comments I had read. Unfortunately I cannot pitch my tent in that camp since this movie never engaged me.John Turturro plays Al Fountain an uptight electrical engineer who is away from home and in charge of a construction crew somewhere in the southeast US. When Al catches his crew having some fun fifteen minutes before knocking off for the day he instructs them to get back to work. The sight of Tutturro in a hard hat being taken seriously by a bunch of burly construction workers should have alerted me that this movie was going to be part fantasy and that turned out to be the case. The first part of the movie is spent in showing us what a nerd Al is. A closet full of neatly hung white shirts and dark pants nightly calls home at precisely 900 PM an inability to get along with ordinary people stilted phone conversations with his wife and son and so forth. Obviously Al needs to be shown how to loosen up a bit and appreciate the wondrous variety of experience and sure enough Al meets just the right person to introduce him to more abundant living The Kid. The Kid Sam Rockwell in buckskins is a rifletoting young lad wearing a coonskin hat who deals in selling such items as plastic deer and garden gnomes. Through a sequence of unlikely events Al winds up staying at The Kid's housea facing wall opening onto an openair courtyard that is lighted like it is decorated for a large Christmas party. The Kid frequently comments that he is off the grid so how he powered his lights and television puzzled me. There are elements of pure fantasy such as Al's seeing things in reverse like water being poured into a glass or a kid riding a bicycle. Why these irrelevant scenes were in there escaped me. In the director's commentary he remarks that these scenes were filmed by running the sequences backward. Who would have imagined that? I realize that questioning the believability of anything here is not to accept what I perceive is meant to be quirky whimsy. But I could not accept the absurdities presented.And what are the rewards of living a more carefree life? Such things as shooting out expensive window glass jumping into lakes naked cheating on your wife shooting holes in tubs of paint getting beat up while others stand around watching helplessly eating crushed Oreo cookies and milk for breakfast and so forth. Is an argument being made here for the value of being a nerd and staying a nerd?".

	schema:headline " Middling entry in a series";
	schema:reviewBody "Continuing in the tradition of previous Germanmade westerns based on the books of Karl May this later entry can't hold a candle to earlier films such as The Treasure of Silver Lake.  This one has Granger as leading man and though he has occasional moments of wit and presence for the most part he isn't interesting enough to carry the film.  He is joined as in most all of these films by Brice as Apache Chief Winnetou.  The chemistry between the two doesn't quite match that of Brice and Granger's predecessor Lex Barker who played a different character but the roles are very similar. The plot involves Granger and Brice setting out to discover who murdered a frontier mother and daughter.  The surviving father blames the Indians while Brice feels that it was a gang of thieves called The Vultures they certainly don't SOUND like a very friendly band of men!  In the mix is Sommer who is en route to see her father and is wearing a belt filled with gold.  The son of the murdered family George finds himself falling for her as he investigates the murders along with Granger and Brice.  Their adventures take them across various terrain and eventually alongside a wagon train which is beset by infiltrating bandits.  This film lacks the grandeur and the production values of earlier films in the series.  The lighting is about the worst that can be without having everyone completely in the dark. There is some unintentional humor as in seeing Sommer's extreme bubble bouffant hairdo in an old west setting and the usual hilarity that results from the awful dubbing Why do these oldfashioned vocal dubbers always sound like they smoke 4 packs of cigarettes a day?  Most fun is seeing George bounce all over the place as if he has springs in his boots.  No American western ever had anyone quite so gymnastic in his approach to action scenes.  Also note that perhaps due to a European sensibility the men in these films seem to touch each other so much more often than in American westerns.  Look for it it's really unusual.  The film just seems to have a deadening pall over it for some reason.  It does not have the style energy or vividness of the earlier works.  It comes to life briefly during a pretty rousing circle the wagons stand off and an interlude at an Indian camp at which Granger has to prove his word to a disbelieving and hilariously bulked up chief.  It's an okay movie to see once but has no real lasting impact.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unter Geiernon The vultures is an exciting Western that contains adventures  action  crossfire and gorgeous Yugoslavian exteriors magnificently photographed and in which takes place the emotive meeting between and Winnetou Pierre Brice and Old Surehand Stewart Granger replacing to Old Shatterhand Lex Barker . This is a thrilling and stirring adventure based on Karl May novel with two agreeable characters as Old Surehand and Winnetou  being stunningly played by Stewart Granger as an expert scout and Pierre Brice as an Apache chief respectively . Old Surehand and Winnetou investigate the murders of a mother and daughter at Bouman's ranch . The surviving husband named Bouman Walter Barnes and his son Gotz George think that the family was killed by Soshons Indians but Old Surehand suspects that it was carried out by a band of gold thieves known as The Vultures . Old Surehand Stewart Granger helped by Winnetou Pierre Brice set out on pursuit of the bandits who disguise themselves as Indians while committing their crimes and both of whom prepare them a trap  but they get escape . Meanwhile  the desperado outlaws attack an Indian cemetery located at Valley of Death . Later on  they besiege a wagon caravan . At the end takes place a moving epilogue by shooting and fighting with no much sense . In successive episodes Old Surehand and his faithful halfbrother Winnetou are ready on the trail to undertake new and risked adventures.This is an acceptable episode about one of the series of popular German made Western  featuring the intimate duo formed by valiant Old Surehand who agrees to guide the revolt against outlaws located at Indian territory and immortal Winnetou  both of them will repeat their same notorious roles as dignified as always . Highlights of the movie are the spectacular attack at Indian graveyard and the impressive bandit raid on the caravan . This enjoyable saga benefits from sensational adventures  shootouts  action  emotion  largerthanlife characters and spectacular scenarios shot in Roski falls CCCAtelier Spandau BerlinGrobnicko Polje Croatia  Krka Falls Krka National Park Paklenica Canyon Paklenica National Park Croatia  Perucko reservoir Tolove Grede mountain Vrlika Yugoslavia . The immutable and incombustible WinnetouPierre Brice plays  as usual his excellent and unforgettable role to be continued in a TV series. Lex Barker scored especially high marks  though he played as a serious and intelligent man who joins forces with Winnetou  while Stewart Granger as Old Surehand performs with humor and joy  he's the perfect counterpoint to Winnetou . Enjoyable relationship between Old SurehandStewart Granger and WinnetouPierre Brice is quite match . The highbrow Lex Barker played the most part of series  Apache gold1963 by Harald Reinl Apaches last Battle1964 by Hugo Fregonese Last of renegades1964 The desperate trail being succeeded by Stewart Granger  Old Surehand 1965 directed by Alfred Vohrer Rampage at Apache Wells or Der Olprinz by Harald Philipp . Stewart Granger as Old Surehand took the role in three occasions he starred a diverse character but the role is pretty similar to Old Shatterland  he plays with mirth and liking manner but in ironic tone  almost parody style  as Among vultures and Winnetou and Surehand .Besides Rod Cameron starred only one  Old Firehand in which chemistry between stuffy Cameron and Brice is inexistent . This time the support cast is excellent such as Gtz George as Martin Baumann Jr.  the gorgeous Elke Sommer The prize as Annie Dillman  Sieghardt Rupp For a fistful of dollars as Preston  Walter Barnes who worked in lots of Spaghetti as Martin Baumann Sr.  the Italian Renato Baldini as Judge George Leader  Terence Hill future Trinity as Baker Jr and Gojko Mitic who was one of the most famous and most loved actors in East Germany and in the other countries in Eastern Europe  and starred several roles as an Indian rebel . The film displays a colorful cinematography and a catching  sensitive musical score by Martin Bottcher  series' ordinary  and achieved superretails  being eventually replaced in some episode by Peter Thomas . The motion picture produced by Rialto Productions by producer Wendlandt who was subsequently succeeded by Arthur Brauner was professionally directed by Alfred Vohrer who directed various Karl May episodes and was a German thriller expert called Krimi  Edward Wallace adaptation . Rating  6  acceptable and passable . Worthwhile seeing for marvelous scenarios and breathtaking outdoors from Yugoslavia including rousing falls  canyon rivers and mountains all of them as spectacular as Almeria Spain outdoors where at the same time were shot numerous European Western .".

Stewart Granger as Old Surehand took the role in three occasions he starred a diverse character but the role is pretty similar to Old Shatterland  he plays with mirth and liking manner but in ironic tone  almost parody style  as Among vultures and Winnetou and Surehand .Besides Rod Cameron starred only one  Old Firehand in which chemistry between stuffy Cameron and Brice is inexistent . This time the support cast is excellent such as Gtz George as Martin Baumann Jr.  the gorgeous Elke Sommer The prize as Annie Dillman  Sieghardt Rupp For a fistful of dollars as Preston  Walter Barnes who worked in lots of Spaghetti as Martin Baumann Sr.  the Italian Renato Baldini as Judge George Leader  Terence Hill future Trinity as Baker Jr and Gojko Mitic who was one of the most famous and most loved actors in East Germany and in the other countries in Eastern Europe  and starred several roles as an Indian rebel . The film displays a colorful cinematography and a catching  sensitive musical score by Martin Bottcher  series' ordinary  and achieved superretails  being eventually replaced in some episode by Peter Thomas . The motion picture produced by Rialto Productions by producer Wendlandt who was subsequently succeeded by Arthur Brauner was professionally directed by Alfred Vohrer who directed various Karl May episodes and was a German thriller expert called Krimi  Edward Wallace adaptation . Rating  6  acceptable and passable . Worthwhile seeing for marvelous scenarios and breathtaking outdoors from Yugoslavia including rousing falls  canyon rivers and mountains all of them as spectacular as Almeria Spain outdoors where at the same time were shot numerous European Western .";

	schema:reviewBody "As another commenter said this is pure fantasy in a Western setting. If you're looking for the gritty realism of a Spaghetti Western or an American Western from the Peckinpah era this is definitely not your cup of tea.For one thing everyone is so clean  even the Vulture Gang whom you'd naturally expect to have less exacting standards of personal hygiene.In many ways these Bratwurst Westerns seem like throwbacks to an earlier style namely the 1930s brand of American horse opera. Except that in the Old Surehand series the Native Americans are portrayed to an almost ridiculous degree as misunderstood Noble Savages. Which is somewhat of an improvement over depicting them as mindless bloodthirsty savages but neither approach corresponds very closely to the reality. What's really disconcerting about the English language dub of the film is that someone else does Stewart Granger's voice. Which is a pity because much of Granger's charm and presence as an actor resided in that inimitable bass growl. I wonder why they couldn't get him to do his own dubbing  I'd have given this one an extra star just for that.But it doesn't look as though the production values were skimped when it came to the costuming and props and the cinematography is occasionally breathtaking. If possible you should try to catch this in letterbox format just for the gorgeous scenery. The action sequences come off fairly well too and the bad guys are appropriately villainous.Overall I can think of many worse ways to spend an hourandahalf.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unter Geiern or Frontier Hellcat or Amongst Vultures is a Germanlanguage movie from over 50 years ago and one of many installments to the pretty successful Karl May western series. German audiences really loved it back then. The film was coproduced by a handful other countries such as Yugoslavia which results in several actors from this country in the cast mostly the bad guys. The director is Alfred Vohrer and he was one of West Germany's most successful filmmakers from that era and worked on many other prestigious projects also several other Winnetou films. Now I keep calling them Winnetou films but if you know a bit about the franchise you will realize that this is not entirely true for this one here. Yes Pierre Brice's Indian character does appear on some occasions in these slightly under 100 minutes but he is far from a lead compared to the films that carry his name in the title.And I personally believe this is a good thing. The franchise's biggest star may also be his biggest weakness. Brice offers very little in terms of range body language and face expressions in my opinion so the fact that he does not have that much screen time is actually a pleasant change. Still unfortunately his few moments are still fairly embarrassing like the killing at the very end or when he comes to the rescue with his tribe a couple minutes earlier. I guess they really wanted to make sure we don't forget who the big star is. I wish I could. Lex Barker is also not in this one but instead of his Old Shatterhand we get a good dose of Old Surehand. Terence Hill before stardom next to Bud Spencer has a couple scenes too but it is all fairly minor. What is not minor is Gtz George's performance. He is the lead actor in this one and he shows that he is ready to carry films on his own what he did so many times during his long career. Now it is more than half a century later and he is still extremely wellknown here in Germany. And then there is Elke Sommer well she was pretty forgettable but they needed a major female character and for that purpose I agree with her inclusion.All in all mostly thanks to George this was a decent watch. Yes there are weaknesses such as Sommer's acting Winnetou's inclusions the overthetop acting especially the theatrical dying scenes but i dare say the good outweighs the bad in this one. The villains are interesting and the false prophet made a nice main? antagonist. If anybody is interested in starting to watch this series and does not want to take the chronological approach I believe this is a good movie to start with. I give it a thumbs up.".

	schema:headline " East Berlin in the 1960s";
	schema:reviewBody "Boxhagener Platz is a German 100minute movie from 6 years ago that gives us an insight into the GDR back in the 1960s. The director is Matti Geschonneck semifamous here in Germany and he also adapted Torsten Schulz' novel together with the author of the novel himself. The movie scored several awards nominations including a German Film Award nomination for Meret Becker in the Supporting Actress category. Still I have to say I am a bit surprised that Gudrun Ritter and Michael Gwisdek did not get any not because they were that brilliant but because their characters were very baity. Anyway they weren't bad either. Their performances and the film in general are overall okay to watch even if there are occasional problems. For example sometimes it did not really feel as if I was watching authentic characters but just performances.All in all the filmmaker's intention here was certainly to make audiences aware of how bad and manipulative the GDR system really was. Is it propaganda? I am not sure. It certainly is very overthetop often as it feels too many people were arrested in here and it does not seem realistic. It happened but not with that frequency. Still in its best moments this one here is certainly a film worth watching. The acting was solid overall and it was also fun to see Jrgen Vogel in a supporting performance for once and he still makes something good out of it. Geschonneck and Schulz could have toned it down on the degree of how much they despise the GDR as subtlety is sometimes more rewarding. Nonetheless the overall impression was positive and I recommend Boxhagener Platz. Lots of drama in here and comedy if if the Berliner Schnauze style especially by the two older lead actors will not appeal to everybody. Thumbs up.".

	onyx:emotionText "Boxhagener Platz is a German 100minute movie from 6 years ago that gives us an insight into the GDR back in the 1960s. The director is Matti Geschonneck semifamous here in Germany and he also adapted Torsten Schulz' novel together with the author of the novel himself. The movie scored several awards nominations including a German Film Award nomination for Meret Becker in the Supporting Actress category. Still I have to say I am a bit surprised that Gudrun Ritter and Michael Gwisdek did not get any not because they were that brilliant but because their characters were very baity.

After seeing Sherilyn Fenn in Just Write recently it rekindled my interest in Helena. This movie was written and directed by David Lynch's daughter only 24 so considering all that I suppose it isn't such a bad film. But not real good either just interesting.some SPOILERS  Fenn plays a beautiful bad girl bitch and a young surgeon with whom she had a brief affair is obsessed with her. She doesn't want anything more to do with him but his attraction is so obsessive he won't take no for an answer. He even climbs a tree at her house and watches her with her lover played by Bill Paxton before he became a star two years later in Apollo 13.  Lured to her house to retrieve her address book left there at a party she is running away and gets hit by a pickup. The rest of the film we see his obsession carried out imprisoning her amputating first her damaged legs then her arms all the while obsessing over her while he quit his job at the hospital.However as we find out at the very end everything after the truck hit her was a dream of his.  He had actually called an ambulance she had undergone surgery he had been sleeping down the hall he hears a voice Doctor are you back with us. We learn nothing more about what happens to him or to her. All of which makes the film kind of fall flat like a punctured souffle'.  When you then think back on what you saw and realize it was all a dream arising from his obsession with her you think So what?  I didn't expect Boxing Helena to be a very good movie still I was expecting something more.It is noteworthy that this first movie of Lynch's daughter is thus far also her last.".

Surprisingly none of the commentators seem to have gotten the gist of it although this is not too difficult to grasp given that the symbolism while occasionally complex is not that obscure. A couple of brief tips should help. Venus Marion for the obtuse this is only apparent at the very end and Helena Venus. The three scenes in which Marion appears two of them nude or seminude are a give away as is Helena's reference to Nick as a little boy confirmed by his behavior. The only mystery in this absorbing study of incestuous obsession is whether Nick and Marion actually did the deed. And the answer comes in the latter part of the dream when Helena teaches Nick on whom she have finally taken pity how a woman ought to be properly loved. Nick's real life love interests are a disarticulation of Marion with Anne representing her loving side and very similar in physical appearance while Helena wonderfully played by Sherilyn Fenn is the bitchy slutty yet ultimately redeeming side. The storyline recounts how Nick copes with the loss of Marion after her death not very well but there is no resolution of the problem. Once you've gotten the basics though it's fascinating to see how elegantly and delicately this psychodeviation is treated. Nothing is superfluous and everything fits. Even the dream which is part fantasy part reality part prophecy. The film is not a masterpiece but it is very well done. See it again with the correct perspective.".

None of these phrases seems to capture my appreciation for  the film.  The overwhelming numbers of negative reviews do not intimidate me. I'm  not afraid to be the only one who likes something While I was  listening to the likes of Television The Ramones and Iggy Pop back in  the day everybody else my age was into metal disco or 'classic rock.'  I was so out of touch!   Madonna and Kim Basinger saw the script and bailed. Kim even  sacrificed 8M and crippled her career rather than appear in such a  turkey.  Director Jennifer Lynch was doing a poor imitation of her  father the great David.  The imagery was sledgehammer obvious  'Hmm...I wonder if Little Boy will grow up resenting his parents?'   The ending sucked.  I don't know why Kim and Madonna bailed and I don't care. James Caan  bailed on several successful movies including Kramer vs. Kramer.  Attractive as they are they could only wish to be able to do what  Sherilyn Fenn did with the part. The combination of fierce  independence courage bluntness and irresistibility of Helena was  Fenn's alone to depict.  'Boxing Helena' is certainly not for everyone. I think that anyone who  suspects that a friend is going off of the deep end over a romance  should arrange a viewing. My take is that the plot line portrays an  obsession taken to its logical conclusion.  The childhood flashbacks the piteous groveling by the perpetrator and  the mercilessly accurate assessments by the captive demonstrate the  true nature of obsession It has very little to do with love or even  the desire's object. It is about an unhealthy perspective of self and  world.  I don't give a damn about whether a film is 'derivative' or  'predictable' is it watchable? Sex or good food is predictable too  what's your point? I don't know if Jennifer Lynch was imitating her  father. I think that those who compared the two were prejudicing  themselves.  Some of you liked most of the film except the ending but I did. I  think that having lived an obsession in the safety of a dream Nick got  a second chance to 'wakeup' and back away. Otherwise it would have  been just an elaborate slasher flick which is all some shallow  reviewers got out of it. Most movies could have been done better. This  one gets the point across nicely.

She tries to escape and like a Venus of Milo Nick removes her two arms and keeps her hold to a wheelchair. A surprising end finishes the story. Boxing Helena is a polemic sick weird and bizarre love story. But also it is very well produced and has an unconventional screenplay. It is not a masterpiece but it is not so bad it is indicated to a very specific audience. However it became famous when Kim Bassinger refused the role of Helena after signing a contract with the producers. Due to the notoriety of this problem this movie hit the wrong targetpublic. Everybody wanted to watch the film Kim Bassinger refused to act. The beauty of Sherilyn Fenn is amazingly highlighted in this film performing a bitchy woman. The director Jennifer Chambers Lynch is the daughter of David Lynch and tried to follow her father's steps with a very bizarre film. Unfortunately this was her unique movie. In my opinion the 'IMDB User Rating' of 3.8 is very unfair. My vote is seven. Title Brazil 'Encaixotando Helena' 'Boxing Helena'Note On 01 April 2014 I saw this movie again.".

I found myself screaming at my television  Get over it you loser!!!!The worst thing about the movie was how you were hoping that you would see something scary and twisted. Instead you got artsyfartsy pseudopsycho babble.Bill Paxton was another notable flaw in this stale movie. His acting was horrible. He looked unwashed and unappealing. His performance came off as naive uninspired and total phoney.In the end the movie was too onenote bland and soap opera like. Gosh no wonder Kim Basinger dropped out of this picture!I give this movie a 5 out of a possible 100!".

Helena's speech about what women enjoy though explicit is also accurate. Male viewers should take notes. I know I did.And then there are people who say Jennifer is just trying to imitate her father. That's just plain unfair and it shows a lack of anything substantive to critique. Shame on them too.Sure we have to put up with Julian Sands but he's perfect in the part.

Cinematography is flat At least Lynch could have learned something from her dad.The characters are like cardboard cutouts. Sherilyn Fenn is very beautiful but her acting here is not impressive mostly because of the awful writing. Julian Sands is atrocious. No wonder he's never offered a decent role.

	schema:reviewBody "TREASURE OF THE AZTECS 1965 is a GermanItalian western based on a novel by Germany's famed western novelist Karl May whose fanciful view of the American west spawned a whole series of movies including several starring former Tarzan 194953 Lex Barker who is seen here in the role of Dr. Sternau. Barker who was for a time the most popular movie star in Germany is directed here by old Hollywood hand Robert Siodmak wellknown for a career which included such film noir classics as PHANTOM LADY THE KILLERS and CRISS CROSS.Set in Mexico at the time of the American Civil War TREASURE details Dr. Sternau's efforts to obtain financial support for deposed president Benito Juarez's efforts to overthrow Emperor Maximilian installed as Mexico's ruler by the French government. A host of characters is involved including one of Juarez's treacherous captains Rik Battaglia a wealthy landowner sympathetic to Juarez's cause Friedrich Ledebur the landowner's wastrel son Gerard Barray Kara an Aztec princess Theresa Lorca who holds the key to a source of Aztec wealth a Bavarian clockmaker serving as comic relief Ralf Wolter and an American cowboy American actor Kelo Henderson assisting Dr. Sternau. Various parties are trying to get their hands on a cache of hidden Aztec gold either for themselves or for the cause and there is constant backandforth motionbattles between one faction and another duels and fistfights and the wastrel son's romancing of the Indian princess in a bid to learn the whereabouts of the treasure. It all culminates in a freeforall inside a Mexican pyramid and a search for the gold inside an active volcano.Plot and characterization tend to get lost amidst all this activity and one can enjoy the Spanish and Yugoslavian landscapes where this was filmed while lamenting the lack of any reason to care too much about what happens. The film is ultimately undone by awkward fight scenes Bmovie plotting and a subpar English dub job. The production was originally planned as a threehour epic and then released in two parts with the second installment titled PYRAMID OF THE SUN GOD 1965 with the same cast and crew. For the American release version however both films were compressed into one 105minute feature accounting for the choppy editing and continuity lapses in the print available for review. The VHS edition distributed in the U.S. also has serious soundtrack problems with the English dub track laid down twice but seriously out of sync so that every line of dialogue sounds like someone's offcamera repeating each line a beat later.The Indians on view look nothing like the actual Indian tribes of Mexico but are decked out in war paint and headbands adorned with feathers. When we first see them they've got two darkhaired beauties one of them the Aztec princess tied to a stake while the Indian braves dance around in a circle. Sternau and his party of three come and rescue the women from dozens of braves without suffering a scratch.As a GermanItalian western directed by a German director who'd excelled in Hollywood with a FrenchItalianSpanishGerman cast headed by an American star and shot in Spain and Yugoslavia it is not without interest for those Eurocult fans curious about such hybrids. It's got an odd tone about it not quite stylized enough to compare with Italian westerns but a bit too cartoonish to be taken seriously as a western. It's probably closer in spirit to the cliffhanger serials of old than to any classic westerns. This is particularly evident in the preposterous but actionpacked finale. The bombastic music score deliberately recalls certain wellknown Hollywood western scores.Of special note is the participation of Hollywood actor Jeff Corey in the role of President Abraham Lincoln in a brief scene with Dr. Sternau at the beginning. Corey had worked for Siodmak back in 1946 in THE KILLERS. Neither Corey nor Barker dub their own voices on the English track. Barker had previously worked for Siodmak in the Germanproduced THE SHOOT 1964. Fausto Tozzi plays Benito Juarez and offers a striking resemblance to the great Mexican leader.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a 50year old western movie starring Lex Barker and in the later years of his career he actually starred in quite a few German films. There is lots of cowboy and Indian action in here but that is a bit of a given looking at how this is adapted from a Karl May novel. It took no less than 4 writers to adapt this piece and for that the outcome is a bit weak. The director is Robert Siodmak actually one of Germany's more known directors in Hollywood. He also has a nomination for directing and also scored a nomination in the Foreign Language Film category. He worked with Lancaster Gardner de Havilland Peck Stanwyck and Lollobrigida to name only a few.I thought this film didn't start too bad but I have to say the action wasn't good enough to keep me interested for 100 minutes or even for 50 minutes. The drama is fine occasionally but the storyline from very early with the girl and her mentor telling her who to marry completely disappears until near the end. There's a Swiss guy in here obviously for comedy reasons but his shtick got old so quickly and soon stopped being funny. Also the way he was such a brave fighter at the end was truly unrealistic. The thing I was most disappointed with was probably the way the characters were written. There is really only good and evil black and white nothing inbetween. No shades at all. This is really only a film for hardcore western film lovers. Everybody else should give it a pass. But if you enjoyed it take a look at its sequel which came out only roughly 50 days after this film here.".

Winnetou was far from new to film at this point so they tried to establish major supporting players next to him like Old Shatterhand in the past. The title character Apanatschi is the best example for this new trend. It was a bit of a breakthrough role for German actress Uschi Glas. But sadly there is little to her performance in here apart from her stunning looks. And what is there to say about Winnetou himself. I can only repeat myself writing that I do not believe Pierre Brice was the right choice for the character. He definitely fits physically but he simply does not have enough range and looks extremely pale next to Lex Barker for example who is a good actor at best too not a great one. The result is that you really need to try to focus on stories landscapes and costumes in order to enjoy these Karl May movies from 1960s Germany. But this is difficult enough as the stories are also really mediocre for the most part. Is it May's fault or do you have to blame the one who adapted the material Fred Denger in this case? I cannot be a judge on that as I have not read the novels. However the outcome of this Harald Philipp is once again style over substance like it is the case for many other Karl May films. Not recommended.".

But as for the amount of gore that definitely deserves a 10 out of 10 not only is the tractor kill scene the best gore i've seen in a zombie movie ever it was stomach churning as well as funny. As for the comment i have just read bout it not being a very good teen horror movie thats just wrong yes not a good teen horror movie but thats because its not one its a comedy and its not meant to scare the hell out of you and make you jump every five seconds. Anyway definitely another good zombie film from this area of the world definitely deserves to be up there with Shaun of the dead and 28days later!".

After reading that description I'm sure those of you who are looking for a serious zombie movie are already going to look for something else. For those who are still reading Boy Eats Girl was a hilarious horrorcomedy treat with  gasp!  a sweet side!! As the film begins our high school hero Nathan has already got enough problems  being bullied by the jocks abused on the rugby field  but when he accidentally misses a chance to tell his long time friend Jessica how he really feels about her he goes home and hangs himself. Reawakening the next morning after a last minute rescue by his mother Nathan begins to notice some errrr changes in his body chief among them the urge to munch on human flesh. Turns out Mom used a voodoo spell book borrowed from the local church to bring Nathan back from the dead... but there was a page missing from the book so she accidentally left out a step. Whoops. Nathan is able to contain his errr appetite for only so long until he finally takes a bite out of one of his high school tormentors at a school dance. This of course is a bad idea. His victim goes on to bite some people who then go on to bite some more people who go on to bite even MORE people until sure enough his quaint little Irish village is being overrun by zombies. Even though he may be one of the Undead now Nathan still doesn't want anything to happen to his beloved Jessica so he and his two doofus friends race to her family's home to rescue her just before the horde of undead descends upon the place. Hilariously overthetop mayhem ensues.It takes a little while for the zombie shenanigans to really get going in Boy Eats Girl but once it does I doubt any gorehound will be disappointed. The scene where Jessica charges into the horde on her father's farm machine is friggin' EPIC! From then on the blood and guts as well as the one liners come fast and furious. The compact run time just about 80 minutes keeps Boy Eats Girl from overstaying its welcome and wraps everything up nicely.Fans of Shaun of the Dead or Zombieland should get a few kicks out of Boy Eats Girl and the film is a worthy addition to the growing Zombie Comedy genre.".

However the gory bits which there is quite a lot of for a 15A film are varied and inventive enough to keep the viewers entertained.The main cast all do a good job in particular David Leon and Tadhg Murphy. Samantha Mumba is good in her role but she hasn't got as much dialogue as you'd expect from the films lead.

Not wholly European as you'd expect but it works on most levels just not so much on the humour however.Nathan David Leon is the heartbroken teenager who accidentally kills himself after making the mistake of witnessing the love of his young teenage life Jessica Irish pop sensation Samantha Mumba in a compromising situation with his school's Lothario. Nathan's mother Deirdre O'Kane finds his lifeless body in his room and remembers the handy book of resurrection spells that she'd found just days earlier in the bowels of the church that she works at.As easy as you can say beginner's luck she manages to bring back her son and gets him ready for the next day of school. Nathan starts to feel the effects of his zombification when he starts to feel impervious to pain and feels hungry all the time. His 2 pals Henry and Diggs Laurence Kinlan and Tadhg Murphy who at times seem even less shiftless than their dead friend get worried when they see Nathan's disenchantment with Jessica vanish.At the night's school disco resident slut and girlfriend of the toughest jock in school Cheryl Sara James propositions Nathan. Not exactly willing to do what Nathan wants from her she ditches him. Unfortunately for Nathan the jock boyfriend follows him as he stumbles on to the rugby pitch. Normally this would be a cakewalk for bullykind everywhere but Nathan's newfound undead ability of superstrength makes it easy for him to overpower the jock. He finally gives in to temptation and takes a couple of deadly chunks out of him. Nathan runs home and is given the bare bones of his worsening condition by his mother who promptly locks him in the garage as she finds a cure. Things start to get a whole lot worse for him after last night's attack starts a chain reaction of killings each spawning a much more vicious version of Nathan's condition.The plot and situation 'borrows' heavily from a handful of movies especially the 1993 cult classic My Boyfriend's Back with virtually the same subplot of unrequited love between the unfortunate undead and his highschool sweetheart. As most will use Shaun of the Dead as a touchstone in understanding the film's comedygore tandem it's intended use of black comedy and detached humour falls short.The backyard splatter that comes from fending off ravenous classmates and neighbours is refreshing to see and it does it well. The violence and the reactions of the harried survivors are always tongueincheek which is satisfying as the zombie horde never comes close to being scary just downright silly. The flaying of skin and removal of limbs is a requisite in any good romp through a town full of undead. However the gore starts of perfunctory not exactly a good sign when it takes almost half the movie to get there.As the film progresses to its climax a visible shift in priorities takes place. Suddenly the story stops and a zombie freeforall take place courtesy of a pimped out tractor and surge of adrenaline from the heroine. As the movie is a relatively short enterprise clocking in at about 77 minutes including credits it almost makes up for the lack of spilled blood and guts when the horror aspect of the film finally kicks in.Most satires succumb to taking themselves too seriously at some point in their films and Boy Eats Girl is no different. The romance between Nathan and Jessica felt too overdone in the beginning leading to the most controversial scene in the movie that initially got it banned in its native Ireland. The attempted suicide scene was clumsy and awkward not exactly an endorsement for depressed teenagers everywhere.The film starts out slow working out the setup of the eventual suicide that triggers the rest of the plot leaving just a third of the movie for bona fide zombie mayhem. Each transition is disjointed and rushed especially the weak example of a deus ex machina during the last minutes of the film.The 1note characters and unresolved story lines are indicative of the apathetic acting and lack of fleshed out character development. Mumba does not show any signs of being a tough female character in the beginning making a transformation into the movie's heroine seem out of character. Leon's Nathan seems too selfaware and confident to pull off being the angstridden chump who finds it hard to bring up his true feelings around Jessica.From start to end its campy throwback to nonsensical horrorcomedy masks over its inability to find its feet and its problematic attempts at satire. Suffering from a painfully short running time and an overly brisk pacing Boy Eats Girl does not fulfill the potential that it has. What it does achieve is a quick and harmless way to spend just over an hour when bored.Rating 2 out of 5 stars".

It isn't a fullon horror movie it's more like the Buffy movie with zombies instead of vampires and a lot more gore. People like to gripe and moan about more accessible movies declaring in a grandiose fashion that 'what has become of our once great cinematic history' blah blah blah then instantaneously undermining their argument by finding something like Scary Movie more to their tastes. Seems Boy Eats Girl has been on the receiving end of the kind of folks who think their ability to use a keyboard makes them some kind of Brian Sewell. Well it won't be the first time.Aside from the aforementioned gore Boy Eats Girl is a horrorcomedy with the emphasis on the comedy. It's premise is pretty similar to Shaun of the Dead but it's a much more mainstream kind of humour seeing as it relates to highschoolers. Thankfully the clichs of the 'highschool horror' are largely dodged through the combination of zombies a surefire way of spicing anything up. The horror equivalent of a horde of angry ninjas lol and an ace script that flips most of the clichs on their head. For instance the preppy bimbo character who's dating the jock is not only quite intelligent and resourceful she's also given a lot of lines and a fair chunk of plot to get on with.The characters are one of the two key places this deviates wonderfully from the teenhorror crowd. All of these characters have a little story of their own none of them just feel like they're serving as a boxticker in a genre movie. You almost feel sad to see them meet a sticky end. Almost.Why you won't entirely is the hilarious and OTT ways they go out. For instance at one point an ageing Science teacher swears at the bimbo girl as she flies by on a scooter only to pitch headfirst into a ditch and be jumped by five zombies. Once there's a horde of hungry Irish zombies wandering the neighbourhood things get really interesting really bloody and above all satisfyingly silly.It isn't a classic horror I'll grant you that but it's endearingly stupid and has some of the best oneliners ever. It's funny it's gory and it has hordes of zombies. I can't see what the problem is.".

She's not and her casting in this bit of romzomcom dross is ample proof of that. She qualifies as a pretty face with a certain zaftig appeal and I'm sorry to say not much more.The rest of the cast doesn't fare much better and as is always the case the blame must be placed squarely where it belongs on the inept shoulders of the screenwriter although I suppose the questionable efforts of a visionless director might also be to blame. The listless threadbare plot such as it is focuses on a pathetic pretty boy who can't seem to score with the girl of his dreams and opts for suicide to relieve his miseries apparently he's never heard of masturbation. Mom resurrects him though thanks to a handydandy book of spells she's stolen from a nearby church only she somehow overlooks a missing portion of the potion and ends up with sonnyboy as a slowly degenerating infectious dead thingamabob who soon spreads the zombie meme to his classmates. The ensuing mayhem delivered with all the finesse of a hamfisted school boy features little in the way of hilarity virtually no suspense no horror no pathos and certainly nothing in the way of a fresh take on the genre. There's plenty of gore which is eventually released in such paroxysms of spew and rubbery body parts that this viewer could only suspect that someone was trying desperately to make up for the paucity of everything that had gone before none of it works on any level at all.I'd give Boy Eats Girl said title btw being an insultingly brazen example of misrepresentation an even lower rating if it weren't for a certain level of professionalism concealed within the thing. The cinematography is passable if derivative pointless dolly shots that do nothing to advance mood or plot for instance and the sets and locations costumes and so on are miles ahead of most exploitation cheapies but none of it is of any avail. The best intentions still end up youknowwhere.Boredom viewing only. Utter waste of time otherwise.".

Maybe if it was a love story without the zombies it would have been good for some teenagers. The beginning is also good but as the whole film it's said in just a few words and a movie would never look fine read as a bedtime story. The actors  what can I say?? I didn't quite like non of the girls the boys aren't acting much better. I could stand no more but 30 minutes. Because it is neither scary enough to make me feel just a bit frightened nor it's so funny. As I said it has nothing to show. It's just another low budget movie which would attract a terribly low number of audience. To be honest I feel that the 50 mins I spend watching the movie and it's completely stupid end are like stolen from my life. Just don't make this mistake. Watch something you have watched and you know it'll make you feel better that this consecutive senseless movie.".

That night in a drunken stupor he decides to end his life.His mother who works at the local church comes home and finds him dead then uses a book she found at the church to bring him back to life.

While Nathan can contain his blood lust the person he bit cannot and he goes to infect the entire town. Now Nathan needs to get to Jessica before it's too late.Boy Eats Girl is a refreshing move away from the traditional zombie movies. First of all Nathan isn't a brain dead bloodthirsty zombie...but in actuality still a teenager who still has feelings and coherent memories. Also there is a cure for the people who've been turned unlike most zombie movies where there is no cure. Finally the subtext of the forlorn love between Nathan and Jessica just adds to the entertainment value of the film.Sure it's no Oscarworthy movie but it's definitely worth a watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Boy Eats Girl is a teen horror romantic comedy that is somewhat of a cross between Clueless and Dead Alive aka Brain Dead. I would say that this is more of a teen movie and has more in common with Clueless than Dead Alive though. I would not say that this is as good as either one of those but also is certainly not bad at all either. This Irish production is not unlike most high school movies. It is centered around teen angst has clean cut nerdy guys trying to get laid super hot girls and meat head jocks that get the hot girls and bully the nerds. Of course the hottest of these girls is also the coolest and is love interest for our main character. Not atypical for the horror genre messing around with voodoo is part of why the dead are running around town munching on your neighbor's innards. While the splatter and gore is not super abundant when it does kick in it is awesome and is real well done. If you have seen a decent amount of movies Boy Eats Girl probably won't rock your socks off. However for a zombie comedy you could certainly do much worst. Some reviewers have compared this to Shaun Of The Dead it is somewhat similar to that except Shaun Of The Dead is much more original and better than this.".

	schema:headline " A surprisingly entertaining Irish zombie comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Filmed on the Isle of Man this is a lowbudget Irish film that obviously tries to appeal to the same demographic audience as SHAUN OF THE DEAD except with little of the talent behind that movie. It's clichd from the start telling the love story between a doomed zombie boy and his affectionate wouldbe girlfriend while of course mixing lots of zombies into things. Surprisingly though I enjoyed BOY EATS GIRL. Perhaps it's because of the natural humour or the sense that the cast is having a whale of a time making it but this is a fun if goofy way to spend seventy minutes of your life.The film goes about setting up the various characters jocks geeks etc. that you'd expect from a high school teen flick before introducing the zombie element. About halfway through the plot breaks down entirely changing to show the running battle between the humans and the zombies. The script focuses on the humour which is sometimes crude sometimes obvious but sometimes quirky and appealing. The zombies themselves are played for laughs although the film is happy to wallow in the gore at key moments. Blood sprays flesh is torn asunder and various implements are shoved into heads and eyeballs. There's even a little flesh eating for the zombie fans. But the gory highlight is an incredible twominute splatterfest as the heroine uses a tractor and thresher shades of BRAINDEAD's lawn mower to dispose of a zombie crowd. Limbs and entrails go everywhere and earn the film an 18 certificate there and then.The thing that makes the film likable is the cast list and there are fine performances from everybody  except Samantha Mumba. Mumba is as bad here as she was in THE TIME MACHINE wooden beyond belief and she never convinces as a tough heroine for one second. In comparison David Leon brings soul to his lovesick zombie hero and there is excellent comic relief throughout from geeks Laurence Kinlan and Tadhg Murphy especially the latter who reminds me of Ron from the HARRY POTTER series. Other supporting cast members also do particularly well. Sara James for instance brings a real vivacity to the clichd role of high school bitch livening up things no end when she's on screen. In a nutshell BOY EATS GIRL succeeds at mixing laughs with the expected bloodshed and while it adds absolutely nothing new to the genre it remains an enjoyable spectacle.".

That's what Boy Eats Girl is but it turns out to be neither fish nor fowl. When it comes to comedy the movie does have a few mildly humorous moments but for the most part the movie isn't especially funny  it's either serious or the humor is so low key it almost isn't there. When it comes to horror the movie does have a few somewhat pleasing bloody moments particularly the climatic scene that in part rips off the climax of the Peter Jackson film Dead Alive. But the horror for the most part isn't particularly bloody or chilling to observe. Looking at the comedy and the horror of the movie I think I see what ultimately sinks the movie  it's directed in a way that lacks bite. The movie is too low key to frighten or induce giggles from the audience. And despite only lasting 80 minutes long it moves somewhat slowly. It doesn't help that the movie also has a pretty cheap feeling to it though I guess it looks okay for what had to be a rock bottom budget. The best part of the movie is the cast  they have charm and talent and you get interested in them even though they are a bit too old to be playing high school students. They make the movie somewhat bearable to watch despite its many shortcomings. I can't recommend the movie but I'll admit I've seen much worse.".

Boy A is a perfect example of what happens when the media gets a hold of a spectacular story one that might be tragic or devastating but it still offers enough drama to cast a spell on us. Write a good book about it In Cold Blood comes to mind adapt it into a couple of decent films and you can certainly catch fire.Boy A explores an obscure case in America but apparently a very famous one in England telling the story of a released convict who might have more than a few problems adapting back to society. It is essential that his identity remain secret because the consequences can be horrendous for all parties involved.The audience's main concern at first appear to be whether the main character has been rehabilitated and is able to deal with his new freedom. Garfield's performance is so good it brings to mind the vulnerability shown by Timothy Hutton in Ordinary People that of a bruised soul that is very strong but also quite close to an emotional collapse if not nurtured properly. Garfield's character is damaged from his early life to the abuse he suffers at the hand of his childhood friend the one that eventually gets him in jail. It is not very clear how responsible he is for the crime that eventually incarcerated him but what is clear is that he needs a lot of support and any interference will be catastrophic.In the end we know there has to be some type of revelation and it is the degree of the pain that the revelation brings that we want to see and we dread all the time. We grow to like this young man. Maybe because he might not be very different from many in our world maybe because he is another victim of a cold and fractured society. The film will open wounds in many who have been disappointed and hurt and it will mostly teach a few people a lesson about what we can do to prevent any more tragedies like these from occurring again.It is an admirable achievement.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Christian author Lewis B. Smedes once said that to forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you. John Crowley's Boy A is a powerfully gripping film about what happens when we fail to forgive ourselves for wrongdoing and give society the opening to move in and assuage our guilt. Jack Burridge Andrew Garfield has been released from prison after serving fourteen years for a murder that he helped commit when he was ten years old but the struggle to recover his life has just begun.Adapted by Mark O'Rowe from the novel by Jonathan Trigell the story is a reminder of the notorious 1993 Jamie Bulger case when two tenyearolds were convicted of murdering Jamie Bulger aged two although Trigell says that his inspiration for the book was a friend of his who served prison time as a juvenile and turned into a lovely lad. In the Bulger case the British media portrayed the two boys as evil savages ignoring circumstances that might have compelled them to commit the act. Sadly Jack's release is also trumpeted in the media with a scare headline about evil coming of age and a drawing of how he might look today.Known at their trial only as Boy A and Boy B both Jack whose given name was Eric Wilson and his friend Phillip Taylor Doherty were incarcerated for the brutal murder of a young female classmate yet the full details of the crime including what may or may not have been Jack's role are never fully explained and the surrounding circumstances revealed only in sporadic flashbacks. We learn that both boys had a childhood of poverty and neglect. Eric had an alcoholic father and a mother stricken with cancer and Philip was sexually abused by an older brother yet Crowley never uses their circumstances to justify their crime.The film opens with Jack being assisted by his counselor his uncle Terry Peter Mullan on his release from prison. Terry gives him a present of a pair of Escape brand sneakers and helps him to find a new job at a delivery service and obtain living accommodations with Kelly Siobhan Finneran a kindly woman who agrees to house him temporarily. As a cover he tells his new boss and coworker Chris Shaun Evans that he did three stints in prison for stealing cars when he was much younger. Jack makes a positive adjustment at work and falls for office secretary Michelle Katie Lyons known affectionately by her mates as 'The White Whale. Their relationship at first is awkward especially when Jack is given Ecstasy at an office party and lets loose in a wild spasmodic dance and later engages in a violent brawl while coming to the aid of a friend.Slowly Jack and Michelle find much in common and one of the loveliest scenes in the film is when they snap photos of each others while taking a bath together. As Jack begins to get his life together he remains fully aware of the need to guard his secret and his anxiety that others will discover it is always evident. All the while Jack is supported by Terry and when the boy rescues the victim of a car accident to become a local hero Terry calls him his most successful achievement. Things get complicated however when Terry's estranged son James Young comes to live with him and begins to show resentment about his father's closeness to Jack. Eventually this entanglement will be the trigger for the realization of Jack's and our deepest fears.Boy A is a compassionate and disturbing film that won numerous BAFTA awards for acting directing editing and cinematography though it started out as a made for TV movie. As Jack Andrew Garfield turns in a superb performance allowing his face to reveal his vulnerability and his changing moods to reveal the tightrope on which he is walking. Though the film has moments of pathos it is not without grace. We cling tenaciously to those moments of transcendence sensing that they might be fleeting but knowing that they will never be forgotten.".

	schema:reviewBody "Few films wowed audiences at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival as much as John Crowley's Boy A. Scipted by Mark O'Rowe from a Jonathan Trigell novel Boy A is a storydriven mystery which is carried on the shoulders of newcomer Andrew Garfield in a tour de force performance that dominates the film from opening title to closing credits.Jack Burridge is leaving prison after a 14year sentence for a crime he committed as a child. His mentor Terry has been working to gain his release and help him transition into the new world in which he'll live and work under a new identity. It's up to Jack to determine who he wants to be but it's up to those around him to determine whether or not he will be allowed to do so. It's that challenge which is at the heart of Boy A. Andrew Garfield Doctor Who Lions for Lambs is frighteningly brilliant as Jack. It's his movie to make or break and this role is sure to be singled out as the launching pad for what is destined to be a notable career. The viewer sees a sweet sensitive puppy dog of a young man while his secret past indicates something completely different. We wrestle with that concept as he does himself and it's an emotional moving piece of work. As his counselor Terry Peter Mullan Trainspotting Children of Men is the father figure who provides a foundation for Terry's wandering existence. His attempts to keep Jack alive and well are both heartening and heartbreaking.Boy A is visually stunning. The interplay of light and shadow through the use of diffusion filters and silhouette gave me chills. The dramatic manipulation of white light is a seemingly simple device but cuts to the bone. Cinematographer Rob Hardy demonstrates true artistry with camerawork that is often a character in itself. A recurring visual theme using tunnels alleyways hallways and bridges stands out even to the untrained eye. Paddy Cunneen's score makes it clear that this is at its heart a tale of intrigue.Told in flashback the secrets of Boy A are revealed in bits and pieces. The reality of who Jack is becomes more powerful and painful as the film progresses. Garfield is so charismatic and his Jack so incredibly sympathetic that this film easily rises to the top of those screened at this year's festival. John Crowley's Boy A is a master class in the art of filmmaking.".

The viewer sees a sweet sensitive puppy dog of a young man while his secret past indicates something completely different. We wrestle with that concept as he does himself and it's an emotional moving piece of work. As his counselor Terry Peter Mullan Trainspotting Children of Men is the father figure who provides a foundation for Terry's wandering existence. His attempts to keep Jack alive and well are both heartening and heartbreaking.Boy A is visually stunning. The interplay of light and shadow through the use of diffusion filters and silhouette gave me chills. The dramatic manipulation of white light is a seemingly simple device but cuts to the bone. Cinematographer Rob Hardy demonstrates true artistry with camerawork that is often a character in itself. A recurring visual theme using tunnels alleyways hallways and bridges stands out even to the untrained eye. Paddy Cunneen's score makes it clear that this is at its heart a tale of intrigue.Told in flashback the secrets of Boy A are revealed in bits and pieces. The reality of who Jack is becomes more powerful and painful as the film progresses. Garfield is so charismatic and his Jack so incredibly sympathetic that this film easily rises to the top of those screened at this year's festival. John Crowley's Boy A is a master class in the art of filmmaking.";

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this last night on Channel 4 and I honestly cannot believe just how much it has challenged my opinions on this highly emotive subject. I cried very hard for about 20 minutes after the end credits and I still cannot stop thinking about it. I almost wished I hadn't watched it as it has just challenged my way of thinking so much  although I suppose that is what films are supposed to do.The story revolves around Jack  formerly known as Eric  a child murderer released at the age of 24 after serving 14 years in prison for a crime he committed with his accomplice Philip at the age of 10. It follows his reentry into the world making friends and finding his way.Suffice to say Eric and Philip were two very neglected souls. Philip we discover through a series of flashbacks is suffering very severe sexual abuse at the hands of his older brother and I just have to say that Taylor Doherty who played him is hopefully set for a very bright future  what an understated and convincing performance. Eric is neglected by his family friendless bullied and he clings onto his only friend in Philip  which I believe is probably why he goes along with the crime  for fear of letting down his one and only companion in the world.This has reinforced my opinion that children including child murderers are not born evil  they are shaped by their surroundings and their upbringing. It has changed my opinion of how they should be handled  they SHOULD be given a second chance. Jack was a lost soul who had played a part in the most heinous crime but he was desperately trying to turn his life around. It is hammered home that he is not evil when he saves the little girl from the car accident. He is living a haunted half life  24 with the naivety of someone half his age. I so wanted him to build up a good life which I think was why the ending upset me so much. The whole film leads up to it and Andrew Garfield's superb performance just haunted me afterwards.To be honest  I don't think I will watch this film again as I just find it too upsetting  and that really is not like me although I am pregnant and a bit hormonal at the moment  but I think there are some future stars in this film namely Andrew Garfield who played Jack and Taylor Doherty who played young Philip Craig.You really should watch this film".

	schema:headline " A challenging perspective";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a film which forces you to think differently. Boy A completely shifts its focus from the typical media perspective and instead chooses to concentrate on the ones being vilified.Before watching Boy A I reminded myself about the facts of the James Bulger case. It's painfully clear that this film was intended to force viewers to have a new perspective on the case and its perpetrators Venables and Thompson. In both the film and the case there are two schoolboys skipping class and getting up to no good an unspeakable act of sheer horror and prosecution by both the judiciary and mainstream media. The most heartbreaking allusion that the film makes to the case though is in its use of the train tracks. The train tracks are where James Bulger at only two years old was sickeningly abused and ultimately killed by the two boys depicted by the media at the time as Child A and Child B.Both Eric and Philip have very troubled backgrounds and as a result their morals and values have been entirely skewed. Eric at least seemed to lose his sense of knowing right from wrong the longer he was around Philip and subject to his brash violent nature the more exposed he was to Philip the more detached he became from humanity.Was Eric a bad person? From everything we've seen no it seems as though an abusive father a detached mother an unsupportive and inadequate school system and bullying all had a detrimental impact on the growth and development of this young boy. Eric did kill or at least take part in the killing of a schoolgirl and took part in some other very violent acts too however this only occurred after he had been exposed to and influenced by Philip for some time. Jack on the other hand is one of the most friendly caring and vulnerable individuals you'll ever see onscreen  he is totally at odds with Eric. This juxtaposition is excellently handled by the director through the use of flashback to simultaneously introduce us to both Eric and Jack whilst distinguishing the two.Additionally it must be noted that the schoolgirl whom Eric and Philip kill is not revealed to be entirely innocent kind or vulnerable. Instead she's portrayed as an arrogant rude distasteful little girl. Her attire and wellspoken nature lead the audience to believe she's from a wealthy background whereas Eric and Philip are the complete opposite. This makes it even more difficult to watch as we know that the schoolgirl is the victim but ultimately so are Eric and Philip.A scene which I found especially perplexing was the one in which the pair of them catch a fish and Philip then proceeds to beat the fish within an inch of its life only to toss it back into the water. He admits that he knows the fish won't survive yet he's still chosen to release it back into the water rather than show it mercy. This speaks volumes for the way in which young offenders are handled in the justice system. Is rehabilitation truly effective? Can it have a beneficial impact on the offenders? Or by the time they're finally released back into society has the damage already been done too significant?The drawing we see at the end of the film by the little girl indicates that she sees Jack as a hero. This further reinforces the idea that it's all a matter of perspective. In a past life Eric used his knife to kill a schoolgirl but to this little girl Jack is a hero who used his knife to save her. This stark contrast goes to show how much an individual can change as Jack's mentor Terry identifies when he reflects on how far Jack has come since he met him all those years ago. This notion then seems to answer the questions raised earlier in the film as to whether or not rehabilitation is actually effective we can see from Jack's behaviour and his progress that rehabilitation can and does work. Unfortunately though once someone has been broken into so many pieces and they've been put back together it only takes the most gentle upset for it all to come crashing down again.In the end we're led to believe that he jumped. Jack admits that as Terry often told him Eric is dead  in his past. But now that his past has been brought up again it has consequently resulted in the destruction of Jack his new identity. This leads him to a sense of hopelessness as he realises he's trapped between two worlds and they're collapsing against one another pinning him in between until he shatters. This leaves us with a bleak message we the public have ultimately caused Jack to take his own life. What makes this far more serious is that public intervention actually has resulted in the deaths of innocent people such as Scott Bradley who was wrongly identified as being Venables. As a result of his misidentification he was harassed vilified and took his own life an innocent man died at the hands of the public's persecution.If you enjoyed Boy A and the way it encouraged you to see from a different perspective then I urge you to watch The Dirties which deals with bullying in schools and the consequences which can arise from neglecting to address it.All in all Boy A is a highly thoughtprovoking and devastating film which ask us to pause and reflect on our treatment of young offenders and consider that there may  and indeed likely is  more going on than that which is portrayed by the media. Only once we take a step back and contemplate our crucification of these children can we effectively pinpoint what causes such tragedies to occur and prevent them from happening ever again. RIP Jamie Bulger.".

	schema:reviewBody "This sensitive drama about a young man released from prison after serving time for his part in a brutal crime years earlier must rank as one of the best British films of the year. Boy A follows 'Jack' as he starts his new life supported by his social workermentor a superb Peter Mullan. His struggle to fit back in to society whilst still living with the guilt of his unforgivable crime is beautifully realised by Andrew Garfield definitely an actor to watch in the future.The film is morally complex and challenges the viewer without being pointlessly provocative resonances with the Bulger case will still make this painful viewing for many people. The character of Jack is perhaps a little too sympathetic he is portrayed as a very tender shy and naive man almost still childlike despite having spent many years in prison. Only occasionally do we see a violent side to Jack's nature and his part in the pivotal crime is not made explicit though is all the more chilling because of this.This is a quality film on all counts with the cast working well with a solid script and sensitive direction indeed it's hard to see why this didn't get a UK cinema release as it stands head and shoulders above much of the clichd dross churned out by the British film industry recently. This is a haunting thoughtprovoking film that deserves a wide audience.".

	schema:headline " Powerful and challenging look at a relevant subject with impressive delivery across the board SPOILERS";
	schema:reviewBody "Jack is a young convict who has finishes his sentence and is being released back into society under the guidance of mentor Terry. Having been in prison since he was a boy the world of work women and adult responsibilities are all new to him but Jack has a bigger challenge. His real name is Eric Wilson but he is better known as Boy A  one of two boys who murdered schoolgirl Angela Milton several years ago. While he tries to move on with his life his secret both haunts him and sees him at risk of exposure to a public unable to forgive.Although it is increasingly famous for reality shows and trash Channel 4 do still screen strong films on important or controversial subjects. Recently one such film was Boy A which takes the fictional tale of a young man released from prison into a new identity to protect him from retribution. It is a delicate subject to say the least and it is certainly not one that we are used to considering from the point of view of the guilty party. So Crowley's film is indeed worth seeing even if it is only so that the viewer can be forced to view Jack as a person and not as evil incarnate. Having said that though nobody is saying that the act of murder should be forgiven as a childish mistake and indeed the film doesn't make it easy to accept his actions  the murder is not graphic but is disturbing and powerfully depicted and I did feel quite ill at it.Channel 4 did a similar in style film last year about a paedophile I forget the name but they concluded it the same way with the suicide of the main character. It is a very tidy conclusion perhaps but here it fits as it seems like there is no other answer. The viewer is given the best overview possible but even still I found it challenging. It is clear that Jack is not the monster that he is painted as in the tabloids but then at the same time his actions are hard to take even if the flashbacks do a good job of providing an understanding of how it occurred. The director and scriptwriter have a difficult job of bring off this complexity and they do well both providing the tools to the cast to then deliver the goods.In this regard Andrew Garfield does very well with an assured and convincing performance. His hopes are touched with fear and he brings this out really well fearful of attention and unsure of himself in a world that he has never experienced as an adult. It is a great performance that is a key part of making this material challenging in knowing where right is. Mullan provides famous support and he does have an interesting character but he always feels like he is on the sidelines offering his name as much as his performance to the film. Lyons and Evans are more useful and are convincing as people  it is only at the very end where the script hands Lyons a rather clumsy final scene where she appears to struggle. Special mention also to the two boys who play Eric and Phillip both are excellent with difficult dialogue and characters and they both nail it  which was important for the film.Overall then a suitably dark and challenging film that doesn't give the viewer an easy opinion on anything. The leaning is very much away from the stance of the Daily Mail hanging's too good for 'em but still the film doesn't make it easy to totally forgive Jack. The delivery is strong across the board with particularly important and assured delivery from Garfield and the two boys in the flashback scenes.".

Yet I am convinced that Director John Crowley never strived to that end it is just that the subject matter is such that it provides quite a number of emotional gut punches!

Perhaps it is easier for some to have cut and dried black and white views about certain things. Life of course never fits into those type of parameters which have been paved by a nonthinking 'justice' system and continued by a pack mentality.This film challenges generalisations keeps you on the edge of your seat with no clue of what will unfold next. It stays away from clichs and works only on allowing us into the depths of this main character's psyche. It is a rare treat to watch a film which neither lies to us nor makes judgments. We simply see a snapshot of a young man's life interlaced with his history. There are plenty of disturbing scenes and I did cry a lot watching this film. Mostly the bits which show such severe neglect of the young boys. Unfortunately this kind of neglect IS a reality in our society and that's one of the reasons this film is important. There are very very few human beings who randomly decide to be violent psychopaths  humans who are unable to experience empathy being probably the only example of such. Almost ALL violent behaviour stems from abuse and is a learnedcopied response.The only antidote is love. I have seen a webpost which may or may not be accurate but it states that there is a tribe in Africa who respond to negative behaviour with love only. This is the only response which could work. Forgiveness IS the only way and I feel this film really conveys that message. It leads us to have compassion for a man who was severely abused as a child and who may or may not have contributed to the murder of another child. We're never actually told if he did hurt the girl but the point isn't whether or not he did the point is that we can see that he never would NOW that it's not in his nature to inflict pain. Like his social worker says this young man deserves happiness and anybody watching the film will be compelled to agree.There is no shame in feeling love for a vulnerable abused human being. We should never be concerned to feel compassion or care for another. An abused dog which bites will be forgiven by most and a human should be given the same chance. A wonderful film. Oh and exemplary acting throughout from all. I particularly loved the social worker and his story also. He was a beautiful rich character. Bravo to the film makers for championing the underdog and taking on such a sensitive and controversial subject. from a thinker who loathes the media for the needless negativity it propagates".

Bravo to the film makers for championing the underdog and taking on such a sensitive and controversial subject. from a thinker who loathes the media for the needless negativity it propagates";

	schema:reviewBody "Centered around a young man just released from prison for killing a young childwhen he himself was only tenthe story shows how he deals with the guilt and the scrutiny of that event attempting to build a new life as far away from the past as he can. With the help of a caseworker who has given him a new identity and history Jack Burridge does his best to live life for the first time to experience what it is to be happy. However no matter how hard he tries to leave that defining moment behind one can never forget the fact that while he may be able to start over again the victim of his crime will never get that chance.The team of director John Crowley and writer Mark O'Rowe have adapted a novel into the cinematic world using visuals to express what words needed to on the printed page. It all starts pretty straightforwardly as we are introduced to the players and Jack begins his life and new job meeting friends and learning about new technologies and whatever else he missed while in prison. However once he sees a computergenerated photo of himself aged from an old picture as a child the faade he has tried so hard to build into his reality starts to fall apart. Seeing himself on the news makes it very hard to forget about his true identity Eric Wilson and flashes of memory creep into his consciousness. Crowley never hits us over the head with these glimpses into the past but instead teases us with short cuts Jack trying to shake the images from his mind before finally playing the scene out. Even when they are shown in their entirety one can never know if what's on screen actually happened or whether he has fabricated some of the details. It is an effective way to show the inner turmoil as the life around him falls apart and the one he left behind comes ever closer to the surface.It becomes a case of absolute irony that him saving a little girl from a car crash serves as the final nail in the coffin that is his ultimate discovery. A killer becoming a hero a publicity photograph for his place of employment puts his image out for anyone to see including people connected to those trying to help him people who may feel the need for misguided revenge. Boy A truly comes into its own when Jack's identity is brought out into the open but the journey to that point is by no means inferior to the frenetic emotional tailspin portrayed in the final half hour. When a friend is suckerpunched at a club should he look the other way or involve himself in a fight that could only bring memories of the bullying and beatings he received as a child? When a woman opens her heart to love him should he feel guilty that she is in love with a person that doesn't exist with a killer? That first date at Michelle's house is a devastating scene showing Jack naked literally and figuratively vulnerable and completely unaccustomed to what love could be.While the storytelling delivers a powerful tale it is the acting that brings those words and events to light. Andrew Garfield is fantastic as Jack Burridge awkward and shy reconciling his past with his future. When you see his childhood in flashbacks and realize the pain and suffering he was put through it is tough to argue why he would befriend someone as troubled and unpredictable as Philip Craig. Here is someone that finally makes him feel a part of something wouldn't you do all you could to keep that alive? It's a pretty harrowing scene when we finally are able to see how the murder went down. It doesn't show anything as far as definitive proof that young Eric was an active participant but you can imagine from what is seen that he didn't stop it. He was a child then and in many ways a child still and Garfield portrays that perfectly.I also really liked Katie Lyons' Michelle a pretty and confident girl that shows Jack what could be in the future that perhaps he really isn't a monster after all. Shaun Evans was great as Chris too coworker and friend. He played the role as a fun guy someone that could cause trouble but in an innocent way. Not angered when he gives Jack ecstasy to his dismay forgetting his friend is on parole and trying to help whenever is possible Chris is a character that you believe would forgive Jack for his past if he had the time to do so. It is the always topnotch Peter Mullan that ends up stealing many scenes though. As Jack's caseworker Terry he is there at every turn a surrogate father for the boy and the strongest cheerleader he has. His part in the uncovering of his identity is absolutely tragic and his final scene in his car all the more heartbreaking as a result.Boy A is a film that will stick with you once it ends. With a conclusion as powerful as any other this year watching may be tough to endure but you will understand why it all must end how it does. Jack Burridge was a real person despite the past he would have to live with. As Terry said at the start Eric Wilson was dead. That boy who murdered a classmate no longer existed but was replaced by a young man out of jail for car theft a man looking to rebuild his life. Orchestrated to perfection Crowley and O'Rowe conclude the film with the reactions of those who grew to love Jack whether the goodbyes are real or imagined they are never false.".

	schema:headline " What a movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "Just Staggering. When you first watch the trailer of Boy A and read its synopsis you might expect a kind of sanctimonious movie but once you've seen it all the way through you realize that beyond this first aspect it is much more of a wrenching movie that gets under your skin. Andrew Garfield's amazing performance as Jack the main character is one of the reasons why this movie is a masterpiece. I think that he really managed to figure out what someone like Jack feels like and to transmit that feeling to the audience. He is just stunning and although I haven't seen the other movies he's played in I guess we could say that he's at the top of his game in this one since his acting could not have been any better. He successfully tried to express happiness naivety love hope and desperateness without overacting and we all know that in that kind of role it's really easy to slip to something overplayed that turns the character's truthful sadness into something you make fun of. Here though he is truly endearing and we are more than just witnesses. We're most likely to put ourselves in Jack's shoes and this way we get the opportunity to share his feelings and concerns. That is probably why this movie will stay etched in your memory for quite a long time. It really moves you and gets under your skin. I doubt anyone would ever forget about that poor and sympathetic Jack after having seen the movie. Some supporting stories appeared sort of useless to me though. For instance I didn't really understand why Terry and his son's story was put forward once or twice whereas the link to the main story is too slight to make it truly interesting. It could have been so if it had been put forward more throughout the movie. At the beginning we expect Jack to be successfully released back into society and we really believe in the kind of fairy tale we think is about to happen. Imagine our astonishment when we find out that his past catches him up through a heroic action and leads him to death! Our belief in the thorny topic of redemption in this world is being challenged and we get a rather negative portrait of society. The notion of Past is also questioned and the movie makes you think about whether we can actually forget our past and move on with our life despite our misdeeds or if our past and our present are always eventually brought back together and come down to one same thing. Boy A is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen and I will remember Andrew Garfield's for a long time. It definitely is a thoughtful movie so if you do not feel like watching that kind of movie well don't! It is a mustsee to me though that's for sure.Baptiste.".

Turns out he's a childmurderer and that revelation along with his own sense of guilt ends up ruining whatever future he might still have had at that point.In my humble opinion this film could have been a masterpiece maybe a classic even. The actors give some quite damn convincing performances the imagery and score really help set the right mood and the narrative flow although a bit awkward doesn't really get in the way of enjoying the film for all the good that it has to offer.What absolutely ruins this film for me however is that it tries way too hard to be an eyeopener and knowingly plays with your feelings so as to trick you into believing that you are in fact the monster. It's like the whole film from beginning to end just keeps whispering in your ear hey you remember those two little bastards who abducted tortured and murdered the 2year old child? oh remember that feeling of righteous hatred the deep repulsion you felt back then? well guess what you insensitive jerk? you were too quick to judge! see the kids were actually victims themselves and with that judgmental attitude of yours you're only helping perpetrate the injustice all the while presenting you with a protagonist who's surprisingly easy to sympathise with  probably because he's nothing like the actual person that inspired him.It's bad enough when a film tries to spoonfeed you a moral but Boy A takes it a step further because it does so through means of manipulation and deception keeping you hostage of that very same conscience you're not supposed to have.".

This film tackles the idea of second chances and starting life all over.Boy A is visually stunning. The acting is astounding credit goes to up and coming talent Andrew Garfield and the raw emotion that he invested in the character. It was very convincing and all the while heart breaking. He carries the film from start to end and you can't help but notice his presence from the getgo.It just goes to show that you don't need big explosions and loud noisy scenes to make an excellent movie. With all the rubbish Hollywood's been releasing these days its nice to see films like these just circling around silently building its audience fan base and through the word of mouth it spreads and it spreads. Boy A is highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "I guess this subject had already been explored a number of times recently  how convicted criminals upon release from their jail term attempt to reintegrate themselves back into society. With Little Children and The Woodsman we essentially have pedophiles who were released and had to deal with deep rooted prejudice and nonforgiveness in the community they reside in. But what if this criminal is a killer? Based on the novel by Jonathan Trigell Boy A refers to the unnamed boy who cannot be positively identified during the trial as he's a minor. After serving significant time behind bars we see him being released from prison and working with his counsellor Terry Peter Mullan he adopts a new identity as Jack Burridge Andrew Garfield. This is not only for an opportunity to start life afresh with a totally new and made up background but to serve as a mask of protection against retributive attacks by the case sympathizers or by the family members who may be out for their own brand of justice served.But of course this is no action movie so scrap those thoughts of having a man on the run with contract killers on the loose. What we have here instead is a touching exploration of a teenager's despair at trying to recalibrate his life after the chilling crime committed at an age where he was influenced by best pal Philip Craig Taylor Doherty. And here's where Andrew Garfield's ability got tested to the max where he constantly has to live a lie and finds it extremely hard to work at and obtain the trust of others always having to deal with the niggling feeling that he's not being totally honest and with romance in the picture with Michelle Katie Lyons it just complicates things. Fate allows him to redeem himself but one wonders if that is enough and whether one good deed can free oneself from the sins of the past.Garfield's charismatic presence will engage you from the get go as he carries the movie through from start right up until the end and kudos too to the editing and direction set to weave what's essentially two story arcs seamlessly together with the current timeline and one which looked at the mysterious past where events were presented a little bit at a time. We see how the two young boys evolve over time in their spiral downwards in morality and even so the dastardly crime doesn't get shown verbatim but only through a fishing reference which will cause the audience to question how culpable Jack was with his involvement in the crime.Running parallel to Jack's story is that of Terry the counsellor was well being estranged from his wife and having to address the disappointment he has with his own son. It's not hard to see how close he is to Jack and how under his care or lackof would develop inside each boy as the story went along. And this character study also extended to various supporting characters as well especially one whose promise to another seem to ring hollow the minute you hear it which just makes it a little bit more heartwrenching when you see Jack's nonchalant response as if preemptive and in the know.So yellow ribbon project? I suppose the reality of it is that it still boiled down to the crime itself and just how tolerant society is toward it in a case by case basis. Don't let this gripping drama slip you by it's powerful stuff that will continue to pose questions for discussion way after the end credits roll.".

	schema:reviewBody "Andrew Garfield an English actor born in LA has the reedy boyish looks of the young Tony Perkins but without Perkins' edge of craziness. He stood out in the otherwise lackluster 'Lions for Lambs.' As the protagonist of this gritty new movie Garfield plays a tough role compellingly grabbing our sympathies even though the guy he plays has a terrible past. His character was complicit in the murder of a young girl at the age of eleven and has just gotten out after many years of detention. In the opening scenes Terry the excellent Peter Mullen his caseworker and mentor helps him settle in the north of England in Manchester with a job and a new name. He was Eric Mullen. He becomes Jack Burridge. Garfield's sudden bashful smiles in the intense early scenes with Mullen make Jack appear to be a remarkably innocent young maneager to make good.These scenes between Garfield and Mullen establish sympathy for Jack as a painfully tentative sensitive and threatened young man and set a hushed serious tone. Jack's overwhelmed by Terry's gift of a new pair of appropriatelynamed Nike Escapes and he doesn't even know how to order a meal at a diner. He's haunted by nightmares and his new room is frighteningly stark. Nonetheless things go unbelievably well for Jack pretty quickly with the job and Michelle. The film puts us in his corner.Finding a roadside accident while making a delivery with a coworker in his new job Jack rescues a young girldramatically showing off his positive side. He's a hero. It's good publicity for the company too.But this good deed is dangerous because it gets Jack's picture in the papers. Even though he was tried for his crime anonymously as Boy A and in the eyes of the state has been rehabilitated there are people out there who know Eric Mullen has been released and want to hunt him down. His boss who's aware he was in prison but not what for has assured him on his first day at work that everybody deserves a second chance. But the truth is for some crimes people throw that rule away. No second chances for what the tabloids call a monster. The mainstream media seems to altogether reject this young man's right to a new identity. Not everyone believes in rehabilitation.Besides which Jack must struggle to hide his complete ignorance of noninstitutional life. All at once he must learn to work an ordinary job hang out with coworkers and party with them on the weekend and hardest of all when a woman at work called Michelle Katie Lyons takes an immediate liking to him he must handle dating sex and a serious relationship.Meanwhile periodic flashbacks pull us back to Eric's dark early years. His abusive father swills whiskey in front of the TV and his mother is withdrawn dying of breast cancer upstairs. He's shy withdrawn and seeking comfort from the bullies around school who hound him he becomes friends with the nasty more confident Phillip Taylor Doherty a kid long sexually abused by his own brother who teaches Eric petty thievery. While Jack's getting closer to Michelle we're getting closer to the young Eric though the actual crime he and Philip committed isn't shown till near the film's end.The scenes with Michelle navigate a nice line between the matter of fact and the achingly sincere as in early encounters Jack goes too far can't perform and then is intensely excited. Lyons conveys Michelle's experience along with her appreciation of Jack's naive warmth and sweetness. Again he is overwhelmed when she gives him a nice present. Then when they both declare their love he aches to tell her the truth about himself. It seems a betrayal not to. But Terry whom Jack calls whenever he's in need of advice assures him he cannot.Crowley who won a Tony for his direction of Martin McDonagh's brilliant play The Pillowman gets uniformly fine performances from the cast and Rob Hardy does fine atmospheric camerawork that conveys a sense of the gritty north that may recall Corbijn's 'Control.'The film is well edited but may seem to move too fast. As was true of native Irishman Crowley's Dublin film Intermission the dialog is hard to follow at timesfor an American anyway. Some plot elements such as the highway rescue and Terry's noaccount son who becomes a contrast to Jack are a little obvious. 'Boy A' becomes a bit of a thriller at the end and its direction feels rather deterministic. The film isn't meant to be about action but states of mind and degrees of moral certainty. Luckily the acting feels so immediate that we're not left with any sense of being manipulated. Though this hero comes from a darker place we're firmly in Ken Loach territory and the able Mullen in fact has worked well for Loach himself.This quietly powerful English film presents serious moral and practical issues. If a criminal has served his time does he deserve a new life? How can he achieve that anyway? In a small country like England it's not easy to hide. Distances may not be long enough to outrun one's past. To what emotional lengths must one go to be safe under such circumstances? At 24 is a full life forever to be denied because of an act at the age of 11? Mark O'Rowe's screenplay adapted from Jonathan Tribell's 2004 novelitself loosely based on the experiences of Mary Bell and the Bulger killerscan't altogether sidestep the source book's manipulativeness. But what it can do in compensation is present splendid performances and a realistic feel that leave viewers troubled and pensive rather than brainwashing them.Garfield delivers a breakout performance and he's already received a BAFTA award for it. He deserves to be remembered when other awards are given out this year and we're sure to be seeing more of him.".

	schema:headline " Interesting concept but it really doesn't go anywhere";
	schema:reviewBody "'Boy A' is a missed opportunity and that's all there is to say about it. The film has an intriguing beginning but it has no end or meat to this story. It's brave enough to ask questions but it isn't brave enough to really delve into a search for answers. It's brave enough to propose a brilliant character study but it's far too scared to really begin to scratch the surface of the character it proposes.It is no secret that 'Boy A' is inspired by the James Bulger murder case. The horrific story of two ten year olds murdering a 2 year old baby. The film is brave enough to begin to dramatize this but it's far too scared to acknowledge it. Andrew Garfield stars as Jack Burridge who used to be known as Eric Wilson and he's the most cuddly misunderstood child murderer imaginable. He was led on by the treachery of others and grimaces at the sociopath warning signs of his buddy Phil. We are lead to believe through the flashbacks that little Eric truly wasn't violent and he merely found himself at the wrong place at the wrong time. Phil is so over the top in his sociopath warning signs that we are lead to believe he is a miniManson. What does this do? Well for starters it ruins whatever chance this film had at what it seemed to initially wanted to do. Wouldn't this story of guilt sin and redemption be so much better if Eric actually was guilty? What if during the murder he actually was complicit in a grave crime? What if he truly was violent? What if in this partnership there actually was a mutual tendency towards violence? Eric Wilson wasn't a bad kid he merely had a bad friend. I wanted the film to be braver. I wanted Eric to truly have a monster within him that he had to face. Instead he is facing his past rather than his inner demons. This is well and good but it isn't what the film proposes.Garfield's performance lacks any restraint to it and so he engages in excess in a subtle way. His shyness is surprisingly blatant. We look at Garfield as if he is someone shouting out Look at me but don't acknowledge my presence I think Garfield is a decent actor but he's been given a weak character. He simply doesn't have anywhere interesting to bring this character. The film spends much of it's time building up to the secrets falling out of the bag. When this happens there isn't any conflict. Eric mainly walks around in a fog and acts on his first horrible impulse. The film doesn't give Eric the moment where he confronts his demons. The film is merely about him avoiding them and that is sufficiently disappointing.The film has some decent performances. I loved Katie Lyons as Michelle but the character is wasted. Above anything else we want Eric to face Michelle and beg her for forgiveness and the film doesn't have the courtesy to give us this moment. Instead we get an idealized fantasy in Eric's mind and so Lyon's brilliant performance is completely wasted. Peter Mullan's Terry is also a good character and has a dilemma. His son Zeb is a horrible drunk and he identifies with Eric as his son. He doesn't make a choice despite Zeb doing something horrible.This film could have been really special but it doesn't have the guts to really delve into it's rich propositions.".

This movie is about prep school called The Regis School and its packed with rebellious kids in which one kid William Tepper Sean Astin has a hard time adjusting due to prior rejections from other schools cause they couldn't control his rebellious act and now at The Regis School committing more acts of a rebellion there school gets taken over by terrorists on a random day and which the real reason is because the leader Luis Cali's Andrew Divoff father has been sent to prisonand the leader will do anything including killing the students setting bombs and so forth in order to get his father back.Along side William Tepper is his rebellious friends at the Regis School one in particular is Joey Trotta Wil Wheaton in which this guy holds a troubled past of living in a Mafia family and being sent to The Regis School because of hating his father for who he is and which now he must deal with these terrorists taking over the school so William Joey and there friends must band together to stop these terrorists from violent acts and hazardous tactics.This movie was really awesome and I believe people should notice it more because when people think of a good hostage movie they would say Die Hard and even though I would have to agree with them they need to recognize that Toy Soldiers was a good thriller it sure had my heart beating because the students are my age and I would be scared to confront terrorists like these if they took over our school ... But overall this movie is really worth a good 112 minutes of your time and If I had a decision to rent or buy it... I WOULD BUY IT! I recommend it with a lot of hype! 810".

But overall this movie is really worth a good 112 minutes of your time and If I had a decision to rent or buy it... I WOULD BUY IT! I recommend it with a lot of hype! 810";

In my opinion the plot is captivating. It keeps your attention without having an outrageous story that couldn't possibly happen in real life. I think that everyone would enjoy this movie. Sean Astin always seems to pick the perfect movies to be in that showcase his talent. He's very underrated and doesn't get the recognition that he deserves. Other movies that he has been in other actors have been in the spotlight but this movie and Rudy really showcase him because he is the main character in both. I hope that he someday gets the accolades he deserves for his acting. If you want to see a great movie you need to check this one out and if you are a Sean Astin fan you will definitely like this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the best Bloke movies from the early 90's and whilst slightly dated its one of those movies that would never get made today which makes it very special! In fact a very similar movie was made in the 90's called Masterminds and it was a PG variation on the same theme but it was nowhere near as fun or realistic for that matter.So what's so special about this film? It's the comradre between the main characters and the against all odds theme of the film. Sean Astin is very likable and has starred in some of the most memorable films of the 8090's particularly The Goonies. He also went onto greater things with Rudy and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy but Encino Man is a good trip down memory lane. Will Wheaton from Stand by Me lends nice support to the film and Andrew Divoff is a terrific villain. Louis Gossett Jr sleepwalks in his role but he does add some brevity to the film particularly his relationship with Astin's rebellious nature.So how's the action? By today's standards it's rather tedious and cheap looking almost like a TV movie but the production values are good and the violence is actually quite nasty for a film involving school students. However the director makes up for the limited budget with some nicely suspenseful moments and well placed humor.So park your brain at the door and enjoy this fondly remembered action flick but don't expect Oscar material!".

	schema:reviewBody "Ah the ever popular brat pack type casting line up a selection of young Hollywood faces either on the edge of becoming major stars or falling into obscurity. In this forgotten action thriller its Gomez Addams son Sean Astin and Wil Wheaton who are the main rising stars the rest of the youngsters have fallen by the way side. But unlike some other young gun lineups this film also includes various adult stars to add that bit of quality to the film.Dare I say it? the plot is basically Die Hard in a boarding school? sure it is. Group of terrorists take over a posh school for kids of rich families. Their purpose is solely to see the release of the terrorist leaders father who is some kind of drug kingpin. So its up to this small band of plucky smart ass teens to take back control of their school from the nasty bad guys with automatic weapons.The similarities to that certain Bruce Willis franchise are clear to see. If you take the basic premise of Die Hard and mix it with 'The Goonies' and 'The ATeam' you see what I mean. The teens in the story use their skills knowledge of the school and cheekiness to somewhat outwit the bad guys and slightly disable them for the special ops guys to mop up. There is a very fine line between a happy go lucky boys own adventure flick and in your face bloody squibbed violence which is a bit odd actually.Its difficult to know what the film is trying to be an adult action film or a light hearted teen flick. The young cast are clearly enjoying themselves in their roles which gives off a vibe which clashes badly against the older actors. The bad guys and their leader played menacingly by Divoff are really going for broke and being damn ruthless gunning innocents down and chucking them out of helicopters etc...Problem is these two sides just don't gel too well together seeing Astin playing an older version of 'Mouth' from 'The Goonies' and Denholm Elliot playing an old lovable professor set against Divoff's cold blooded killer feels uncomfortable Divoff really relishing his gritty evil Colombian drug lord role. Its like two different films.Yet despite the moments of bloodshed the action is so predictable and almost childish as it unravels. The special ops guys at the end come across as inept plus there is like a whole army of them and it takes them some time to take out just two bad guys. There are only twelve bad guys and it really feels like there needed to be more to make the ending more exciting. The action and soundtrack was reaching such a crescendo in the finale...but because there are so few bad guys in the end it feels totally deflating. Also the way the special ops storm the school they could of just done that straight away! apparently it would of made no difference.I love how all the Colombian bad guys are dressed up as sweaty dirty vest wearing guerrilla fighters with headbands and lots of stubble. Not too stereotypical then. The very end is also terribly corny and unoriginal surely Divoff could of gone out in a slightly more exciting way?. Oh yeah there's even a crawling in an air duct homage to 'Die Hard'.This was one of those films that I enjoyed back in the day when I was much younger mainly because the young cast were appealing. I kinda looked up to them as I did with other similar brat pack flicks wanted to be them and I was around their age when I first saw it or a bit younger. Looking back now the film isn't really too good its actually really dumb looks silly and has an even sillier title. It sounds predictable I know but it really does feel as if they wanted to make a 'Die Hard' for teens.4.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Toy Soldiers 1991  out of 4 This here is pretty much DIE HARD via a boarding school but if you're a fan of 80s then you're going to find quite a bit here to enjoy. A terrorist group takes over a boarding school full of important kids in hopes that the American government will release the main guy's father who is in prison. Soon the rejects led by Sean Astin and Wil Wheaton must try and figure out a way to bring the terrorist down. If you need brains with your action then it's probably best that you skip this thing but if you just want to have fun then this film offers quite a bit. Most people will remember Astin and Wheaton from THE GOONIES and STAND BY ME among others but if you're fan of those films then you're going to enjoy seeing them grown up and taking on a new adventure. We also have a strong supporting cast that includes Louis Gossett Jr. playing the stern Dean who will certainly remind people of his role in AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN. Also on hand is Jerry Orback playing a Mafia boss and R. Lee Ermey as a General wanting action. The entire cast fit into their roles quite nicely with Astin playing the rebellious teen who must eventually grow up and try to outsmart the terrorist. He has wonderful chemistry with the rest of the boys in the cast and his time with Gossett comes off extremely well and realistic as they go for that fatherson relationship. What also helps the film is that it at least tries to be aboveaverage in terms of story. The way the boys go to get their freedom isn't just a simple plan but instead it's rather well thought out and in the long run the movie at least rises above the type of film you'd expect to see on TV. Director Petrie actually manages to build up some nice suspense towards the end and he handles the material very well. Another major plus is Andrew Divoff who plays the main terrorist and eats up the scenery left and right. When there is action in the film it's bloody just like fans of action want it. The movies biggest problem is that it runs nearly twohours which is a tad bit too long but if you a fan of any of the cast members then you should find yourself having fun with this one.".

The way the boys go to get their freedom isn't just a simple plan but instead it's rather well thought out and in the long run the movie at least rises above the type of film you'd expect to see on TV. Director Petrie actually manages to build up some nice suspense towards the end and he handles the material very well. Another major plus is Andrew Divoff who plays the main terrorist and eats up the scenery left and right. When there is action in the film it's bloody just like fans of action want it. The movies biggest problem is that it runs nearly twohours which is a tad bit too long but if you a fan of any of the cast members then you should find yourself having fun with this one.";

I was born a few years after it came out so of course I didn't go see it in the theaters but im sure I would have if I would have been alive.

So he sends his henchmen to a prep school where the judge's son attends is only to find out that he has been moved out earlier. This doesn't stop them from taking the school hostage and rigging it up to explode.The school is an exclusive prep school for kids who don't settle into other prep schools. I really didn't think there could really be such a school because the exclusive schools are simply that exclusive and it makes me wonder why anybody would go to the effort of making such a school like that.Anyway this is in America and I must admit that I really don't know as much as I think I know. It is not really a problem that it is a prep school for misfits but rather that the school is taken by terrorists and that these kids use all their wits and intelligence to get out of it. These are both smart and gutsy kids and not only manage to outwit the terrorists but the FBI as well.I personally think this is a pretty cool little movie and something that I quite enjoy watching. It isn't as tight and well executed as Die Hard but it is a clone so I wouldn't expect much more.".

Of course the police are outside ready to negotiate while Louis Gossett Jr joins the SWAT in dispatching these goons. Toy Soldiers is thankfully not based on Martika' 1989 single of the same name. Which was unfortunately sampled in Emeinem's worst song However the movie is still an undecidedly unheroic and tedious actioner which doesn't know whether to be action or drama. For instance the climax is bodycount action but in the beginning it is all build up one that never generates any legit suspense as anyone who has seen Die Hard will have seen this and everything Toy Soldiers has to offer. Also Gossett's usually reliable screen presence is trumped for a role where he doesn't do anything but scold and complain. Once again this is very weak stuff and the talented cast deserve better.12 out of 4Poor".

	schema:reviewBody "Being raised at the time this movie was released has probably influenced my shallow mind but still this isn't a bad movie by any means.  It's a movie about a hostage situation involving a prep school populated to some extent by endearing teenage boys who can't seem to get out of trouble. What's wrong with that?  It doesn't have any big special effects but so what?  Who needs special effects?  Cinema's decline began around the same time that special effects were popularized.  A coincidence?  I think not. It turned movies with potentially good plot and feelings and turned them into a big substanceless light show for innocent kids and the selfmedicated.  Well you know not all movies need special effects. About three fourths of the movies on the IMDb top 250 are without special effects but almost all of the Top Grossing movies of all time have some special effects.  Think about it  Star Wars E.T. Ghostbusters etc.  All good movies but the rest of the topgrossing movies are usually cliched tripe with nonsensical plots and lots of eye candy.  Well some movies don't need ny of that junk.Excuse me for going off on a tangent which I normally do but I'm just so fed up with that special effects junk.  Back to the point  Toy Soldiers is simply a great movie.  I admit some of the content is a little corny and ripped off but so what every movie rips off another to some extent. Think of Resovoir Dogs.  Countless appreciation sites dictate the fact that beloved Quentin Tarentino who I admit I like has copied many many many movies in the making of his first major film Reservoir Dogs.  Many say that the entire plot is ripped off almost scene for scene from japanese and chinese gangster movies which Mr. Tarentino loved so much and probably still does.  Sorry once again for the tangent.Toy Soldiers is fun.  It has the whole insubordination from teenagers to unwanted members of authority i.e. hostage takers.  It's fun to see kids take over when they're being held to something they don't want to do. Hell teenage angstinspired rebelion was the key topic to a great majority to 80's comedies.  Plus there's the tension and thrill of having the characters use firearms and knock out the bad guys etc. Plus there's some emotional points to the film.  When one of the characters dies the others have to cope and adjust.  It's not perfect acting but it beats most of the other tripe out there.In short Toy Soldiers is exciting interesting and fun.  How dare you jaded blowhards rate this movie poorly!  Shame on you all!Personal rating 810".

All the guys are great in this one in there own right but the one lead that really stands out is Sean Astin. As far as I'm concerned Astin delivered the performance of a life time at the tender age of 20. His agonizing screams when he's being punished his cries when he's in grief and his ability to portray a flawed defiant character who uses his difiance which usually lands him in trouble as a vehicle to save his fellow classmates and beloved friends is uncanny. And the chemistry between the guys is surreal when watching you feel like they are infact YOUR friends and you've known them for a lifetime. Most notably Sean Astin and Will Wheaton. All that I can say is that this film exceeded my expectations in every way it's a beautifully written and paced film with a gorgeous sexy and smart cast of guys who are really eye candy and a rich compelling storyline. Check it out I promise it will not disappoint!".

It is not boring it just contains great dialogue instead of the usual lame boyfriend girlfriend story where they all try to figure out who to sleep with next or what funny sex scene they can come up with.  It is incredibly sweet and it contains a great performance by the wonderful Claire Forlani.  She is such an incredible actress and no one seems to notice.  The same thing happened with Meet Joe Black because it had wonderful dialogue and no one saw that either.  I think people just don't like movies with any character development that may actually cause you to think about anything other than what will blow up next.  If you want to see something that takes a little effort to understand then go see Boys and Girls.  The dance scene alone is worth the 7.00.".

	schema:headline " One of the best romantic comedies out there";
	schema:reviewBody "Okay technically it was kind of predictable in the case that boy meets girl boy and girl encounter turbulence in relationship and then boy and girl end up back together at the very end of the movie.  However let me ask you this  How else is a romantic comedy suppose to go?  I challenge anyone who isolates this flick's unoriginality as the reason for their dislike to come up with a better overall plot for a romantic comedy.  I think that the writers did an excellent job of adding onto the generic template and making this film enjoyable to watch.  First of all there's the whole thing with fated meetings where the two main characters seem just unable to get away from each other which adds that sweet soul mates ideal even though I personally don't buy into that stuff there is an undeniable charm to the idea.  Then there is the stillunoriginalbutnotyethackneyed idea of attempting a mere friendship between the guy and the girl.  Finally there is the inevitable falling in love the relationship problems and then the falling back in love towards the end of the movie. As a matter of fact the only problem I have with the script is the miniscule hypocrisy found in it at some point in the movie Jennifer states that a romance movie never shows the affect of time on long term relationships and this movie was not an exception as it ends with them making up and going off to live happily ever after.Now we can look at the undeniable chemistry and superb acting of the two main characters Ryan and Jennifer.  The interactions of these two characters is the classic example of not getting along as kids but falling in love as adults.  Freddie Prinze Jr. and Claire Forlani are two of the up and coming celebrities of teen movies and I personally feel that they did their part in this movie by acting well.  Also the principle humor of this movie did not lie in the common slapstick or sexual humor although Jason Biggs does add in those factors hilariously.  I think the main characters came off as more intellectual as one majors in engineering and the other in Latin so the writers aimed more towards clever jokes anecdotes and quip remarks which to me seemed just as hilarious as Jason Biggs's antics.All in all this isn't the BEST movie in the world but it IS definitely a good movie if you want to watch a movie that will make you feel like Love is something real and not just some random idea that people have in their heads.".

The acting is stilted the dialogue is horrid Claire Forlani is miscast as anything but an ice queen and Prinze and Biggs seem like they did a last minute switcheroo in an attempt for both to play against type but Biggs can't play confident and Prinze is too good looking to be believably shy.

Jason Biggs also stands out in his few scenes especially in the one as the credits roll about the Victoria's Secrets models. hilarious! whenever i get to feeling lonely i can always put this movie on and feel better. the music on the movie is really good too. the Jennifer Jennifer song is really catchy. i highly recommend this movie. trying to grade it objectively i'd give it 810 but for me personally it's a 10 all the way.".

A horrible attempt at a horrormovie involving of all things a cow. But as of now whenever I see a really bad movie I'm going to think Well at least it wasn't as bad as Boys and Girls.This movie is about... eh.. two people  a girl and a boy  who bump into each other at random places at regular intervals. And when they do they start a boring conversation that usually ends with them disagreeing over something pointless and parting again. These dialogs are not at all funny not interesting and most of the time they don't make any sense at all.The editing is also confusing. Entire years pass by in a cut without any indication hereof other than the changing hairstyles of the characters. Several breakups take place without you even knowing they were dating in the first place. And the shallowness  oh the shallowness. You will hear dialog resembling So I just got dumped. Are you still with your boygirlfriend because if not we can like hook up. And here I was thinking romantic movies were supposed to have at least some romance.So no romance. And seeing as not a single sentence or scene in this movie was even remotely funny to me I wouldn't call it a comedy either. And the drama kind of disappears when the dialog doesn't make sense and the characters are impossible to sympathize with. That really leaves an hour and a half of absolutely NOTHING.Watch at your own risk.".

Jennifer met Ryan during a trip and they hated each other. Years later they met again and another few years later they became friends.

Roger Kumble made an excellent job with Cruel Intentions' for example Boys and Girls' is charmed sweet and has great lines.

I think anyone who's been in such a relationship can totally relate to this film. Some people will reproach Jason Biggs role that feels too close from American pie and yes that's the movie main flaw but no movie is perfect and this one has not been produced for next year's academy award race. Also what really did surprise me was the great chemistry between Forlani and Prinze Jr. that you can definitely feel. I don't want to spoil it for anyone but the endingeven though predictableis original and very very funny. It's nice to see a film where you sit relax enjoy yourself without having to expect the impossible and just experience it for what it is Fresh and Heart warming.

It stars Freddie Prinze Jr. and Claire Forlani who have been friends since he was twelve. They go through a string of failed romances until the idiot plot brings us to the obvious. Directed by Robert Iscove who made the somewhat better yet nonetheless stupid She's All That. He must be in some sort of desperate casting dilemma to get stuck with Prinze Jr. twice. He is not expanding himself and remains in that constant teen appeal. Forlani is a pretty face in need of material better than this. She seems smarter than the predictable tripe she gets stuck with here. In supporting roles is Jason Biggs who wishes to impress women through lies. My best advice for him is never to admit to being in this film. Amanda Detmer plays Forlani's lesbian roommate. Her sexuality is suppose to make her appear interesting or rebellious but it plainly looks tacked on as if the screenwriter was merely writing a type as oppose to a real human being with a personality beyond anything this film offers. Heather Donahue isn't exactly making a splash after The Blair Witch Project and this will not increase her odds. The film should have examined gender differences. The script should be folded into a paper airplane and darted down a sewer. Score 1  10".

	schema:reviewBody "Ryan Walker Prinze  Jennifer Burrows Forlani have a history that goes way back all the way to the time they met each other randomly on a flight. It continues off and on until college. The only problem is that both are in a relationship and they have contrasting personalities. Jennifer is funny perceptive wise and beautiful. Ryan is an uptight mess that doesn't like to be out of his comfort zone. After a while they become great friends. Things get a bit complicated when they develop feelings for each other. I saw this when it first came out years ago strangely enough I remember digging it. That is far from the case this time around. I was never bored but it's one of the disingenuous romantic comedies I've seen in some time. Nothing in this movie felt genuine at all despite the potential to be so. Right off the bat we get conversations about orgasms and periods. When a romantic comedy pulls out all the stops in the beginning to try to get cheap laughs you know you're in trouble. It tries to be clever and perceptive about the pratfalls of relationships to no avail. Despite the lame start this movie did have potential to be a decent romantic comedy. It doesn't have the cast or the script to pull it off. It's also filled with unfunny slapstick that produces more groans than anything else. The only scene I laughed at is when Jason Biggs fakes being a priest and has a pool ball incident at a bar. That almost had me in stitches. The main problem is that I had trouble empathizing with any of the characters. All of them are rather obnoxious except for Biggs. Freddie Prinze Jr is a good guy in real life but acting should have never been in his calling. His wooden style is painfully obvious. He lacks chemistry with Forlani and really brought the film down. Claire Forlani fares better and has the charm to spare. She's also gorgeous but I felt her character was quite pretentious. There were a couple of times I wanted to smack her. Jason Biggs will never be known as a great actor but I think he's funny. He injected some much needed life with his antics in this movie. The finale is completely clichd and predictable. Forlani's monologue in the end made me cringe with how forced it sounded. Alyson Hannigan is wasted as a brief girlfriend of Prinze's. Amanda Detmer is OK as Forlani's odd friend.I wouldn't exactly call it horrible but it was certainly mediocre for the most part. It comes across as extremely awkward and very phony.

Halfbrothers Doughboy and Ricky Baker are foils for each other's personality presenting very different approaches to the tough lives they face. Ricky is the 'AllAmerican' athlete looking to win a football scholarship to USC and seeks salvation through sports while 'Dough' succumbs to the violence alcohol and crime surrounding him in his environment but maintains a strong sense of pride and code of honor. Between these two is their friend Tre who is lucky to have a father 'Furious' Styles to teach him to have the strength of character to do what is right and to always take responsibility for his actions.";

This is not a hiphop film nor a detached and dehumanized story about gang violence the great oversimplified scapegoat of the issues treated in this film its a story about growing up fatherless or motherless in a war zone with a faceless enemy where people do not value each other's lives at all and value their own lives only slightly more.Laurence Fishburn leads one of the best casts of the early 1990s in his memorable portrayal of Furious Styles a father trying to raise his son Cuba Gooding Jr well in an environment where murder and substance abuse are daytoday realities  South Central L.A. The film follows his son Tre and his friends from the hardships of childhood in an irrelevant educational system and a neighborhood which doesn't allow kids to be kids through to the realities of making decisions about the value of life and the development of responsibility and hope as young adults.The cast disappears into their characters and brings each one to life in a unique and powerful way. losing the identities of big personalities like Fishburne and Ice Cube is no mean feat. Many of the performances recorded here are awardworthy  Fishburne Bassett Chesnutt Gooding and Ice Cube are especially memorable. For me personally this is the film that convinced me that Ice Cube was destined to become a major personality in American cinema. While I had enjoyed some of his music prior to this film it was here that I was first exposed to his versatility and intelligence as an actor. While some may see some of the film's messages as heavyhanded and others might have issues with the fact that the film deals with so many of the problems of innercity life in a very 'inyourface' almost archetypal manner I find these criticisms impossible to justify.This is a great film about real issues sensitively portrayed and thoughtfully examined. Every American who cares about the vast untapped potential of our people ought to take a long hard look at this one. These are not 'black problems' they are everybody's problems and their solutions will require everybody's understanding. I could think of far worse places to begin developing that understanding than Boyz n the Hood.".

The film concentrates on a Black community without the interactions between communities shown in Do the Right Thing another epic race commentary. The direction of the film is fluid and natural the acting heartfelt and strong the affect extraordinary. The message of the movie is deeper than White or Italian based gangland movies because the human aspect and the characters are more solid and approachable and rooted in highly intellectual and applicable theories on race and violence.

The mother of Tre Styles Cuba Gooding Jr. decides to send her son to live with his father Furious Styles Laurence Fishburne after he gets into a fight at school. Furious who lives in the heart of South Central LA is a man that knows the values of how to respect and how to earn it. He's strict but he's fair. Furious works as a mortgage broker.We watch Tre mature from a young boy to his senior year in high school taking the SAT's. His two best friends are brothers. Ricky Morris Chestnut is a great athlete and is getting into college to support his girlfriend and infant son. The other brother Doughboy Ice Cube is headed down a totally opposite path of guns drugs gangs and violence. He's in and out of prison each year.Furious knows that his son could get killed easily as he was once involved with the gang scene himself. He wants Tre to graduate college and be good in whatever his profession may be.As the story goes more in depth we see that even if you aren't involved in a gang you could still be a target. Whether it's your brother cousin sister or other family member that is thee one involved with the violence the main target could be the person in the family who stays away from the dangers of the street.Tre and his friends are in a world where being violent is sometimes the way to live. Helicopters are heard searching for murderers every night. The police are so busy that sometimes a 911 call could mean waiting for the police to arrive. There is even one Blackcop who uses his power to try and intimidate young Blacks who he thinks might be involved in the gangs and violence.This is the ultimate ghetto film which will never be topped. All of the direction and screenplay is brilliant. Singleton doesn't use cheap scenes that get the viewer offtopic and the audience as a whole is always into the movie. Come into a world that most of us haven't been in. Follow the life of one boy who turns into a man as he has to not only goes through personal struggles but has to worry about whether he'll be killed at any moment. Pat1010".

From what I've heard he captured exactly what it was like to grow up in that area. It's a little dated thoughthe guy sucking on the pacifier confuses some people but that was a big fad back in 1991. It's just unbelievable that kids grew up in an area like that and survived. The story itself is a little too simplistic the good and bad brothers and it's basically just the story of a teenager coming of agebut it still works. Singleton wisely doesn't accuse anyone of how the situation is and offers no solutions. He just presents it in a matter of fact way which makes this all the more powerful.The acting is just great. Fishburne and Gooding play a father and son perfectly. Fishburne is just incredibleGooding falters a few times and it's obvious that he's no teenager but he's still very good. Ice Cube is a little one note in his character always angry and sullen but it fits. Chestnut is just great.People should be warnedthere's tons of profanity but that is how kids talk and the ending gets very bloody and disturbing.

I think this movie is quite realistic sad brutal and depressing at the same time. The story about three friends living in the cruel nature of ghetto full of drugs violence gang wars etc. is shown very realistic and without any judgment or statement at the end of the movie because the movie doesn't need that. Boyz n the hood is family drama about nonsense of gang violence but what I like the most is that the movie doesn't show stereotypical characters and environment of the ghetto. The characters in the movie are shown like a people who are trying to escape from the cruel nature of the streets where death awaits. The movie is dealing with a lot of controversial themes racism loss of good friend gang violence unexpected pregnancies violence without any sense and I think that most directors would make this movie cheesy and pathetic but Singelton managed to put together everything together in a beautiful and sad drama about young lives lost in the battle of streets. The three main characters are shown really great I like the fact that Ice Cubes character change his behavior after shooting another gang member  this shows that even the hard boiled gangster like him is thinking about meaning of violence and killing another black brother. That shows that the violence is really just a illusion to solve problems. This also shows that the movie is realistic and doesn't show a life in the ghetto in stereotypical way.All the actors are great from Cuba Gooding Jr. Laurence Fishburne to Ice Cube. I simply love this movie despite the fact I never knew the real life in the ghetto. Masterpiece.".

Furious Styles is a loving father but stern and wise enough to be observant about his surroundings. Cuba Gooding Jr is great as Tre' a somewhat confused but intelligent kid. Ice Cube's best performance next to Fudge in Higher Learning will always be Doughboy. Angela Bassett shines as Tre's caring mother.I like all the gems in this movie like Furious telling Tre' why Black men shouldn't join the army or Furious explaining to the neighborhood in Compton what Gentrification ishell most people don't even know what that is now. The stereotypes in this movie are all too real The mother that loves one son over the other the biased black cop the confused black men and women and crack cocaine. All these things still exist in every ghetto in America that is why Boyz In The Hood is still relevant after all these years!

	schema:headline " Brilliant use of sound engaging script and wonderful character development makes this film better than you think.";
	schema:reviewBody "Boyz 'N the hood is a thoroughly fascinating and deeper than you think look at life in Los Angeles around the early 1980s to early 1990s what the film actually does is look at a life in one of these Los Angeles 'ghettos' and uses it as the backdrop for a wonderful series of filmic events revolving around growing up relations with family and friends racism and the constant threat of violence. The film has a certain aged charm about it and with actors you'd easily recognise today looking very different in 1991 this adds to the feeling. These actorscelebrities are Laurence Fishburne Cuba Gooding Jr and Ice Cube. I was surprised at how everything in this film just managed to pool together and just work. The film doesn't really adopt a neorealistic approach but what it does do is tie together an unpredictable and often heartwarming script great character development and some genuinely entertaining situations that don't let your eyes off the screen. Some examples of this can be when the main group of characters are out for revenge and stalk a rival group whilst they innocently have their meals on the pavement or when the father of then ten year old Tr Gooding Jr. is desperately trying to bring his child up well and teach him the right things he needs to learn whilst we are desperately longing him to listen. The way in which the four main characters in the group also progress bouncing off one another in life and scraps as they try to find their way is not only compelling viewing but the attention to detail by including unnecessary dialogue and real life conversations in real life situations is remarkable. The life in which these people lead is also put across in a very disturbing and realistic way that makes you glad you're not part of what is going on. This is done thanks to visuals and background noise and sound effects. Often a police car siren will begin to wail signalling there's probably been another shooting or crime that has happened there will also be what I presume a police helicopter fly overhead every once in a while  forced into keeping an eye on things and events even though everything's probably fine. This feeling of being trapped and constantly in danger whilst being watched most of the time plays on the character's minds and is relayed onto us in an often effective manner.In terms of visuals there are constant threats and reminders that danger literally lurks around every corner.

	onyx:emotionText "Boyz 'N the hood is a thoroughly fascinating and deeper than you think look at life in Los Angeles around the early 1980s to early 1990s what the film actually does is look at a life in one of these Los Angeles 'ghettos' and uses it as the backdrop for a wonderful series of filmic events revolving around growing up relations with family and friends racism and the constant threat of violence. The film has a certain aged charm about it and with actors you'd easily recognise today looking very different in 1991 this adds to the feeling. These actorscelebrities are Laurence Fishburne Cuba Gooding Jr and Ice Cube. I was surprised at how everything in this film just managed to pool together and just work. The film doesn't really adopt a neorealistic approach but what it does do is tie together an unpredictable and often heartwarming script great character development and some genuinely entertaining situations that don't let your eyes off the screen. Some examples of this can be when the main group of characters are out for revenge and stalk a rival group whilst they innocently have their meals on the pavement or when the father of then ten year old Tr Gooding Jr. is desperately trying to bring his child up well and teach him the right things he needs to learn whilst we are desperately longing him to listen. The way in which the four main characters in the group also progress bouncing off one another in life and scraps as they try to find their way is not only compelling viewing but the attention to detail by including unnecessary dialogue and real life conversations in real life situations is remarkable. The life in which these people lead is also put across in a very disturbing and realistic way that makes you glad you're not part of what is going on. This is done thanks to visuals and background noise and sound effects. Often a police car siren will begin to wail signalling there's probably been another shooting or crime that has happened there will also be what I presume a police helicopter fly overhead every once in a while  forced into keeping an eye on things and events even though everything's probably fine. This feeling of being trapped and constantly in danger whilst being watched most of the time plays on the character's minds and is relayed onto us in an often effective manner.In terms of visuals there are constant threats and reminders that danger literally lurks around every corner. Tr attempts to take some food from one house and walk it about a hundred yards back to his own for his father but along the way is greeted by a car containing a few 'gang bangers' possessing a sawn off shotgun that is consequently aimed at him. He also manages to save a child that had escaped from its mother from getting run down in the road  it turns out the mother has just too many to deal with and very solemnly shuts the door on Tr without much of a 'thank you'.

	schema:reviewBody "I appreciated the performances from Laurence Fishburne and Cuba Gooding Jr. in this. They were both very good. I would also give credit to director John Singleton. This was his first movie and he coaxed good performances from the entire cast making me a little bit surprised that he hasn't really directed much of note since then. The movie opens with captions offering a sobering look at life in the hood and then proceeds offer us a look at that life in this black neighbourhood of Los Angeles where violence drug addiction and a general feeling of hopelessness is an everyday reality. That look is offered mostly through the character of Tre Gooding  a young man who seems to keep out of trouble for the most part but watches as his friends and neighbours often get sucked in to what's going on around them.Tre was perhaps too good for my liking. As the movie begins Tre as a young boy is sent to live with his father Fishburne so that his mother can finish her education and his father can teach him how to be a man. Frankly Tre seemed to me too easy to teach. He really didn't seem to be much of a challenge for his dad. Perhaps a bit more emphasis on the relationship between Tre and his dad would have given the movie a bit more intensity. That's what seemed to be basically lacking for me. Until quite near the end of the movie I wasn't finding this especially intense. I found it sad  especially the brief glimpse of the drug addicted mother who let her baby wander into the streets and didn't really seem to care all that much  but not really intense. That does change near the end of the movie especially with the story of Ricky Morris Chestnut  a talented young football player who has a chance to get out with a football scholarship to USC. But up to that last half hour or so I wasn't really finding this movie especially powerful.Perhaps the intensity was lacking because the movie is more than 20 years old and is a bit dated or more likely perhaps as a white person I simply can't relate to the environment that was being depicted. Whatever the reason though that lack of intensity and personal connection with the movie and characters in spite of the good performances pulls this down a notch or two for me. 510".

Like the protagonist Tre Gooding Jr. Singleton lived with his mother played by Angela Bassett in the film for his first years and was sent to his father's Laurence Fishburne when she felt the place she was living in wasn't suitable for the 10 yearold and it was about time his dad taught him how to be a man. The other protagonists Ricky Chestnut and Doughboy Cube are half brothers who couldn't be more different Ricky is their mother's favorite the athlete pursuing a football scholarship to USC and their mom's pride and joy while Doughboy is the overweight overlooked 17 yearold excon.Boyz N the Hood starts with sad statistics One out of every 21 black males will die of murder most of them at each other's hands. Singleton who was only 23 when the film was made he became not only the youngest ever Oscar nominee for Best Director but also the first African American to be nominated in that category only this year another African American would be nominated Lee Daniels of Precious exactly 18 years later told a story of how the reality of one's environment and upbringing are definitely huge factors in how one's personality and life choices are shaped andor limited yet it still remains one's own struggle in the end. The rebellion here is the struggle to get out of a rotten environment you alone aren't strong enough to change without being killed by it before then. It's a struggle only those who have been there know entirely and for those of us who are fortunate enough to have been raised in better or at least not as violent environments we can imagine and analyze through statistics but not with an inner understanding of what living in such reality is like  lucky us. In that sense Singleton's film reminds me of Fernando Meirelles's masterpiece City of God 2002 which presents an even tougher scarier reality in Brazilian favelas which as a Brazilian myself I can tell you it's all true sadly. The musical score is corny and easily the weakest link in the film and some moments seem clichd and contrived but you can't deny the impact and overall honesty of this brutal effort from this young director. Not as multilayered or even ambitious as Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing but still a film that remains relevant in 2010. 8.510.".

	schema:reviewBody "Movies like this raise the question of whether movies are most important as arts of work on their own terms or as social statements made to have an impact on the world. Just by habit I tend to lean towards the first view and I would guess that most filmmakers do as well since directors generally seem wary of discussing their work in terms of messages. But obviously not John Singleton in the very first shot of Boyz n the Hood the camera pushes towards a stop sign until it looms over the audience. This image sets the mood for the rest of the film which has a strong impact that as contradictory as this might seem is somewhat blunted by the lack of subtlety. It belongs to that group of movies that probably stem most directly from Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets a film that showed how talented young directors could make a splash with a debut set on their own home turf particularly home turf far removed from the mainstream of American society. Not that Boyz n the Hood is anywhere as good as Mean Streets but then I don't think that Singleton's main goal is to top Scorsese he has a point to make. It's about the poverty and violence infesting SouthCentral L.A. with three main characters representing the basic options available to a young black man from that background. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays Tre whose father Furious Styles Laurence Fishburne is determined to raise him with the selfrespect and discipline to avoid a life of crime and violence. His friend Ricky Baker Morris Chestnut isn't as smart but hopes to get into college on an athletic scholarship. Doughboy meanwhile is already immersed in gang life. The main performances are strong particularly from Ice Cube whose character is in man ways the most interesting possessing the selfawareness his life is headed nowhere but not the will to do anything about it. At his strongest Singleton creates a powerful bleak portrait of a community under siege from guns drugs poverty and general hopelessness and he immerses you in this world as well so that you share with the characters the same sense that all of the exits have been closed off. Whether or not you agree with all of the specific points that Singleton is trying to make Boyz is unquestionably strong as a statement and a piece of reporting. It's far from a great piece of filmmaking the music is intrusive and poorly done and the story is overly melodramatic it's not enough that one character has to be murdered to show the tragedy of gang violence his friends then have to dump his bloody corpse in his living room so that we can see his mother's and his girlfriend's hysterical grief. But melodrama isn't really the main problem it's more that Singleton's determination to get his message across frequently overwhelms his determination to tell a good story with believably individual characters. Too often the characters seem to be speaking to the audience instead of each other sometimes to the extent that I expected them to turn towards the camera and issue a final warning. But for all of my criticisms of the movie in the end I'm not sure how much they mean because Singleton's focus as I've already said really doesn't seem to be on creating great art. If the success of a film is to be measured by whether it accomplishes what it sets out to do rather than by one's enjoyment of it than I think Boyz n the Hood would have to rate as a solid achievement.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think that how good you find a film like Boyz N The Hood will ultimately depend on what you expect from it. The write up for this film suggests that it's going to be a deep and gritty film that explores the seedy underbelly of South Central. It also suggests that the characters involved will discuss various fundamental issues affecting their daily lives. I'm sorry but if this is true then I clearly must have watched another film....This film does not explore its characters and doesn't even really explore the violence within South Central. It basically goes from scene to scene with all the 'kids' cussing each other and being disrespectful to their 'ho's'. Then thrown into the mix we have a million fbombs and lots of shouting. The major problem with Boyz N The Hood is that for the most part it has an aimless meandering feel to it where for most of its running time you never feel as though it's going anywhere. The dialogue exchanged between the characters is at best poor and at worst irritating. The relationships between the characters are poorly established particularly between Tre and Furious and this is unforgivable as this should have had much more focus than it actually did. Many of the characters are dull clichs with the exception of Ricky and Furious. I've got to be totally honest and admit that I was bored for most of this film and considered switching it off at one point.There is one scene that was truly effective in this film and that was the scene where Ricky gets gunned down in a driveby shooting. I actually found that scene very moving because Ricky was a likable individual  a family man who was on the verge of a scholarship. It was even more sad when you realise that he was always the one that kept out of trouble and was merely 'guilty by association'. I was genuinely moved by that scene and sadly that was the only good scene in the film.Of course this sets up the revenge aspect that we see in the final act and I only wish that Singleton would have focused more on the rivalry we saw towards the end rather than tedious melodrama that I had to endure for most of the running time.Boyz N The Hood is a good film that's trapped inside a terrible screenplay. Although its message is obvious from the start this still could have been a very good film if Singleton would have made the main story more compelling. As it is the tedious melodrama and dull and meandering nature of the narrative really killed this for me. Aside from the one effective scene I found Boyz N The Hood a very hard film to care about.".

The write up for this film suggests that it's going to be a deep and gritty film that explores the seedy underbelly of South Central.

First Tre comes back from a night of hanging out and shows up at his girlfriend's house has a nervous breakdown and she instantly without discussion gives him what she had so vehemently denied him earlier in the movie. Do we have any idea why? That was just an excuse to add the one element of appeal that makes up for what the movie is lacking. It's the oldest trick in the book. Then when the shooting occurs the victim is dragged into the house and on sight of him his girlfriend screams but we're reminded of the attempts at acting that are characteristic of a low budget horror film. It was pretty weak.Anyway the morals the premise and some of the performances are pretty good but overall this movie is corny and satirical.".

He hooks back up with his friends  loser gangbanger Doughboy and athletic college hopeful Rick.  Tre finds that the hood is full of traps for the young men therein and must decide how he wants to live his life with guidance and hindrance from his father and his friends.It's hard to remember now but this film was the one that created a series of copies and spoofs some of which were better or more hard hitting but they all suffered because they held to cliches that this film created. I.e. the babyfather trap the college kid having his dreams crushed etc.  The plot now suffers because we know it is all a clich  but with fresh eyes it is powerful and realistic for many.  Singleton may be a flash in the pan but this was his flash and he directs well  only occasionally going OTT dramatically with slowmo etc.The young cast are all very good.  Gooding Jr delivers a good if nave performance and Ice Cube proves that not all rappers have to be rubbish actors in poor comedies'.  Fishburne is as powerful as ever in a small role but Angela Bassett has little to do with her small role.  Long is one of my favourite actresses and she's really good here.  Many of the cast do fall into caricatures but it's best to ignore that as much as you can.Overall a great film that suffers now because it has been copied so much that it looks like a clich itself.  However with fresh eyes this is a powerful film with only a few weaknesses.".

Visually stunning as well.  Clearly better than Director Singleton's attempt to make something special with Janet Jackson Poetic Justice.  Boyz was not bad at all for his first shot at writing and directing.  Fishburne Gooding and Cube no I don't mean Cuba Gooding are superb.  Angela Basset is pretty good too.What's sad is that few acknowlege this film's blatant ripoff of Steven King's novella The Body better known as the film Stand by Me.Nice little details to the plot include prized sportsrelated possessions given to the kids by the family members whose memories they treasure.  The cruel environment they live in though can take these items away without a second thought.  In this cruel world parents also play favorites to the extreme of loving one child and not loving another.There's other stuff I've neglected to mention in the interest of preventing boredom for the reader.  Both gangs of children don't journey down the railroad tracks because one child offers You guys wanna go see a dead body?  Is Singleton making a statement that in his movie it's not as life changing an experience for the boy witnesses as it is in King's work?  That Singleton's kids are already jaded to such a thing and that they've already lost their innocence?  Since he didn't acknowlege as far as I know any homage to Stand by Me in making this film I doubt he really gave this a lot of thought.All in all though Singleton has never again achieved this level of cinema and that may be because he has never since borrowed so much from another film.  Perhaps it is Poetic Justice that Singleton has yet to match the greatness of his first and only masterpiece.  Perhaps he lacks originality perhaps not.  It'll be interesting to see if this guy can make something really good with out Puff Daddying it.".
