He has armed a small group  the Exterminators  with guns as Zardoz's philosophy is that killing is good and procreation is the root of all that is bad. In reality Zardoz is Arthur Frayn from a competing more advanced race called the Eternals who live in paradise in the Vortex. The Eternals truly are immortal as they do not age and their bodies undergo reconstruction if they die. As such they truly do not believe in procreation as their society has reached perfect equilibrium. Past human acts such as sex and sleep are obsolete in their advanced state.

I wonder if Boorman came up with Excalibur at the same party. Visually there is a similar thread in both films. One is just a whole lot more coherent than the other. At first viewing Zardoz makes no sense at all but is so wonderfully weird so out there that you stare at it in disbelief. How did they get James Bond to run around Northern England in his undies? Why is the bread green? What's with the magic marker mustache? These are the types of questions that come to mind and keep you wading through the mess on the screen. The questions keep your mind occupied while your eyes feast on state of the art 70's futuristic concepts. It's as brilliantly fascinating as a 10 car freeway pileup and you can watch it with considerably less guilt.Everything is so beautifully perfectly confusing in this film that it was with a heavy heart that I had to admit after the 4th viewing that it DOES MAKE SENSE. I will not spoil the fun for anyone else but the whole thing really does come together. I can only say that you should enjoy the cacophony while it lasts because once you get the film's storyline it's not half as fun. Though there are still some great lines of dialogue left I'm voting for him Monster being my favourite.In any case viewing the film from a 21st century perspective reminds me that back in the 70's some very original idea based SF movies could be made with a fittingly large budget. Some of these films have become classics which is more than I can say for the bigbudget nobrainer crap that mostly comes out of Hollywood nowadays.I wholeheartedly recommend Zardoz for those who can admit to cinephilic guilty pleasures!".

Don't be a fascist about it!I will not go into details but I will comment on themes in the movie hence a slight spoiler warning The reason for my giving Zardoz 10 stars is that I truly believe this to be a movie of extreme artfulness and originality and intellectual as well as entertainment value.That said it is not a movie I can bring myself to watch as often as say Jurassic Park or Pulp Fiction. There is no doubt that this is not a movie that could possibly be to everybody's liking and there is nothing wrong with being unable to enjoy it.But personally I do love it for several reasons  about as many reasons as there are ideas shoveled unto each other in the movie.When this movie came out the press reviewers tended to agree that Zardoz is extremely artistic  overly so handling almost too many themes and perspectives  and here's a bit of the key to the puzzle too rightwing if the reviewers were leftwing or too leftwing if the reviewers were rightwing.This is rather funny and says something about the movie The truth of the matter is it criticizes capitalism and socialism with equal fervor. If anything it suggests an apolitical humanism instead. But the reviewers in all cases saw their own political views ridiculed and commented about it without realizing that the opposition was under equal attack.As I saw it the first time back in the 70's I found the following things rather obvious1 Zardoz is a 70's movie with a cheesy style that deliberately parodies contemporary movies. The more or less hippie ideals found in other scifi movies at the time are ridiculed in Zardoz Most of the action takes place in The Vortexes closed cities where the enlightened and privileged dress in a mix of yoga class and pseudoEgyptian styles live on ecological produce hold weareallequal round table group meetings use crystals as containers to store knowledge and even have a sort of artificial reincarnation system.These enlightened people are decadent thinblooded sexless and bored out of their wits. And they are a perfectly acidic parody of 70's new age culture and socialism and feminism.2 BUT  at the same time the Vortexes are sanctuaries for the privileged upper class idling away while the outside world populace suffers and toils. And thus they are also an acidic comment on the relationship between the privileged and the nonprivileged countries or classes both apply. The underlying hypocrisy of the spiritual enlightenment of the privileged seems to be one of the more important themes of the movie. Neither socialism nor capitalism seems to sit well with director John Boorman.In this setting Zardoz tells a story of individual rebellion or not so so individual after all but that's yet another detail and thus plays on its clear main theme A profound doubt in culture and civilisation and a belief that personal life defined by sex love death violence and intellectual achievement is the real and true nature of human existence.If that sounds a bit much let me assure you that is is The scopes of Zardoz' existentialist theme is the main reason why the movie can feel chaotic as if it wants do do too much at the same time. But this is also part of the fun and the art Zardoz raises lots of questions and offers only family life and personal experience as a sort of preliminary answers.Zardoz plays on several literary and philosophical themes and like the philosopher Nietzsche whom I believe to be a direct source for inspiration comments on everything it can think of at an almost chaotic pace.Add to this the combination of genre parody political and social satire and you do get something that is indeed difficult chaotic  but also extremely unique and original.Most users and comments seem to believe that the cheesiness of the movie in unintentional. I don't I think Boorman had great fun in making Zardoz look so awfully 70's that is awfulness completely overshadows other movies from that time. I also think that Connery looks to be enjoying himself extremely in this movie for the very same reason.There is no real conclusion to this only  I hope  a few perspectives that may help you when or if watching this movie.If you get a headache watching Zardoz I understand.If you got a headache reading this review I apologize But if at any point you as much as smirked  DO give Zardoz a try. You can always turn it off  it really IS too much anyway.Oh and I for one DO want a bluray of this. It IS a counterpart to Excalibur in several ways and wonderfully goodlooking in all its awful cheesiness  a bit like the 80's Flash Gordon.".

It is a film for people who aren't perturbed by a lack of surface glitz in science fiction and can take on the underlying meanings about immortality or the fear of death that other films rarely raise. Some of it doesn't make sense but only if you are not paying attention. In my view it gets straight to the point without any polish which some people are uncomfortable about in any artform. It is not made for Star Trek fans. It is a bleak and powerful story about a cabal of ineffectual immortals who play God to an inferior but more vigourous race and who long for death yet cannot die. They stealthily invite one of these inferiors Connery into their midst to solve their problems. The final scenes are extremely striking and are set to the 2nd movement of Beethoven's 7th symphony. You just don't hear this symphony enough in the movies. I recommend this film to anyone who likes science fiction with a small sf.".

Zardoz did not disappoint me.  The question of what would happen to mankind if all our physical needs were met and we were thereby allowed to expand intellectually is fascinating.  We are constantly striving to make life easier better and to live longer.  Do we really need a struggle to exist or is it merely a leftover animalistic aspect of our evolution?  Personally I like living in a climate controlled surrounding versus a cave where I have to kill something with my bare hands in order to eat.  For what it's worth I saw it again as a middle aged adult and I am still impressed with some of the concepts of the movie.  My 13 year old daughter was not so much impressed.  I'd still give it a good review and wouldn't mind owning it for my personal collection.  I guess it takes a scifi geek to not be so bored with it and of course a bare breast thrown in gets my attention just as it did back in 1974.".

The word plays picture plays and complex storyline at 3.00 am in the morning were extremely entertaining. The basic themes it pretends of elites vs worker slaves the boredom of eternal life the decadence of  forced idleness the pureness of the macho noble savage  are all interwoven in a Midsummer Nights fantasy futuristic world. I have to explain it is British so the special effects  were limited . However this left the actors with parts to act.  Quite simply Zardoz was great especially the name and how it unfolds. This was despite the fact even then we knew who would eventually win.. and the Union cinema was not Dolby.I saw it again in the 90's and I was rather depressed somehow my memory of  great film was overwritten. It seemed so pretentious. John Alderton seemed fresh out of please sir' Sean Connery at bit too macho etc etc. The whole thing so terribly  amateur.  The cast of typecast British TV  Movie stars waffling through some clever student scifi  1984cumBrave New World thing brought to screen with a bad script.. Mind you I thought  similar things about Oh Lucky man the 2nd time around. It was rather like seeing an old flame many years later somehow the chemistry was gone and perhaps love is blind.I saw it again recently and well I think I have it back. Perhaps  with all these cloning' and geneticengineering' stories being now topical. I seemed to have recaptured the initial feelings. I have thought about these two extremes  To enjoy this movie one needs to regain the feeling of being entertained by actors in a  Play.  Zardoz more like a fantasy play than a SciFi movie. The imagery is excellent the themes of immortals and mortals still a relevant possibility  for the  future.  There are gaps that we need to bridge over with our own imaginations and yes we do have to get over the feeling that Q' will pop up as John Cleese.. But bridging that gap was nearly always the case in a play. Connery really does act despite his costume.The part with the crystal continues to excite my imagination.  I still love the part in the old public library and his macho strutting don't seem so out of place in a fantasy.  The sexual chemistry with the immortal maidens doesn't seem so sexist anymore. His character seems well fitted to the time and place and to me at least it is easy to believe his curiosity led him into the idol.I think with these type of films  where you extend the script in your head they are so different from  the scifi  fantasy genre of today  you either love them or leave them. There is very little middle ground.  So for a period piece that has not lost its charm.   Zardoz has place on my shelf of fantasy greats.".

	schema:reviewBody "I hope I've quoted that correctly from John Boorman's audio commentary.I never understood why on earth John was doing this film at the time. What about the 70s made him do so? I still having listened to his commentary cannot say. Normally people only become absorbed by the thought of dying when they are about to face it Parsifal is a pretty good example for that. Zardoz is a desperate manifesto made with the utmost urgency at least that how it feels. Boorman chose it as his heart's revelation about the need to die.Another line of the commentary stuck in my mind the one about religions having  as a secondary purpose at least  the function to control people by the idea of an afterlife. I don't really believe that he was quoting Marx here. It's a blind guess but I think he was hinting to something like that the absence of evolution and the wish for eternal existence cause each other. Sterility... everything's just too clean and nice and beautiful a mentality that strives for heaven on earth while forgetting that heaven is just the consolation for those who don't understand what it means to live thus killing of life were that the 70s?I don't remember it I am too young. The film was made with a million dollars not bad. It certainly has nice photography. A proposes lots of theses most of them simply wrong especially the one concerning the necessity to sleep and it has lots of rather simple... inflatables. Still the mixture of new and old here is much nicer than in Star Wars for example. What can you expect for a million? I think the visual outcome is great! And though the story picks up many ideas lots of them silly it doesn't lose its theme mortality and the need for it. Everything directly concerning that is deep and serious. So I'll forgive those minor hickups.For me by far the best Boorman yes one of the greatest films of all time. As Schopenhauer said... if you look at a genius don't look at his smallest accomplishments but at his biggest. And so you should look at this film too.".

I still having listened to his commentary cannot say. Normally people only become absorbed by the thought of dying when they are about to face it Parsifal is a pretty good example for that. Zardoz is a desperate manifesto made with the utmost urgency at least that how it feels.

	schema:reviewBody "'Zardoz' is the kind of fantasy which tends to be overrated by some underrated by many. It came out when science fiction cinema consisted mainly of bleak visions of tomorrow such as 'A Clockwork Orange' 'No Blade Of Grass' 'Soylent Green' and even the 'Planet Of The Apes' series. 'Star Wars' came along in 1977 and everything changed.Set in a postatomic future where Mankind has divided into two factions  the Brutals who practice violence and worship a flying stone head called 'Zardoz' and the Eternals who possess immortality and psychic powers. Zed an Exterminator  Sean Connery  becomes curious about Zardoz and after hiding away in its mouth is taken back to its point of origin. The Eternals live in the Vortex a sort of technohippie commune guarded by a force field. Zed is regarded as a freak and used for scientific study by May  Sara Kestleman . But his presence in the Vortex has been planned  weary of living forever the Eternals wish Zed to relieve them of their monotonous existences. He does so but keeps Consuela  Charlotte Rampling  alive and the film ends on an optimistic note with the birth of their son.Written and directed by John Boorman fresh from the hugely successful 'Deliverance' 'Zardoz' was made in Ireland in 1973 on a low budget and is a visually arresting experience. Like Godard's 'Alphaville' it overcomes its limitations. The first thirty or so minutes are powerful as we enter a world that is terrifyingly staggering. The sight of the openmouthed 'Zardoz' flying across the countryside is enough to induce nightmares. But it grows cluttered as Boorman unwisely tries to get as many messages across as possible. The Vortex was created by scientists who having achieved their goal of immortality have become apathetic. The last forty minutes or so minutes are tough going but ultimately rewarding. The scene where Zed tells May how he came to realise 'Zardoz' was fake  he had read 'The Wizard Of Oz' in a children's library  is wonderful.Yes Connery goes through the whole movie in a loin cloth  luckily he was in good physical shape back then  but gives a strong performance. Charlotte Rampling is a stunning 'Consuela' and John Alderton  of 'Please Sir!'  sports a curly blonde wig in the role of 'Friend'.I have watched this many times and do not claim to understand every word but the basic theme  one man standing out from the crowd to get at the truth  is unmistakable. 'Zardoz' hails from a time when film makers were free to experiment with ideas and not restricted by the need to dumb down their work in order to achieve popular success.".

	schema:reviewBody "Zardoz is written and directed by John Boorman the director of Deliverance and Point Blank. There is no point in trying to describe the plot or story of Zardoz which is very weird and strange piece of film. It stars Sean Connery as brute among greater and wiser people who have also developed a way to live forever. The film is set in future and there are many things that are impossible to describe or write down. The less you know about the story and plot of Zardoz the better.The film's main point is that humans are primitives and brutes that are only hiding under their civilized surface and society. Zed Connery is loathed because of his animalism but soon it turns out that the more they hate him the more they become like him. The film is pretty philosophical and needs to be watched with brains since there are many issues under its science fiction film oriented surface. The film tells also something about immortality and asks is it after all as great thing as we may think. In the film there are those who have lived many hundreds of years and gained all the possible knowledge about everything. They have become sad and bored it is not so great to live forever especially once we see our real face what Connery's character in the film reflects. Some have said that the film is artificially philosophical but that is not true the subject matters the film tells with great optimism though! are as topical and important as they were back then when Boorman wrote this film.The film could have been very cynical and pessimistic but it is not. Boorman tells the story with great optimism and most importantly with humor. Zardoz is very funny at times but with clever way and many will not understand the film and its satiric elements. For me the film was fantastic and pleasant with all its themes and merits. The film is also shot fantastically and MUST be seen in widescreen or in the big screen. The cinematography is gorgeous and the gorgeous landscapes were shot in Ireland and near Boorman's house. The film is occasionally little slow moving and repeats itself but there are no other negative points I can say about this satiric classic.Zardoz has deserved its cult status and it is great to see James Bond in little different role. Zardoz is way too difficult for many viewers and so the film is easy to hate and laugh at for those who don't understand it. I give Zardoz 810 and really smiled after the viewing. This will not leave your mind too soon if you just manage to understand the film and see into its core.".

Have audiences really dumbed down that much since the 70s?ZARDOZ is a bold original film with amazing imagery and philosophical underpinnings. This is not just another candy coated overbloated computer generated merchandizing scifi piece of cp that Hollywood has been churning out in droves the last 10 years  thank God!. This is REAL science fiction one of only a half dozen REAL science fiction films ever made. This is a movie that moves at a mature pace and challenges the viewer's intellect. If you bother to look closely you will see that ZARDOZ explores nihlism existentialism and even zen buddhism. It presents one of the most original visions of the future ever put to film. It is wonderful in its weirdness.If you only see Sean Connery running around in a loin cloth and some bare breasted women then by all means continue to wear your Jar Jar Binks underwear and plunk down money for cp like Mission to Mars.Okay perhaps I'm being a tad bit condescending to those who don't share my tastes. But it just disturbs me profoundly that the market for thought provoking science fiction films is being killed by kiddie cp and the people who pay to see it. Maybe the internet will open up avenues for independent filmmakers to make movies like ZARDOZ again.".

Once you accept not understanding everything right now just relax and follow the images and sounds and you are ready for the Childhood of Ivan. As I said before the film uses many ellipses to show Ivan's fractured life  he plays in the fields his mother calls him and smiles a water well he stares down at the water and his mother stands beside him and tells a story about the stars we hear a gun shot someone lying on the grass Ivan is wading through a swamp to reach a soviet army unit.The war is not shown at all  it is suggested. We only see the enemy soldiers once for a brief moment. And two hanged men is all there is to denounce the carnage of the war. The rest is suggested by unfinished speeches by faces where pain is followed right after by the desire to live and be happy......Ivan's memories His mother his sister and their games the beach the sea and the rain his captivity  his life a broken life. Nothing remained for him in life but to fight  to fight against the enemy that had taken everything from him.I repeat that Childhood of Ivan is not a partisan film it doesn't try to demonize the adversaries. I would call it much more an intimist film somewhat in the vein of Les Jeux Interdits but Ivan's childhood was over after the horrors he had to go through his only way to survive as a human being was to fight the horror that had crippled his life while the children of Les Jeux Interdits went on with their children games in spite of the war. France because of her fast surrender was preserved from the butchery inflicted on the Soviet Union.I recommend this film to everyone who wants to see a paradoxically sad beautiful reflexive and passionate film.".

The dream sequence with the apples though brilliantly done seems derivative.

The key performance comes from Ivan himself a fine effort from one so young and indeed Tarkovsky used him again in the bell section of Andrei Rublev although he used rather harsh methods to get the performance he wanted in that case. Obviously influenced by Dreyer you see the beginnings of Andrei's obsession with water and it's reflective calm around more tempestuous events. His use of black and white stock in terms of lighting is exemplary.The film's title is ironic as Ivan does not have a childhood but the films majestic and moving final shot suggests that Ivan does receive a kind of immortality beyond the bleak finality of his discovered photo in Berlin that the Russian spirit itself cannot be stifled and will ultimately run free.".

	schema:reviewBody " out of Ivan's Childhood is Tarkovsky's debut feature film about a 12 year old boy who volunteers to fight in the front lines against the German invasion because his family where murdered by Nazis. His size and height make him the perfect spy for the Russians as he slides his way across muck and swamp to bring back vital information about the German offence that no other man can achieve. At the same time his commanding officers object to this boy being used as a tool of war but have no control over the matter because of Ivan's convictions to bring down those that killed his parents.Shot in beautiful monochrome the camera never ceases to capture nature religion dreams and love  all of which are major elements in any Tarkovsky film. This motion picture is one of the most stunning independent movies you will ever see.Sometimes Ivan cries like the child he is but this is not because of the burden of war but because he can not do what he wants most  to avenge the death of his family. Other times he is like a General in the making  standing up to his commanders spitting orders back at them making other soldiers look pale in comparison and walking into the fray without any fear attached. The dichotomy of his fractured personality is evident the most when he is alone. One moment he is dreaming of his mother the next he is stalking the ghost of a Nazi murderer in the room where he sleeps which is one of the most disturbing scenes in this film.The final sequence in the ruins of Berlin fully brings home the impact of the film's premise. This is a story about Ivan's Childhood and that is exactly what you get. Heart wrenching from the first frame to the last and never equalled. To think this was all made in 1962!  Shocking cinema at its very best.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first fulllength feature film by the great Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky caused a sensation when it was released and shown at Venice Film Festival in 1962 where it won the Golden Lion. The world had not seen such a powerful motion picture about war and what it does to the youngest and weakest  the children. It is a bleak haunting and horrifying portrait of lost innocence and the childhood that was interrupted the very day the boy's family was murdered. Although Ivan survived physically he was changed forever not a boy but a man who looked in the eye of triumphant death and horror. The film introduces young Nikolai Kolya Burlyaev in the fascinating performance as Ivan. Ivan's Childhood is a screen adaptation of the story by a Russian writer Vladimir Bogomolov Ivan which is a fiction story but it is based on the real facts. Millions young boys and girls perished during the endless days months and years of the worst war of the last century. Bogomolov fought as a soldier during the WWII. He was only 15 years old but he had forged his papers  added two years dropped from his school and joined the Army. He had been seriously wounded three times but survived and finished the war in Berlin  the 19 year old soldier with six medals for courage and heroism. He was a very good writer and I love his books Moment of Truth In the August of 1944 and Zosya that were also adapted to very good movies in Russia.".

	schema:headline " a powerful piece of poetic filmmaking for the disillusionment and disorientation surrounding young Ivan";
	schema:reviewBody "Ivan's Childhood Andrei Tarkovsky's first substantial feature as director he previously made a short of the Killers and a 45 minute student film is a nearmasterpiece of adolescence shredded to pieces in subjective perception. It's set in world war 2 with 12 year old Ivan's family killed by the Nazis and his alliance with the Russian soldiers as a scout able to sneak past into small spaces more to do with vengeance than real patriotism. By the time we see him he's a torn figure someone who at 12 looks and acts like he's already come of age by force and that this deep down has left him in a disparaging state of mind pushing it away through temper he won't go to military school he tells his superiors and only with the slightest escape through dreams. But in these dreams he's also tormented by his past in fragments that hint to the psychological trauma through abstractions of a splash of water hitting across the dead body of his mother while Ivan is at the bottom of a well or in the natural and happy surroundings of a truck carrying fruits. One sees in this the only spots of innocence left in Ivan's life the pinnacle and one of Tarkovsky's most breathtaking scenes ever filmed the final dream on the beach with Ivan and his sister running along the sand. In this nature smiling faces the filtering of the background of the forest Ivan's Childhood is starkly incredible.The 'real' world as depicted to be sure is jagged torn apart in dark marshes and forests and with trenches dug for a long while and flares and cannon fire always in the air. It seems almost not to be entirely real or as real as should be 100 truthful to battlefronts. But it's also for the most part sometimes it shifts to the adult soldiers like Kholin and Galtzev through Ivan's point of view and so this world around him that is ripped to shreds and bulletstrewn and deadened is amplified a little. There's a curious evocative scene where Ivan left alone in a dark floor of a house with a flashlight goes around looking at the messages scribbled frantically as final notes from partisans and it veers inbetween dream and reality where it could go either way depending on Ivan's mental state as fragile as his physical condition. He finally bursts into tears exhausted. It's this wild meddling with what Ivan sees or experiences or thinks and secretly fears through his wouldbe tough exterior that makes him so compelling and heartbreaking as played by Kolya Burlyayev with a sharp level of bravery not even JeanPierre Leaud was this absorbing albeit on different dramatic terrain.It's a given that it was not Tarkovsky's project to start with and ala Kubrick and Spartacus came in after a director had been let go to finish the picture. While it is remarkable to see how Tarkovsky does make it his vision and quite an ambitious one considering how expansive the production design gets and the technical daring taken with his director of photography Vadim Yusov and how there's a fresh and often original eg dream scenes placement of the camera the scene in the postwar house looking at the records of the departed perspective that no one else would have given it there are small parts of the story that could have been dealt with a little better edited or cut out altogether. The character of Masha played practically with one expression practically cause of the moment after she is kissed on her face is a little unnecessary or rather more of a means for Tarkovsky to practice some technical ideas in the forest scene which really leads nowhere and how her reemergence later in the film also doesn't serve much of a purpose. Maybe there's a point to be made about women in the army at the time as she's an object of desire less much of an effective nurse but when seeing her scenes which aren't bad exactly one wants to get back to Ivan and the central plot.But as mentioned one has to know that as a Tarkovsky picture what doesn't work doesn't matter so much as what does and Ivan's Childhood is often staggering in its depiction of the brutality on the mind and consciousness not just through Ivan but through his adult counterparts and about how in a time when life can be taken away in an instant almost without a sound clinging to a past however surreal is all that can matter. There's truths reached about the devastation of war on the young and those who care for them that wouldn't be in a more naturalistic setting and it's Tarkovsky's triumph that he steers it into the realm of a consistent poetic nightmare narrative.".

If I had seen this when it first appeared I would have definitely been impressed with it. But with Andrei Rublev Tarkovsky created one of the best films ever made a label that Ivan's Childhood is not likely to ever receive. Still it is a great film with several great scenes. The problem is that Tarkovsky took this film over from another director. He didn't plan it. His major contributions were the several dream sequences which are the best parts of the film especially the one where Ivan and his sister are riding in the back of an apple truck when it is raining. Besides these dream sequences there are several other good sequences and at least one other great one the scene I refer to here is the one in the birch forest with Masha. The final sequence is beautiful and it brought me to tears. 910.".

He wasn't supposed to be a part of such a cruel occurrence as war but having lost parents chose to help his companionsinarms in risky and crucial way. In my opinion Andrei Tarkovsky has made more an art house film than just a typical soviet military drama. We don't see cruel battles we don't see divided by war love we don't see a war itself after all. All we see is the consequences of the war in theirs different appearances. The objective of this movie is common  to show what gore and sorrow the war is holding. But Tarkovsky shows us this gore and sorrow in an interesting unusual way through the eyes of little boy through his mind and dreams also. A blackandwhite sharp and highcontrast shot adds definition and dramatic atmosphere to the picture. There are a lot of really frightening and inappropriate for children scenes in the movie shown by Tarkovsky in order to achieve necessary level of horror that war provides. So I think Andrei Tarkovsky made a great and strong film showing all horror and gore of war in a different style. A am sure you won't see any familiar to this one military drama it's totally unique.".

It is no less than astonishing that this is his first film. The story is a fairly simple tale of a young boy who wants to continue as a dangerous scout on the Russian front during the last days of WWII much to the dismay of the Soviet staff. The director employs an elliptical narrative which oscillates between an inner dreamlike vision and actual events. Segments of the film are often introduced with extreme closeups which at first are difficult to recognize or understand. However each scene is composed with the utmost attention to detail and I don't think many paintings are created with this degree of clinical precision. Compositions begin stark and finely etched and then seem to explode with meaning after the introduction of light and shadow. Although the film is set within the War Genre the movie examines how war destroys the innocence of childhood. This masterwork contrasts the difference between an idyllic past where childhood should exist and the brutal warlike landscape of the frontlines. IVAN'S CHILDHOOD is a triumph of complex mood and nuanced style and is truly one of the greats.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like most films of Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky My Name is Ivan a.k.a. Ivan's Childhood reaches out to the spirit within us. Based on a short story titled Ivan by the Russian author Vladimir Bogomolov My Name is Ivan is a bleak but deeply moving film about a 12year old boy whose parents and sister were killed by the Germans and is now a scout spy for a Red Army battalion. Alternating between idyllic dreams of childhood nightmares of revenge and scenes of war devastation Tarkovsky creates a uniquely personal exploration of the effects of war on the mind and spirit.My Name is Ivan is set on the eastern front during World War II. Ivan's Nikolai Burleyayev size allows him to slip behind enemy lines and obtain vital strategic information about German positions for the Russians. Burleyayev who later portrayed Boriska in the bell sequence in Andrei Rublev gives a truly amazing performance as young Ivan. As the film opens Ivan wakes up jarringly from a poetic dream of his mother and finds himself in the attic of an empty windmill. Dodging enemy fire he swims across a muddy swamp to reach a Russian bunker where the ranking officer Lieutenant Galtsev Yevgeni Zharikov questions his credentials.Ivan is shorttempered and speaks to the Russian commanders with bravado unusual for someone of his age. The officers however take an interest in Ivan's welfare and provide him with love and protection. When they plan to send him to a military school Ivan demands to be sent back to the front seeking to revenge his parent's death. Unable to persuade his superiors Ivan runs away but finds only desolation and returns to camp. Despite the officers' objections Ivan is sent on another covert operation.Tarkovsky shows us war but without bombs or glory or battle scenes  only the suffering spirit of a child devastated by loss. As the film progresses it becomes more and more an internal map of Ivan's mind. Haunted by the demons of approaching death he seems to become emotionally inert. Tarkovsky said about the film as quoted in amazon.com I attempted to analyze the condition of a person who is being affected by war. When personality is disintegrating then we have the collapse of the logical development especially when we are dealing with the personality of a child. I always conceptualized Ivan as a destroyed personality pushed by the war from the normal axis of development. Though an early film Ivan presages Tarkovsky's later work with the use of hallucinatory camera work and very long takes where nothing happens for several minutes. Using dream sequences of normal life juxtaposed with mudsplattered reality the film is suffused with an air of melancholy and longing. In a memorable dream sequence supposedly lifted from Dovzhenko's Earth Ivan and his sister ride in a cart loaded with apples in the words of Gregory Pearce reawakens within us the longing for the lost purity of childhood. This is one casualty of war not counted in the statistics.".

	schema:headline " Point of No Return";
	schema:reviewBody "Born in Soviet Union Andrei Tarkovsky was a master of world cinema. His production is compact but the range is vast from historical epics to futuristic visions and movements of the human mind. Ivanovo detstvo or Ivan's Childhood was his first feature length film which was based on a short story 'Ivan' by Vladimir Bogolomov published a few years earlier. The portrayal of war from a child's perspective instantly proved the master's talent and his unique personality.The plot is quite difficult to summarize without getting into the details the film builds on a series of episodes from the WWII. The protagonist is a 12yearold boy whose family has been killed by Germans. A group of Russian soldiers pick him up but when the boy refuses to leave and wants to take part in military actions they're forced to keep him. The character of Ivan is built marginally he is serious and smiles rather rarely he lives a life which sadly has become quite normal for him  the concept of what is right and what is normal is totally twisted for him. At times he gets sudden aggressive bursts of hatred and moments of juvenile joy when he forgets that he is a soldier.The poetic narrative of Ivan's Childhood is both classic and modern Tarkovsky's style is strong classical but on the other hand he modernizes cinematic poetry and creates something completely new and original. The film builds on many poetic contrasts reality and fantasy life and delusions deserted dark areas and beautiful light birch forests. Dreams fantasies and returning memories form pictures of the past which are shown to us as the story goes on. As Tarkovsky realistically portrays the horrors of war he paradoxically finds something poetic and beautiful in its all cruelty.Ivan's Childhood is a cruel and honest film. Does it portray the world where the point of no return has not yet been passed or one where there is no turning back. With regards to Tarkovsky's pessimism obviously the latter. The story could've easily been juvenile and conventional but not in this case where Tarkovsky created an extremely original film about war in the eyes of a 12yearold. Ivan's Childhood grows out to be a film not just against war but against everything which turns us into something cruel against everything which allows children to be exploited and let's them lose their innocence and childhood.".

He's good at coming up with telling objections to opposing theories but when it comes time to make positive assertions of his own he doesn't do so and he doesn't candidly confess that he cannot do so instead he waffles.He argues persuasively that cutting doesn't have the importance others attach to it and that no amount or style of editing can turn limp footage into exciting footage.  All very true.  So what IS cutting good for?  It's hard to tell but I think Tarkovsky's short answer is nothing much.  The only positive assertion he can make is that every shot EVERY shot! should be complete in itself.Many shots in Ivan's Childhood are and are consequently hard to forget the fallinginadream shot at the beginning the bomb in the well all those images of the marshy forest especially the shot of the flare travelling in a distant arc above it that incomprehensible bit with the horse and the apples.  These images are hard to forget but Tarkovsky's refusal to do anything  anything at all  with them renders them pointless.  There's less point or internal unity to this film than there is to Fantasia which consists of seven semiautonomous productions glued together or Andrei Rublyov Tarkovsky's masterful second feature in which as with Fantasia the unit of meaning is the episode not the individual image.Anothing Sculpting in Time says is that art's purpose its only purpose is to improve our souls and prepare them for the afterlife.  On these terms is Ivan's Childhood successful?  Since Tarkovsky means his criteria to be taken literally the answer is no take them metaphorically and it's hard to see what he's talking about.  But by sensible standards the film is a failure.  We have wonderful material in a sense the film is ALL wonderful material sitting there waiting for someone to turn it into a film.".

Tarkovsky is not at his absolute best here in the sense that his style was still settling and he went on to even better thingsAndrei Rublev gets my vote as the greatest Soviet film ever made. This may sound like a knock but it isn't even when Tarkovsky is not at his finest he is much better than most other directors when not at their best and Ivan's Childhood is still beautifully directed up there with one of the better feature film directorial debuts.Tarkovsky's films are among the most visually beautiful I've ever seen and Ivan's Childhood is not an exception. The cinematography from Vadim Yusov is gorgeous and evokes chills there is a dreamlike quality to it but also a hardedged realism. The use of landscapes is wonderfully Expressionistic making the reallife sequences even more hardhitting. The music score is haunting and the film is written in a thoughtprovoking way that wrenches the gut and breaks the heart. It isn't a Tarkovsky film without memorable scenes and images and Ivan's Childhood has those certainly the dream sequences make the filmi.e. Ivan and his sister on the apple cart in the rain but standing out too are the magical birch forest scene the emotionally harrowing scene in the dark house and especially one of the most heartbreakingly powerful endings ever. What's remarkable is that while the story sounds simple there are several characteristic Tarkovsky themes for so early on his career and when it comes to mood Ivan's Childhood works amazingly.Furthermore the story of Ivan's Childhood is incredibly touching the childhood scenes are the epitome of innocence in a heartfelt sometimes entertaining and charming way and in complete contrastwithout feeling like two different films the effect of the war and combat is both grotesque and poetic. The characters are interesting and vibrantly portrayed although Masha is a little onenote for my tastes Ivan is a compellingly real character who is easy to identify with from the get go. The acting is very good outstanding in fact in the case of NikolaiKolya Burlylaev who gives one of the best child performances I've ever seen on film. Overall for a directorialfeature film debut Ivan's Childhood is incredible and as an overall film it's nearmasterpiece quality. 910 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a simple story really wholesome and vindicated by the end. The boy who spies behind Nazi lines is brave and stubborn the fierce fighting spirit of the Soviets personified in this frail wiry young body. His action is patriotic but also a petulant vengeance Tarkovsky insinuates. The two army officials are different sides to it the one calm and considerate the other brass and boisterous. The woman that serenades them is almost an afterthought a promise of love after the carnage.In other hands this would have been a simple crowdpleasing war drama this is worthwhile because of how Tarkovsky makes cinema with these bare essentials. In his camera survives the legacy of Soviet film Dovzchenko and Eisenstein. The camera that roams freely these rugged landscapes the pensive closeups of hard faces lost in thought.Tarkovsky's personal mark to this legacy lies in how he wants to transcend this wartorn land and strife the plaintive desire to enter into communion with worlds beyond the field of simply living and dying. Seeing around him he recognizes things which are not of this world and which we can surmise only by the shadows and reflections they cast around us or inside of us. Dream realities within shadows of the mind. Reflections of the divine without cast on still waters ready perhaps anxious to receive them. He captures these echoes and whispers in several shots most poignantly for me in the recon flares that keep dropping from the sky in the distance as though lighted matches tossed from celestial fire.He doesn't yet know how to pursue these visions or what they are awe seems enough at this point. But it reveals a filmmaker biding time ready to surrender himself over to God if only he would show his face. Few debuts are more cinematically accomplished than this.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a simple story really wholesome and vindicated by the end. The boy who spies behind Nazi lines is brave and stubborn the fierce fighting spirit of the Soviets personified in this frail wiry young body. His action is patriotic but also a petulant vengeance Tarkovsky insinuates. The two army officials are different sides to it the one calm and considerate the other brass and boisterous. The woman that serenades them is almost an afterthought a promise of love after the carnage.In other hands this would have been a simple crowdpleasing war drama this is worthwhile because of how Tarkovsky makes cinema with these bare essentials.

	schema:reviewBody "Ivan Nikolay Burlyaev may be a tad less naive but there's undeniably something of Come and See's Florya in his anger and his resourcefulness. Like Elem Klimov's devastating classic there's a mouldy naturalistic bleakness about Ivan's Childhood that does nothing to brighten the horror of World War II. Using a fractured narrative structure Andrei Tarkovsky's first feature film concerns the titular orphan and his experiences as a scout on the Soviet Eastern Front.The film sidesteps the potential sentimentality of its premise a definite risk given the presence of prominent father and brother figures by using the situation to ask greater questions about the nature of war. When Ivan throws a tantrum when he's told by his commander that he's going to military school instead of the Front we naturally question the boy's moral maturity and his limited understanding of the hypocrisies and complexities of why men fight. And yet by observing events unfold from Ivan's perspective aren't we being made to ask such questions of ourselves? Do we really know better than him? With his family gone and with his youthful eagerness and wanderlust and his simple smallness Ivan is more than qualified for his desired role. Hasn't he earned it? Fans of Solaris will instantly recognise Tarkovsky's ability to find the image that best depicts his characters' psychological state without recourse to melodrama. Actors need not apply. Tarkovsky's eye is so exacting so demanding that it's like we're looking through some kind of xray vision trained on the soul. And what soul there is to Tarkovsky the last frames are the equal of those which close his elegiac sciencefiction masterpiece.If ever one needs convincing of the difference between film as art and film as entertainment perhaps Tarkovsky should be the first port of call. Not simply because a film like Ivan's Childhood a perfect title by the way is so multilayered metaphorical psychologically complex eerie strange and moving  but because all those ARTISTIC elements combine to form a highly ENTERTAINING film thus making a nonsense of the notion that European art film exists to be admired but not enjoyed.

	schema:headline " First time feature director's dazzling visual competency subsumed by weak script";
	schema:reviewBody "'Ivan's Childhood' is also known as 'My Name is Ivan' in the United States. It was the first feature film of the famed Soviet director Andrei Tarkovsky who took over the project from another young director after it was rejected for poor quality. Tarkovsky based the film on a short story by Vladimir Bogomolov a very successful writer during the Soviet era. Supposedly Bogomolov drew upon his experiences as a soldier in World War II but according to Wikipedia some journalists believe that he never fought in the war and all his writings constitute a hoax!Tarkovsky immediately established a big reputation when he won awards at the Venice Film Festival as well as the San Francisco International Film Festival in 1962. Even Ingmar Bergman was quoted as saying that My discovery of Tarkovsky's first film was like a miracle. Suddenly I found myself standing at the door of a room the keys of which had until then never been given to me. It was a room I had always wanted to enter and where he was moving freely and fully at ease. Not everyone was completely effusive about 'Ivan'. The NY Times critic at the time Bosley Crowther stated The one exception I take to this picture which is based on a short story by Vladimir Bogpmolov is that its structure is a bit too frail. Its emotional communication is too dependent on its impressionistic details.Indeed it's the assorted palate of individual visual scenes that have drawn viewers to this film time and again. A good number stick in your mind here are just a few flashbacks of Ivan's mother and her subsequent demise the dead soldiers on the other side of the river with the sign 'welcome' Ivan being carried to bed by one of his soldierprotectors the horses eating the apples the soldier holding the nurse over the ravine the graffiti of doomed partisans urging future viewers to take revenge and the striking cinematography filmed on location in the marshlands near Kaniv at the Dnieper River.Despite all these great visuals the film still doesn't work very well due to the weak script. Since the carnage of war is only suggested which was obviously intentional on Tarkovsky's part not to show any overt clashes between Germans and Russians he was forced to fall back on the conflict between the Soviet soldiers and their 12 year old charge the jaded Ivan. Tarkovsky relies on the main conflict in which Ivan insists on continuing his activities as a scout as opposed to the Russian commanders who insist that he be taken from the front lines and placed in military school. This tedious battle goes on for much too long until two soldiers Kholin and Galtsev who have befriended Ivan decide to ferry him across the river and allow him safe passage into the forest where he'll continue acting as a child soldier Kholin and Galtsev meanwhile retrieve their two dead comrades under the tree.There's also a subplot that seems to go nowhere. Captain Kholin makes some aggressive moves on the Army Nurse Masha in the forest you would figure that this might end up as some kind of sexual assault but nothing like that happens. The scene is probably there because simply focusing exclusively on the inert conflict between Ivan and the soldiers cannot carry the entire narrative.The Ivan denouement is interesting because Tarkovsky uses archival footage from the Fall of Berlin. There are some disturbing images particularly shots of the Goebbels' children who were poisoned by their parents in Hitler's bunker days before Germany's official surrender. He uses this footage to work in a scene where one of Ivan's soldier friend discovers the boy's ultimate fate executed by the Nazis by beheading!.Ultimately the message of a poor 12 year old orphan caught up in the horrors of war fails to have the shattering impact that most critics insist that it does. I can only surmise that many of these critics were so impressed by the dazzling virtuosity of a first time feature director's extraordinary visual competency that any objective observations concerning plot were lost. But there's simply not enough compelling conflict to keep this antiwar vehicle completely afloat. What's more I understand the whole idea that Ivan's misguided thirst for revenge illustrates how war can affect an innocent child in such a deleterious way. And of course his ultimate fate is supposed to be quite tragic. But somehow I felt emotionally detached from Ivan probably because of the child's own detachment from reality. Tarkovsky's impressive impressionistic techniques at the same time leads to an emotional distancing. We see the dreamlike shot of Ivan's mother after she's killed but we never get to know who she is. Likewise her executioners. All we're left with is the emotionally detached Ivan and his enablersagain not a big enough canvas for compelling drama.You might be interested in the fate of the actor who played Ivan Nikolay Burlyaev. Actually he's done quite well for himself Since 1991 the founder and director of the Moscow Film Festival of Slavic and Orthodox Peoples and since 1996 founder and chairman of the International Association of Cinematographers of Slavic and Orthodox Peoples. One disturbing caveat according to Wikipedia In March 2014 he signed a letter in support of the position of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin on Russia's military intervention in Ukraine.".

	schema:headline " NeoRealism meets Noir Marx meets De Laurentiis and Silvana Mangano meets glory";
	schema:reviewBody "By 1949 Italian NeoRealism was just 6 or 7 years old but it had already taken the world by storm stunning audiences and winning awards all over. When Bitter Rice was made Neo Realist principles i.e. no stars mix of professional and nonprofessional actors locationonly shooting rejection of beautyclassicismromanticism stressing on ordinary people and reallife themes were being stretched stars were joining in including international ones like Ingrid Bergman or starlets like American Doris Dowling here productions got bigger and more expensive crews more professional equipment more sophisticated ordinary people were being replaced by Olympic beauties or do ordinary people EVER look like Silvana Mangano or Vittorio Gassman? ordinary characters were getting very complex and real life was being traded by elaborate far from realistic drama.Bitter Rice was one of the biggest worldwide boxoffice hits of NeoRealism. The reason for its success wasn't exactly in the depiction of the lives of poor peasant women who worked under harsh conditions in rice plantations in rural Italy  this isn't the theme of Bitter Rice it's just its background. The main reason for its success probably lied in the fact that the audience could enjoy a Noir story of doomed love betrayal and crime while being politically instructed watching the miserly semiliterate female workers develop Marxist consciousness while parading their butts and naked thighs in industrial quantities. Thus Bitter Rice is a sort of titillating Noir with NeoRealist scenery and Marxist subtext. The big scenes in the rice paddies the postwar devastation. the poverty and the supporting characters are NeoRealist all right. But the Noir elements also prominent in Visconti's 1943 masterpiece Ossessione based after all on Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice are strong the indoor lighting check out those stylized shadows in the warehouse the complex camerawork that amazing opening dolly shot!! the doomed characters Silvana is a peasant femme fatale Gassman is a rotten crook Raf Vallone is a jaded war veteran Dowling is the woman born to be mistreated and abused the perverted violence Gassman is a sadist Dowling is a masochist Silvana is a sadomasochist the deaths are stylized to the hilt the uncontrollable sexuality and the inexorability of fate.But Bitter Rice had 7 !! writers working on it and the film suffers from an excess of back stories and conflicting focuses jewel robbery rice looting union rights clandestine labor postwar trauma political manifesto rape murder betrayal revenge etc. And it had Dino de Laurentiis producing who at 30 already showed his penchant for grandeur check out those crowd scenes of epic proportions with hundreds of women in the paddies on trains on trucks. Sometimes the screen is so over crowded you'll be gasping for air.Bitter Rice is a convoluted film but no one can say it lacks great scenes the women's chant in the paddies builds up to such tension between the legal and illegal workers it leads to their physical confrontation it's probably the biggest  in numbers  female brawl in film history or the women going to work even under heavy rain or the final confrontation in the slaughterhouse or the electrifying whippingrape scene between Gassman and Silvana or Silvana dancing Silvana reading in bed Silvana smiling Silvana crying Silvana bathing Silvana walking...Silvana Mangano gives what's probably one of the 10 most stunning starmaking female performances in cinema. With absolutely no training this former beauty queen and film extra had the luck to resemble Ingrid Bergman when Bergman was Hollywood's 1 star. But that's just the start she also had the kind of body that makes men drool and babble a fabulous acting instinct and a stormy temper. The emotional range of her character also named Silvana is huge strong and frail simple and ambitious healthy and neurotic determined and insecure jealous and indifferent jaded and naive compulsive and calculating. All of this while exuding sex through every pore. It's an amazing performance especially when you consider she was 18 at the time!! Her character reunites Rita Hayworth's sexdriven and tormented Gilda including the howling inducing dance numbers Lana Turner's tragic Cora from The Postman... and Jennifer Jones' stubborn sadomasochist Pearl from Duel in the Sun all in one. She's a mess but we root for her anyway. In the heartstopping finale lucidity insanity and shame cloud her face as she climbs to her destiny. With Bitter Rice and later with Anna Mangano paved the way to the new uninhibited earthy irrepressible sex divas of the 50s like Sophia Gina Ava and Brigitte.

	onyx:emotionText "By 1949 Italian NeoRealism was just 6 or 7 years old but it had already taken the world by storm stunning audiences and winning awards all over. When Bitter Rice was made Neo Realist principles i.e. no stars mix of professional and nonprofessional actors locationonly shooting rejection of beautyclassicismromanticism stressing on ordinary people and reallife themes were being stretched stars were joining in including international ones like Ingrid Bergman or starlets like American Doris Dowling here productions got bigger and more expensive crews more professional equipment more sophisticated ordinary people were being replaced by Olympic beauties or do ordinary people EVER look like Silvana Mangano or Vittorio Gassman? ordinary characters were getting very complex and real life was being traded by elaborate far from realistic drama.Bitter Rice was one of the biggest worldwide boxoffice hits of NeoRealism. The reason for its success wasn't exactly in the depiction of the lives of poor peasant women who worked under harsh conditions in rice plantations in rural Italy  this isn't the theme of Bitter Rice it's just its background. The main reason for its success probably lied in the fact that the audience could enjoy a Noir story of doomed love betrayal and crime while being politically instructed watching the miserly semiliterate female workers develop Marxist consciousness while parading their butts and naked thighs in industrial quantities. Thus Bitter Rice is a sort of titillating Noir with NeoRealist scenery and Marxist subtext. The big scenes in the rice paddies the postwar devastation. the poverty and the supporting characters are NeoRealist all right. But the Noir elements also prominent in Visconti's 1943 masterpiece Ossessione based after all on Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice are strong the indoor lighting check out those stylized shadows in the warehouse the complex camerawork that amazing opening dolly shot!! the doomed characters Silvana is a peasant femme fatale Gassman is a rotten crook Raf Vallone is a jaded war veteran Dowling is the woman born to be mistreated and abused the perverted violence Gassman is a sadist Dowling is a masochist Silvana is a sadomasochist the deaths are stylized to the hilt the uncontrollable sexuality and the inexorability of fate.But Bitter Rice had 7 !! writers working on it and the film suffers from an excess of back stories and conflicting focuses jewel robbery rice looting union rights clandestine labor postwar trauma political manifesto rape murder betrayal revenge etc. And it had Dino de Laurentiis producing who at 30 already showed his penchant for grandeur check out those crowd scenes of epic proportions with hundreds of women in the paddies on trains on trucks. Sometimes the screen is so over crowded you'll be gasping for air.Bitter Rice is a convoluted film but no one can say it lacks great scenes the women's chant in the paddies builds up to such tension between the legal and illegal workers it leads to their physical confrontation it's probably the biggest  in numbers  female brawl in film history or the women going to work even under heavy rain or the final confrontation in the slaughterhouse or the electrifying whippingrape scene between Gassman and Silvana or Silvana dancing Silvana reading in bed Silvana smiling Silvana crying Silvana bathing Silvana walking...Silvana Mangano gives what's probably one of the 10 most stunning starmaking female performances in cinema. With absolutely no training this former beauty queen and film extra had the luck to resemble Ingrid Bergman when Bergman was Hollywood's 1 star. But that's just the start she also had the kind of body that makes men drool and babble a fabulous acting instinct and a stormy temper. The emotional range of her character also named Silvana is huge strong and frail simple and ambitious healthy and neurotic determined and insecure jealous and indifferent jaded and naive compulsive and calculating. All of this while exuding sex through every pore. It's an amazing performance especially when you consider she was 18 at the time!! Her character reunites Rita Hayworth's sexdriven and tormented Gilda including the howling inducing dance numbers Lana Turner's tragic Cora from The Postman... and Jennifer Jones' stubborn sadomasochist Pearl from Duel in the Sun all in one. She's a mess but we root for her anyway. In the heartstopping finale lucidity insanity and shame cloud her face as she climbs to her destiny. With Bitter Rice and later with Anna Mangano paved the way to the new uninhibited earthy irrepressible sex divas of the 50s like Sophia Gina Ava and Brigitte. She was the antiMarilyn the opposite of the fragile sextoy doll. Later she changed radically into a refined slender diva and became the favorite star of Pasolini and Visconti. But here you have the chance to see the early Silvana in all her teenage glory talent and temper.Next to her the other main stars fade aside Gassman then the brightest young star of Italian theater is devilishly handsome and virile but tends to overact but we get a glimpse of what his Stanley Kowalski must have been on stage.

	schema:reviewBody "The principal flaw of this film is the performance of Doris Dowling mistakenly cast in the role of Francesca. Dowling seems capable of only one facial expression something between a scowl and a sneer. Why such a wooden American actress was cast in this role when there were so many budding actresses in Italy at the time must remain a mystery.This film ranks just below such classics of the Italian neorealist movement as The Bicycle Thief Shoeshine Open City and La Strada. Turner Classic Movies is to be applauded for making this rarely seen gem available on their channel. There is a nearly showstopping performance by Silvana Mangano a performance that must have been electrifying at the time. Earthy sensual voluptuous Mangano performs with unshaven armpits which she puts on full display when she puts her hands behind her head. This was a gutsy move for an unknown actress who was a former beauty queen presumably aiming for stardom but this little touch adds immeasurably to the brooding sense of poverty and desperation that pervade the film. It has been said that if Mangano had had more drive and been less controlled by her husband Dino de Laurentiis she might have achieved the stature of Loren and Lollobrigida. But alas it was not to be. The only other notable performance of her career was in Visconti's Death in Venice.If this film seems excessively proletarian even Marxist in its outlook it is important to remember that Italy was impoverished after WWII and that the Communist Party very nearly came to power in 1948 and probably would have done so had it not been for CIA intervention. The crane shots and other camera work as well as the superb acting of the women in the smaller roles are masterful in depicting the drudgery of the toil of the women working in the rice fields. Other aspects of the camera work are masterful. Probably the most famous or notorious scene in the film is the one where Mangano takes a reed and playfully pokes Vittorio Gassman with it. Gassman's character is not amused he takes the reed from her and proceeds to whip her with it repeatedly. Notice the way the camera moves with Gassman as he approaches her then moves with Mangano as she tries to move away from him in terror. This is masterful camera work. The finale of the film which I won't reveal here is shattering as well. The acting of Gassman and Raf Vallone is superb as well.Until recently this film was unavailable on DVD with English subtitles but it has recently become available and can be ordered on Amazon. It would be a great addition to anyone's film library. And one final note another reviewer cautioned parents that there is nudity in this film. This is incorrect. I think he is probably referring to the crane shot that shows the women bathing in the river. They do indeed appear nude but if you look more closely you will see that they are wearing body stockings and are fully clothed.".

	schema:headline " Before Loren There Was Mangano Wow!";
	schema:reviewBody "Riso Amaro is one of those atypical movies that is not only multilayered and realistic but also difficult to categorize. And it has Mangano. Silvana Mangano age nineteen is simply stunning in every way one can visualize. Can a man take his eyes away from her? And her two dances  what an electrifying screen presence! Prettier than Drago Loren and Cardinale she was a natural actress in the right setting. She may not have had the drive of many of Italy's breathtaking actresses but she certainly lit up a screen. And this movie was made in a situation that did not demand flamboyant makeup fancy hairstyles and fine clothing. Even her underarms were unshaven not unusual in Europe for the time see a few French or German movies. No this is what Italian neorealism is all about unlike the French new wave with professional actresses all puffed up with baroque makeup and without a hair being out of place and always looking prim! So much differently Mangano is earthy and sensual! And she was not the only lovely peasant girl in the motion picture! Ah yes the movie. The beginning presents a newscaster on location in northeastern Italy who reports that the world's major riceproducing regions are China India and northern Italy. He comments on the hundreds of women arriving in the area for the 40day riceharvesting season. Only women have the nimble hands and feet to do the backbreaking work in lowlevel water. They welcome the task for it provides the recently wartorn citizens a chance to earn some precious money. Mixing among the group is a wanted thief slippery stilettowielding Walter Vittorio Gassmann and an attractive female accomplice Francesca American Doris Dowling. Sergeant Marco Raf Vallone a tenyear veteran of the Italian army is about to be discharged. We have the makings of a movie centering on the working classes doomed love abuse of women robbery illegal immigrants and bravery. The focus is on the toil of the proletariat the obvious tension between union and nonunion labor. But the parallel story is on a heist that will thwart all the wearisome work of the ladies. There will be a shootout and our gorgeous Italian girl will climb a long ladder to her destiny. Superb camerawork longwide vantage points nice characterdevelopment singing and onlocation shooting are big pluses of this fine largely unknown melodrama. Worth seeing.".

	onyx:emotionText "Riso Amaro is one of those atypical movies that is not only multilayered and realistic but also difficult to categorize. And it has Mangano. Silvana Mangano age nineteen is simply stunning in every way one can visualize. Can a man take his eyes away from her? And her two dances  what an electrifying screen presence! Prettier than Drago Loren and Cardinale she was a natural actress in the right setting. She may not have had the drive of many of Italy's breathtaking actresses but she certainly lit up a screen. And this movie was made in a situation that did not demand flamboyant makeup fancy hairstyles and fine clothing. Even her underarms were unshaven not unusual in Europe for the time see a few French or German movies. No this is what Italian neorealism is all about unlike the French new wave with professional actresses all puffed up with baroque makeup and without a hair being out of place and always looking prim! So much differently Mangano is earthy and sensual! And she was not the only lovely peasant girl in the motion picture! Ah yes the movie. The beginning presents a newscaster on location in northeastern Italy who reports that the world's major riceproducing regions are China India and northern Italy. He comments on the hundreds of women arriving in the area for the 40day riceharvesting season. Only women have the nimble hands and feet to do the backbreaking work in lowlevel water. They welcome the task for it provides the recently wartorn citizens a chance to earn some precious money. Mixing among the group is a wanted thief slippery stilettowielding Walter Vittorio Gassmann and an attractive female accomplice Francesca American Doris Dowling. Sergeant Marco Raf Vallone a tenyear veteran of the Italian army is about to be discharged. We have the makings of a movie centering on the working classes doomed love abuse of women robbery illegal immigrants and bravery. The focus is on the toil of the proletariat the obvious tension between union and nonunion labor. But the parallel story is on a heist that will thwart all the wearisome work of the ladies. There will be a shootout and our gorgeous Italian girl will climb a long ladder to her destiny. Superb camerawork longwide vantage points nice characterdevelopment singing and onlocation shooting are big pluses of this fine largely unknown melodrama. Worth seeing.";

It comes across as a realistic portrayal of life in the rice fields of Italy and is undoubtedly wellmade with a haunting natural quality about the whole production. Some of the scenes tend to be a bit overdrawn and samey but this doesn't detract from the overall intensity which is helped in no small part by the acting. It's quite clear that professional actors were used alongside nonactors and this adds a certain poignant interest to the proceedings. The best performance is given by that seriously underrated actress from the USA  Doris Dowling and it makes it all the more difficult to understand why she didn't have a far more high profile career in her own country. For fans of continental cinema in general this is well worthy of interest.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's something about the way actress Doris Dowling stares piercingly into the eyes of the men and women who temporarily populate the Po Valley of northern Italy. Hardly a shrinking violet the shrewdness she innately possesses drips from her sweated brow and subtle scowl. She's equal parts Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indeminity 1944 and Vivien Leigh in Streetcar 1951 both the criminal and the victim.Bitter Rice concerns the tragic entanglements of four people two men and two women during the much celebrated time of the northern rice harvest circa 1949. Walter Gassman and Francesca Dowling are fugitives hiding from the fuzz with a thicket of stolen jewels. They find respite among the gaggle of women working the harvest and decide to stay just long enough to elude capture and steal a few bags of rice. The craven Walter finds himself attracted to a youthful rice weeder named Silvana Mangano who glamorizes trinkets of American largess including and especially pop music. As such she immediately becomes drawn to Walter's badboy persona. Meanwhile Marco Vallone a disaffected war veteran attempts to court Silvana but finds conflict from all angles.The film is a jumble of compromised pastiche referencing everything from precode crime and social problem films to stage musicals adapted to the screen. Yet it's all translated with neorealist cinematography and wingclipped melancholia. The love triangle for instance leaves the impression of a screwball comedy yet any humor or sexual tension is muted when compared to the paranoia shared by our two criminal leads. That very real tension is subsequently switched out with flashes of turfwar bravado predating the American teen movies of the decade to come. There's an argument to be made that this quixotic mix of sensibilities amplifies the pettiness with which our characters seem doomed to repeat again and again. What's a girls obsession with American bubblegum when compared to the troubles of an army of harvesters working in the heat?Yet the way the movie gives equal weight to the melodrama as to the characterization keeps this film just out of place for the time like bran of the grain just slightly askew. While constantly reminding its audience of the space the time and the politics of the day we don't see the characters as we should  tragic and vulnerable. Instead we see them petty vain and oafish oblivious to their effect on the strangers that they harvest rice with. By combining the moral and economic difficulties of postwar Italy with westernstyle myopia there's certainly a pep to the plot but no characters to really root for.This tugowar between Italian neorealism and Hollywood glitz and melodrama reaches its boiling point during the climax which pits the four against each other in a slaughterhouse under the cover of night. It's a mesmerizing scene that is brimming with symbolism pathos artful audience manipulation and suspense. Considered as a marriage of form and technique the climax is a marvel though seen as a corruption the film hammers home a deeply anticonsumerist message. One that not only highlights the seductive and prevalent nature of Americanstyle capitalism but can even be seen as a commentary on Italy's 1948 General Election which was seen by the west as a Cold War tipping point.Yet taken out of its political and historical context Bitter Rice is at its heart a pulpy rural drama. One that can't help but be compared to films like The Big Sleep 1946 and lauded as the film that got Silvana Mangano on the fast track to international stardom. Yet despite its limitations the image of Doris Dowling's fierce icy glare is burned into memory and should be etched into cinematic consciousness in the same way Mangano's erotic boogiewoogie is.".

I don't know how some of the period directors turned out decently done films like this one Open City Paisan and the rest of the neorealist examples. Maybe it helps to have no money. Well let me take that back because I ought to know better.There are a lot of scenes of men and women hard at work in the rice fields of northern Italy but the film captures little of the backbreaking quality of that work. Everybody seems to be enjoying herself although there are arguments between the contract workers and the scabs. They overcome their differences and finally work together. A bit of Marx never hurt anyone.The thing is rice planting tending and harvesting is horribly burdensome toil. You stand in mud up to your calves bent over working with your hands under the murk. And the film doesn't give us any of the exhaustion that follows. You get a better hint in The Grapes of Wrath when Pa Joad finishes his hamburger stands up stretches stiffly and says something like You wouldn't think a couple hours of pickin' fruit would make a body ache so. The two principal women are the sullen but good Doris Dowling who looks very much like her sister Constance Danny Kaye's inamorata in Up In Arms. Dowling was of Irish ancestry. She had a long career mostly in television not being an exceptionally striking beauty.The other woman driven by lust and greed but not unsympathetic is Sylvana Mangano. She's a good enough actress and of considerable heft for an eighteen year old. I approve of the fact that she doesn't shave her arm pits. She has a majestic bosom that if set free from its tight confines would devastate the countryside smothering cities wiping out whole populations and in the end denuding earth of all life. Those Michelangelos yet unborn would remain unborn.There's a sub plot involving the randy but fundamentally decent guy Raf Vallone. I could never understand what women saw in him  a large and hairy guy with a big bony face. Then there is the treacherous lying thief Vittorio Gassman who switches women the way some men switch socks. He plans to undermine the entire enterprise at the expense of the workers. That slight groan you hear comes from Highgate Cemetery as Karl Marx struggles to roll over.I realize it's beside the point but I have to mention that I sat through the first half of this movie two generations ago in one of those big movie palaces on Market Street in San Francisco hoping to see a little flesh. And just about the time the ladies were rolling up their skirts the theater lurched forward then backward like a ride in an amusement park. The earthquake sent me dashing out into the street. For half a century I've been wondering how it all turned out.".

I'm afraid we get let down by a predictably melodramatic ending full of clichs.

On the whole I have a preference for the Englishdubbed version because in most cases the British or American stars postsync their own voices whereas in the Rome version none of the players  aside from the really big stars like Anna Magnani Gino Cervi and Amedeo Nazzari  are allowed anywhere near a microphone. It's strange to hear Vittorio Gassman's distinctively throaty voice replaced by a bland radio actor's and equally disconcerting to find Silvana's peasant girl speaking beautifully cultured high class.Of course Bitter Rice was such a sensational success it launched not only Mangano but Gassman and Vallone as well on to the international scene. Gassman was offered a Hollywood contract and before long was costarring opposite the likes of Elizabeth Taylor. Mangano continued her career after marrying this film's producer in 1949. Incidentally Bitter Rice was not her first film. She'd previously made L'elisir d'amore for director Mario Costa in 1947. And she was eighteen not seventeen when she starred in Riso Amaro.Alas the film did nothing for the waning career of that ultra classy siren of The Blue Dahlia Doris Dowling. Forced to play second fiddle to Mangano she's not only dowdily dressed but robbed of her distinctive voice.I thought the attempt to marry documentary neorealism with a melodramatic plot worked rather well. The realistic backgrounds made the story seem far more credible whilst at the same time the more sensational aspects of the story lend an added power and poignancy to the plight of the rice workers. The four leading characters are skillfully delineated. The writers give them enough quirks to make their behavior and reactions individualistic without descending into caricature.Director De Santis and photographer Martelli's probing camera explore the teeming settings to the full assisted by a noholds barred budget and an appropriately atmospheric music score.".

Gassman was offered a Hollywood contract and before long was costarring opposite the likes of Elizabeth Taylor. Mangano continued her career after marrying this film's producer in 1949. Incidentally Bitter Rice was not her first film. She'd previously made L'elisir d'amore for director Mario Costa in 1947. And she was eighteen not seventeen when she starred in Riso Amaro.Alas the film did nothing for the waning career of that ultra classy siren of The Blue Dahlia Doris Dowling. Forced to play second fiddle to Mangano she's not only dowdily dressed but robbed of her distinctive voice.I thought the attempt to marry documentary neorealism with a melodramatic plot worked rather well. The realistic backgrounds made the story seem far more credible whilst at the same time the more sensational aspects of the story lend an added power and poignancy to the plight of the rice workers. The four leading characters are skillfully delineated. The writers give them enough quirks to make their behavior and reactions individualistic without descending into caricature.Director De Santis and photographer Martelli's probing camera explore the teeming settings to the full assisted by a noholds barred budget and an appropriately atmospheric music score.";

This sexualization and the melodramatic presence of death and suicide in the film cause it to diverge from typical Italian neorealism.I do find the symbolism interesting especially because as noted the neorealist films of the era which have been getting a major reevaluation as of late really are pretty straightforward very Italian and often dealing with postwar themes. There is some of that postwar feeling here but we see less of the city as a character and more individuals.On a personal note I like that this film is an early entry in the DeLaurentiis dynasty.

Though it was my admiration for Vittorio Gassman rather than your patronage that led me to this neorealist ruralnoir. But I could not help but think about your films while watching this. Afterall the film opens with a shot of female legs and thighs jumping into a water body.How do I describe the film? A thrilling working class love quadrangle? A rice heist film? Titillating Communist manifesto filled with the thighs of bovine Italian women? The film does not really have a main plot. In fact it is packed with subplots.It is a film about these earthy and lustful working class people who live purely on instinct. They live cooped up together in a postwar Italy where humans are no better than cattle and have to fight for the right to work. Greed and passion drives them.Silvana Mangano was sensational as the working class beauty. Her introduction scene where she is dancing is so real  I could smell the odor emanating out of her armpits. I am surprised you did not cast her in one of your films Russ. She was a damn good actress too. She literally filled the screen with her plump thighs and when she is simply walking and laying around like a wild animal.Vittorio Gassman looked menacing  the way he uses his tall and wiry body in the fight scenes and towards the end when he is shot dead is unbelievable. You could not ask for two better actors to play a working class couple.The director sort of foregrounds the beauty and wildness of the working class throughout the film. We are treated to many scenes of scantily clad women working fighting and bathing in the paddy fields. The film reminded me of John Steinbeck's novel The Grapes of Wrath. Like in that book the characters in this novel are also desperately searching for work. And there are so many of them. The film is filled with long shots of the working class woman that are supposed to emphasize their plenitude.Like I said earlier the numerous subplots and characters do affect the film's tempo. It could have used a really strict editor like you Russ. It is not a masterpiece. But there is certainly a lot to appreciate.Best regards Pimpin.710".

Mangano is one of those workers a bit younger than Dowling and when she discovers the jewelry she becomes enamored with her new friend's apparently exciting life. Dowling warns her that it's actually pretty crappy but when Gassman shows up at the camp Mangano is drawn to him. Raf Vallone rounds out the main cast as a soldier stationed near the rice fields who is in love with Mangano. The film really isn't too concerned with the plight of the poor rice workers though it pays them enough lip service that it doesn't feel like it doesn't care. The script is uneven. There are a good handful of dumb bits particularly the risible climactic sequence. It's fun throughout though and the two leading ladies are both very attractive.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is rare when a movie transports me back to my childhood memories reminding me of the time when playing games use to be fun. Adventures were limited by imagination and Summer days were transformed into magic. Zathura directed by Jon Favreau based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg came knocking on my door and invited me to come out and play.AuthorArtist Van Allsburg has a wonderful gift. His vision is firmly planted in a realm of childhood experiences. More illustration than words his books evoke worlds of wonder. The last movie based on one of his stories was The Polar Express directed by Zemeckis. It is making it's re appearance as a seasonal movie. It is well worth seeing and if you can find it in IMAX 3D it is phenomenal.Van Allsburg's book Jumanji was filmed less successfully back in 1995. It failed because it could not find the right tone. Zathura nails it. Both books share the same plot device Children find a board game that transports them into the game. Cards are drawn that effect their fate and their surroundings. The only way to escape the perils of the game is to play it through. Jumanji was a jungle game and Zathura is a space adventure.What elevates this film is the believable interactions of the two young players. Jonah Bobo plays the six year old Danny who is always getting in the way of his older brother ten year old Walter played by Josh Hutcherson. Danny is looking for friendship and attention from his brother who in turn considers Danny to be a pest and a nuisance competing for the attention of their recently divorced father played by Tim Robbins.The boys have an older sister Lisa played by Kristen Stewart. She is living in a world of her own between her preening and dating the boys hardly see her. Although she does join the game late in the film for most of the film she is cryogenically indisposed.The Game itself is a marvel of brightly painted tin and wind up gears. To play is simple wind it up push a button and watch a number come up this determines the number of spaces your playing piece will take. Two rockets chase each other around the twisting path. After your piece moves a card pops up. The card describes the action to follow. Danny draws the first card that says Meteor Shower Take Evasive Action and the game is on.The movie is visually stunning. The discovery by the children that their house has been transported to a location in outer space hovering above a ring of meteors that encircle a large planet is jaw dropping. The effects are real enough to imply danger but logic is not a function of children's games so it does not matter that oxygen gravity and warmth still exist in the house even as it is blasted apart by various forces.Along the way the boys encounter a young astronaut played by Dax Shepard who helps them out of perilous situations like battling engulfing black holes and evading Fierce carnivorous lizards called Zorgons. Along the way the Astronaut teaches them lessons in brotherly cooperation and even beguiles Lisa into sharing the adventure. While funny and exciting it is never preachy Zathura is intelligently written and directed this is a great family film. I give it  out of five stars.".

Jumanji was a jungle game and Zathura is a space adventure.What elevates this film is the believable interactions of the two young players. Jonah Bobo plays the six year old Danny who is always getting in the way of his older brother ten year old Walter played by Josh Hutcherson. Danny is looking for friendship and attention from his brother who in turn considers Danny to be a pest and a nuisance competing for the attention of their recently divorced father played by Tim Robbins.The boys have an older sister Lisa played by Kristen Stewart. She is living in a world of her own between her preening and dating the boys hardly see her. Although she does join the game late in the film for most of the film she is cryogenically indisposed.The Game itself is a marvel of brightly painted tin and wind up gears. To play is simple wind it up push a button and watch a number come up this determines the number of spaces your playing piece will take. Two rockets chase each other around the twisting path. After your piece moves a card pops up. The card describes the action to follow. Danny draws the first card that says Meteor Shower Take Evasive Action and the game is on.The movie is visually stunning. The discovery by the children that their house has been transported to a location in outer space hovering above a ring of meteors that encircle a large planet is jaw dropping. The effects are real enough to imply danger but logic is not a function of children's games so it does not matter that oxygen gravity and warmth still exist in the house even as it is blasted apart by various forces.Along the way the boys encounter a young astronaut played by Dax Shepard who helps them out of perilous situations like battling engulfing black holes and evading Fierce carnivorous lizards called Zorgons. Along the way the Astronaut teaches them lessons in brotherly cooperation and even beguiles Lisa into sharing the adventure. While funny and exciting it is never preachy Zathura is intelligently written and directed this is a great family film. I give it  out of five stars.";

When he learned Zathura would be the next Van Allsburg book to come to the screen he made me promise we'd see it.We nearly missed our chance it was at the secondrun theater but I am glad we made it. Zathura was excellent we were riveted the entire time and my son THEN made me promise we'd buy the DVD when it was released! Since one of the main characters was a 10year old boy like him naturally I knew he'd like it. But I really liked it too and thought that every actor's performance was exactly right. Not cutesy in that movie kid kind of way but very real. I flinched at some of the older brother's dialogue it was so mean and angry toward the little brother. But that's how it is!! Kids are so mean. This movie did not shy away from it OK that set up the ending but still.Even the teen sister was great. Tim Robbins as the harried dad little screen time was spoton. Families of divorce have a whole separate set of behavioral rules to learn and live by and this movie nailed it.Thumbsup from all of us!".

	schema:reviewBody "Those who criticize Zathura for being a copycat Jumanji are apparently clueless about the Van Allsburg's books. Zathura is a sequel to Jumanji it is about what happened when the Budwing brothers opened the game box that Peter and Judy discarded at the end of Jumanji. Early board games were often designed with twosided boards so that the game pieces could be used to play two different gamesusually of the same type. Zathura was the flip side of the Jumanji game board and the ones the brothers chose to play because Walter did not like jungle games. So it is supposed to be like another Jumanji.Having grown up with this same sibling age dynamic six and ten I was not surprised at the amount of yelling anger and resentment that goes on between the two brothers. I was however surprised that anyone would find this sort of thing entertaining. While their divorced father Tim Robbins playing the only sympathetic character in the film is away at a meeting the younger brother Danny finds an old Zathura game in the basement. Based on those old 1950's tin toys it involves two tin spaceships on a track racing around space. Each spin of the dial determines the distance the ship will move on that turn and a card is ejected detailing what happens to the ship at that point of space. As Danny and Walter face the challenges of space they discover that they can work as a team and they even develop some affection for each other a more unrealistic idea than anything they actually encounter in space. Like the source book the movie adaptation of Zathura targets kindergarten to Grade 5 children. Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl older viewers will find very little of interest other than a fun production design and nice effects. Unfortunately Zathura it is not as pure as Sharkboy and Lavagirl which uniquely refused to compromise its for kids only story. Zathura does compromise as the producers attempt to expand their audience by creating an older sister Lisa played by Kristen Stewart who was not a character in the book. While Stewart is fine in this role and even provides some comic relief it is rather disturbing that the producers chose to turn her into a pubescent sex object blustering around the house in her underwear for most of the film. Van Allsburg's illustrations are the best part of his books but a hot teenage sister is not an image he has ever published. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

Of course both movies are adaptations of books written by the same writer. I was watching it with my kid sister who was having a blast. The two main characters are two brothers who are probably 10 and 7 years of age. The kid actors are quite good and they don't overdo the cute act. However Kristen Stewart is the caricature whiny older sister who doesn't care. Thankfully her role is limited. The only directorial venture of Favreau I have seen was 'Made' which was a laugh out loud dark comedy completely different from 'Zathura'. He does seem to know the kind of movies kids love and families can enjoy. He's moving to being more versatile as a director as he's done a fine job so far. The special effects are awesome. Just like the engaging weirdness in 'Jumanji'. The house floating outer space the dim lighting in the house the house breaking the bicycle orbiting around the floating house...all work well and add to the amusement. Highly entertaining! Kids will love it! Therefore families will love it too!".

	schema:reviewBody "Title Zathura 2005 Director Jon Favreau Review You know the type of movie that you watch when you are a little kid and you never forget that film and hold it close to your heart for all your life? For me it was all about The Goonies and Explorers. Zathura is going to end up being one of those movies for a whole new generation of kids growing up right now.Zathura is just a variation of what we saw earlier in Jumanji. Jumanji was a board game that once you started playing it would transport a savage jungle along with all its beasts and perils right into your living room. With Zathura we get the same basic idea only this time around the adventure transports us into space. And all the alien creatures spaceships meteor showers and malfunctioning robots that come along with it.There's a couple of things I liked better about this film then Jumanji. For example with Jumanji you got all these special effects and all these creatures and things happening but to me personally the film always seemed a little empty. It didn't show anything to kids. It just felt like this empty shell of a movie with lots of razzle dazzle effects. And heres where Zathura improved on the whole idea this movie had a whole lot more to say then Jumanji ever did.With Zathura you get these two little brothers. One is six and one is ten. So naturally they are always fighting for attention and are in a constant competition to see who is best who is first and who their dad loves the most. Once they get going on their space adventure they will learn to value and care for each other. And their bond as brothers grow. So yeah Zathura has a lot more to teach to kids and has an actual message as opposed to Jumanjis empty effects.But on top of that you get some kick ass action and adventure. And this is the part where I said man some little kid somewhere is LOVING this movie. There was a lot of care taken to make this movie not just a preachy movie about loving your family and brothers..but an entertaining film as well. With some cool special effects too boot. You gotta love the giant malfunctioning robot you gotta love those lizard like aliens called the Zorgons. I liked the fact that Hollywood didn't say ah its a kid movie they wont notice. The effects here are top of the line cool stuff.The performances by the two kids were great. I loved the fact that they seemed real. Kids fight like this they talk to each other in this way. And the kids at the same time weren't annoying in the least. They acted very naturally and non of their acting felt forced or fake. Tim Robbins makes a cameo as the dad of the kids.So in conclusion if you have kids rent this movie and watch it with them. Theyll learn something in the process and you'll go back to being that ten year old kid saying cool every five minutes. Its a win win situation.Rating 5 out of 5".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's face it Zathura is basically a carbon copy of Jumanji with the former based in space and the latter based in the jungle. Both involve children playing a seemingly innocuous board game that shockingly comes to life with the players needing to finish the game in order to survive.With two such similar premises how is that Zathura ended up as a completely superior film to Jumanji? In my view the reason begins and ends with the casting. Tim Robbins kind enough to take time out from his busy politicking schedule in order to actually do some acting work was perfectly cast as the father and added a sense of legitimacy to the film. The boys themselves were excellent young actors. Jonah Bobo as 'Danny' in particular was very impressive it's easy to recognize his talent and emotional range as he goes from contrite younger brother to jealous sibling to frightened school kid within the span of a few frames. Josh Hutcherson's understated performance grows on you as you realize that his role is to play the sullen longsuffering older brother.In contrast Jumanji had the overly exuberant synonyms for incredibly annoying? Robin Williams hamming it up yet again in one of his most unlikable roles a cameo by Frasier Crane's wife Bebe Neuwirth and two nondescript kids. 'Nuff said.I could go into plot points but the basic premise of a game that comes to life about sums it up. The difference is that the audience actually cares about the fate of the kids in Zathura whereas the average viewer is probably rooting for Robin Williams to be eaten by a wayward lion in Jumaji. If you're in the video store and are trying to choose between the two films' and if you can get past some questionable language by Jonah Bobo's character in the beginning of the film go with Zathura.".

	schema:reviewBody "After a long day of listening to my boys fighting I decided we all needed to get out of the house and see a movie. I corralled my husband my daughter and both of my sons into the car. I painstakingly made sure that my daughter sat between the two boys so that they could not kill each other on the drive to the theater. Sure enough the drive consisted of them reaching across their sister's lap to pinch and poke each other. By the time we reached the theater all I could think about was how great it was going to be to quietly watch a movie for two hours Little did I know that Zathura is a thinly disguised lesson in brotherly love. Throughout the first half to twothirds of the movie the audience is subjected to fight after fight between the two brothers Danny played by Jonah Bobo and Walter played by Josh Hutcherson. The resemblance to my two sons is uncanny. I believe I even heard the same words and pitch on the screen that I had been subjected to earlier in the daythis was certainly not the relaxing experience I had hoped for when deciding to go to a movie. By the end of the movie the brothers learn that in order to survive and return home they must learn to work together. The final scene shows the brothers playing ball together and acting like best friendsyeah right.Zathura directed by Jon Favreau is almost an exact replication of Jumanji released in 1995. The only difference is the age and gender of the participants and the location of the adventure. In Zathura Danny and Walter decide to play a board game that Danny finds hidden under the stairs. When Danny hits the button to begin the game meteors bombard the living room the house breaks away from earth and floats through space. If I hadn't seen Jumanji first this would have been a good movie. But after seeing Jumanji this was just way too predictable.As sappy and nauseating as the hourandahalf long sermon about getting along with your brother was for me to watch it seemed to have the desired effect on my sons. As we drove home my nineyearold son fell asleep with his head on his older brother's lap.My older son's response as he shrugged his shoulders for emphasis was He was hurting me with his head digging into my shoulder so I moved him. I might have believed that response if his hand was not protectively wrapped over his younger brothers shoulders. Even though I know that bonding will be shortlived it is a moment that will go down in history for our family.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow this film just wasn't very good. Nothing wrong with the visual aspect that I noticed and the basic premise seems to be a sound one but its execution and just about everything else about this movie stunk. You probably know the premise JUMANJI in space so no need for me to go over it. But I bet you didn't know that there's oxygen in space. Or so this movie would have you believe. Aliens and a robot move around and about the house and liberally smash great big holes into the house but the inhabitants two boys and their elder sister can breath just fine. One might chalk this up to this being a fantasy or some such if not for the fact that the characters themselves make a point about the concern about air. Also at one point a couch is set on fire set loose into deep space and continues burning blithely unaware of the laws of physics.As for the acting the two boys and teenage girl are grating and their acting is not very good but I blame this on a terrible script. The actors do the best they can with the lines given.As for the plot it's just an exercise in random events. Let me cite a few examples. At one point the game produces a gold card granting the player a wish. What does the kid wish for while they're flying around lost in space with a murderous robot in the basement and aliens blowing firing laser cannons at their house and they're constantly screaming at each other at the top of their lungs? He wishes for a football signed by Brett Favre. No really.But the stupidity doesn't stop there. The sister quickly develops a crush on the Astronaut a man who got rescued from space as a result of the boys playing the game. This Astronaut reveals to the older brother that he too played the game got a gold card and wished his brother were never born. Thus he strongly cautions the the boy about what he wishes for before he wishes for a football. This is significant because later in the game the same kid gets another gold card. This time he wishes for the Astronaut's brother to come back...And then we have a twist. The vanished brother is none other than the younger brother. The Astronaut is none other than the older brother aged about 20 years and trapped in space from playing Zathura. The movie does nothing to explain this odd paradox or anything else for that matter you're just meant to accept it.Of course we're also either asked to accept or expected to forget that the Astronaut wasn't able to recognize his younger brother nor his younger self nor the sister who had a crush on him btw we're meant to find this particular development humorous. The only twist here is in the movie's logic.".

You probably know the premise JUMANJI in space so no need for me to go over it. But I bet you didn't know that there's oxygen in space. Or so this movie would have you believe. Aliens and a robot move around and about the house and liberally smash great big holes into the house but the inhabitants two boys and their elder sister can breath just fine. One might chalk this up to this being a fantasy or some such if not for the fact that the characters themselves make a point about the concern about air. Also at one point a couch is set on fire set loose into deep space and continues burning blithely unaware of the laws of physics.As for the acting the two boys and teenage girl are grating and their acting is not very good but I blame this on a terrible script. The actors do the best they can with the lines given.As for the plot it's just an exercise in random events. Let me cite a few examples. At one point the game produces a gold card granting the player a wish. What does the kid wish for while they're flying around lost in space with a murderous robot in the basement and aliens blowing firing laser cannons at their house and they're constantly screaming at each other at the top of their lungs? He wishes for a football signed by Brett Favre. No really.But the stupidity doesn't stop there. The sister quickly develops a crush on the Astronaut a man who got rescued from space as a result of the boys playing the game. This Astronaut reveals to the older brother that he too played the game got a gold card and wished his brother were never born. Thus he strongly cautions the the boy about what he wishes for before he wishes for a football. This is significant because later in the game the same kid gets another gold card. This time he wishes for the Astronaut's brother to come back...And then we have a twist. The vanished brother is none other than the younger brother. The Astronaut is none other than the older brother aged about 20 years and trapped in space from playing Zathura. The movie does nothing to explain this odd paradox or anything else for that matter you're just meant to accept it.Of course we're also either asked to accept or expected to forget that the Astronaut wasn't able to recognize his younger brother nor his younger self nor the sister who had a crush on him btw we're meant to find this particular development humorous. The only twist here is in the movie's logic.";

Besides the special effects which today don't mean as much as they did in terms of dedicated work the movie is as hollow as possible.The idea of a game that takes two children in outer space is very well played NOT !!! by the amazingly 4 beginer ? actors. The conflicts are very poorly described and the reactions exaggerated and hilarious in a bad way.So to sum it up you get a lot more if you go and rent  buy 'Jumanji'  you'll change losing one hour and a half for a great movie.PS Considering the amazing high score it has until now this movie is either heavily promoted by the staff meaning they directly voted here D or children really recognize themselves in the two parodies of main characters which may be a lot worse.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always had a certain affection for Jumanji. Granted the plot is on the slight side and it's carried by a barrage of special effects but it still entertains and its a lively romp. 10 years have passed and we now have an almost unofficial sequel with the same basic premise but more fleshed out characters and the action taking place this time in outer space. That film is Zathura.Danny and Walter are two bickering brothers who have been left at home while their Dad has had to run out to work for an hour. In the meantime Danny discovers a retrostyled board game in the dumbwaiter. A game called ZATHURA. A very oldfashioned game with windup figures and cards that slot out when Danny starts playing the house is suddenly blasted off into outer space.Unaware of ZATHURA'S incredible powers Danny and Walter now have to put their differences aside and work together to finish the game if they ever hope to return home. But that's easier said than done with some of the obstacles the game throws at them. Meteor showers runaway robots lethal aliens and black holes.Anyone who's seen Jumanji will recognise the similarities between that film and Zathura but in some ways Zathura is a transmogrified version of the same idea. There is more characterisation evident here. Danny and Walter are two very realistic brothers who argue over the slightest things but the able playing by the actors ensures precocity is kept at bay.The film adds a level of realism to their relationship through the inclusion of a dysfunctional family unit. Their parents are separated and there are times when they blame each other for that even though they know deep down that it isn't true. It's not surprising the writing is so sharp with David Koepp handling the screenplay.Also Zathura is a very exciting film with a lot of great special effects undercut by a sly infectious humour. Such as their sister Lisa who is also in the house and accidentally gets caught up in the game when ZATHURA freezes her for a number of turns. There is some great slapstick humour to be had when the two boys have to move her frozen body and it goes sliding down the stairs.The effects are top notch better than Jumanji's. One moment that springs to mind is when they first realise they're in outer space. There is a dazzling image of considerable beauty when they open the front door and the vastness of space is out there. A lot of the spatial phenomena is handled well especially the wormhole at the end. A scene that quite takes one's breath away.But there is also a retro look to some of the things that emerge. Like the robot coming out with slogans that wouldn't have been out of place in Lost in Space or Forbidden Planet. Or rocket ships that have none of the sleek streamlined finish they have nowadays. I'm sure this would elicit fond memories of nostalgia from older members of the audience.Zathura is not strictly a kids film. It manages to generate real moments of suspense such as the sound of the robot coming or the meteor shower destroying everything. Some of the sciencefiction doesn't quite hold water though. They're in space but there's gravity inside the house oxygen and nobody gets sucked out into space when the doors and windows are open. Unless it's some form of protection afforded by the game but since it seems so insistent on placing them in danger you wonder why it would bother with aliens and robots to do the job when all it would have to do is let the vacuum of space in.But I suppose it's easy to ignore plot holes in light of Zathura's entertainment value. There is some fine ensemble playing from the cast including an astronaut in the game who helps fight off the dangers of ZATHURA. He has a rugged Captains Courageous characteristic to him and the truth of his identity brings a shocking twist to the exciting climax.Zathura is first class entertainment. An underappreciated gem with lots to enjoy and a fine example of how one film with an identical plot line can be adapted into something quite different.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story of the blind swordsman Zatoichi should be well known to most aficionados of Japanese cinema. I was thrilled when i heard that Takeshi Kitano of all people would be making a remake of the classic series. And i was not disappointed.The blind masseurswordsman Zatoichi stumbles upon a lone widow when he comes walking in the countryside. He helps her carry a basket and she tells him of her problems while he is invited to stay with her. The local town is plagued by a war between different criminal factions and the protection rates are constantly going up. Soon two geishas also arrive in town with their own agenda linked to one of the warring gangs.Zatoichi is a beautiful film in my opinion. Everything from photography and scenery to music is exceptionally well tuned to the mood of the film. Also the action sequences are very well made the fencing well choreographed and nicely shot. What distracted me somewhat though is the use of liquid animation for the blood. There is almost no usual fake blood in this movie rather it's liquid animationblood spraying when people are stabbed. This looks odd but it's still a minor distraction.Zatoichi feels both like a nice tribute to 60's and 70's samuraifilms as well as a fresh take on the genre. Both modern and classic which is one of the finest compliments i feel you can give a movie like this one. I enjoyed it very much and i rate it 710.".

	onyx:emotionText "The story of the blind swordsman Zatoichi should be well known to most aficionados of Japanese cinema. I was thrilled when i heard that Takeshi Kitano of all people would be making a remake of the classic series. And i was not disappointed.The blind masseurswordsman Zatoichi stumbles upon a lone widow when he comes walking in the countryside. He helps her carry a basket and she tells him of her problems while he is invited to stay with her. The local town is plagued by a war between different criminal factions and the protection rates are constantly going up. Soon two geishas also arrive in town with their own agenda linked to one of the warring gangs.Zatoichi is a beautiful film in my opinion. Everything from photography and scenery to music is exceptionally well tuned to the mood of the film. Also the action sequences are very well made the fencing well choreographed and nicely shot. What distracted me somewhat though is the use of liquid animation for the blood. There is almost no usual fake blood in this movie rather it's liquid animationblood spraying when people are stabbed.

There he meets many characters like the siblings on a mission a samurai who is hired by the gang as well as an unlucky gambler who befriends the blind swordsman.          This is the first ever Takeshi Kitano film I have ever seen and I got to say it turned out to be a rather pleasant surprise. Prior to this I have heard so much about Kitano's work and was really expecting to see a really good film. Add to that every samurai film I see normally gets compared to Kurosawa's works like Rashomon and Ran which of course are tough acts to follow. I thought the film was well made in many aspects. The cinematography was really beautiful and well made. The costumes like most period films were finely crafted and were beautiful. The scoring was also very good.         I always find it rather hard to laugh in a film that is nonEnglish. I guess I always believed that humour doesn't always transcend different cultures. What may be funny for one may seem rather dull in another. This film however debunks that thought.  I found myself laughing over a lot of scenes in the film. Even in scenes where you do not think there could be a funny moment Kitano is able to deliver one just to break the tension a little.        The fight scenes in this film were also well planned and I though it was done realistically but not necessarily done to shock the audiences with bucket loads of blood and mangled body parts. It was effective but not too disturbing.        I also thought that the overall story of the film was good. I was particularly interested with the story of the siblings and it's eventual resolution at the end of the movie.        Takeshi Kitano's Zatoichi is a great film which now ranks as one of my and hopefully it will be to other people. I'm already anticipating the next film from this great film and will also look for some of his earlier works.".

Some may complain about how this Zatoichi isn't consistent with the original Zatoichi but that was done by design. Kitano set out to create his own story his own character and his own version  simply using the legend of Zatoichi as the most basic blueprint from which to start. He deserves credit for creating something new and innovative even when working with an old story.

The creator of Hanabi 1997 and Dolls 2002 Takeshi Kitano turned to a historic figure of the Japanese culture and so directed his first period piece and directed it masterfully.Zatoichi Beat TakeshiKitano is a blind old masseur with blonde hair who can fight with his sword as well as Michael Flately can dance with his feet. He does not have many enemies but he is good at creating them in order to defend the just. And of course he attacks singlehandedly the biggest mafia clan in a village in 19th Century Japan. The plot is simple but it does contain some interesting moments which focus mainly on some minor characters. Hattori Tadanobu Asano is forced by fate to protect the baddies in order to save his wife while Osei Daigaro Tachibana seems to enjoy dressing as a Geisha along with his sister Okinu Yuko Daike in order to revenge the death of his family. Otherwise we have a lot of extraordinary fighting scenes with amazingly lowtech blood effects for Japanese standards.This isn't flying Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon for you but a gory downtoearth action epic in case you were wondering. It also contains a lot of humour in the most unexpected of places and apart from the wannabe samurai child it is frankly hilarious.Zatoichi is a still highly controversial. Our hero lives by gambling and he seems to enjoy living on other's mercy. However these are mild issues in comparison to the distressing moment when a 10year old Osei willingly offers himself to another man in order to gain money for him and his sister. I cannot recall another film in which homosexual paedophilia is promoted by children and more importantly as an acceptable means for achieving an end.Nevertheless there are two main reasons why this film should not be missed. First you have great performances given by the main leads especially by the Daigaro Tachibana in his first ever screen part and Michiyo Ogusu as Aunt Oume. And then the choreography  as you may witness probably the best group dance since the 1970s seen in a film. And if one mentions 19th Century Japan and tapdancing in the same phrase than this should be a hint to what you may be expecting. Believe it It is spectacular!

The village is split with rival gangs one of whom hires a troubled but talented samurai to wipe the others out.  Meanwhile two beautiful geisha sisters are more than they appear.  Into the middle of the impending bloody conflict walks Zatoichi.One of the good things about Kill Bill may well be that it brings a wider audience to the martial arts genre from the Far East on a bigger scale. If that is the case then this is one of the films that they will likely come to first in the cinema as it is about to have a full UK release.  I was able to see this as part of the Birmingham Screen Festival 2004 so I was in a full audience that was ready and willing to be entertained and this may have helped me enjoy it more than a half full cinema of people who have just drifted in.  With or without this atmosphere I found this to be an enjoyable stylish funny and violent film  but not without flaws.The biggest flaw is the plot sadly.  At it's heart it is a good story but the manner of delivery really hamstrings it's ability to engage and grip. I have read that it was meant to be a homagespoof of operas and my very astute and beautiful! friend told me that the way of having lots of minor characters to almost cover costume changes for the main actors is a musical thing and that the film reminded her of that.  While I accept that may be the reason for the way the film is it doesn't change the fact that it didn't work for me.  The films starts with difficulty  it is hard to follow with so many characters and gangs of which we are given no history to work with.  This continues for much of the film with minor characters coming and going partly contributing to the overall story but also breaking up the flow with subplots that are never really explained or understood.This trend continues with the film never getting a real tension or pace to it.  The conclusion of the film is a bit of a letdown  although I may have been conditioned to expect the big showdown' in this genre.  It still works pretty well but I just had a pretty big problem with the way the story flowed or didn't.  This is not to downplay how much I did enjoy it.  The film has a great thread surrounding Osei where he acts as a comic relief  all his stuff is very funny and it really helps to break the tension it's just the things like the bodyguard's subplot  nothing explained yet quite a lot of weight put on him.  While it does lack pace tension and punch it still works well enough to hold the action together.The fights are bloody stylish and enjoyable although I fear that those weaned on Kill Bill's excess will not accept it as gory enough.  The use of CGI blood may be a problem as well  personally I found it to compliment the otherworldly effect of the film by being almost more pronounced than real' blood would be.  The fights are enjoyable although they are perhaps a little too brief  certainly some of the more important fights were over way too quickly and without ceremony.  Generally though the film looks amazing. Each shot is framed really well and where the characters are still or set against a big background many of the shots would look great on a poster. The sets are fantastic and really capture the sense of period and place. As director Takeshi really has done well even if he could have done with a bit more help on the action front.The cast are roundly superb even where the are let down by the material a little bit in terms of their characters.  Takeshi plays his character with an easy going humour that contrasts nicely with his sudden violent movements at key moments.  Easily the standout performance though is from Taka who brings so much to the film with his likeable comic fool.  He is very funny throughout the film and his lack of background is not a problem as none of his strands call upon that like the others do.  Asano's bodyguard is interesting but sadly poorly served by the material.  The two sisters are OK but again their performances are overshadowed by the fact that their sections of the film are not as strong as need be  the slightly corny CGI ending involving them is only corny because I didn't have sufficient buy in to their characters to care that much.  The various villains fail to impose themselves on the film but enough is done by Takeshi and Taka to keep the audience engaged.Overall I did really enjoy this film.  It was visually very stylish funny engaging and enjoyable.  It has flaws with the structure the plotting in regards characters and suffers from a lack of real excitement or consistent tension but it is still more than worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Takeshi Kitano's offbeat samurai drama marks a personal triumph for the man himself and a notable entry for the genre. Kitano directs and stars as the blind samurai of Japanese pulp fiction Zatichi. He puts in a grand performance and really brings the character to life. His direction is superb also and he succeeds in creating a foreboding and tension filled atmosphere that also captures the familiar Kurosawaesque feel of the classic samurai movies. The story follows the fate of blind samurai master Zatichi. This master doesn't let a small thing like losing his sight get in the way and in spite of being blind the master is still the fastest man with a sword as he proves on a number of occasions. The first thing you will notice about the fight scenes in this movie is that they are bloodthirsty! That's no bad thing of course especially since the second thing you will notice is that there's lots of them. The fight sequences are definitely the highlight of the movie and they include some highlights in themselves as we watch in delight as limbs fly and people get sliced and diced! The fights in this film make the likes of Kill Bill look even more ridiculous than it does already.Takeshi Kitano creates his own world for the characters in the movie to inhabit and he also seems keen to incorporate as many elements as possible into the plot which is good in one way as it ensures that the movie is always intriguing and interesting but it does get a little convoluted and at times makes you think what's that there for?!. Still the film does offer lots of interesting little tidbits and it never gets so convoluted that it becomes boring. Well it can't do there's always another fight scene round the corner! The film is artistically played throughout and you get the impression that Kitano has an obvious respect for the art of cinema which is certainly no bad thing at all. Even though the plot is very familiar and anyone that's seen more than a couple of samurai movies will have seen one with a plot like this one has it's inventive enough to carve out a niche of it's own and it draws it's originality from that fact. On the whole this isn't a great samurai movie like the ones of yore but it's encouraging that films like this are still being made and it's easily one of the best movies of 2003.

	schema:headline " Good film about a blind samurai swordsman who helps unfortunate people";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie centers on Zaitochi  a swordsman who helps and saves hapless villagers . He's a Ronin a samurai without master . He will have to face a villain and a nasty gang . In the movie there is noisy action  Japan sword fights  high body count  emotion violence and lots of gore because of the murders are pretty savage . The blood in the film has been described by many as being too CGI. Kitano did this intentionally  wanting to soften the shock to the audience due to the brutal massacres . Kitano told the CGI artist he wanted the blood to look like flowers blossoming across the screen . The fighting stage is similar to Kill Bill saga . Kitano said that he wished the struggles to be as realistic as possible but that he wanted the blood to be extremely exaggerated . The runtime film is overlong and results to be slow moving in spite of the fights  which are fast moving and breathtaking  but the motion picture is a little boring. Two hours and some are a bit tiring . The picture obtained much success around the world and specially in Japan . Interpretation and direction by Takeshi Kitano is riveting  it's his best film . The ending confrontation between the starring and the enemies is overwhelming and impressive . The final dance set piece is a tribute to many of the popular Japanese movies in which the Hollywoodstyle happy ending was followed by a sudden burst into song  as Kitano wanted to attempt this  but in a different type of way . Kitano combined traditional Kabuki theatre clogdancing with the latest AfricanAmerican tap style . This dance sequence features all of the villagers but not the villains  the reason for not including Zatichi into the sequence was because Kitano felt that he was more of a villain than a good man . Film will appeal to strong emotions lovers and Takeshi Kitano fans. Rating 6510 . Good .".

	schema:reviewBody "I just finished watching this film and am surprised that it has received such a good rating on IMDb. The first problem I had was with the Zatoichi character. Zatoichi played originally by Shintaro Katsu was humble had a subtle humour the seemingly bungling master swordsman. This to me is what made him a memorable character. This new Zatoichi is simply ruthless with little of the honour he should have seems to look for a fight doesn't speak much has no humanity and therefore is hard to warm up to.The plot was my second problem. Those who enjoy the original films or TV series know that one of the best things about them is how the plots are well crafted... Zatoichi 2003 was not even close in this respect.Third was the shoddy secondary character development. For instance we were introduced to the bodyguard and his ailing wife and we want to sympathize with them but then the film went nowhere with their development to make us feel anything for them. The big internal conflict in the viewer when Zatoichi meets the bodyguard in combat should be how will I feel if this guy who is just trying to make money to heal his sick wife is cut down? Going into this fight the answer is... well not much. Fourth was the absolutely ridiculous modern tap hiphop dance sequence at the end  what was that about?!? Embarrassing and completely out of step with the rest of the film.Also of note I was under the impression this was set in the 16th century but a revolver was pulled in one scene. A small thing but it bothered me.One the whole very disappointing as a film in general and especially when compared to the originals.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK everyone loves this flick and I can see why to a degree. We all know the fights are pretty stunning. But bloody sword battles do not make a movie As a major fan of the old Zatoichi series I am terribly disappointed. I went into this film with expectations. I expected the film to revisit the original series at every turn. I wanted to see Ichi cheat at gambling with the old dice falling out of the sleeve trick. I wanted to see him use his blindness to make people think he was weak then punish them for taking advantage. I wanted to see him drinking hard womanizing and stuffing his face as often as possible. I expected him to be robust and handsome with a deep growling voice just like the original. Instead who did they have attempt to fill the shoes of Katsu Shintaro? An aged nobody with a feeble voice and distorted strokeface.The plot was weak as water. The movie was smattered with meaningless characters who provided neither humor nor serious plot device.. The retarded man who dreamed of being a samurai never did anything useful.. How cool would it have been if he showed up at just the right time to save someone's butt with his spear and subsequently get slaughtered? It would be shocking and he would have died a hero satisfying a samurai movie fan's lust for chivalrous selfsacrifice from the characters. The poor gambler who befriends Ichi is useless and unlikable as well. They spend endless time showing his attempt to build gambling skills which he fails at.... and that's the end of that. WOW. That's what I call pointless. Then he gets a wild hare and wants to dress like a geisha for no apparent reason other than to put him in drag for comic purposes.The camerawork was really horrible.. My main complaint was closeups where there should not have been closeups going to reaction shots when what we wanted to see was action starting out with a lovely angle that cuts away too fast to enjoy it.. The camera work threatens to be brilliant over and over and fails each time.The film also insults your intelligence by providing flashbacks to scenes that happened less than a minute ago. They hand obvious facts on a platter apparently to cater to the very least intelligent among us.The back story of the brother and sister team on a mission for revenge brings up issues for me as well.. When their attempts to rob Ichi and his incompetent gambler friend are stopped they suddenly tell their entire life story and plot for revenge and then they are now all boone companions... That in my book makes no sense whatsoever.And last but not least the festival. WHAT? Ancient Japanese tap dancing? We are treated to some bizarre combination of River Dance and Stomp set to vaguely Japanese sounding music. While three men dressed like Peter Pan are tap dancing they show all our friends from the movie there with them and apparently they've been taking choreographed dance lessons when not slaving away as peasants under yakuza rule... And what's better they all know to face the camera!! That doesn't look like a festival it looks like a stage show at the holiday inn. GIVE ME A BREAK. The festival scene absolutely destroyed the tone of the movie and was highly reminiscent of the way you end a children's movie or a cartoon.This movie shames Zatoichi fans as well as the Japan's rich film history. The writers would need to commit seppuku to regain their honor. Long story short real Zatoichi fans will be repulsed by this film. Steer Clear!!".

But Zatichi decides to help the village and get rid off the criminals.Zatichi is a good movie of Takeshi Kitano visibly inspired in Sanjuro of Master Akira Kurosawa. The gore story has adventure excellent choreography in the sword fights and lots of humor there is a samurai without a master offering his services of bodyguard to a gang in a small town and in the end the gangs are destroyed therefore there are many points very similar to Sanjuro. The parallel plots are well constructed and the cinematography is very beautiful highlighting the blood in the sword fights. My vote is nine.Title Brazil Zatoichi".

The final entry of the series directed by shintaro katsu himself was also controversial since it is the bloodiest most uncompromising and most swiftly paced of that series presenting us with pretty raw film with some unsettling themes.  ultimately zatoichi leaves the world pretty much as corrupted by yakusa as he first finds it.takeshi's zatoichi comes to us very stylized  blond with clean clothes a very neatly crafted sword cane. The violence is augmented by CGI blood spurting in the documentary accompanying the film on DVD takeshi is frank that he wanted the blood to look a little phony. And then there is the dance segment at the end foreshadowed throughout the film by rhythmic natural sounds of men and women at work.After trying to get a hold on this film and its clearly complex relationship to the original series through multiple viewings of the film I think I've finally grasped that the dance sequence is really the heart of the whole film. no matter what you think of it in relationship to the rest of the film it's extremely entertaining  so perhaps that's all we need to know about this film  perhaps it's all we need to know about the original zatoichi series as well.There is a strange question that recurs again and again in Takeshi's films  what do we do to entertain ourselves when death is near and there's neither need nor possibility of accomplishing anything with a purpose? In most of Takeshi's films the proper response to that question is to live life like a circus. Here obviously salvation is to be found in dance. I'm not sure that these answers are satisfactory but the question is too disturbing to ignore.".

I enjoyed the music especially when it was synchronized with work movements and other actions. Mainstream humor is not usually funny to me. The humor in Zatoichi made me laugh out loud throughout the movie. And I laughed the longest and hardest during the dance scene at the end because it was such a great ongoing parody of different musical genres and periods involving 60 dancers and including a lot of the cast. It transitioned from Shintu performance to river dance to Hollywood 30slike tap extravaganza to the 3 outfront tap dancers in green a la the Stepp Brothers  an act that performed in early Hollywood musicals and I think maybe on the Ed Sullivan Show as well to a wrapup with the look and style of a Bollywood musical production number camera angles  smooth flowing synchronized movements. I was howling by then. That in itself made watching Zatoichi worthwhile. But I just really liked the whole movie and I can't explain exactly why because the blood and gore were a bit over the top for me.

	schema:headline " One of a kind fabulous fantasy";
	schema:reviewBody "Since most of the other comments detail the plot I won't go into that here. Save to say that the story is by and large the least interesting thing about this wonderful film. It is what Kitano does with a simplistic genre story line that compels the viewer to engage with the story. And he does this by making all of the central 'characters' into believable people that you can take an interest in and care about. As is the case with socalled 'real life' it is not the 'big picture' that is of interest here but rather how boring reality is played out moment to moment that tells the real tale of life. In the midst of the on going humdrum routine are flashes of real beauty comedy tragedy horror and 'mystery'. It is 'believable' in the same sense that our own lives are believable.But in the film this kernel of reality is played out on the stage of cinematic art. And Kitano obviously has a fantastic artistic sensibility. From the first moment to the last the film is truly stunning to look at. The color the frame composition the camera movement the action of the actors are all created and combined to delight the eyemind and to propel the story forward. This is further enhanced by the use of natural sound and music. The music score is wonderful! And the several times when the natural sounds of the action are woven into the music as integral parts of the music are truly delicious.The viewer is never allowed to forget for long that this is a movie and at the same time a piece of movie art. This is especially true at the film's conclusion it's GRAND FINALE!! Much has been said of the film's musical ending. Every comment that mentions it is a spoiler for sure. I was lucky in that while I knew something of the 'Zatoichi' story I knew virtually nothing about this particular version. So Kitano's ending came upon me a complete and in the end overwhelming surprise! Since the 'cat' is well out of the bag in all these comments it can't spoil it any more for me to say Who would have anticipated a full blown Broadway Musical Grand Finale AND have it work stupendously!! And why not? The bad guys have been vanquished with blood sweat and tears. The good gals and guys are victorious. God is in IT'S heaven and all is right with the world at least for the moment so why not celebrate? Which is precisely what the people do. It just occurred to me that this ending is very much like the ending of SHREK! They have a 'festival'. And what is a festival without music and dancing.In this case the music and dancing are straight out of the realm of the extraordinary KOTO DRUMMERS in which percussion music is taken into wild and wonderfully new places. Remember STOMP!! I could write a million words about this ending and still not capture it at all. So I won't try. I will just say that if you have any 'soul' at all you will be dancing with joy yourself and thanking Kitano with all your heart that he had the 'soul' to end his film on this note. It is a moment of pure joy!! But it is not in fact the 'end' of the film. At the very end Zatoichi approaches the festivities and stumbles upon his own moment of 'truth' and in that instant brings the whole trip into 'perspective'. It was the final 'catch' of one's breath.As I have tried to point out in all of the comments I have written for IMDb any work of art must be approached on it's own terms. It cannot be criticized for not being some other work of art. This movie is the movie it is in the very best sense possible and is I think almost certainly the movie Kitano set out to make. I for one congratulate him for being absolutely successful in making a really great movie!!".

Very cool fighting scenes thats the outstanding part of this movie.The directing is pretty well done also although at times confusing and complex as mentioned before.But if you're into a symbolic and stunning action movie then this is definitely worth checking out there are of course times of the movie where it spends maybe to much time playing music and drumming etc sorta like the chinese movie Hero 2003 where there is also spend a lot of time doing that perhaps that's just how it goes for asian movies but that's ok as long as it doesn't bore one to death while doing it.And another thing the cinematography is pretty well done and looks pretty damn good at times.810".

The pacing is all off  scenes that should last for a minute or two a lengthy montage between the geishas as children and the geishas today go on interminably while scenes that need a bit more foreplay the run up to the big battles in the courtyard and against the roninbodyguard are too brief. The story is relatively simple even cliched which is fine except Kitano doesn't seem to know where to focus his attention either the geishas or the ronin are more interesting characters than Zatoichi himself and deserved either much more screentime or much less. As it stands they feel like types more than living breathing characters figures in need of development.The fight scenes are okay but overrated if you've seen any samurai movies before you've seen better stuff. Yes they're bloody but not unusally so check out AZUMI for a better use of gory effects.It is very funny in spots which is apparently typical of Kitano's work. The best sequence by far is the concluding tap dance number which feels utterly natural and joyous if more than a bit absurd. But there's my problem with this movie in a nutshell if the best things in your action movie are the jokes and musical number you're in trouble. It's okay just overrated.

But there's my problem with this movie in a nutshell if the best things in your action movie are the jokes and musical number you're in trouble. It's okay just overrated. AZUMI is a wilder ride TWILIGHT SAMURAI a far more interesting attempt at doing something interesting within genre conventions.";

It is agreed that it does a little too excessively melodramatic in places though to be fair there was always going to be the trap of that happening and momentum sags occasionally The film's print is not always great with the picture quality in need of more clarity and focus which would have allowed one to appreciate the otherwise beautiful cinematography better.However Eggerth is on top form her performance is delicate charming and moving with flashes of humour. She has an attractive presence too while being believably frail when necessary and sings a dream singing music here that her voice is perfect for. Her real life husband Jan Kiepura is handsome youthful and dashing with the right touch of ardour and idealism. He doesn't fare too badly as an actor if not as good as Eggerth and while his singing does have a finesse in places it is a truly lovely sound and he sings with feeling and lively style. The two are magical together.Eggerth and Kiepura are served well by a good supporting cast with fun turns from Paul Kemp Oscar Sima and Theo Liggins. It's all directed very capably and it's rarely dull.Imperfect print aside 'Zauber Der Boheme' is beautifully shot and sumptuously but also atmospherically produced in costumes and sets. The music is wonderful as to be expected while there is a lovely mix on the most part of wicked humour and tender pathos. The story compels and draws one right in even though the surprises factor is low right up to the heartwrenching ending.Overall has a lot of charm well performed and it delivers on the emotion. 710 Bethany Cox".

It is about the desperate attempt of an idealistic hungarian conductor to perform Tannhaeuser in the opera house of Paris. The problems he encounters are unbelievable... and for us viewers unbelievably funny.What really is wonderful about this movie is of course the music. It shows how much passion and love lies within classic music and how much work there is to do until the staff of such a big production is finally in synch.This film also offers a chance to get an insight into classical music pieces. Some of the most splendid passages of Wagners Tannhaeuser can be listened to in full beauty and thus the film might tempt some people to overcome their inhibitions and to dive into the world of opera.For those more interested in characterization there are a lot of weird persons playing in this story showing different kinds of European lifestyle and tackling topics like prejudice bureaucracy and of course love.".

	schema:reviewBody "Imagine you are one of Europe's most celebrated composers and that you have been invited to Paris to conduct a production of Richard Wagner's Tannhauser for the Opera Europa. You will be given a multinational cast of singers musicians and strong bold sets which are meant to elevate the opera to its biggest heights. You arrive feeling a little inadequate since Parisians are known for being artistic elitists the Germans believe only they can produce such a magnificent masterpiece and you. Although you are accepted with applause the pressure is on.And then imagine that anything and everything that could possibly go wrong takes place with the increasing craziness of a domino dance. Musicians and singers both have unions and demand having more controls over the schedules. Artistic vanity runs amok within the actors singers and pretty much everyone else who has their own overinflated selfimportance. One young singer falls has an accident and cannot continue with the rehearsals. Another one an American receives a visitor from what seems to be an exlover causing not only an inflamed jealousy in his current partner but a screaming match that ruins the American's voice. And on top of this you the composer are not only at odds with your leading lady but somehow have found yourself doing an aboutface and initiating a torrid love affair with her. And your wife finds out. Which may ruin your marriage.Not a good thing if Tannhauser is to be produced. Istvan Szabo brings this elegant farce of love and opera as if he's been there himself as a director he could be telling this story as if he himself were Zoltan Szanto Niels Arestrup the composer. His view of Szanto is one that looks like compassion this is a man who is trying against all odds to create something unearthly beautiful but the very humanity surrounding him is the main obstacle and at times seems like it will succeed and Tannhauser will not survive. And then when he falls for Karin Glenn Close in a role tailor made for her he completely and irrevocably falls for her but at times I wonder does she feel the same for him too? A Diva has been known for creating a web of romance around her composerdirector more than once. It's as if Istvan Szabo were telling us that probably the love she feels may be a wellpracticed pose to ensure her moment in the spotlight. That all Divas do are make themselves available for the sake of their own vanity.MEETING VENUS is a rarity of films because it never tries to be an easy farce and is too eccentric in its intertwining very European characters. Plots aren't solved in the satisfying way that most ensembles would require that is up to Tannhauser to do itself as much a character as its human counterparts to reveal itself like the flower that suddenly blooms at the tip of Szanto's bow despite the intrigues the nearmisses and even the lastminute inability to even open the stage which reduces the performance to just that. And this is what makes a performance soar its very presence its own transcendence the symbolic meeting and revelation of Venus among the audience.".

The action takes place in an imaginary Opera Europe in Paris. Istvn Szab the excellent film director is really interested here in fanatic people of the theater who came from several countries of Europe to unite their talent in order to create a successful performance of Wagner's youthful masterpiece. The ensemble is a mixture of multinational people the head of the company a Spaniard a former hero of the Spanish Civil War her private secretary and mistress descendant of a noble Russian family the conductor a talented young Hungarian who suffers from inferiority complex because of his Eastblock origin the singer who plays Tannhauser a permanently offended dumpy man from the DDR with beautiful voice the French theatrical technician a pig headed trade unionist who causes much trouble etc. They carry with themselves all good and vicious habits and traditions of their origin which cause many conflicts but humorous episodes as well during the rehearsals. There is a remarkable scene when at a dinner party the protagonists put aside all of their conflicts and sing together a song called Suliko which was once Stalin's favorite. They sing it not because they love Stalin but because of a certain nostalgia for their youth. In the center of the story stands the Hungarian conductor's and a Nordic singer's played by Glenn Close stormy love affair which ends in diminuendo using here deliberately this term of music. Strongly recommended for everyone who loves art and theater.".

I would recommend anyone to see this movie to simply enjoy it over a nice evening!!";

Bradley introduces her after a game to his favorite customer Harry Morgan Freeman a professor who is temporarily on leave from his job due to the death of a child. Harry a very intuitive and wise man married to a loving lady Jane Alexander sees immediately that Kathryn has eyes for another female softball player. In short order Kathryn calls it quits with Bradley leaving him very despondent. However a beautiful real estate agent named Diana Radha Mitchell soon warms his heart again. But alas she is having a secret affair with a married man named David Billy Burke even though she becomes quite close to Bradley as well. Then too Bradley has two young employees Chloe and Oscar who soon fall in love and move in together. But Oscar's abusive father The Bat Fred Ward very scary makes things difficult for them from time to time. In fact how strong are the chances for happiness among these fine people of Portland? If you saw the trailers you might think this was a romantic comedy. Not so not by far. It is a romantic drama with some comic elements but a great deal of inyourface depressing reality too. That is not to say it is not worthwhile for it is but no one will be humming a tune when he or she exits the theater. All of the principal players are quite good bringing depth to a story that could be dismissed at times as being overly melodramatic. As for the Portland scenery it is lovely as are the costumes and camera work. Benton the director has not been at the helm of a film for quite some time but he clearly shows he has not lost his touch. On the other hand this film is rated R and for good reason as it definitely has some sexuallycharged scenes. In brief if you are drawn to films that include romantic drama and sharp character studies this movie might do for you. Also fans of the cast will want to see it too. But be forewarned that some tears might fall and that the experience overall will be bittersweet.".

Think of the HoffmanStreep split in Kramer vs. Kramer and you will see the similarities with the breakup here of Greg Kinnear and Selma Blair. The number of intimate moments and personal insecurities are too many to count ... just like real life.Rarely do you see one partner slap the other in the midst of an affair when the one slapping is trying to lecture the soontobemarried other one that her morals need to be straightened out before she weds. In other words ... do as I say not as I do. Another good story line involved two young broken people who try to accept that life and love can be good. Played well by Toby Hemingway and a stunning Alexa Davalos the two lovers have overcome much in their lives and certainly appreciate the bond they have.The best story line in the film is the magic of Morgan Freeman and Jane Alexander playing the oldest interracial couple I can remember seeing on film. They are both hurting deeply from the loss of a son yet the strength of their relationship allows them to deal with grief in separate ways while still being there for each other. Two excellent performances.The center of the film is the lovable clueless hopelessromantic played by underrated actor Greg Kinnear. We see two relationships Selma Blair and Radha Mitchell end badly for him yet he clings to his belief that LOVE is what it's all about.I like how the only kids involved in this real world mess are old enough to make their own decisions. It would have been easy to toss in a kid or two to tug even harder at the tear ducts but this remained an adult story for adults ... and there are far too few of these. Be forewarned  this is no lighthearted chick flick. It could be termed a romantic drama but more accurately a human drama.".

And when film buffs begin to believe that the meaningful movies only come from foreign sources out pops the DVD release of a jewel like this film a story so well written Allison Burnett directed Robert Benton and acted by a gifted cast to show under scrutiny that it is the equal of the best of the 'sensitive films'.Based on a novel by Charles Baxter and adapted by Allison Burnett another extraordinary writer of his own novels CHRISTOPHER A TALE OF SEDUCTION and THE HOUSE BEAUTIFUL the story takes place in Portland Oregon and examines the lives and love stories of myriad characters each of whom is connected in some way to the father confessor of the town one elderly professor Harry Stevenson Morgan Freeman who not only narrates the threads of the people's lives that round out this film but also plays a significant role as a father of an only son who died in the recent past from a heroin overdose a man bruised and experienced in the vagaries of life supported by his wife Esther Jane Alexander both of whom cope with their loss by extending their love to young people.Bradley Thomas Greg Kinnear is an artist and an optimist who own Jitters a coffee shop and is married to Kathryn Selma Blair who loves sports...and leaves him for a woman who awakens her lesbian longings. A young recovering drug abuser Oscar Toby Hemingway works in Bradley's shop and in a magic moment falls in love with a sensitive free spirit named Chloe Alexa Davalos and is hired by Bradley on a whim. Bradley doesn't understand the complications of love he is an optimistic romantic but with an indomitable spirit that allows him to progress through marriages like a hero! Searching for a place to live after his marriage fails he meets real estate agent Diana Rhadha Mitchell who despite the fact that she is having an extended love affair with married David Billy Burke a relationship consisting solely of 'nooners' with wine and sex sees the rare vulnerable goodness in Bradley and once again Bradley is in love headed toward marriage. Meanwhile Oscar and Chloe share dreams for a perfect future despite a problem with Oscar's alcoholic abusive father Bat Fred Ward and some ominous warnings from palmistcard reader Margo Martindale. At the heart of each of these affairs of the heart is the supportive Professor Harry a wise man who observes reality and yet retains the courage to offer advice and love to all of the characters. In a short time Bradley's marriage to Diana fails as Diana returns to the now available David and in a moment of angst Bradley wounds himself is taken to a Dr. Vikashi Erika Marozsn for treatment and ends up falling in love yet again  and this time the feeling is wholly mutual. And just when the playing field of love seems even a major tragedy occurs which bonds all of the players surrounding the wise Harry and Esther and the resolution of all of the aspects of the feast of love come round.What makes this film so very successful is the gentle manner in which it is written and directed and acted. There is not a weak element here in this survey of the power and force of love. Some may find the generous scenes of lovemaking a problem but these scenes are in integral part of the story and never border on the superfluous or gratuitous level. The cast is excellent the pleasure of seeing actors of this wide age range work together in such a fine ensemble manner is doubtless due in large part to not only the individual actors of quality but also to the director. This is a beautiful film happy and sad tender and enriching and hopefully will be seen by a large audience now that it is available on DVD. Highly recommended.Grady Harp".

Searching for a place to live after his marriage fails he meets real estate agent Diana Rhadha Mitchell who despite the fact that she is having an extended love affair with married David Billy Burke a relationship consisting solely of 'nooners' with wine and sex sees the rare vulnerable goodness in Bradley and once again Bradley is in love headed toward marriage. Meanwhile Oscar and Chloe share dreams for a perfect future despite a problem with Oscar's alcoholic abusive father Bat Fred Ward and some ominous warnings from palmistcard reader Margo Martindale. At the heart of each of these affairs of the heart is the supportive Professor Harry a wise man who observes reality and yet retains the courage to offer advice and love to all of the characters. In a short time Bradley's marriage to Diana fails as Diana returns to the now available David and in a moment of angst Bradley wounds himself is taken to a Dr. Vikashi Erika Marozsn for treatment and ends up falling in love yet again  and this time the feeling is wholly mutual. And just when the playing field of love seems even a major tragedy occurs which bonds all of the players surrounding the wise Harry and Esther and the resolution of all of the aspects of the feast of love come round.What makes this film so very successful is the gentle manner in which it is written and directed and acted. There is not a weak element here in this survey of the power and force of love. Some may find the generous scenes of lovemaking a problem but these scenes are in integral part of the story and never border on the superfluous or gratuitous level. The cast is excellent the pleasure of seeing actors of this wide age range work together in such a fine ensemble manner is doubtless due in large part to not only the individual actors of quality but also to the director. This is a beautiful film happy and sad tender and enriching and hopefully will be seen by a large audience now that it is available on DVD. Highly recommended.Grady Harp";

It tells you that most importantly you need to be honest with yourself but also you really need to find out what to look for in this great journey of life.I believe Morgan Freeman led a excellent cast of actors but what I noticed more in the narrative was his distinct voice of reason that Mr. Freeman is so exceptional with in every film he does. So if you decide to take my advice and spend a couple hours away from your routine to take in this wonderful little film try to view it from a perspective that its message of thoughtfulness courage and heart might endure long after its over.I also enjoyed some great acting efforts from the always good Greg Kinnear and the Aussie Radha Mitchell which I think are worth mentioning separately but the whole cast was good. The film basically follows five distinct relationships six if you count Morgan Freeman's marriage as they fall in love stay in love or fall out of love. The story line is a little chaotic and improbable at times but like I said in the beginning sometimes you have to spare the analysis and let the experience just gobble you up and let you go.

At the core of this movie is the story of three couples and their loves losses toils and tears.Morgan Freeman and Jane Alexander play the older wiser couple who are suffering a heartbreak which is revealed about 13 of the way through the movie. Of the three couples they are the most interesting and the least explored. Here we have an interracial couple in their late sixties facing their mortality with a deep abiding love. I could have watched them for 1.5 hours! Couple their interesting story with the fine acting that these pro's deliver and you'd have a great movie.Greg Kinnear and X are the second middleaged couple. I say X because Greg goes through several women in the movie.Toby Hemingway and Alexa Davalos are the young couple. Romeo and Juliet young love yada yada yada.What annoyed me about the movie were the constant coincidences. I think only 10 people live in Portland and they all sleep together. On scene involves Greg Kinnear and his new wife Radha Mitchell who just ended a long affair with a married man but kept his shirt. Greg and Radha jaunt off to a party with Radha wear the aforementioned shirt. Guess who is at the party? Yup  married man and wife who Radha the real estate agent sold a house to years ago which started the affair. Of course wife recognizes Radha the Realtor and has to say hello where she of course recognizes the shirt since it happened to be a birthday gift from her to her cheatin' husband. And of course that shirt was missing a telltale button which eliminated any possibility of a duplicate. Thus drama ensued...Another scene that stretched my credulity followed quickly afterward when Greg Kinnear's character decides his body must feel the same pain as his heart and slices off the tip of his finger. Rushed to the hospital by wise and kindly Morgan Freeman who continuously admonishes him to stop telling people he did it himself Greg falls in love with the Doctor who stitches him up. What was amazing was the Doctor falls in love with the crazy guy who just chopped his finger off.Oh and the movie had way too much nudity. I'm not a prude but I'm not a fan of excessive nudity for the sake of nudity. Same with some of the coarse language.Overall rating I wouldn't pay an airline 3 for the headphones to hear this movie!".

Based on the novel by Charles Baxter almost every conceivable notion of the modern relationship gets worked into the entire story. And it helps too with an ensemble cast filled with beautiful leads from young upstarts to wisely veterans. As with most movies with a huge cast everyone's connected to one another through the inevitable six degrees of separation naturally for convenience but in this aspect it played to the early monologue and we take on the role of the Greek Gods who introduced the notion of love and see how each of our human creations scuttle around trying to make sense of it and through their individual journeys succeed or fail laugh or cry get spurned on to heights unimaginable or get thrown into the depths of heartbroken despair.Morgan Freeman can almost sleepwalk through any wise sagely character roles.

Such as whether you'll find the courage to go through hardship and difficulties with the other half knowing the consequence of it all finding little happiness and blessings in your daily life despite setbacks that take a stab through your heart and what I thought was a very very apt reminder and an important lesson to be learnt is to always open your eyes and not be blindsided by love just because of the endorphins that course through your entire body make it seem that you can tolerate shortcomings for the longer term.It's a reminder that in relationships one has to be first honest with oneself before seeking out that somebody else. Ditch those baggage and fear not to break away amicably should you realize that things aren't working out right. Never give up hope and to keep to your vows should you already have made them. Love is in the air but pragmatism should sometimes prevail or be considered in tandem.".

It looks like one of those stories where guy gets dumped meets nice girl pulls himself up by the bootstraps gets his dog back and heals his heart. WRONG! The plot goes more along the lines of guy gets dumped lots of people have sex or walk around naked guy pathetically buys dog from nephew plot goes nowhere. I have no idea how it ends because after an hour we gave up and walked out. It was that bad. Weak storyline predictable and uninspired dialogue unimaginative and excessive nudity and sex for its R rating. Even if you view the movie as a drama instead of a potential romantic comedy it still lacks depth and doesn't tie you to any of the characters. I found myself watching the scenes in the hope that just maybe the dog would be on camera at least he was likable and interesting. No such luck. Watch some of the rainy scenes you can see the sunshine in the background even in the big storm scenes. Altogether awful awful movie.Don't waste your time money or spot in your rental queue. Worst movie I've seen in years.".

Seriously though i found some parts of the dialog excruciating. As well who talks about their recently turned lesbian exwife to a complete stranger? Also the story itself seems to have been written by either a 15 year old or a midlife criser. It's just so clich... the young couple with a tragic end the alcoholic father the cutely naive 40 year old who gets his heart stomped on over and over again and above all the wise old black man. I think it's about time for Morgan Freeman to find other parts to play... It's also clich in that everyone falls in love at first sight somehow confusing lust for love.The acting was overall OK though sometimes Kinnear makes you raise an eyebrow. Truly I think the producers noticed the movie wouldn't have cut it so they decided to throw in a few naked chicks and I guess it works I mean i stayed till the end. The only reason i stayed though was for Alexa Davalos bom chicka wah wah.This could have been a really really good soap opera.".

So I went into the movie theater expecting a film that was if at least not awardworthy was a thoughtprovoking  wellmade picture. Plus it had Greg Kinnear  Morgan Freeman both Oscar winners what could go wrong? Everything.I have not read the book on which this was based but I cannot imagine it had the simplistic contrived and corny plot that the movie contained. The pacing was so painfully slow and quiet I could hear our crowded theater straining in their seats to stay awake during the long shots of Greg Kinnear's glossy eyes trying to convey his disbelief at why another woman has left him dude maybe it IS you!Even harder to explain is why the director felt it was necessary to have so many sex scenes. 'Feast of Flesh' would have been a better title. Didn't gratuitous nudity go out of style after 'Basic Instinct'? I like a passionate love scene as much as the next but when you have EVERY sexual encounter involve the woman grinding away on top of the man who of course isn't showing any of HIS private parts! it becomes very tacky and cheap. Okay Rhada Mitchell is HOT we get it! Can she have a conversation with a bra on at least? Nudity does not convey intimacy emotions convey intimacy.So if you want to bored senseless for long stretches of time by all means see this movie. You can then decide if this movies suffers from 1. a lack of musicscore I could have heard a pin drop at times 2. trying to mishmash multiple plot lines poorly 3. not developing characters enough so we don't connect or relate or 4. theme about the mystery of love is a very clich  tired concept.This movie does not prove a thing about the wonder of love just because the girl knew her boyfriend would die but married him anyway is probably the 100th movie to do this see 'Love Story' 'Dying Young' or 'My Life'. I got what the director was trying to show us but it wasn't original didn't explore anything new or move me. All this movie proves is that good directors can make bad movies!".

Feast of love a bookadapted movie is more pensive and at times sad although there is of course the lighter side. I often think that it's a sign of laziness when a film critic quotes dialogues but when two of the most widelyread critics do the same there should be some meaning to it.It's like this. The movie starts with Morgan Freeman playing a retired philosophy professor sleepless in Portland close enough to Seattle walks pensively from his house with voice over of his thoughts something to the effect of The Greek gods were bored invented humans still bored invented love which was not boring tried it themselves and invented laughter so they could stand it. That sets the tone of the movie.And while we are on philosophical thoughts one question that is asked repeatedly in the movie is whether love is just something to ensure the creation of new babies. This vaguely echoes Shaw's Man and superman what he himself calls a comedy and a philosophy the Life Force that brings a man and a women together in a supreme moment and all that.With considerable simplification one could say that the movie builds on the stories of three couples. Freeman and Jane Alexander play a couple who has recently lost their son to drug addiction and the deepest tragedy it that they never knew the truth until it was too late seeing their son only as what appears on the surface a successful doctor. In the second story we witness how a young couple meet played by Toby Hemingway and Alexa Blair  fall in love and dream about a wonderful future when they leaving their poverty behind build a beautiful family with lots of kids. The third story which is in fact the main plot is about a man's relationship with three women no not simultaneously but successively. Greg Kinnear plays an otherwise undistinguished man with Snow White simplicity and purity. Surely he doesn't deserve the agony of losing his first wife to her randomlyencountered lesbian lover and his second wife to her formal adultery lover. Still he finds true love and happiness when he encounters a doctor who does appreciate him. Here it's the second relationship that take the spotlight with Radha Mitchell portraying an attractive women who is driven essentially by her reckless passion. In a way this movie suffers in not fitting neatly into a niche as Love actually does and therefore not pleasing some people. But although it does not have the depth of serious dramas this move has its moments. And despite the opening quote this movie has a wider scope than mere romantic love as we find in the end. There is also a positive message however clich that with the tragedies that bring so much sorrow life goes on and if we make the best of it we'll see the blessings. The performances will not bring Oscar nominations as one critic puts it. But I would add that the acting from a rather large cast is uniformly above being mere competence.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a movie that features the always enjoyable Morgan Freeman and a decent amount of female nudity. Those are pretty much the only real selling points.Feast of Love focuses on a small group of people and the romantic contortions in which they engage. Harry Morgan Freeman is a college professor in Portland still coming to terms with a family tragedy. Harry is friends with Bradley Greg Kinnear a man who deeply needs to love but is so oblivious to the people he loves he doesn't notice his first wife Selma Blair is a lesbian and his second wife is an adulterous bitch. That second wife Diana Rhada Mitchell lets herself be romanced by Bradley because he's so unobjectionable even though she's really in angry unhealthy love with another woman's husband. Bradley owns a coffee shop where Oscar Tobey Hemingway works and Oscar falls in love at first sight with Chloe Alexa Davalos a coupling not approved of by Oscar's angry and violent father Fred Ward.I think the point of this story which was adapted from a novel is to make you think about the utility of love. At one point Diana says love is a trick to get people to procreate while Bradley says love is everything. Is all the pain and difficulty of seeking out and pursuing love worth it? I'm not sure the answer offered up is supported by the evidence in the movie.The fundamental problem of this film is that it never settles on a main character. At first you think it's going to be Harry as the center of this romantically troubled crew. But then the movie focuses on Bradley's first wife and her yearning for a love she doesn't have. But after she leaves Bradley and hooks up with another woman the movie forgets about her. Then you think the story might focus on Bradley and his recovery from a failed marriage but as soon as he meets Diana the story focuses almost entirely on her and Bradley becomes a supporting character until they breakup and the focus shifts again to Bradley. Even with Oscar and Chloe the story starts out concentrating on Oscar and his poor upbringing but then for no particular reason shifts to looking at the relationship from Chloe's perspective and Oscar essentially disappears. As soon as you get interested in a character and their story the film decides it's done with that person and brings someone else to the forefront.The other significant problem with the film is that it wants to believe that no one ever really gets that angry. It wants us to accept and even endorse a world where Bradley's first wife cheats on him with another woman and his second wife cheats on him with another man but after his third marriage he can still be friends and pal around with his exes. But when supposedly traumatic personal events don't have any emotional consequences they don't have any emotional significance either.As for Feast of Love's good pointsMorgan Freeman gives another fine performance and yes he does narrate parts of the movie. And Selma Blair Rhada Mitchell and Alexa Davalos all look quite good naked although there are moments when the movie is so gratuitously showing off their female forms that the only thing missing is a blinking neon sign that says Nudes! Nudes! Nudes! Feast of Love isn't ultimately an aggressively bad film. It's just not good enough or perceptive enough to tell you anything about love and heartache you don't already know.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see this movie with the idea that it was a lighthearted comedy...nothing could be further from the truth. It wasn't the best film I have ever seen but far from the worst. The truth is it made me stop and think about a few things that I wouldn't have otherwise. One is to really pay attention to the dynamics of your particular relationship and to the person that you share it with. Another is to live each day as if it were your last...life is fleeting so enjoy it to the fullest while you can. The last thing I took away from this film is that there is a lid for every pot...you may not find the right person the first time around or even the second time around but if you don't give up on love some day you might find that one special person that was meant for you.Most of the above is pretty sappy and I'm not generally a sappy person but these are some of the feelings this movie brought out in me. I would not want to see this type of movie on a consistent basis but once in awhile I find it refreshing to focus on human nature and how we are all fumbling through life with our own problems and ways of dealing with them.Morgan Freeman and Jane Alexander were superb as the older couple profiled and I truly enjoyed Greg Kinnear as the guy that refused to give up on love. I would recommend this movie to anyone that has a sensitive side they want to explore...otherwise stay away!".

There's Morgan Freeman the wise old man who is friends with Greg Kinnear who is a bit naive when it comes to love despite his bad experiences which make his character more enjoyable. And there are the two young loves both with hard past. The two actors who portrayed these characters this was the first time I've seen either or them and I hope to see them again both gave excellent performances. The only complaint is the overly graphic sex scenes. They could of been toned down a bit. It was a bit too much and it did take away from a good and interesting plot.

It was quite surprisingly a very enjoyable film for me mostly because of the chemistry between Meg Ryan and Alec Baldwin I thought they captured the blissful uncertainty of falling in love and thought the subtext was an interesting commentary on love and marriage and what we see in others. It's no great work of art but it is moving and sweet. I really enjoyed watching the two leading stars. Of course they're beautiful and all that but they managed to seem human and flawed at the same time as did the parents and I didn't feel this movie was overly sappy at all. They seemed to talk to each other the way people do and less like your typical Hollywood snappy dialogue. There were some interesting and touching moments such as the contrast between what the old man thought a married couple should act and how Alec Baldwin thought they should as he looked longingly at the couple kissing in the pool while his new wife possessed by the old man chatted away with an older couple.Oscar winner Kathy Bates was totally wasted here though. I wonder if her part had been bigger and then got cut later.".

Then there is the powerful moment after Meg Ryan and an elderly man somehow swap bodies and Baldwin looks at his wife and asks where is my wife?! because he just knows that she is not the same person he fell in love with even though it was her body and she looked like his wife there was something wrong...something off....when it came to her spirit and the way she thought and acted. Incredibly original stuff... to show how deep love is actually. That we could tell whether or not someone is our soulmate even if they changed physical form. It also showed how we love and embrace all those annoying little things about our lovers that we complain about and don't agree with. I thought it was extremely cute how he missed all of his wife's neurotic and strange idiosyncrasies. All of her foibles were as important to him as all of her best traits.This is a very underrated movie and a must see for anyone who is a romantic.".

The key to the movie is in the advice the heroine's mom gives the hero when he talks to her on the phone. The movie is about the nature of love and whether it means more than just being attached to an attractive exterior. The magical aspect is just a way of confronting this question in a new and powerful way. Also notice that almost the first conversation the two lovers have is about a book The White Hotel which is a depiction of life where the word tragic is maybe an understatement. Like many movies made from plays the writing is crisp and to the point. Meg Ryan is fine but Alec Baldwin is riveting when his world falls apart. He is a walking picture of grief unable even to be civil to the bartender who is a friend. There is a great soundtrack from the Cowboy Junkies and Lou Reed to Annie Lennox. There is one sublime moment when the hero rises above all convention and expresses his love leaving behind all rational normal ideas of what is okay to do. Well needless to say I love this movie.

It ponders the nature of true love....and then gives an answer.  It asks the more contemporary question..what do you do when the person you love becomes sick repulsive and dying?Of course this is an allegory for aids but the concept of loss is universal and Baldwin gives a great performance in conveying feelings of loss and helplessness.".

This is obviously a fantasy but the supernatural elements are handled in such an understated way that it is almost believable.The best thing about this movie is Meg Ryan's face. She has never been so adorably daffy and several scenes where she mugs outrageously are hilarious. Alec Baldwin does his best to act the role of a really nice guy caught in an impossible situation but he fails to be totally convincing Just under the surface is his true rowdy dude persona fighting to get out.Peter Baldwin and Rita Ryan are young Chicagoans who meet and immediately fall in love. On their wedding day their paths cross with that of Julius a weary ill lonely old man. Rita and Julius momentarily envy each other's life for reasons that are surprisingly similar and magically their souls switch places. On the honeymoon Peter begins to suspect that Rita is not the woman he thought he knew. He figures out what happened and this brings together Peter and Rita now in Julius's body. The film moves toward its climax with all three principals being sorely tested trying to deal with their predicament without being taken for lunatics by their friends and family. Resolution when it comes is deeply moving. Inevitably the film has a happy ending. Younger viewers will be satisfied with the ending with everyone back in their own bodies. Older viewers will feel left hanging. Wasn't Rita more affected by her experience inside Julius's skin? Wouldn't she want to keep up a relationship with this person with whom she has shared more than anyone ever has in the history of the human race? How will she feel when he dies? Wouldn't a piece of her go with him? Furthermore it begs credulity to assume that old Julius could figure out so fast how to dress put on makeup and do hisher hair like Rita. And how does Rita know exactly how to dress as Julius? How does Julius as Rita even know which toothbrush is hers on their honeymoon? However these are minor flaws in a film concerned with bigger questions and most viewers will feel more or less satisfied at the end of the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Prelude to a Kiss .5Norman Rene did a very smart thing in his first feature as director. He took a known and successful play with an original story cast two well known Hollywood romance specialists to play the leads and let them determine how good the movie is. Alec Baldwin and Meg Ryan the two leads deliver quite well making Prelude to a Kiss one of the more original thoughtful geniuately sweet and overall firstrate romances in recent years. The movie begins with the common cliche total opposites attract. PeterBaldwin is a nerdy somewhat conservative manager of a science information firm. His friend and coworkerStanley Tucci introduces him to freewilled liberal bartender RitaRyan. Although the actions of Peter that first night don't exactly show it Peter has fallen in love with Rita. The next night Peter visits Rita at her bar and after an intital akward period the two hit it off. For a period of time they are a couple in love and then about a half an hour into the movie Peter poses a marriage proposal which Rita accepts. SPOILER ALERT If you don't want to know the twist that changes the direction of the movie stop here.Peter and Rita are married. Meanwhile we see a mysterious old manSydney Walker in his film debut wandering around and ending up at the wedding. He congradulates the bride and groom who acts civily towards them although they have no idea whats going on. The old man asks if he can kiss the bride Rita accepts and suddenly we see a supernatural occurrence which we soon find out involves the soul switching of Rita and the old man. Eventually Peter figures it out and comes to the definate conclusion that Rita the woman he loves is in the old man's body and vice versa. In quite possibly Baldwin's best movie scene everriviling with the memorable I own your asses lecture in Glengarry Glen Ross he confeses to Rita's body and soon things become a mess. Peter realises he has to find the old man's body with Rita's spul inside. I've probably given away too much at this point so I will not dare tell you the ending although it no doubtly it will recieve mix emotions. Personally I found the story intriguing and thoughtful sometimes even forgetting that it was a total fantasy. The acting for the most part is wonderful. Meg Ryan's performance is as good as City of Angels which parts of this seemed similar to. She is able to develop great chemistry throughout. Walker's debut performance is masterable. Although they are brief roles Patty Duke and Ned Beatty perfectly fit the role of Rita's parents. One criticism I have of the film is casting talented actors like Stanley Tucci and Kathy Bates in completely nothing roles. However like I said earlier the key to the movie is Baldwin. In movies like Glengarry Glen Ross Malice and even the recent Pearl Harbor he has been able to portray the cool calm man in control. However this by far is his best performance because it's the only one that has ever let him do great things without talking. His facial expressions are as telling as prime Pacino or DeNiro. When he is overjoyed or deeply saddened it's so genuine that the viewer feels it. Although Baldwin wasn't in the same league as 92's Oscar Winner PacinoScent of a woman one of the great films of cinema he neverless should have at least merrited a nomination and in a weaker year he probably would have. Prelude to a Kiss is not a masterpiece and does not try and go overboard in making a statement on society. It recognizes it's job to make the viewer laugh cry and smile and does it better than most movies in this genre would.Rated PG13 for a few crude sexual remarks however I think Prelude could have gotten by with a PG this is an appropriate film for kids who are interested....1 hr 50 min a 20th Century Fox release".

Meg Ryan is amazing as the complicated Rita. She is both free spirited yet unbelievably pessimistic. Alec Baldwin is brilliant as usual as Peter who falls head over heels with Rita despite all of their differences. When a strange old man kisses Rita on her wedding day they switch bodies and it is Peter who knows his beloved so well that he immediately figures out that Rita is not herself. When he meets the old man and wants to be with him because he knows that his wife's soul is inside the old man's sick and dying bodyit's just heartbreaking. Kudos also goes to Sydney Walker who plays the old manhis monologue about life brought me to tears and he brings out the true spirit of who Rita really is. A must see for anyone who believes in true love and its power. I give it a 9 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS THROUGH Prelude to a kiss is a very strange film but also a very good one. Meg Ryan and Alec Baldwin portray the two main characters who meet and fall in love. Meg Ryan's character Rita is a lovely and complex woman frightened by living life to the fullest. On the couple's wedding day just after the two are married Rita comes face to face with a mysterious elderly manSydney walker who nobody at the wedding seems to recognize. While everyone is trying to find out who he is he asks if he may kiss the bride. During the kiss the souls of Rita and the old man switch and both find themselves in the body of the other.This is no Freaky Friday or Big. It's not a comedy though there are a few funny moments. But by and large it's a love story and a touching one at that. All three of the main leads are great. Baldwin is Subtle and convincing and this maybe the best role I've seen Ryan in since When Harry Met Sally. But Walker is the standout he being exceptionally well cast as the old man and his performance is absolutely outstanding. This is a strange story but extremely touching and for one who is tired of the same old tired romantic comedies this is a welcome change.One thing that I liked was that the movie makers did not turn this into a thriller. I kind of expected the old man to develop a disease and the movie turn into a race against time to get the souls switched back. The movie surprisingly stayed fairly light though there were many serious touching moments particularly toward the end.The best scenes by far occur after Baldwin recognizes his wife as the old man and Rita in the old man's body learns to stop being afraid. The dialog is very good and I liked this movie. It's definitely unusual and well above average. My vote's 7.5 of 10.".

So now we're expecting to fall about laughing and because Meg Ryan's in it we think of 'When Harry met Sally' or something similar. 'There's something about Mary' has a storyline based on one man's love for Mary but it's the comedy which carries the movie not the love story. But this film is not like this at all. First and last this is a love story. Yes it makes you smile at times but Mike Baldwin's wonderful portrayal of Peter is very moving. SPOILER ALERT!!!When he knows he's lost the love of his life when to all intents and purposes she's still standing in front of him it is so poignant. So if you love a really good romance watch this unusual and lovely film. All the acting is excellent but Mike Baldwin gets my vote for as has been said elsewhere the performance of his life.

Baldwin Beetlejuice plays Peter a businessman who meets and finds romance with Rita Ryan a designer turned bartender who has a negative outlook on life. Soon fate takes them on a journey when a mysterious sickly old man Julius Walker crashes their wedding and kisses Rita. Peter starts noticing changes in her behavior discovering that Julius and her have magically switched bodies. Eventually things go back to normal and Rita's outlook on life changes. Bates Titanic plays Leah Julius' daughter Beatty and the late Duke play Rita's parents. This is pretty good and Baldwin and Ryan have good chemistry. I recommend this.".

Now this is not a completely unique premise...remember Like Father Like Son with Dudley Moore? That was actually a somewhat funny movie however the premise doesn't work when trying to be serious. I think Meg must have been relieved to have success the following year with Sleepless in Seatle...because Prelude was a disaster.

Rumors of the Owens women being witches have existed for generations in the small close minded town in which they live despite there being no hard evidence.

I just loved the sets the costumes the women and their relationships the real magic in the film the special effects the child actresses.  This was stuff that women could relate to better than men. Aidan Quinn was the only boring part of the movie.  I wished they'd chosen an actor who was more into the role.  He seemed bored and made his part in the film more boring.  Also he mumbles.  Someone should give him elocution lessons.This movie wasn't meant to be heavy.  It was meant to be light fun fluff and that it is.  The characters weren't meant to be deep but I felt the relationship between the two sisters was deeper and well performed by two skilled actresses.  In spite of the fluffiness of it I enjoyed the two scenes in which we got to sit and relax to the sound of Stevie Nicks' Crystal.  So what if cars weren't crashing and guns weren't shooting. They weren't supposed to be.  I felt the camaraderie of the moment as the two sisters and their aunts got drunk on midnight margaritas while dancing to Harry Nilsson's Lime in the Coconut.  It was just plain light fun. Also women can enjoy the vicarious satisfaction of watching these women destroy the evil bullying man who tries to destroy them. The end of the film was rather Disneykiddieflicklike.  Another ending might have worked better but it was tolerable because it reminded the audience that the film was all in fun and not to be taken seriously.I usually prefer deeper films but I thoroughly enjoyed this piece of fluff. Sure it was silly and campy but it was fun.  A film doesn't have to take itself seriously to be fun.  Bullock Kidman Channing and Wiest are beautiful charming and wonderful to watch in this flick and I love watching the four of them over and over again.".

Nicole Kidman had never been one of my favorite actress either but I loved her in this movie as I did Sandra Bullock. The real standouts though were Stockard Channing and Diane Wiest  watching them perform was almost worth the price of admission itself! They are wonderful.I don't see this movie as being about magic or witchcraft the romance between Sally and Gary Hallet or even Jimmy Angelov chasing Gillian which is a huge catalyst  but not really any more than that. For me this movie is really about the relationships between sisters and women the Aunts Franny and Jet Kylie and Antonia the Owens' women and the townswomen and of course between Sally and Gillian  both young and adult.All of the actresses had a great chemistry but I couldn't believe how well matched Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman were. I felt that their bond was very believable and I loved watching their relationship to each other and themselves grow and mature as they went from being children to adults.I certainly don't think that this film will appeal to everybody and I can see why so many people don't get it but if you watch it more for the relationships between the women and not so much for the romance angle or the magic I think that you will really enjoy this movie. I thought that the romance and magic were handled very well I just saw them as being secondary to the real story. Also  it has a wonderful soundtrack.I read the book after seeing the movie and while there are many changes between the two I really enjoyed both. I thought that the changes made to the movie made for a better movie overall.All in all a very enjoyable movie. I highly recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "A couple of months before Practical Magic came out in theaters I read the novel it was based on by Alice Hoffman and loved it. So when I went to see 'Practical Magic' the movie I didn't know what to expect since most movie adaptions from books are very different and disappointing. But while this was very different from the novel I was pleasantly surprised. 'Practical Magic' is not your average romantic comedy or your average witch movie. Instead it mixes the 2 genres together and creates a sparkling film that never gets boring. Even though some scenes are a little farfetched the acting relationships and storyline keep it from getting too weird.As for the cast I don't think it gets much better. Sandra Bullock pretty much plays her usual character but she plays it with a wellacted sensitivity and you definitely sypathize for her. Nicole Kidman is brilliantvery wildchild but not so trampy that you hate herand probably the most interesting character  and the best performance in the whole movie. Dianne Weist and Stockard Channing are extremely well cast as the eccentric aunts and their onscreen presence is breathtaking. Aidan Quinn is also very good playing Sandra Bullock's 'perfect man'. So what's my final outlook on 'Practical Magic'? Excellent. Sure it's not a flawless Oscarworthy masterpiece but it's fun and one of the most interesting films I have seen in a long time. So if you're looking for a wellacted wellwritten unique film I definitely recommend 'Practical Magic'. And don't forget to read the book!".

The movie fails to fully develop the town's overt fear of witches missing only slightly the full foreboding of something wicked this way comes with Jimmy although the script lets them get away with it and the magical love bond between Sally and Gary.  A few small changes such as more supportive background music would have made these points support and counterpoint the lighter parts of the flick.Bullock and Kidman are very good as the central characters very believable as differentbutbonded sisters.  Kidman is a little too flaky at times to be a fully credible witch but this characterization runs well enough in context.  Channing whom I rarely enjoy and Wiest are excellent in major supporting roles outdone only by Webb and Wood Sally's daughters who show their abilities by not overacting their potentially cutesy roles. Instead they do a great job in stating variations on their mother and Aunt Gilly.Overall I think most aspects of direction and production could have used one more iteration of quality improvement.  Still the movie is quite enjoyable and worth watching again some time.".

How wonderful to hear those words come out of Sandra Bullock's mouth! I was simply delighted.I'm not going to sit here and waste your time with the plot. The movie's been out since 1998 and most of you already know it. If you haven't seen the movie the rest of the reviews gives you the plot ad nauseum.Nicole Kidman's character Gillian Owens is played wonderfully as a seductress. It was a bit stereotypical remember the flighty Wiccan in Blair Witch 2? but well played by Kidman.I did not like the use of Belladonna as it is used in the movie. It portrays a dark intent which is something anyone in the Craft will tell you is strictly against the rules. However it is a tendency in Gillian's Kidman's character to be drawn towards the dark path and was therefore fitting.And who can't identify with Sandra Bullock's Sally Owens wanting nothing more than to be normal? Who IS normal? WHAT is normal? Love is normal. And that's all she wants is to love unequivocally and receive that love in return. And then there's The Owens Family Curse. We all have ours. Some bald early some have the unbelievably spacious nose inherited from Uncle Elmer. My family curse is the lack of childbearing women in My family hence I am the last of My mother's family. She had only Me and I have bore no live children. At least she didn't put the usual curse on Me. The I hope you have a kid JUST LIKE YOU! curse..The idea of Sally Bullock owningoperating a botanical shop I manufacture bath oils is spot on. Many Magick Users long to do something along those lines.Sally and Gillian's bringing back Gillian's lover Goran Visnjic from the dead ?! We don't do that. Dianne Wiest as Auntie Bridget Owens That spell book would have had to have been passed down from at least 5 generations if not more to even HAVE a spell like that within its bindings. That having been said those in the Craft don't do that. Most CAN'T do that and those who can...well...shouldn't. Necromancy is of the Dark Arts and is no part of the Craft. And finally the ending.The ending was quite fantastic and over the top. Insanity if you ask Me but ... no one did.Jumping off the roof of their house in full witch regalia complete with pointy hats bucked shoes and red and whitestriped stockings and floating down to the ground safely and slowly FLOATING! down like that...put a fantasystyled ending to what otherwise would have been a big boost for Pagans in the mundane world.It's a very entertaining story and contains great portrayals by.... Sandra Bullock .... Sally Owens Nicole Kidman .... Gillian Owens Stockard Channing .... Frances Owens Dianne Wiest .... Bridget Owens Evan Rachel Wood .... Kylie Owens Alexandra Artrip .... Antonia Owens ...right up until the ending. But the ending doesn't negate the entire movie. It just degraded its value far more than Pagans would have liked. It still gets a 7.210 from...the Fiend .".

When Maria Owens jumps off the hanging ramp snaps the rope and scares the hell out of 38 people and the dove even flys away as quickly as he can. That's funny! It's easy to follow all through the movie and I really like that. This movie was a laugh academy all the way. So so many laughs. The best one was when Sally mouths out I don't know When Gary has Jimmy's hand go into him and he's outside the look on his face is priceless. I could go on and on about this baby. It was great with a great cast great acting and of course Sandy Bullock and Nicole kidman. How can you beat that? Those two are a sheer delight. I think you get the picture. I love it! p.s. Nice po po in the garden scene of SANDY. I also don't want to get in the way of Sandy's left hook. Joe Frasier would go down.".

Why was Adian Quinn in the previews he had such an invisible role?  Are we to believe that all of the town people were scared and angry at the witches just because they had never been invited over for demon killin'?  Why was that margarita scene filmed? Why? Why? Why?  I haven't been this horribly amazed that a movie actually made it to the screen since Hush.  Griffin Dunne has done good work in the past?!  Sandra take note this is no way to revive a very short lived career  how much money did you make on this?  Shame on you for taking any of it  you should distribute it back to the people who had to sit through this movie!".

Without Keanu Reeves and a speeding bus to mask her performance Sandra Bullock is even more irritating than usual and Aidan Quinn appears in this kind of rubbish regularly. But Dianne Wiest and probably Nicole Kidman should really have known better. It's almost worth watching this movie simply because if you've been moaning about THE PHANTOM MENACE or THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT or whatever you'll realise they are better than CITIZEN KANE compared to the utter garbage that is PRACTICAL MAGIC.".

The basic idea is that Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman play witches and Sandra can't have a normal romance with a human because she is a witch.We learn this early on and from this point on the film ambles through plot lines and ideas each with about fifteen minutes till it moves onto the next idea which last for another 15 minutes. Each moment is so disconnected from the rest that you feel no real passion for the characters and no distinctive connection to the story if you can call it that.If you're after a good chick flick with magic see Stardust if you want a good chick flick in general see Bring it on but for pity's sake please avoid this one. It's got Akiva Goldman's name on it and is from the same school as Batman and Robin. Don't say you've not been warned.".

I think the more important aspect of this movie though is how it presents modern Paganism Wicca in particular.Coming from a Pagan point of view myself I've been waiting for this movie to come out with many mixed feelings and misgivings.  I was hoping that it wouldn't be another typical witch movie and I must say that I was really pleasantly surprised.  It did glamorize the workings of the Wiccan Craft quite a bit but that's to be expected. How many movies are there that don't do that to their subjects? Take Xfiles...I'm positive that there's a lot more paperwork than action in the FBI but you can't make a movie out of filling out forms.  If you look past the flashy stuff that was put in to draw audiences and make the movie appeal to the general public you find a wellresearched representation of what Pagans do daytoday.  So even though it wasn't totally true to today's form of Paganism I must say that it was a step in the right direction of overcoming all the negative PR that Pagans have had to endure all these years.  This is the kind of thing that is needed to convince the mass populace that we are not better or worse or dangerous but just different.  So please support this movie as part of the ongoing campaign to get all of us out of the broom closet.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to believe 'Romance on the High Seas' is Doris Day's first flick. She's awesome in a role originally intended for Betty Huttonand everyone has a great time poking fun at manners and morals in this breezy sea breeze of a farce. When Day and Jack Carson aren't coming up with oneliners she takes time to sing some nifty tunesamong them 'Put 'Em in A Box' 'It's You Or No One' and of course 'It's Magic'. Her rendering of the latter song in a Cuban nightclub is one of the highlights of the filmand her career. Never has she expressed the simple emotions of the lyric more beautifully with a honey of a voice that is always directly on pitch warming the heart with great phrasing and tone. And her comedic skills are already in evidence here. Especially enjoyable is her first night on board the cruise ship when she and Carson mistakenly dress up. Nobody dresses on first night shipboard Carson tells her. Posing as a society lady she asks in cultivated tones Really? Don't they get chilly? She turns and peers into the dining room. This I gotta see! she says in her own voice. She uses the cultivated tones to disguise herself as society lady Janis Paige whose identity she has taken. The slim plot revolves entirely around the mistaken identity theme and it's all played for laughs with lots of punch lines. Doris has an amusing scene with the fabulous Eric Blore as a doctor who comes to check on her illness and ends up feeling weak when she checks his pulse. Janis Paige Don de Fore S.Z. Sakall Oscar Levant and the usual Warner Bros. stock players are all adept at this sort of thing. Highly amusing comedy with some great songseasy to take and always good for a few laughs. Doris Day at the peak of her form.".

Yet the sheer naturalness of her winning personality is enough to launch one of Hollywood's most successful screen careers. On the whole it's an entertaining film especially the first third where Day's high spirits are allowed to shine. Once the shipboard romance takes over things slow down and the mood shifts. Whatever his other many talents the versatile Jack Carson is a character actor not a leading man. Too bad he gets romantically serious and we lose his light comedic talents. And of course there's the professional wit the very unHollywoodlooking Oscar Levant always livening things up with a mordant quip.What a gorgeous movie to look at. The Technicolor is outstanding. Note how well the colors are coordinated especially the scenes in Rio. This is a neglected phase of moviemaking and here the art director and set designer both deserve industry awards. The plot's fairly clever having to do with a marital mixup that keeps the audience interested without straining. Nonetheless it's Day's movie showing what an engaging screen personality she is too bad she became mockingly identified as America's professional virgin. Here her rendition of It's Magic is just that. Magic!".

	schema:reviewBody "Doris Day hails from our city of Cincinnati Ohio. A Price Hill girl who was born with the last name of Kappelhoff. Orignially Doris wanted to be a dancer and if I'm not mistaken she studied with Pep Goldwyn here in Cincy. She was dancing with a guy named Jerry Doughtery when they became involved in a car accident and she was told by her doctors that she would never walk again but they didn't know Doris as well as she knew herself and she ended up walking again so seeing her career as a dancer was more or less out the window she studied singing with Grace Rains at Schuster Martin who also trained Tyrone Power another Cincy talent to be an actor but he wanted to be a dancer also and they told him Tyrone try acting! So he did and the rest is history! So Doris ended up singing with a band and later it was obvious that Kappelhoff was not the right name for a professional singer although later some sexy lady by the name of Lollibrigida would not fare so bad with an unpronounceable name but anyway she was asked what her favorite song was so the story goes and she said Day by Day and that's how Doris Kapplehoff became Doris Day. Then later she would do some Hollywood Musical Shorts for the movies but nothing happened until she was spotted for her singing talent because of her hit record Sentimental Journey with Les Brown and His Band of Renown and then Warner Brothers made the call and she said No! She wanted nothing to do with Hollywood but eventually with a little coaxing by Jack Carson telling her that they needed her and the picture was set to go she finally said yes but to only one picture and that was to be that! Well after Romance On The High Seas premiered that was to be that wasn't that anymore and once again history was made! Was Doris lucky! One of the finest Hollywood directors Hollywood would ever see the very underrated Michael Curtiz guided her through the picture and the greatest songs composed for a singers debut in the movies and of course the hit song It's Magic became another hit for Doris Day on the record charts although I've always preferred It's You Or No One For Me to be the better of the two and Put It In a Box Tie It With a Ribbon coming second in my opinion! Later on in her movie career her dream of being a dancer would come true in movies such as Tea For Two but she had to wear shinsplints to be able to dance and after Lullabye of Broadway in which she completely showed her dancing talent it was decided that dancing in the movies would have to stop for fear of damaging her legs again and by the way when she danced in the movies notice that it was either long dresses or slacks that she wore to dance in therefore the shin splints could not be seen!We're proud of our Doris here in Cincinnati Ohio which also boasts Tyrone Power Vera Ellen George Chakirus Dean Millerk who eventually wound up on the T.V. Series December Bride with Spring Byington and Frances Rafferty and also some say Roy Rogers! We got a lot to be proud of here in Cincinnati Ohio! WE LOVE YA DORIS!".

So Doris ended up singing with a band and later it was obvious that Kappelhoff was not the right name for a professional singer although later some sexy lady by the name of Lollibrigida would not fare so bad with an unpronounceable name but anyway she was asked what her favorite song was so the story goes and she said Day by Day and that's how Doris Kapplehoff became Doris Day. Then later she would do some Hollywood Musical Shorts for the movies but nothing happened until she was spotted for her singing talent because of her hit record Sentimental Journey with Les Brown and His Band of Renown and then Warner Brothers made the call and she said No! She wanted nothing to do with Hollywood but eventually with a little coaxing by Jack Carson telling her that they needed her and the picture was set to go she finally said yes but to only one picture and that was to be that! Well after Romance On The High Seas premiered that was to be that wasn't that anymore and once again history was made! Was Doris lucky! One of the finest Hollywood directors Hollywood would ever see the very underrated Michael Curtiz guided her through the picture and the greatest songs composed for a singers debut in the movies and of course the hit song It's Magic became another hit for Doris Day on the record charts although I've always preferred It's You Or No One For Me to be the better of the two and Put It In a Box Tie It With a Ribbon coming second in my opinion! Later on in her movie career her dream of being a dancer would come true in movies such as Tea For Two but she had to wear shinsplints to be able to dance and after Lullabye of Broadway in which she completely showed her dancing talent it was decided that dancing in the movies would have to stop for fear of damaging her legs again and by the way when she danced in the movies notice that it was either long dresses or slacks that she wore to dance in therefore the shin splints could not be seen!We're proud of our Doris here in Cincinnati Ohio which also boasts Tyrone Power Vera Ellen George Chakirus Dean Millerk who eventually wound up on the T.V. Series December Bride with Spring Byington and Frances Rafferty and also some say Roy Rogers! We got a lot to be proud of here in Cincinnati Ohio! WE LOVE YA DORIS!";

Everything about it is perfect the acting the songs the premise the jokes the costumesand to top it all off the two leads fell in love with each other during the movie! I've yet to see a man look at a woman in real life the way Jack Carson looks at Doris Day in Romance on the High Seas. Every time he gazes at her during the song It's Magic I swoonand I've seen the movie close to fifty times!I could spend a paragraph detailing the adorable setup of the plot but then you wouldn't get to experience every delightful emotion the first time you watch it. Trust me on this one it's cute funny and irresistible. Every character no matter their faults is endearing and you can't help but root for them. And an added bonus is the wonderful chemistry and timing of the cast. Everyone works beautifully off each other and the natural but tight timing of the jokes is remarkable.It's hard to believe that Romance on the High Seas was Doris Day's first movie she'd made a name for herself with her singing and Hollywood gave her a break by introducing her in a leading role. She and Jack Carson made three movies together and after watching any of thembut this first one in particularyou'll refuse to believe any other offscreen tale than their enjoyment of a long and happy life together. They're so sweet considerate comfortable and downright perfect together. Many times in movies old or new the supporting characters aren't very interesting or entertaining. In Romance on the High Seas everyone has laugh lines everyone puts their heart into their performance and everyone gives the audience a warm fuzzy feeling. S.Z. Sakall has hilarious quips with a mixture of broken English and wellintended awkward comments. Oscar Levant while as depressing and negative as he always is still grabs at the audience's heart as he knows he doesn't have Doris Day's heart. Eric Blore's showstopping turn as an incompetent doctor is easily one of the funniest parts of the entire film. Even Franklin Pangborn makes the most of his few minutes on the screen and John Berkes who has no lines at all is a hilarious addition to his scene!There are certain gowns that stand out in one's memory as the greatest gowns in film history. Everyone has their favoritesGone with the Wind The King and I and Atonement come to mindand Doris Day's metallic blue gown designed by Milo Anderson in Romance on the High Seas is one of my alltime favorite film dresses. Even if the movie were garbage it would be worth watching just to admire that dress. Thankfully the movie is nearly perfect but in all the wondrous moments you'll remember long after you watch itIt's Magic You have principles I'm no blabbermouth!I guarantee the blue dress will be one of them. Watch it and find out. You're better off buying a copy than renting it though as I can't seem to let a few months go by without popping my copy in the DVD player!".

In it she sings the Oscar nominated Song It's Magic which would become one of her trademarks Ray Heindorf's Score was also nominated. However my favorite song in the film is It's You or No One.The plot itself is the kind of fluff one used to see regularly on TV episodes of The Love Boat in the late 70's and early 80's though this one features a single storyline with multiple characters. A busy executive Don DeFore is worried about his wife Janis Paige straying on a cruise she's taking by herself such that he hires a private detective Jack Carson to keep tabs on her. What he doesn't know is that his wife has hired a singer Ms. Day to pretend to be her on the cruise such that she can stay home to see if her husband is cheating on her with his secretary Leslie Brooks.A recognizable supporting cast that includes Oscar Levant S. Z. Sakall Eric Blore Fortunio Bonanova Franklin Pangborn and even Grady Sutton uncredited makes this one fun to watch.Married three years and having yet to take a trip since their honeymoon Mrs. Elvira Kent Paige is determined that the third time will be a charm. She books an extended cruise vacation for her and husband only to be disappointed yet again. Her husband Michael DeFore who is the top executive in her Uncle Lazlo's Sakall pharmaceutical company says he can't make it yet again because of something that just came up a potential merger. Elvira discovers that Michael had just hired a brand new secretary Brooks that morning and suspects the worst regarding what's just come up. Earlier that day while having her passport picture taken she'd met a singer at the travel agency who always plans trips but can't afford to go.

When Michael realizes he can go on the cruise if Elvira will only wait 4 days he's surprised that she's unwilling and then suspects the worst. So he hires detective Peter Virgil Carson to tail his wife and see what she's up to on the ship.Of course Peter falls for Georgia who he thinks is his client's wife Elvira ... and the feeling is mutual. Blore plays the ship's sick doctor Sutton appears as the ship's nosy telegraph operator. Things get more complicated when lonely and financially dependent Oscar arrives to join the voyage.

Lazlo aware that Elvira is on her way learns that Michael is about to such that he tags along the men actually arrive first.

	schema:reviewBody "My summary heading says what Romance on the High Seas is about. Jealousy and humor but also impersonation romance some very good songs and bonus scenics from cruise travel ports. The supporting cast for this comedymusicalromance is top drawer in the comedy ranks of Hollywood at the time. S.Z. Sakall Eric Blore and Franklin Pangborn always spell laughter in a film. The leads are all quite good and Doris Day is a smash hit in her first ever movie and starring role. Day was never more vivacious than in this film. She has the bounce energy and enthusiasm that became her trademark throughout her film career. She sure was a great entertainer. She was only 44 years old when she quit making movies after 1968. She did have a very successful half hour TV show that ran five years through 1973. The plot for this film is hilarious in itself and the writing fleshes it out beautifully. Michael Curtiz directs a very good story for film and Busby Berkeley directs a couple of nice dance numbers. Day has half a dozen very good songs. It's easy to see why she became popular with several hit songs as well as her acting over the years. But what drives this film is the comedy. The dialog is complemented by some good scenes with humor in the acting antics. One of the funniest drunk scenes in all filmdom occurs in a bar in Trinidad. Peter Virgil Jack Carson and Oscar Farrar Oscar Levant have both been stood up by their girlfriends the same person Doris Day playing Georgia Garrett and impersonating Elvira Kent. They order doubles of whiskey. Leaning on the bar next to them is a drunk played by John Berkes. The two shipmates are looking at each other as they talk and the drunk picks up Oscar's drink downs it and moves to Peter's side and does the same thing. The two men pick up their glasses notice they are empty and order two more. As they continue to talk looking at each other the drunk repeats his moves. The next time the men order triples. After a couple more repeats Peter and Oscar begin to slur their speech bob a little and notice that they're getting a little tipsy. In reality they haven't had more than a few drops of liquor. A couple more rounds and they walk away holding each other up looking quite drunk. We then see the real drunk start to walk out and slither to the floor. Whoever heard of a placebo drunk? But it worked so well that the two men got on a plane and woke up several hours later. Peter marveled that the Trinidad whiskey didn't leave the usual hangover effects the next day.Here are some funny lines to whet one's appetite for this hilarious film. Uncle Lazlo S.Z. Sakall Oh well I'm not saying that Michael hasn't looked at another woman. Who hasn't? I have looked at women and the few that looked back I married. That cured me of looking.Oscar Oscar Levant I always wanted to marry a gal who could tune a piano on the side. Once and for all will you marry me? Answer yes or no. Georgia Doris Day No! Oscar We'll continue this discussion later. Waiter Hey Georgia. A couple of incometax evaders want you to have a drink with them. Table seven.Elvira Kent Janis Paige Won't you sit down? Georgia Don't be surprised if I do. Elvira That's cute. Elvira later Just remember that while its your lips that are being kissed it's my reputation that will be suffering. Georgia Yeah I'll make a note of that. Elvira Good!Peter Virgil Jack Carson Look don't worry. The slogan of my firm is 'Never kiss a client's wife' Michael Kent Don DeFore Well don't change slogans in midocean.Georgia Oh by the way Mrs. Kent. I know it's none of my business but have you got anything on your husband? Elvira I'm afraid his conduct has been impeccable. Georgia Oh caught him with the goods huh? Elvira No that means he's been behaving himself. Georgia Oh too bad. Well maybe he'll do something unimpeccable before I come back.Ship's doctor Eric Blore Why do I small herring? Georgia I guess there's a school of herring following the ship. Doctor No no not marinated herring. Oh I don't feel well. I suppose I'd better be going. Georgia Goodnight doctor. Doctor Goodnight. I hope I sleep well.Oscar Incidentally I picked up your last two paychecks. It was barely enough to pay for my plane ticket down here. Didn't even have enough to boy you a present. I feel like a cad. Georgia You crook. You can go jail for that. Oscar Marry me and you won't have to testify against me.Peter Can you explain to me why that man was in your cabin kissing you? Georgia No. Peter Well? Georgia Well can you explain why you were watching my cabin? Peter No. Georgia Well? Peter Well maybe Georgia Maybe what? Peter Well maybe I'm narrow minded. But I don't like married women who play around with other men. Georgia Would you feel different if the other man was you? Peter That's beside the point. Georgia It is is it? Peter Yes it is. Everything they've ever said about women like you on boats like this with men like me certainly turns out to be true. Or don't you follow me? Georgia I've wanted to Peter anywhere anytime.".

Her chemistry with Jack Carson is off the charts and I think the chemistry between the coleads Janis Paige and Don DeFore is just as good. Throw in some of Hollywood's finest and funniest character actors like S.Z. Sakall Eric Blore and Franklin Pangborn plus Oscar Levant and you have one of the best motion pictures of 1948. It certainly helps that Warners filmed it in Technicolor because the cinematography is vibrant and full of life especially during the last act which takes place down in colorful Rio de Janeiro.Originally the script was written with Betty Hutton in mind apparently they were going to borrow her from Paramount but pregnancy sidelined her and Doris stepped in. So this is probably why Doris' character Georgia Garrett is daffier than most of her later screen characters. But in a way all the characters are presented as loons not just the four leads but the supporting characters as well even the lastbilled guy who has no dialogue and plays a drinkstealing alcoholic much like Red Skelton would. Warners promoted the picture as a romantic comedy with music but it's really more of a screwball musical comedy. The reason this film works is it knows a good laugh comes from sincerely played mixups. When Day assumes the identify of Paige's character and then falls in love with a detective played by Carson who's been hired by DeFore it leads to an ongoing game of who's on first that only builds with ribtickling intensity. Of course it all gets sorted out in the end. But before it does Sakall offers a few cuddly sheesh sounds and Pangborn looks on bemused speaking for the audience when he says Paris has nothing on Rio.".

Paige from a random situation that stems from the moment she overhears Day's antics in the travel agency where they've crossed paths Day plays Georgia a lounge singer who has a thing for imagining elaborate trips to exotic locales she can't afford or as she states hasn't been todidn't go to is amused at this and decided to concoct a plan to send Day into the cruise she is slated to go on to stay home and see if her husband will in fact cheat on her. Paige's husband also suspicious of his wife sends a detective Jack Carson to do surveillance on her unsuspecting that Day is impersonating Paige rather badly but what would he know? We do and it's a great breezy delight to see Day and Carson who from here on remain on screen play against each other neither aware of the other's identity. An extremely silly comedy of errors with cracking lines basically handed on a silver platter to Paige who churns them out with real verve also marking Doris Day's first appearance and she basically saves this kindof unmemorable feature from an otherwise different fate of course keeping in mind that director Michael Curtiz had brought Bette Davis and Joan Crawford into delivering fantastic performances in THE PRIVATE LIVES OF ELIZABETH AND ESSEX and MILDRED PIERCE.".

Featuring a story that wouldn't have a need to exist had there been a little communication between its catalysts  Janis Pauge and Don DeFore  a married couple who even before their marriage is consummated see infidelity in all the wrong places she from insinuations coming from the nonetoosubtle secretaryblond bombshell her husband has hired Leslie Brooks in a nice but pat performance he from the looks Paige gives the other men around her. Paige from a random situation that stems from the moment she overhears Day's antics in the travel agency where they've crossed paths Day plays Georgia a lounge singer who has a thing for imagining elaborate trips to exotic locales she can't afford or as she states hasn't been todidn't go to is amused at this and decided to concoct a plan to send Day into the cruise she is slated to go on to stay home and see if her husband will in fact cheat on her. Paige's husband also suspicious of his wife sends a detective Jack Carson to do surveillance on her unsuspecting that Day is impersonating Paige rather badly but what would he know? We do and it's a great breezy delight to see Day and Carson who from here on remain on screen play against each other neither aware of the other's identity. An extremely silly comedy of errors with cracking lines basically handed on a silver platter to Paige who churns them out with real verve also marking Doris Day's first appearance and she basically saves this kindof unmemorable feature from an otherwise different fate of course keeping in mind that director Michael Curtiz had brought Bette Davis and Joan Crawford into delivering fantastic performances in THE PRIVATE LIVES OF ELIZABETH AND ESSEX and MILDRED PIERCE.";

	schema:reviewBody "So when I first saw the trailer for Obsessed I have to admit I was curious to see this even though the fatal attraction story has been used five million times before it's always interesting to see what the new fresh writer is going to do with it. Obsessed could have been so much more and offered a lot to the table but instead turned out to be a Lifetime movie of the week. There are so many problems with this movie it's not even funny... oh wait actually it was which I'll explain in a minute. But trust me when I say that this movie had me laughing so hard. Now I don't want to sound strange or wrong I'm a white woman and even I found this movie not only to be sexist but racist as well. We have a black family who actually are very successful well bred beautiful smart and nice people but somehow Beyonce turns ghetto in the end. This movie needs so much work it's honestly ridicules let me tell you about the story before I tell you all that's wrong with it.Derek Charles is the Executive Vice President of Gage Bendix and has resulted in a recent promotion. He is happily married to his wife Sharon with a son Kyle. However when a new temp Lisa begins to flirt with him. Lisa eventually attempts to seduce him but he repeatedly rejects her advances. Lisa becomes obsessed and begins to manipulate Derek and Sharon's relationship eventually becoming violent. Lisa fakes a suicide in Derek's hotel room while he is on a business trip. Meanwhile Detective Reese interrogates Lisa who lies about her relationship with Derek. While Derek and Sharon are out Lisa goes to their home and convinces the babysitter to let her in eventually escaping with Kyle while the babysitter is distracted. Derek goes to the car intending to pursue Lisa and finds Kyle in the backseat with lipstick from Lisa on his forehead. They set up a home alarm system but at this point nothing is going to stop Lisa from getting what she wants.This is one of the worst movies of the year why? I never really found Ali Larter to be that threatening everything happened so fast with her obsession I didn't get her motive or history on why she might possibly be obsessed with this man. Idris Elba who plays the husband Derek is completely whipped. Now granted I know they were trying to make him into a nice husband but did they go far or what? This man sent flowers to his wife every week isn't allowed to go to a basketball game with a friend is not allowed to have female assistants pretty much hide in the corner at the company Christmas party so his wife won't jump on him at home. Beyonce Knowles who plays his wife Sharon I had no sympathy for her character whatsoever. This woman has major jealousy issues and we never know why she mentions that he once was a player up till he met her but it's never indicated that he ever cheated on her so why in the heck is she so incredibly jealous? Also when she finds out that Lisa attempted suicide in Derek's bed she won't even hear his side of the story not only that the house he paid for she throws him out for THREE MONTHS! God I want know what happens to him if he doesn't do the dishes does he have to sleep in the back yard? I have to talk about the ending I'm sorry so if I haven't already spoiled the movie enough don't read on.The ending we go from the story being about Derek and this crazy woman who has insane fantasies about them having an affair... stepping in the right direction. But then all of a sudden Lisa breaks into their home and lays herself in their bed and Sharon the wife catches her instead of being rational and calling the police it goes into it's all about Beyonce mode and she's shouting out one liners just to please the audience. The girls take the ultimate beating and somehow are still able to land on their feet for God's sake they have 105 lb. Ali Larter swinging a two by four at Beyonce! Then after Sharon kills Lisa she walks out of the house all bloody and the detective and husband come as he holds her we pause on Beyonce's face while her song is playing... hmm subtle on the promotion there she's a secondary character for goodness's sake! Also one other thing I have to spoil is that Lisa puts a roofie in Derek's drink and seduces him in some way... what was the purpose of this scene? It never comes up again or had any purpose if it's supposed to be threatening not so much. The detective was also a stupid addition to the story she is the most incompetent detective ever. Just everything about this movie didn't work pointless characters no backrounds no thrills chills or suspense save your money.210".

	schema:reviewBody "Remember that movie Wild Wild West? Will Smith has said that that movie is one of his biggest regrets because it opened at 1 even though it sucked and he said he hated knowing that so many people were spending their money to watch a movie that wasn't good. At the time I'm writing this Obsessed is the 1 movie in the American box office and I'm wondering if for example Beyonce feels as guilty as Will Smith did because Wild Wild West is about ten times better than this snoozefest. Personally I doubt she has the acting chops to even realize how godawful this thing is. I've seen some backwards thrillers in my time but THISI care hardly think of where to start. My first question is for Beyonce. I'm wondering if when she signed on to play the wife of a man stalked by a psychotic blonde if she knew that her character would ultimately turn out to be just as psychotic as the psychotic one. I'm guessing yes because here's a direct quote from her character late in the movie  You think you're crazy? I'll show you crazy!Wow.If you want to watch Ali Larter squeezing her limited talents into the form of a badly written blonde with some relationship issues and Beyonce talking all tough to her and to her husband you might enjoy this movie. Every once in a while a movie comes along that is so flawlessly terrible that the perfection of the way the badness fits together becomes a fascinating area of study. This is one of those times.Sharon is married to Derek who has a new employee at his work a crazy hot blonde named Lisa who was recently hired on from a temp agency. She falls in love with Derek and forms a fantasy in her head that she and Derek are together blah blah blah blah. The movie is called Obsessed and stars two women and one man. You don't really need to know anything else in order to know everything there is to know about the movie except how bad it is. Sadly you have to watch it to find that out. One of my favorite things was that the movie is as suspenseless as any movie I've ever seen and yet the suspense music kicks up constantly and I guess we're supposed to scoot forward to the edge of our seats and get all worried and whatnot. There's a scene when Lisa emails a picture of herself to Derek which opens itself in a dozen windows as soon as he opens the email and the orchestra kicks in frantically as Derek slowly clicks them each closed his wife only seconds away.Did anyone else laugh at this? First of all why would you slowly click them closed one by one? Does he know nothing about computers? ALTF4 man!! Or if it's a Mac CommandW!! But of course if he knew how to close windows like that then we would have missed out on the sheer tension of watching this guy about to suffer the wrath of Beyonce. They actually tried to generate TENSION by having a guy struggling to close windows on his computer before his wife sees it!! HAHAHAHAHAHAAA!!!Then again with a wife as horrific as Beyonce's character maybe it's a good idea to fear her hysterical wrath. She does after all kick him out of HIS OWN HOUSE for three months because she thinks. Not KNOWS mind you. She SUSPECTS that he had an affair. And when I say his own house I mean the beautiful multimillion dollar mansion that they live in with the sleek new Escalade parked out front. This woman ladies and gentlemen is a COLLEGE STUDENT. I have trouble relating to a man who would suffer so much ridiculous punishment at the hands of an insecure and violently suspicious woman and still beg on his hands an knees for her to take him back. In order for a movie like this to work you have to care about the characters that's obvious but it's impossible here. Obsessed has nothing going for it. It's a movie about one poor guy with two psychotic women around him and I'm going to go ahead and suggest that it's just not possible to make a good movie when your basic premise is so overflowing with the yawninducing clichs of cheap norent thrillers. It is informative that Obsessed comes from David Loughery the same screenwriter who gave us the highly disappointing thriller Lakeview Terrace last year. Obsessed is pretty much exactly the same story except Lakeview Terrace was about a black neighbor angry at his interracial neighbors. Now we have a black wife going crazy at her black husband's white stalker. Set your watch to beep every ten minutes or so to make sure you can stay awake. It was a struggle for me!Even worse I'm not sure who the target is. Angry black women who hate skinny smartass blondes? Maybe. Word has it that the original title was Oh No She Didn't which would at least have been amusing and advertised right away that the whole movie is a joke. If they had made this a parody I really think it could have been good but it takes itself super seriously even when challenging us not to laugh at Beyonce flinging Ali Larter all over her house or not to cringe when she viciously berates her boyfriend for whom she has not the wispiest scrap of trust but who has committed no crime. The most effective thing that the movie does is convince me beyond a shadow of a doubt that if I ever find myself dating Beyonce I will throw myself in front of the nearest train.".

I feel the movie keeps you entertained to a point and had pretty good actors aside from some parts with Beyonce. Even though its not the best movie I would consider seeing it once more. Only because it was an enjoyable watching experience. I would recommend this movie for someone who is bored and would like to waste about an hour and a half.".

I think the problem with people who go to see this movie is that they expect this to be Beyonce's break through movie. But until she chooses a role that has nothing do with musicsinging and a role that is original and this includes a character with depth she might never have a breakthrough movie. But still her acting improves..The first 20 minutes of the movie I cringed. Beyonce I thought was horrible at pretending to be a wife. You could tell she was uneasy with kissing talking about sex under the mirror  etc Weird since Idris is an incredibly handsome man. But as the movie continued she became more believable. She's not that great of an actress but becoming believable was her first step something she failed at in her previous movies excluding Dream Girls.But overall the movie was good. The frustration that one gets from the constant interaction between Derek Elba who is sort of symbolizing a weak man and psychopath Lisa Larter is what makes the movie even more enjoyable. People need to quit taking this movie so seriously. This is a movie where you can invite some friends over bring out the popcorn and kickback. Who cares if its unoriginal and just a little predictable when it keeps you entertained the whole time.".

Obsessed is one of those movies that women love to watch in their PJ's on a Sunday afternoon with a pint of icecream when nothing else is on except for the trashiest piece of trash on TV. And make no mistake Obsessed is such trash that it is a 3rd rate ripoff of Fatal Attraction which many forget was already a ripoff on Clint Eastwood's Play Misty for Me. Here's what you need to know nice business guy with lots of cake and a fine mansion and a superfine wife and young tot gets derailed off of living in banality by a foxybuttrouble type of girl who's working part time in the office.That's it. No more explanation. If you can guess everything that the characters will do or wont due to incompetence then you're doing well. Obsessed makes no bones about being original and in fact could be the precise template needed if anyone ever wanted to do a fullblown ZAZstyle parody on pscyhochick movies. It takes itself so seriously that it's hard not to knock on it in most of the scenes  and it becomes further frustrating since out of the three main characters one actor Idris Elba is actually very good almost too good for the material and another Ali Larter fits in in her completely 1 12 dimensional role without much struggle. Only one Beyonce seems to be actually trying too hard to act and again gets in trouble as she did in Dreamgirls.The direction is very slack considering it's a TV guy who did it maybe only TV according to his creds and the writing is slackier. The development of characterization and plot moves along like a expertly crafted diarrhea meaning that it never really stops from its trajectory and it may be a little smooth going but it also hurts trying to see it accomplish anything aside from pain. And yet as far as painful cinema goes it could've been worse. It certainly has the grace to give us a gigantic catfight at the end that you'd expect samurai swords. It's not campy enough to recommend and by no means if you are a heterosexual male will you get much satisfaction out of it. Girls will giggle and be fine with stuff that is run of the mill with a few jolting twists along the way.".

The acting was horrible and the ending fight scene was hilarious! Everyone in the theater laughed when the quote Bitch Breath was said. This movie could of been a huge success but they hired really bad actors and actresses. The girl that played the temp is a good actress she knows better than to sign up for this crap.

	schema:reviewBody "This screenplay could have been written in one day with bathroom breaks and a two hour lunch. Unfortunately for the filmmakers they were serious in their intention of making a serious dramathriller in the vein of Fatal Attraction The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and many many more. Were they at all serious about the screenplay? If you saw the aforementioned films then you have seen this one before just put two African America leads. Idris Alba plays Derek a successful stockbroker happily married to Sharon played by wannabe thespian Beyonce Knowles. After moving into their new home with their toddler son Derek arrives at work and meets Lisa the attractive new temp who is assigned to work for him as the secretary. She proves to be more than intelligent and efficient. But Lisa's obsession with Derek becomes evident right away and dangerous to everything he holds dear.This is where I got confused. After watching lots of meandering between Derek and Sharon in their pretentious life filled with pointless uninteresting dialogue Lisa doesn't hide her deep attraction for Derek upon meeting him for the first time in the elevator. It was never clear to me who Lisa was replacing as secretary. At first I thought she was replacing the openly gay secretary Matthew. Then after watching Matthew and Lisa engage as fellow secretaries for a while I started thinking that Matthew was in on Lisa's plot to have Derek to herself which would have been more absurdity for the already absurd. But hey this was that kind of movie. This isn't very relevant I guess. But for me this is where the film started down this slippery slope to pure garbage.My biggest problem with the film was the idiocy of the characters. Everyone seems to have the combined I.Q. of a rock.Derek spoke the words of a loyal man to his wife but his actions expressed otherwise in my eyes. He did nothing to stop Lisa in her tracks and proved that he wasn't smart enough to fend her off. I remember hoping that his character was conflicted that we were watching a man who wanted to be loyal to his wife but he needed someone on the side. I guess that was me hoping for more from this onedimensional tripe. But I was wrong. He was actually loyal to his wife. In fact he was flawless making him completely uninteresting. The filmmakers tried to make him a good guy doll. Well unwittingly to them they gave him a flaw the flaw of stupidity. The excuses he made for not shutting down this woman Lisa were downright preposterous. He was a useless boring man.Sharon was just there for the most part. She was brought in as the only one fighting off the insane Lisa with now famous lines like I show you crazy and Do something about this b or I will. She actually pulled the impossible feat of being more uninteresting than Derek. And Beyonce's amateurish flat sleep inducing performance didn't help with the already paper thin character. She just doesn't have what it takes to be a great actress in my opinion. She could never stay in the moment. She comes and goes. After all the movies she has done so far I would say that she is impressively bad as an actress.Lisa was the biggest disappointment. She was obviously the smartest turnip in the bowl which really doesn't say much but she was just as shallow as the others. I was left with way too many questions about her. Where did she come from? Who was she before this story? Why Derek? What was that instant connection with Matthew all about? Why she kept asking Derek what was wrong when she sprung a new one on him? Did she actually get what she wanted when Derek was unconscious? They tried to make her mysterious after a while but the filmmakers confused natural humanistic mystery with the now you see me now you don't Batman crap. It was ridiculous.The film played like the most expensive Bmovie in the history of Bmovies. It was no better than the worst straighttoDVD flicks. That's what made it worthwhile for me. I was thoroughly entertained by this garbage. I was laughing at everything just like I would for a badmovie. I laughed at the dialogue. I laughed at the performances like when Derek storms out on Lisa after her first aggressive pass at him in the bathroom stall and her calling after him. I laughed at what I now christen as Beyonce Obsessed lines. I laughed at how big the baby boy was but he still needed his diapers changed. I laughed at the cop's late response to everything in such posh surroundings. I laughed at the predictably brain dead actions of Sharon and Derek's babysitter and Matthew. I laughed at the contrivances. I would have to say the funniest thing about this film was the believability of it all.If you're looking for a truly well crafted dramathriller like Fatal Attraction or Chinatown then I would advise you to skip this one. But if you're looking for a ludicrous piece of farce with straighttoDVD bad acting writing and directing masqueraded as a well crafted dramathriller then by all means have a good time.".

Well the movie was just a little bit too much Fatal Attraction and not that it made it less watchable it just helped you predict it that much more. Besides this movie would have been predictable anyways with or without Fatal Attraction as a background. Next it just could have been so much more than what it made itself out to be. Like their was a lot of plot elements that didn't seem to go well with the story or plot itself. For example I just hate the whole typical romance trouble elements and it just made this movie seem very annoying at times and just very even uninteresting. Like honestly why on earth would Beyonc'e's character not believe what her husband was telling her it was just very unlikely and if not that than very boring for the audience. Also I just didn't ever see Ali Larter's character as THAT much of a threat! I mean honestly her character had no business being killed the way she way and frankly I don't care that much for Beyonc'e so seeing her beat up Ali Larter wasn't a sight I liked. However like I said it did greatly keep my attention and Ali Larter was very likable even if she does greatly steal the show.

Well I'm not quite sure myself. It could be that the audience is too busy laughing and cheering to care or even notice. Let me explain. Obsessed is NOT a serious movie. It is a mindless campy fun thriller that you should take with a pinch of salt.Derek Charles The Wire's Idris Elba is a successful executive vice president at Gage Bendix and happily married to Sharon singerturnedactress Beyonce Knowles. They're the perfect family as Lisa Sheridan Derek's new temporary assistant put it. But when Lisa Heroes' Ali Larter becomes obsessed with Derek everything he's worked so hard for is placed in jeopardy.What follows is a crazy thrillride up until one of the mosttalked about catfights in film history. Seriously my audience cheered laughed whooped etc. It was like being at a boxing match. That alone was worth the price of admission.Lastly I thought I'd comment on the acting since it seems most people have been put off this movie because of the fact that Beyonce is in it. You probably won't believe me when I say that this is probably her best acting to date. You really felt and believed her character. Idris Elba was brilliant as always but Ali Larter completely steals the show as the psycho bitch from hell! Why do Blondes do bad so good? Obsessed isn't a film it's an experience. It's one of those films you just simply MUST see on the big screen with a full audience. You couldn't possibly get the same effect at home with your family. It's most definitely a mustsee in theatres especially for someone looking for a good time.With a rockin' soundtrack great script and cast Obsessed is a blast of stupid fun and without a doubt the sexiest  and most entertaining  thriller of 2009! I still think they should've gone with the original title though Oh No She Didn't! Also I might add that contrary to popular belief this movie is not in the slightest bit racist.".

This film was slow paced so to say as far as actual suspense but it still was entertaining and gave some time for character and plot development. I personally was not bored for one second. Within about 1020 minutes I was hooked in. The main plot of the film is about a very successful asset manager Derek and how his relationship with his wife and future with his family are threatened when a seductive tempt comes blasting into his life. It starts off similar to many. She comes as a temp he befriends her she takes it as Oh He loves me!!. When rejected she relentlessly stalks him and endangers both him and his family. Ali Larter returns!!!! She is amazing. She is sweet when she needs to be Seductive when she needs to be and psychotic and crazy as well when she needs to be. Ali seemed act as a cross between Sharon stone from basic instinct and Rebecca De Mornaythe nanny from Hll! from the hand that rocks the cradle. Beyonce I though was great! She made me laugh. She played a very good pssed off mother and wife!! This film starts off slow and gains to a point of high intensity. Once it has you on the edge of your seat you wont leave their.

Agree with him or not this is one funny written commentary to the movie. And while MTV and Teen Choice Awards shows actually thought this was good I'm lost for words here for once I will agree with the Razzies! Only omission They didn't include the male lead as Worst actor.Not worst ever of course but in this movie. And while Beyonce is beautiful JayZ and any other man would have kicked her out of the house for behaving the way she does in the movie. It's actually pretty hard to really understand not to mention feel the love those two are supposed to have.Bring Ali Carter into the mix and you think you are thrown back into the 80s. While the Michael Douglas starring movie was indeed suspenseful it did have another major thing going for it Actors who actually were actors! besides Mr. Douglas that would be Glenn Close And while Fatal Attraction wasn't the best movie it's still out of reach when you compare it with this teenfriendly reimagening ...No suspense and badly written this should not be on your to watch list. Rather watch Fatal Attraction again if you really have to watch a movie like this.".

The directors and producers get a big fat F for originality and creativity. However credit needs to be given to Idris Elba because he convincingly made me feel bad for his character great acting. Ali Larder was obviously hot and her usual temptress self however I must add that she played her role so well that towards the end of the movie I didn't care how hot she was I too wanted to just get away from she creeped me out so much. Hope I didn't give anything away. P.S. this movie should not be ranked a 4.".

And Knowles was so miscast it was painful to watch. It was like she was trying to do Vivica Fox who could have pulled this off but we ended up more with Betty Boop. And the final 10 minutes with the infamous catfight was ridiculous. Knowles in her kickass hooker boots and pushup bra announcing her chest like some formal invitation and Larter in black silk panties and her obsession's Tshirt I do believe. And Larter pulled off menacing about as well as a gerbil. This movie had so much potential as I liked the premise innocent man is stalked by crazy woman but thinks he can handle it even if the actors were subpar but whoever wrote the script must have been asleep at the wheel. No one was convincing and a lot of the story was not plausible. I've read that some people think the movie is racist but I found the movie sexist. Meaning that guys are nothing more than drunken hound dogs and too stupid to admit that some wee thing is scaring the hooey out of them. Pass this one up.".

I thought I would like this because of her. I am not a fan of Beyonce. I just don't like her music. The plot is Derek Idris Elba is very successful asset manager who has received a promotion recently and is very happy with his career and family. But all those things are put into jeopardy when Lisa Ali Larter a very hot temp catches his eye in the office. This is a very basic stalker film. Lisa tries everything to get Derek to fall for her but he doesn't budge from his high moral grounds and he apparently loves his bitch of a wife. Seriously his wife Sharon Beyonce Knowles is a vapid because without any proof of him cheating on her she throws him out of his own home. Lisa does something which makes everybody suspect Derek.I hated this movie mainly for one thing its very predictable and boring. Sharon transforming from a sweet housewife to a crazy person who will do anything to save her marriage is just clich. Beyonce cannot act period. Lisa didn't have a backstory as to why she is stalking Derek of all people and this wasn't a racist film according to me as many people here seem to think. I mildly liked the fight at the ending but it dragged on and this is a Beyonce production so you should know by now who will win that fight. I don't think even fans of Beyonce will like it as its so shallow and has no heart. Ali Larter could have done so well with a better script. She's a very fine actress when the script is right for her. I am very sad that I didn't take my friends advice. Only for Ali Larter.310".

When I saw the back cover of the DVD saying Experience The Beyonce Mania I thought mmhmm marketing ploy I'll bet the whole soundtrack is her too which surprisingly it wasn't. This is the same thing that happens when you put LL Cool J in a movie. Anyway the general synopsis is White Chick obsesses over black guy black guy hides truth from apparently overbearing wife wife finds out and kicks him out wife finds out the real truth wife goes after White Chick. Completely bythenumbers. The font used in the opening titles looks exactly like the Lifetime Movie font a hint of things to come? and the movie has notsosubtle hints of The Hand That Rocks The Cradle particularly when Larter is in the house handling the baby for a second I thought she was actually going to start breastfeeding him and in the ending fight scene as well half of which takes place in an attic just like Cradle although there is a Kill Bill moment when Larter wields a floor lamp and uses it like a ninja sword. And let's not forget Larter falling through a glass table at the end the same way Billy Campbell dies in Enough...without the whole chandelier thing of course the chandelier is more War Of The Roses. Throw in the requisite cheesy oneliners courtesy of Beyonce and you have an overboiling cauldron of clich stew. Overall I actually enjoyed the movie in a nobrainer sort of way even if it is predictable as hell right down to the title. Anyone looking for originality should steer clear of this movie but if you like campy thrilling stalkerfun this just might be for you.".

While this was a film typical of the time when it was made it offers some of the most glorious music ever heard in a Hollywood picture. The music takes center stage in the movie. As interpreted by Michael Rabin and Claudio Arrau among others Tchaikowsky Liszt and Rachmaninoff were never given such loving tribute as in this film.Charles Vidor directed this adaptation of a novel that might have been well regarded enough to be brought to the screen. Ruth and August Goetz are given credit for the screen play. The Goetzes wrote many plays among them The Heiress. Fay and Michael Kanin also contributed to the adaptation.The story of Louise Lulu Durant a spoiled rich girl that defied her father into following what she thought was the love of her life turns out to be a nightmare. Lulu was not prepared to play second fiddle no pun intended to anyone let alone Paul Bronte the talented but egotistical violinist that is only in love with his career.The story by the way takes place in Zurich and not Munich as someone reported in another comment. Lulu who has ambitions of becoming a pianist promptly realizes she is a lousy player and heeds the advice of the wise professor Schuman but she makes the mistake of staying around getting bored because Paul has only time for his music and not for her.Enter James Guest an American pianist. He falls in love with the beautiful Lulu only to be rejected. When Paul becomes the toast of the music world he breaks from Lulu who in turn marries James on the rebound. Ultimately Lulu realizes that James is the one that is real and the only one that cares for her and there's a happy ending when he makes a stunning debut playing Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto.Elizabeth Taylor in all her beauty is seen as the ravishing creature she was in those years. She made an impression as the spoiled papa's girl that she was. In this film as well as all those Ms. Taylor made during those years she projects such a loving presence that is hard to find fault with her acting. This actress showed such magnetism and charisma in her films something perhaps no one else can match.Vittorio Gassman was perhaps Italy's best modern actor. He was trying to break into American movies. As Paul Bronte he makes quite an impression. He was dashing and had the presence and good looks to play opposite his gorgeous costar.John Ericson shows he had potential to go far in the business. Unfortunately he never made it big in Hollywood. He was an accomplished actor who deserved better. Louis Calhern as Nicholas Durant Lulu's father had only a few scenes in the movie so it is puzzling for one to agree with another comment about how he carried the film on his shoulders. If it was it remains a mystery to us. Mr. Calhern was a fine actor who show a natural elegance to every thing he did in the movies.Ms. Taylor is dressed by Helen Rose one of the best in the business. Ms. Rose designs are an asset anything that Elizabeth Taylor wore in the film enhanced her figure and gave the viewer an opportunity to see her as the film goddess was always was.".

Although I had never seen any of her 1950's or early 1960's roles I quickly realized this woman was Elizabeth Taylor and was completely mesmerized. Previous reviews of this movie compared the story line to a soap opera and I certainly agree. Without Ms. Taylor drawing me in I would have lost interest very quickly However I could not resist watching her every move and eventually found myself absorbed by the story line and very competent acting by all performers. The classical music was a tremendous plus for the film and made up for the standin sets to some degree. For me this film was about beauty. Beautiful music surrounding a beautiful woman in all her glory. Classical music handinhand with one of the classic women of the big screen. I would recommend this movie highly if for no other reason than to see the definition of the female sex symbol. Elizabeth Taylor with her face figure class and charisma is that definition. She makes the so called sex symbols of today Jessica Simpson Pamela Anderson etc. look like caricatures. What a revelation! Mediocre story adequate acting beautiful music and an irresistibly stunning leading lady are the summations of this movie in my humble opinion.".

She makes the so called sex symbols of today Jessica Simpson Pamela Anderson etc. look like caricatures. What a revelation! Mediocre story adequate acting beautiful music and an irresistibly stunning leading lady are the summations of this movie in my humble opinion.";

	schema:reviewBody "Rhapsody is all about beautiful music and beautiful Elizabeth Taylor. Taylor in a short stylish hairdo is at the height of her beauty in this stunningly photographed color film. And she's not the only beauty. Vittorio Gassman plays one of her love interests. Just try keeping your eyes off of him. Handsome John Ericson is the other man in her life.All in all it's candy for the eyes and ears gorgeous to watch and to listen to with all that classical music. Elizabeth Taylor plays a role perfect for her i.e. a spoiled rich brat. She follows the man of her dreams Gassman a gifted violinist to music school in Zurich even though her own musical ability is pathetic and she'll have nothing to do except wait around for him to finish classes and rehearsals. When it's obvious that Gassman is totally immersed in his music she begins to compete with the violin for his attention. All three leads are excellent as is Louis Calhern as Taylor's father. Taylor wears beautiful outfits. I'm certain this film was intended to be a showcase for her beauty and there it succeeds. Despite some harsh comments made on the board I think this you just have to take it for what it was intended to be and no more. Very entertaining.".

They really look as if they're playing their instruments and both of them are up to the acting demands of their less than dynamic roles.Taylor was certainly one of the most photogenic women who ever stepped before a camera but it's a pity that her talent at this stage is not a match for her fabulous wardrobe and glossy tremulous closeups that have her torn between two men without ever ruining her makeup with real tears.Absurd fun if only for the music and the decent performances but actually a very routine romantic angle that is a mere trifle against a splendid background of passionate classical pieces.".

Not a hair out of place perfect makeup and a flawless wardrobe. Her character Louise Durant also seems to be pretty close to the reallife Elizabeth in some ways. There's an unintentionally funny scene where Louise blithely informs her father that she intends to divorce her new husband because he has become an inconvenience to her constant scheming. She also tries out for an exclusive music academy but when her lifeless piano playing is revealed at her audition she immediately and calmly switches tactics Professor I want to be a student here. I will pay double what everyone else pays. Superb realization of her character and herself in just a few seconds.This is an Elizabeth Taylor star vehicle so she expertly and effortlessly inhabits the center of all the action but the supporting cast is fantastic as well. Louis Calhern Vittorio Gassman John Ericson Michael Chekhov and many others turn in beautifully natural performances. Mr. Gassman and Mr. Ericson actually seem to be playing their instruments in a quite realistic fashion.Finally last but certainly not least the music itself is aweinspiring. There's a LOT of gorgeous music frequently interspersed throughout the film and it's tremendously impressive to put it mildly. The soundtrack features Claudio Arrau on piano and Michael Rabin on violin covering for Mr. Ericson and Mr. Gassman respectively.IMO Miss Taylor was the ultimate movie star and this film gives ample evidence of all her beauty and femininity and talent and skill as well as her surefooted acceptance of and expertise in every one of those qualities. A woman who was perfectly comfortable in her own skin from Day One. Rhapsody is an excellent wellmade film. You won't regret seeing it.".

	schema:reviewBody "No it's not an excellent movie overall. But it's good visually beautiful fun romantic and has outstanding music. All three leads Elizabeth Taylor John Ericson and Vittorio Gassman give very good performances and are the definition of what today we call eye candy. Some aspects of the plot are actually realistic. You still see women who look to find their identities primarily through their men and expect a man to make them happy rather than be responsible for their OWN happiness. And as someone who was more than once involved with an artistic type a performer I can tell you there is some truth in the characters played by Ericson and Gassman. My point there is melodrama here but also grains of realism which give the film some substance. And you have to remember the movie is set in the early 50s. This works as a period piece displaying culture styles values and gender roles of that time. The instrumentplaying which is acted by Gassman and Ericson is outstanding and you feel like you have the best seat at wonderful performances of classical music only you did not have to buy a ticket. I did not know who Michael Rabin the actual violinist was until I saw this film. Now I am aware he was possibly the greatest violinist of all time. HIS real life story would make an incredible movie! I don't know why Gassman and Ericson did not catch on and become bigger stars in America. Perhaps because this film was not a big hit? John Ericson was in the successful film Bad Day at Black Rock but he did not have a sympathetic part so it did not boost his career as a leading man. Too badhe'd have been a great leading man for many 50s and 60s films. Gassman fortunately did find leading man roles before and after this film but mostly in Italian films which I don't have access to. There is an absurd over the top scene in a caf early on and obviously the film was not shot on location but even so if you like 50s films you will enjoy this one especially if you like classical music and looking at gorgeous hunks and gorgeous Elizabeth Taylor.".

While others have complained that the story is mediocre I found Elizabeth Taylor's subtle eye movements and facial expressions intriguing and the story changed enough that it kept me wondering what was going to happen next. Gassman and Ericson played their instruments so lifelike you almost thought they were playing them. Louis Calhern again provided a sophisticated performance as her distanced dad. In fact I thought that the music was not as exceptional as the acting although the selections were chosen to show off the virtuosity of the performers rather than for their beautiful melodies. I am a Puccini and Lehar fan. The actors were all impressive in their roles and should have received more awards than they did for their consummate collaboration.".

	schema:reviewBody "Is it better to be the lover or to be loved? This is the central question of Rhapsody a film about a young woman Louise Durant Elizabeth Taylor and the two musicians between whom she divides her attention. Paul Bronte Vittorio Gassman is a violinist and James Guest John Ericson is a pianist. Each falls for the charms of Louise though they differ in the way they choose to divide their time between Louise and their fledgling music careers.The director of the film Charles Vidor may have overused filters in Ms. Taylor's closeups but who am I to argue with the wonderful results? At age 22 she is the personification of radiant beauty in this film and anyone can understand how these men might be distracted.The film is filled with enjoyable music and it should be mentioned that Gassman and Ericson have to fake playing some extremely difficult passages which they do very well. As an aside check out Vittorio Gassman in Sharkey's Machine 1981 if you want to see him play a contrastingly villainous role.The film rolls along amicably until the finale which is full of emotion and transcendence making the film worthwhile. Louise unexpectedly finds understanding and is transported to a greater love. One of the musicians discovers within himself a strength he never knew he had. And the accompanying music is Rachmaninoff's 2nd Piano Concertoone of the most beautiful romantic pieces ever written.I would describe the ending as Randian a reflection of Ayn Rand's views on romantic love. Many misunderstand her lifeview as cold and calculating but nothing could be further from the truth. Just as she celebrated the heroic in menwomen she championed heroic love between two people. Rachmaninoff's Second is not just romantic it is triumphant. As the orchestra swells over the insistent notes of the piano the music emphasizes the adoring look on the face of Louise and it celebrates the pianist's newfound egoism self love based upon his selfaccomplishment. It's a beautiful scene on many levels and it elevates the film significantly.".

Each falls for the charms of Louise though they differ in the way they choose to divide their time between Louise and their fledgling music careers.The director of the film Charles Vidor may have overused filters in Ms. Taylor's closeups but who am I to argue with the wonderful results? At age 22 she is the personification of radiant beauty in this film and anyone can understand how these men might be distracted.The film is filled with enjoyable music and it should be mentioned that Gassman and Ericson have to fake playing some extremely difficult passages which they do very well. As an aside check out Vittorio Gassman in Sharkey's Machine 1981 if you want to see him play a contrastingly villainous role.The film rolls along amicably until the finale which is full of emotion and transcendence making the film worthwhile. Louise unexpectedly finds understanding and is transported to a greater love. One of the musicians discovers within himself a strength he never knew he had. And the accompanying music is Rachmaninoff's 2nd Piano Concertoone of the most beautiful romantic pieces ever written.I would describe the ending as Randian a reflection of Ayn Rand's views on romantic love. Many misunderstand her lifeview as cold and calculating but nothing could be further from the truth. Just as she celebrated the heroic in menwomen she championed heroic love between two people. Rachmaninoff's Second is not just romantic it is triumphant. As the orchestra swells over the insistent notes of the piano the music emphasizes the adoring look on the face of Louise and it celebrates the pianist's newfound egoism self love based upon his selfaccomplishment. It's a beautiful scene on many levels and it elevates the film significantly.";

All of 18 years old a gorgeous dish looking absolutely flawless in her Edith Head gowns Elizabeth is caught in a triangle of two men of the classic music world.  One Vitorio Gassman Shelley's ex is a concert violinist who seeks his fortune in the world of music.  The other John Ericson fresh from Broadway hit STALAG 17 who is on a GI scholarship from the war and studying the piano.  Charles Vidor directed this small film with some very nice photography of the Alps Switzerland and Europe. Not much the actors could do as the plot really didn't go anywhere.  Miss Taylor gave an honest portrayal of a spoiled rich girl is there any other kind? who rebels her father's wishes played by the oh so elegant Louis Calhern to adorn his dinner table of well known guests. She follows her true love or so she thinks Vittorio to Munich where he intends to perfect his violin under the teaching of Michael Chekhov that wonderful method actor.  However things get sticky as lovely Liz demands more attention.  She eventually marries Ericson to spite Gassman walking out on her.  However hubby realizing she doesn't really love him drowns his sorrow in drink.  When Vittorio returns he sees what she's done to her husband and says unless she can give him back his dignity they're through. Well as in most romantic plots the guy gets the girl or in this case the girl gets the guy.  But which guy? Rent the video and find out.  There are some wonderful musical pieces in this film by Liszt Rachmaninov and Tchaikovsky.  The music the scenery and gorgeous Elizabeth Taylor make this film worth your while.".

Flashy glimpses into the glamorous styles of the 1950s and 60s include loving looks at the many Cadillacs Chess gives as gifts to his star performers.Jeffrey Wright is quietly compelling as Muddy Waters. Mos Def is a charming Chuck Berry he really communicates the charisma that Berry exuded to his adoring female fans. Eamonn Walker is terrific and appropriately intimidating as Howlin' Wolf. Walker electrifies the screen with his every morsel of screen time I wish that after they'd finished Cadillac Records they had just kept the sets up and kept the cameras running and began a biography of Howlin' Wolf with Walker in the lead. Beyonce Knowles is very beautiful and pays worthy tribute to Etta James the singer she plays.Cadillac Records feels a bit rushed and not as deep and probing as it could have been. Perhaps much backstory was cut out?

	schema:headline " This is mostly fiction and an insult to the artists and the history of Chess Records.";
	schema:reviewBody "Pretty much everything in this movie is the work of fiction. It reminds me of one of those Simpsons episodes where a TV studio does a biopic and makes up half the story for 'dramatic effect'. But this is even worse honestly it was bad enough that the stories were fictional but they are also just an insult to the people for some strange reason! though all except the white studio owner that is who was a hopeless romantic who was also apparently the pioneer of the Chicago blues...all things to all men. He was a saint everyone else the musicians were anything but! Let's get some facts clear Leonard Chess set up the company with his brother after working at another company Aristocrat Records. It was here they worked with Muddy Waters. So no Muddy didn't meet Little Walter on the street and bring him into his house. And no little Walter didn't have the hots for Muddy's wife Geneva. Although Leonard Chess was very much hands on when he started the company by all accounts the guy who really pioneered the classic sound of the records was Willie Dixon. Who is criminally underused and treated as a one trick pony who could only write blues songs. He left in the late 50's to work at Cobra records after being underpaid by Chess listen to those Cobra records and those at Chess they sound pretty similar right? That's because Willie Dixon was the pioneer Leonard Chess was the man stuck in the past.One example of the film's dreadful portrayal of the individuals is the fictional scene where Muddy Waters meets Leonard Chess ignoring their prior recording work at Aristocrat records. Little Walter is going to shoot another harp player who has hit him and Muddy stands in his way. Yet the only story remotely like this in REALITY is when a friend of Little Walter's told his wife to leave a club and she sat by Howlin' Wolf and refused to go. Little Walter was performing on stage and had seen Howlin' Wolf get his gun out. He jumped down stage and told Wolf that if he was going to shoot his friend he'd have to shoot him. He later arranged a meeting between his friend and Wolf who in fact became friends despite the altercation. Which is why this movie is so frustrating the REAL lives of these people is nothing short of fascinating exciting and a great background to their music. By all accounts Little Walter was a bit of a loose cannon but he was also a real person not a onedimensional madman who was out to destroy himself and everyone else around him. The story told in the movie is everything that is wrong with Hollywood overblown turgid and full of dreadful 'emotional' scenes everything with Brody and Beyonce is so clichd and hammed up that its cringe worthy. While the story here is just dull the real stories have managed to fill biographies dedicated to each of these artists.Some more inaccuracies Little Walter never shot someone just for touring under his name once again he was no angel but neither does it seem was he a murderer as the movie suggests. Howlin' Wolf actually stayed with Muddy Waters when he first moved to Chicago and sometimes they were friends others professional rivals. Yet Muddy is chosen to be some kind of protagonist who we are supposed to feel sympathy for when another man tries to take his crown. Even worse some of the MORE fascinating characters with all due respect to Leonard 'bore fest' Chess and Muddy Waters of Bo Diddley Sonny Boy Williamson II Ike Turner or Jackie Brenston are completely ignored. Because these people were irrelevant Chuck Berry invented Rock N Roll music all on his lonesome and no one else laid the groundwork for that an especially contrived piece of storytelling when you consider that these guys recorded their seminal records at Chess. But worst of all is the love story. The entire second half of the movie is dedicated to Etta James and Leonard Chess. Who by the way never had any kind of love affair and neither did they speak like buffoons to each other about their 'feelings'. Etta James had already been a successful star before Chess her career if anything went down hill when she joined. One of the more annoying things is that the actors do their own singing few of them are up to the task. Beyonce is simply dreadful as Etta James vocal imitator. On a microcosm it is a perfect representation of why this is an awful movie. Beyonce's voice is overblown she has no ability to control her vocal range without trying to jump from top to bottom every two seconds and ultimately all the soul she tries to put on is clearly just that put on. She doesn't have the understatement of Etta the ability to lull you into a false sense of security before taking her voice from 060 in a second and neither does she have that almost primal quality that Etta had back then. Like this movie Beyonce's performance is overblown and lacks any character or soul.I understand that some liberties might be taken with a story. For example for what it is the Temptations biopic is enjoyable yes there are discrepancies and some things that should have been more central to the story but it did a good impression of the music and the stories behind them. Cadillac Records however is like the HeMan Masters of the Universe of music biopics it has little to do with the source material except sharing the names and likenesses of the characters but any representation of the source material is superficial at best. And that's the only word that really can describe this movie superficial. You have been warned.".

It was 1958 ask Eric Clapton Mick Jagger and Jimmy Page among others. Not only does this movie get a lot wrong by misconstruing the facts it leaves out a couple the bigger players like Sonny Boy Williamson and Big Bill Broonzy. If you want to hear Etta at her best listen to the live version of Baby What You Want Me To Do. Beyonce couldn't touch that. Spike Lee could do this movie with the same actors except Beyonce please use Sharon Jones and win a Grammy.The real story of what these people went through doesn't need to be dramatized or exaggerated it's a great story as is.

The best biopics on musicians tend to get it just about right Bird Sid  Nancy The Doors Walk the Line even if the films aren't great or even worse have those tired old conventions of reallife people fit in tidy fashion for a 2hour storyline. Sometimes all we can hope for is that they get the mood right and even that isn't attained some years back the wildly overpraised Ray had strong performances but to me didn't really capture that feel of what it was like to be in the midst of something really spectacular we only saw it being great for Ray Charles not that his music didn't help the movie somewhat besides the point.There's an attitude to a kind of music whether it's punk or jazz or psychedelic rock or even in wtf mode in I'm Not There. The best thing about Cadillac Records the thing that will have me go back and watch it again more than anything is that it captures what it was like to be around the one of the significant blues explosions in America. There was always blues in the US in the 20th century but it grew steadily out of sorrow and bad days and nights and hate and love gone bad or good for African Americans. Cadillac Records covers some of the crucial blues artists Muddy Waters Howlin' Wolf Chuck Berry the crossover Willie Dixon Etta James and how their personalities were shaped by whatever was around them and then into the songs. We may not get an entire life story out of all those in the film but unlike Walk the Line or Ray we don't need it at all to know these people or the characters.The actors it should be said really do a lot of heavy lifting here. The music it goes without saying is spectacular and wonderful and often shown as developing out of a myriad of things frustration sadness joy craziness anguish love but the script does follow some of those lines that are troublesome in biopics one character Little Walter is the proverbial black sheep and that's almost all he is and there's the obvious dippings inandout of relationship things.So the actors fill in the gaps in the formula and make it far more enjoyable and full of life than it might have in other hands this is the wisdom of the director Darnell Martin usually a TV director. He casts not entirely on if they exactly fit the original people but if they got the right stuff for the particular person Muddy Waters the real badass of the group and the real main character of the story is given powerhouse form by Jeffrey Wright in every frame Beyonce Knowles while hardly the worst thing in Dreamgirls completely redeems herself and then some as Etta James going all out in a fullfleshed out dramatic performance how well she sings is a given Columbus Short given the walking clich of Little takes it for everything it's worth and it is never less than interesting Eaommon Walker from Oz is great as Howlin' Wolf in any scene Mos Def finds the line of hamming it up and playing it for real for Chuck Berry and makes it work all the way Adrien Brody as the token white main player is given not a lot to work with either but is also riveting and captivating and a reminder of why he won the Oscar years back.But with all this gushing about the actors I shouldn't forget about the music the blues all of it lovingly depicted maybe at times too lovingly Cedric's narration while also in rightful critical form on how the blues got completely ripped off by any arguably talented rock band waiting in the wings. You can feel the blues dripping off the screen in some scenes in the first half of the film the scenes with Waters playing in the club or just in his bedroom or Chuck Berry playing on stage with a mixed crowd or the dialog in certain scenes. As a fan of the blues it hit its target right on spot while hopefully converting some who don't know Muddy Waters or Howlin Wolfs' catalogs like Ray Charles. One more clich to note a positive one it gets you whistling as you leave the theater and tapping your feet at your seat. That's good enough sometimes.".

CADILLAC RECORDS CR gives a similar treatment to the story of Chess Records nicknamed Cadillac Records because the PolishAmerican Chess brothers Leonard and Phil Adrien Brody and Norman Reedus reunited from the film SIX WAYS TO Sunday would give the artists Caddies as rewards  out of the artists' own royalties! Chess Records got the music of Muddy Waters Etta James Chuck Berry and other seminal RB performers out to the general public climbing the charts as what were then called race records. Perhaps because of time andor money constraints writerdirector Darnell Martin seems to rush through the Chess stars' highs sometimes literally with scenes of drug andor alcohol abuse and lows forcing her to condense her subjects' dramatic life stories to the point where they don't even seem to age other than a few perfunctory silver streaks visible in Brody's hair late in the film despite the indication that years have passed. Even the Chess brothers' own story is only halftold with the focus being on Leonard as Phil is rendered all but invisible. Heck for half the film I thought Phil was just another sound engineer since we in the audience only ever see him during recording sessions! That said I still found a lot to like about CR. I was riveted and moved by the events and the performances and the musical numbers kick butt I want the soundtrack maybe even the original versions of the songs ! Jeffrey Wright commands the screen as Muddy Waters who becomes Chess Records' first star complete with groupies. He comes home one night to find wife Geneva sympathetically played by Gabrielle Union with a baby in her arms  left there by a fan who says Muddy's the father. Mos Def adds sly humor as Chuck Berry. Eamonn Walker is downright scary as Muddy's rival Howlin' Wolf. Columbus Short breaks your heart and drives you crazy all at once as Little Walter whose lack of a mother or selfdiscipline proves to be his tragic flaw. Beyonc Knowles shows she has range as both an actress and a singer in her fiery heartrending portrayal of the talented but troubled Etta James. Leonard tries to help Etta to learn to sing the blues not live it but with Etta's emotional baggage that's easier said than done. Things only get more complicated when she and Leonard become attracted to each other despite his having a sweet pretty wife Revetta Emmanuelle Chriqui. I'm not surprised that in real life Etta herself gave her blessing to Beyonc's soulful rendition of At Last the ultimate makeout song and Presidential inauguration anthem!  Although Leonard Chess is almost more like a host here than a welldrawn character Brody nevertheless works well with the cast and has great chemistry with Beyonc. In fact he gets a good amount of on screen love action including a nude scene with the fetching Chriqui! ".

	schema:headline " Weak story arc but still somewhat entertaining";
	schema:reviewBody "Cadillac Records is really the story of Chess Records founded by a businessman named Leonard Chess who signed some of the biggest black entertainers in the music business during the 50s and 60s. Supposedly Chess Records came to be known as Cadillac Records due to Chess's penchant for paying his musicians with Cadillacs and not cash.I've read that there were quite a few liberties taken with the historical record in composing the screenplay. This is particularly true of Leonard Chess played by a miscast Adrien Brody who purportedly shortchanged the musicians who were under contract to him the Chess in Cadillac Records is more of a goodnatured cheerleader who always tries to be a great friend to the musicians he hires.The chief flaw of Cadillac Records is that it doesn't have a central protagonist. Just as we're getting used to Muddy Waters as the main character he's supplanted by Little Walter and Howlin Wolf. Then suddenly Chuck Berry takes the spotlight only to be replaced by Etta James. Unfortunately the shelf life of musicians and even big time musicians is not very longusually only a few years in the spotlight.Mos Def is excellent as a wild and creative Chuck Berry but his screen time is much too short for such a seminal figure. Each of the four main characters have one or two things that happen to them that's quite interesting. With Chuck Berry it's the fact that he was arrested for violating the Mann Acthaving sex with underage girls and traveling over interstate lines. Little Walter ends up shooting a man for simply using his name in a musical group I couldn't understand why there was no investigation into that shooting. In addition to Muddy Water's womanizing there's also some attention paid to his financial problems that occurred after he no longer was churning out hit records.While Beyonce looks real fine as Etta James her acting is a bit over the top as she portrays the singer's descent into heroin addiction. I didn't buy Leonard Chess's flirtation with Etta James and Brody and Beyonce simply have no chemistry together.Cadillac Records is narrated by songwriter Willie Dixon played by Cedric the Entertainer. The film needs a narrator to compensate for the lack of a strong story arc. Nonetheless Cadillac Records is worth seeing for the music and the recreation of a bygone era. Just don't expect any drama that will knock your socks off!".

	schema:headline " The music is the story of Cadillac Records";
	schema:reviewBody "Synopsis This movie is based on the true story of how a small music recording studio Chess Records located on the south side of Chicago began recording blues music with Muddy Waters Jeffrey Wright and Little Walter Columbus Short in 1947 and eventually gave birth to rock and roll in 1955 with Chuck Berry Mos Def. Record producer Leonard Chess Adrien Brody has an ear for this different type of music and believes he can cash in by signing up new talent such as songwriter Willie Dixon Cedric the Entertainer Howlin' Wolf Eamonn Walker and Etta James Beyonce Knowles. Leonard Chess makes all of his artist part of his family and takes care of them. This is not an easy job for him because they spend a small fortune on booze drugs and the high life. When Chuck Berry goes to jail Leonard is able to find another talented performer Etta James to take his place. In the late sixties as their music goes out of favor Leonard Chess gets out of the record business.My Comment This story is not a documentary of Chess Records but a story about their music. The movie title 'Cadillac Records' comes from the fact that Leonard Chess would buy his musicians a new Cadillac when they recorded their first hit record and for each new hit. What the artists didn't know was that the cars were being paid from their record royalties. Leonard Chess treated his artists as family and the line between business and family sometimes causes conflict between them. If you go to see Beyonce in the movie you may be disappointed because she only has a limited amount of screen time with about 3 songs. However you won't be disappointed by her performance and that of Jeffrey Wright. They make you believe they are Etta James and Muddy Waters and they actually sing their wonderful songs in the movie. The film can only tell a small part of each artist's story in short scenes but they are very powerful scenes. Sony Pictures Run Time 148 Rated R810".

	schema:headline " This boring superficial movie could've been better. TQS Breakdown PROSCONS";
	schema:reviewBody "1. It was a necessary history lesson for young people in understanding where most of today's music originated from.PRO2. Jeffrey Wright gave a good performance as Muddy Waters. He was amusing at times with enough mystique to make him interesting without making him a total bafflement.PRO3. Mos Def was good as Chuck Berry. This had plenty to do with the fact that his character was the most engaging. He was witty and talented possessing most of the film's admirable qualities.PRO4. Beyonce gave her best performance to date. She was captivating at times. Seductive.PRO1. I was bored. The movie took too long for anything real to happen. The first thirty minutes played like an uneventful montage between Chess and Waters.CON2. The characters were all one dimensional. Every single one of them. They were as much developed as characters in dramatizations one would see on America's Most Wanted. In fact the whole film felt like one big dramatization about the rise and fall of Cadillac Records. The dots never connected.CON3. I didn't engage with any of the characters. In other words I couldn't care less. Oh your father doesn't want anything to do with you? I don't care. Are the police working you over for being a loud mouth? I don't care. You feel slighted because your husband is out having babies with other women? yawn Get in line. I know there were too many characters to develop them all fully and appropriately in which case the story should have focused on the necessary few. In some cases they all seem to be doing something that made me disconnect from them even more like the kid Little Walters. I had a problem with everything he did. He would act out and do cowardly things to people. Where were the humanistic qualities in most of them? They all seem to be looking out for themselves except for Muddy Waters. I never pitied any of them. They were flawed but we never go to know their inner personal or extrapersonal conflicts. And they seemed to be predictable.CON4. The transitions were not smooth at all. The story and editing together felt choppy erratic and disjointed. This goes back to my point about the film never connecting the dots. One minute we're here the next we're there cutting a time we needed to understand or see simple yet eventful things like Chess getting married.CON5. Adrian Brody's performance was mediocre at best in a futile effort to breath life into a character without focus. I knew I was in trouble in the first scene with him staring in the wake of a Polish father dragging his daughter away from him. He uttered something about one day his wife will drive a Cadillac the worst execution of a line in Brody's career.CON6. Too much musical number scenes and not enough story. It wasn't a musical. So what's with the constant music being played? Also the music was so loud it clouded out the already difficult to makeout dialogue. The sound mixer should have been replaced with one who understands the necessity of dialogue in a film like this.CON7. The rest of the performances were not good at all. Gabrielle Union's facial expressions made her look like she was going mad instead of being emotional about her circumstances. And what's that thing she does with her lips folded in? Columbus Short was terrible. Cedric the Entertainer was just... there. Emmanuelle Chriqui looked like she was asking in her mind Why am I here? 8. I didn't believe the whole atmosphere of the film. I mean the over all film had no life. I guess this was responsible for me being bored. I blame the writerdirector.CON9. Beyonce's best wasn't enough. I said it was her best performance but it wasn't very good in my opinion. When she wasn't captivating and seductive she was whiny and boring. In the scene at the restaurant Etta exploded in rage throwing a glass at the floor and for that brief moment it felt like I was watching Effie White from Dreamgirls. The voice the tone the execution of the line as she breaks the glass. Besides that one unique moment of her list of underwhelming beats she was flat and her character was all over the place. I see like in Dreamgirls she still have trouble staying in the moment for a whole scene. There will be a flash of Etta James or whomever she was impersonating then it'll be Beyonce trying to act the rest of the way. Her performance and character was inconsistent. But she was very easy on the eyes.CONIN CLOSING I was constantly asking myself about these characters What does heshe want and how is heshe trying to get it? There was never any real inciting incident and the ending was anticlimatic. And for all those who are betting their home on Beyonce winning an Oscar for her performance in this film let me be the one to save you all from being homeless in what appears to be the coldest winter in years at least those that live in cold places like the NYC. Not only will Beyonce NOT win an Oscar for this she will also be overlooked for a nomination by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts  Sciences.".

Each character is given a seemingly admiring build up only to be savaged by a scurrilous and scandalous focus on such vulgar vices as foulmouthed language fornication drug addiction and avarice. The filmmakers who are much less talented than their subjects seem to be saying that the price a great artist must pay for his gift is to be thought of as a guttersnipe. The lurid images presented are a blight upon the memory of some of the great blues artists of all time. I've met several of the named individuals depicted and don't see any connection between the real life persons and the ones presented on screen. To give you an idea of how far off the mark the film is in over 40 years of being a devoted blues fan I have never once heard a blues musician or another fan use profanity of any kind while in the dialogue of the film profanity is closer to being the rule rather than the exception. The filmmakers had the option of highlighting any dramatic aspect of their subject's lives that they could think of and chose to devote an enormous amount of attention to ugly unimportant and possibly nonexistent details showing incredibly poor artistic judgment.I don't doubt that the makers of Cadillac Records had the advice of attorneys before they put their travesty on screen and that they will claim if challenged that the incidents presented are all true to life. But I very strongly doubt that they'd be able to present convincing proof of some of the more objectionable content which I believe may have been based on questionable rumors mere anecdotes or unsubstantiated gossip. One thing at least is terribly clear whatever the facts are the emphasis is entirely wrong. The great Chess recording stars were not stupid lecherous violent or greedy they were popular geniuses beloved of millions of people all over the world which is how they must be remembered. Don't see this awful film if you can possibly avoid it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cadillac Records has the best music and musical performances of any film this year. Happily there is plenty of music on display that brings to light a sound that has been long overlooked by Hollywood. For this I applaud the filmmakers efforts.The problem with Cadillac Records in my opinion is that the story is too big with too many big personalities and Darnell Martin simply is not up to the task of writing or directing such a story. Especially when the lead character Adrien Brody is given little to do except introduce all of the characters to each other. The drama is forced and unbelievable. It's as if a four hour documentary is trying to be forced into a 110 minute film. It's disjointed and you never get emotionally involved either with the story or the characters. You never even learn what drives Lee Chess to want to record this music. The movie seems to exist only for the purpose of putting the music on display.And actually that's okay. The music is so good and the performances of the musicians so honest you want to here much more of it. Jeffrey Wright is marvelous as Muddy Waters as is Mos Def as Chuck Berry and Gabrielle Union as Geneva Wade. Columbus Short and Eammonn Walker are standouts as Little Walter and Howlin' Wolf respectively.Beyonce Knowles sings Etta James with all of the feeling and soul that you would expect but she's over the top in her acting. Not that she's bad she's just not very good.Adrien Brody is wasted in a thankless role. He brings the individual pieces together but his scenes have no real dramatic impact. If you're thinking of going to see this film don't. You'll get much more of a reward by just getting the soundtrack.5 out of 10".

I actually thought Beyonce did a good job and she sure can sing but the flirtation with Brody just didn't work and as has been pointed out never happened. Best character was the guy playing Chuck Berry but he was under used and there should really be a whole film about Mr Berry anyway. I loved the bit where Chuck was arrested for being taking underage girls across the state line and he says 'Are we stopping off at Jerry Lee's house I hear he married his 13 year old cousin?' So I see this film as a missed opportunity and for those who don't like too much swearing I suggest you avoid this film as it is just full of it  in more ways than one ".

My husband forgot about the movie an hour after we left the theater a sure sign of its weakness. I don't blame Beyonnce I can understand her not wanting to wait for Hollywood to give out good Black Female roles. I also feel sorry for the likes of Gabrielle Union also Angela Bassett who I saw in a trailer for another ridiculous movie tragedy. These women deserve better and so do the other great music geniuses of Chess Records. 610".

Neither the book nor the movie strike me as a children's' story.  Don't get me wrong kids will probably like this movie particularly older kids but it's more for adults who can get the puns and such.  Adult will also probably appreciate the psychedelic artwork from longtime Jones collaborator Maurice Noble.  The amoebic Doldrums are a highlight as is the Awful DYNN a manic crayon scrawl and the cities of Dictionopolis and Digitopolis they look like a riot at the Avantgarde Graphic Design class.

After that my brother and I seldom missed the opportunity to rent it out again if we could and even today we can probably quote the entire film to each other or to anyone who would want to listen for that matter.Made by MGM in 1970 The Phantom Tollbooth pretty much remains faithful to Norton Juster's book but gets brought right up to date for the time that is and given a good dose of phsycodelia.Milo Butch Patrick is a bored young boy who lives in San Fransisco one day a mysterious box appears in his bedroom which contains a magic tollbooth which when passed through takes Milo into a cartoon world called the Kingdom Of Wisdom. A Kingdom ruled by two warring brothers. King Azaz of Dictionopolis whose iron rule is that words are more important than numbers and The Mathemagician of Digitopolis who holds the view that numbers are far more important than words.In order to restore some sanity back to the land he agrees to rescue the Princesses Rhyme  Reason from the Castle In The Air. But first he has to overcome certain obstacles such as The Doldrums and their inhabitants The Lethargians who want to stop Milo for Eating Sleeping and even Breathing. He has to escape the clutches of Kakofonous A. Dischord a mad scientist that wants to stop Milo from ever hearing pleasant sounds again which he tries with the aid of his accomplice the Awful Dynne wonderfully voiced by none other than Candy Candido. Officer Short Shrift is a unicycle cop with a insatiable fondness for arresting people for no good purpose. and the Demons of Ignorance who wait in the mountains guarding the approach to the Castle In The Air.It's not all doom  Gloom though as Milo does encounter many allies to aid him on his journey. There is Tock The Watchdog Mr Humbug The Spelling Bee who by his own admission can spell any word that has ever been written in any language anywhere The Whetherman and his sister Faintly Macabre The not so wicked Which and no they are not misspellings.Every Character in the Phantom Tollbooth is in fact a not too disguised Metaphor for something else. be it impatience sloth and greed but the film also shows a remedy for these negative traits.The most famous of all the people who lent their vocal talents to the movie is none other than voice of Bugs Bunny Mel Blanc. If Lon Chaney was the 'Man of a Thousand faces' then Blanc surely was The Man of a Thousand Voices' Unless you're really sensitive about everything there is nothing in The Phantom Tollbooth that could offend anyone. It's a film that can be watched whether you're 8 or 80 and still get the same thrill from it. I'm also thrilled that my children are also fans of this film that meant so much to me when I was their age and I hope it is something that they will pass on to THEIR children too.Enjoy!".

My two kids aged five and six were enchanted by it just as I was when I first saw it at the age of ten.The characters are colorful and entertaining. Milo is easy for any child who has ever been bored or lonely to identify with. The avuncular Watch Dog Tock will look fairly familiar to any regular viewer of Chuck's work on Warner Brothers' short cartoons. The Humbug and the Spelling Bee are reminiscent of Dr Seuss characters Officer Short Shrift is somewhat more surreal but that only makes him stick in your mind all the more.  The songs are lots of fun and you'll probably be humming them for a long time afterwards.All in all a great movie for kids and Mums and Dads too. Pass the popcorn!".

A lot of elements in the book obviously had to be left out such as the halfchild Milo meets while trying to get to the Land of Infinity Infinity is a dreadfully poor place  they can never manage to make ends meet and the man who's a thin man to fatties a fat man to thinnies a midget to tall men and a giant to those of diminished stature and I'm not too sure having Milo see the tollbooth arrive and leave was such a good idea but Jones and his team manage to bring Juster's fine work to the screen without damaging it en route.

I am not saying that all film adaptations should follow the book strictly but the film should at least stand on it's own. I just feel like the movie was quite rushed and did not take time to explain things. The animation was also rushed too. The whole movie just seemed rushed. Weren't half baked ideas frowned upon in the movie? How ironic! A lot of my favorite part of the book were also skipped such as most of the forest of sight where Milo learns about perspective. Milo's adventure in the valley of sound was also skipped. Milo also did not meet the child from infinity. Tock was also far too patronizing and did not preach as much in the book where his character was far less perfect and more believable. The order in which Milo hits his destinations such as Chroma's place and Dr. Dischord's van also made more sense in the book and probably should have been followed more strictly in the movie for the sake of the story's flow. Even for children the film is much too choppy.The end was also very cheesy because it was sung. In fact most of the songs were overkill.Maybe this book just isn't meant to be made into a film. It isn't exactly subtle and is more of a concept or how to type of story where the metaphors are more obvious. Film translates ideas a bit more subtly with dialog action etc. Bad guys being defeated by a pencil firing the words truth just doesn't make for a good film. Oh well maybe another producer will pull off the Phantom Tollbooth in a better way but for now read the book the story flows much more nicely when it is read.".

It isn't exactly subtle and is more of a concept or how to type of story where the metaphors are more obvious. Film translates ideas a bit more subtly with dialog action etc. Bad guys being defeated by a pencil firing the words truth just doesn't make for a good film. Oh well maybe another producer will pull off the Phantom Tollbooth in a better way but for now read the book the story flows much more nicely when it is read.";

	schema:reviewBody "What's to become of Milo? That was the question posed by Milo's Theme the catchy pop tune cowritten and produced by Lee Pockriss and Norman Gimbel which opens Chuck Jones' 1969 film adaptation of Norton Juster's The Phantom Tollbooth. I've seen the film myself even during the early years of at least two of the Turnerowned networks TNT and the Cartoon Network. But I want to take a moment to make these comments on Chuck Jones' Tollbooth because it has been for the past decade or so the result of a very special dream of mine. I'm Richard Washington Founder and Chairman of Electric Pirates Entertainment. When I started EPE some fifteen years ago one of the company's primary goals was to attempt a remake of the Tollbooth movie. Having seen it for myself I knew a little something about the film's history. MetroGoldwynMayer had bought the rights to Tollbooth along with Juster's second kids' book The Dot and the Line in around 1967 shortly thereafter the management then in place at MGM assigned both properties to animation legend Chuck Jones who by then was under contract to MGM. Basically what management said to Chuck was Here are a couple of originals by Norton Juster. See what you can do about making one into a short subject and the other into a 90minute feature film. Essentially Chuck did precisely what they'd told him to do. He not only made the short bringing in actor Robert Morley to read the entire Juster text from The Dot and the Line he also transformed The Phantom Tollbooth into a 90minute feature  i.e. an animated cartoon bookended by liveaction sequences filmed on location in San Francisco and starring Eddie Munster himself Butch Patrick. This I think was Butch's last major starring role as a child actor. Once production on the Jones Tollbooth was completed and put in the can the intent was to release Tollbooth along with Dot  Line at the 1969 Christmas season. However the project somehow became involved in studio politics the resulting doublebill was never given proper theatrical release until 1971  2 12 years later by which time MGM had fired all of its animation staff including Jones. Thus what had been planned as MGM's firstever animated feature ironically became the company's lastever animated production. And that brings us to the part of this story concerning my very special dream after having seen the Chuck Jones Tollbooth I have spent the last several years tackling plans for a liveaction nonmusical remake of The Phantom Tollbooth  in fact I have actually spoken with Norton Juster himself about this!  one that would basically correct the mistakes Chuck Jones had no doubt made when he filmed Tollbooth in late 1968. Mr. Juster has expressed his gratitude that I should want a new film version of his beloved book but officially he has little to say on the matter in light of the fact that Chuck's 1969 film is of course part of the Turner Entertainment library. With that I have no quarrel. I'm simply saying that MGM should have waited for the magic of the movies to reach a sufficiently sophisticated stage in order to do proper cinematic justice to The Phantom Tollbooth. That's why I have long believed that there are only two special effects powerhouses on the Planet which are capable of accomplishing such aims namely George Lucas' Industrial Light  Magic and Jim Henson's Creature Shop! With their combined expertise in computergenerated characters animatronic effects special makeup techniques and other waycool elements only ILM and the Henson Shop could truly make the magic of The Phantom Tollbooth come alive  especially for what George Lucas once called that generation doomed to grow up without fairy tales. And I have wanted nothing less than to be the man to make it all  and I do mean ALL!  possible. But Richard I sense you're asking did you like the movie itself? Yes. Artistically Jones' Tollbooth is a visual treat and its clever motive of taking the concepts of Juster's Dictionopolis and Digitopolis to literal extremes provides the largest degree of 'eye candy.' The film does sadly fall short by making the two Princesses Rhyme and Reason mere silhouettes that alas denies the viewer the pleasure of seeing how beautiful they really are. Of course considering that this is a Chuck Jones film one cannot fault the voice talents! Mel Blanc Daws Butler June Foray and Les Tremayne were old friends of Chuck's during '67 their voices alone were and are worth the price of the video if you will that was for the Amazon.com customers out there!. Lesserknown vocals  Shep Menken Patti Gilbert Candy Candido and Larry Thor  are also in the cast along with Hans Conried in his first nonDisney cartoon voice role I think. The 9member ensemble clearly mold and shape Butch Patrick's role of Milo into what he ultimately becomes by story's end an emotionally stronger and perhaps a remarkably better boy  but at least a boy no longer bored by the world. Well I think I've given you some kind of idea as to what you can expect from Chuck Jones' 1969 version of The Phantom Tollbooth. Of course if I can bring ILM and the Henson Shop together set up a production homebase at London's famous Pinewood Studios that's where they do the Bond movies and then scout for locations in and around my beloved New York City I think I can do for The Phantom Tollbooth what Sidney Lumet and designer Tony Walton tried to do for The Wiz. I estimate that I should have it all coming together and released by .....oh around the year 2008 or thereabouts. Here's hoping I can do it!".

Hmmmm. I decided that this wasn't bad for an first foray into feature length territory and that if Jones had a chance to learn from his mistakes and try a couple more times he would have probably come up with a real classic. But Phantom Tollbooth wasn't it and deserves its place in semiobscurity. Problem Too much heavy handed moralizing. I was surprised that people as sneakily funny and subversive as Jones and his crew would be satisfied with the tone of the dialog and the exposition here. No matter that the target audience was young Even Disney in the early years was never this blunt and cheesy in their subtexts and allegories. From what I've read the original text wasn't this unsubtle either. Or else what works in a 20 word blurb on the page doesn't always work at length in a live medium. More problems About half of the songs are um pretty lame at least to my sensibilities. The ones that yammer away about the virtues of earnestness duty hard work etc. And Butch Patrick was a pretty good kid actor but he was no singer  all he ever does is pipe along with the lyrics as if they were the musical version of The Pledge Of Allegiance. Worse yet some of the animation is 2nd rate. Oh sure the main characters  the Watch Dog the Humbug Milo the Mathemagician  are done as well as you expect from a Jones flick and some of the backgrounds are suitably trippy but most of the monsters and supporting cast including Rhyme and Reason are slapdash and badly conceived and look like another crew of 2nd unit apprentices did them. Still the movie has its moments. The scene in the Doldrums had a nice sinister edge to it. It was nice to hear Blanc and Foray and Tremayne and the rest do what they do so well even if they had trouble selling some of the dialog. And I am sure that the kid I was back in 1970 would have enjoyed more than I do now  although not as much as One Hundred and One Dalmations or The Sword In The Stone. I really wanted to like this movie as much as I do those two which sport a similar style of character animation and I want to overlook its faults because it has a good heart. But as I said it is undercooked enough that it really doesn't match up to the classics from that era.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have not played any of the Resident Evil games but am a fan of the movie series.This movie apparently takes place in the game universe. I had purchased the first Resident Evil animation but have not watched it in a while.This movie stands quite well on its own. The plot is fairly straight forward. Mr cool guy spy had been ordered away from his vacation to check out a problem regarding prisoners of war in a war torn former soviet country. It turns out they were turned into BOWs Bio Organic Weapons. These are basically humans that have been mutated by a weaponized virus into deadly creatures controlled by whoever has been infected with the master form of the virus.The country is undergoing a revolution and the rebels have resorted to using the BOWs against the army. Our hero tries to survive and fight until he can figure out who's controlling the BOWs and discovers the rebels are not the only ones with BOWs and there is in fact a much deadlier version right under his very nose.Action packed all the way through. The animation is better than the first animated movie and the story and acting are great. I enjoyed every minute of it and I think animation horror andor zombie fans will enjoy it too.".

	schema:reviewBody "Never heard of Resident Evil Damnation before? Can't remember which movie it is since most Resident Evil movies have one spectacular word in the title but ultimately fails to deliver? Worry not Resident Evil Damnation is a 3D animation BluRayDVD spinoff which didn't air in cinema so at least you won't regret paying for ticket. Using full CGI the movie has excellent visual and wicked action scenes although the usual problem of campy oneliner and some plot issue linger like bad does of TVirus.Graphic is topnotch it's on par with some of the best CG of this gen. Facial structure and body motion have been polished greatly and props to Capcom for making hair look quite realistic. The shiniest part is how it cleverly manipulates the lighting every light source has different ambiance. Tone of atmosphere looks differently under many shades be it from moonlight sunrise tiny light from bullet holes or even simple flashlight. Shadow dances about delicately making the contrast of light and dark even more featured.Monsters are eerie down to its gruesome details especially noted in occasional switch to first person view. While there are not many kinds the movie highlighted its monsters with dynamic speedy movement and imposing physique. The movie succeeds in capturing the intense essence of older Resident Evil games while not as consistently as it could've been it's certainly better than what its predecessors had to offer. Action is swift and neatly done some are melee hand to hand combat and silly it may be Ada Wong fighting against female president is quite the spectacle.At latter part the action intensifies with remarkable pace. There are not many sequences that can rival the movie in its climatic moment even amongst today's adventure movie or game. However these bits are rather short compared to the dull slow build up its graphic is not without fault either. In some larger scale scenes motion and details aren't as smooth as the rest. The constant slowmo might get old and it becomes very apparent from the number of stuffs thrown it caters to 3D viewing.Story is expectedly confusing despite the social and political back story it tries to present. It's a shame since the plot could've been more solid if only there's more explanation than stupid quips. Resident Evil is infamous in its regurgitation of Bmovie humor attempt it thinks that it's clever it's most definitely not. I find it hard to believe anyone would have the time to produce corny remarks when running from homicidal nightmarish creatures.The bad dialogue also hurts characterization even though the movie barely has any character development to speak of. In several scenes it tries to draw some sort of emotion but the ludicrous script contradicts the effort. This is not some selfdeprecating jokes that can be funny it is just bad. Story severely needs more clarity things just sort of happen little to none explanation is given as it pushes more dramatic moments with frivolous lines.Somber chirping tracks accompanies the movies it's pretty good obviously bringing more reminiscence and some tension. Dubbing is decent there's a lipsync awkwardness but it is expected in multilingual film. Ending song is simply atrocious bad marketing decision since the credit also serves as teaser for Resident Evil 6.It's undeniably the film has some production value as quality of the visual and action are high. Capcom commendably elevates the graphic but the use of flimsy screenplay and inane catchphrase should be things of the past. The franchise is trapped in the limbo of advancing technology and mundane writing. As it stands now Resident Evil Damnation is a decent DVD spinoff plagued with tiresome plot.Rate 610".

The Effect and CG was great to me it showed the monsters extremely vividly beautiful slowmotions. You must keep your eyes open all almost 2hrs because of the veryfast rhythm and nice action of Leon and Ada. The noteworthy thing is about the Lickers fastmany and even they were the good assistants know while watching!!!???. Dramatic has been pushed up to the climax when Leon and Buddy against 2 giant Tyrans. And that was the 2nd anniversary of Leon when he was getting on the brink of death to save someone 1st in RE Degeneration!!! Will you have a good day off? So let's buy the DVD or Bluray from 25 Sep. and enjoy it maybe you'll agree with my reviews. My rating 910".

The idea of somebody having the ability to control the monsters is a very good idea that lets be honest evens out the odds when the protagonists are facing something like Nemesis.I am going to say something right now to clear things up  I think this is not only the best RE movie to date but the best video game adaptation. However aside from these movies nothing too good or memorable has been done The only other one I have seen in recent memory is Max Payne and that was truly awful and offensive to a fan of the games like myself.Resident Evil Retribution is one I will see but it has A LOT to surpass if they're EVEN THINKING about surpassing this one.".

The action which is very well and interestingly performed or directed and can actually surprise you in a good way not like most of those new Hollywood action movies that seem to get more and more boring... Leon S. Kennedy is again the protagonist of this movie I would choose a different guy this time but they managed to portrait him well in this animated movie but not as good as in RE Degeneration. The sidecharacters were not well enough developed and they lacked a bit in background story and ambitions. I really liked the president of this Eastern Slav Republic she was hot she was well development and simply an intriguing character. Compared to RE Degeneration this movie felt a bit weaker because I think the dramaturgy didn't go that well and too many things were left unclear which is really sad  maybe some of the games give an explanation but that certainly doesn't make this movie better. A really interesting thing is how this story actually kinda foresaw the UkraineKrimCrisis in a very abstracted way because this movie was released a short while before stuff started to go wild over there... even the president kinda reminds heavily of the generalsecretary of the Krim Republic and internetstar Natalja Poklonskaja which is an almost? prophetic coincidence.

Although I wouldn't say this film is very child friendly. One of the things it does better is staying true to the games. It doesn't go in THE MATRIX direction like the recent live action films did it really stays true to both the feeling and the atmosphere the RESIDENT EVIL games are known for.Overall It's very cool and much better than the live action movies. Fans of the games will certainly have a blast.".

The RE franchise is here with one more release and like its previous gaming storyline we also see Leon S. Kennedy Fans might recall him in the Bio hazard installmentas the lead character.Here he once again is on a mission in one of the fictional country named as East Slav Republic which was a part of former USSR and now is suffering in a domestic war with socialistic rebels and whole country is on a verge of destruction as CIA and Kremlin suspects that more radical methods here Bio Organic Weapons B.O.W.S in shortof tactics are being employed by either of the side to win this war but which side they are not sure. Hence Leon is send here to seek and neutralize any such threats found. As he infiltrates the country he is informed that US govt. has ordered all the American citizens in the Slav Republic to return at once so as military of Slav is ready to destroy the rebels once and for all and the country was not secure for civilians.But Leon witnesses something strange and decides to disobey the direct order of US govt. so that he himself will investigate further one if any conclusive evidence is found he will neutralize it and only then he will return but he is captured by rebels after a slave mutant creature attacks him in an abandoned parking lot and after that it is cat and mouse game for both the parties involved and Leon finds himself in between both of them but who is real threat he yet has to figure out.Well as the movie progressed i was amazed at the graphics and animation is lot better then previous installments yet the creatures were not given proper style and most of the time they felt like a bubble floating on screen..they were looking more like a video game scenario rather to be a part of a movie. so i was not pleased here but overall the sound and visual effects were pretty good and storyline was somehow similar like you are surrounded with creatures in a remote area and no help is around you have ammo and you gotta find your way out.Though storyline is still in the sync with the theme of this RE franchise the one thing i liked was that the way movie ended it also kept the suspense going for me and we might see the sequel for this in the coming year or so. The dark elements of the movie were more heavy here like dark corridors underground tunnels sound effects and off course violence every thing you are familiar in this series is showcased little bit here which was a surprise as i did not witnessed any thing more twisted and disfigured as i was hoping and was disappointed as after playing so many parts and encountering dozens of freaky creatures my appetite for entertainment fell short but still the director used the thematics to kept the story going and i would say he did an OK job.So a weak story line might prove a disadvantage for this movie because the whole theme of the movie demands more twist action madness and freaky monsters which was in shortage here.Still movie reign ahead due to better entertainer then latest Resident evil installment starring Mila Jovovich which has no story at all.This movie has decent action scenes which keep the interest going and does not disappoint in the end as the smart climax does not disclose the whole story and a lots of questions are left unanswered.Final verdict Go watch it as it still manages to entertain thought people might find the gameplay stories of RE franchise more capturing and exciting but it is a decent effort as there is not any formula for making a hit movie. The Director and technicians have made good efforts and and as a fan i still love whatever this franchise can offer.And don't worry you can recommend it to friends despite its weak story line.My rating 7.510".

	schema:headline " Resident Evil Damnation Review";
	schema:reviewBody "I first heard about this movie when I was watching Phelous another movie critic that was doing the Resident Evil movies. Both Live action and CGI versions of the movies. This CGI movie is about Leon trying to stop terrorists from trying to take over the fictional nation of Eastern Slav Republic even though it's called the country most of the time. Leon here is also one of the characters from RE 2 who survived and became an American government agent after the the Racoon City incident. It's explained in RE 4 if that helps at all.The CGI is better in this movie than the previous CGI movie even though the voice actor for Leon has changed. The CGI is also like I'm watching one of the Resident Evil games with some of the action. The terrorists also use these bio organic weapons or BOW's from the Umbrella Corporation called Lickers. They control them by using a main las plagas parasite for one person. It allows your personality intact but the main plagas will soon take over them eventually.The las plagas infected act more like zombies at times in the movie. Even though in RE 4 and 5 they were more like people still. Ada Wong is also in this movie and she meets up with Leon in the middle. Both of the voice actors in this movie I think are amazing in this movie too. Ada also explains to Leon that the country will be purged soon and then she leaves.Later Ada and Leon find out there's a las pagas hive under the county's government building. The terrorists also make their way into the hive as well and to stop the lady president. Then these big guys out of pods come out and try to kill the terrorists and Leon. They get backed near a locked elevator but Ada helps unlock it from somewhere else.The big guys also surface but then it's discover they're Tyrants people who bonded with the TVirus instead of it killing them. Leon tries to stop him but they terrorist guy stops the Tyrant with a tank and then shoots him. Then some more Tyrants show up and Leon and terrorist guy try to escape.Leon make his last stand but then some American jets come by and shred the last two Tyrants. Since the Americans were keeping an eye on him the whole time. Terriost guy tries to kill himself since he doesn't want to mutate from the main plagas. Leon then takes the gun and says he needs to move forward and seems like he kills him. At the end Ada contacts her superior and says she has a plagas with her. Also terrorist guy lives after the main cast credits roll. Since Leon mentioned something about the risk of having a las pagas removed is death or paralysis. So he shot of his main plagas instead of killing him.This movie is pretty good compared to the live action RE movies which are kind of boring at times. These CGI movies are pretty good and you should at least give this movie a watch if your a RE fan since newcomers might not understand it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This reminded me of Resident Evil 4 slightly. Leon goes in alone and gets captured by the people he came there to stop. I guess the only thing real different is that they found something that controls the creatures to a point. We have all of the characters from Leon's side of the storyline like the 'bombshell' Ada Wong to Leon Kennedy and Ingrid Hunnigan. And even in all of this they have new characters that actually are lovable even if they don't stay for very long.The problems I have with the show are actually rather minimal but the ending feels as though it was extremely predictable. We have a large fight going with a 'new' form of strong bioweapon and a facility that is about to go through genetic cleansing. Then we have the 'boss' fight with multiple stages to him.It's interesting that they used images of Resident Evil 6 in the ending theme but if you haven't played the game your left wondering what the reasoning was for it. I know I may be reviewing these shows out of order but a good movie normally has something that helps even new watchers understand what's going on.Wow the animation actually looks so much better then what they had in Degeneration. It's much more fluid and the characters look much more realistic without going over the boundaries of the game style. We even get the exploding heads of the zombie people that I bet those who have played the games hate. One of my favorite points is when they go into first person view because it looks so much like the real thing When I mean real thing I mean both game and real life horror shows. The points I do hate is that they actually show someone getting forced into one of the zombies. Whenever I see someone forcing those things into someone's mouth I always end up gagging a bit. I also hate the slow motion times they use although it's used quite sparingly in this one. The textures are good except the fact that all the men seem to have lipgloss or lip stick on their lips.The English voices are pretty good and you can most of the time tell who is American and who is from the Soviet Union. Characters actually sound close to what they were in the games and I believe its because they are the same voice actors but could be wrong. The music was also rather well done and worked to the movies advantage.".

The script had different factions character development lots of action without it being too much over the top and by that standard alone was a lot better than the Resident Evil films.Of course there were plot holes and no Milla Jovovich and also I believe because of rating purposes there was not much gore or horror. Consider it an action film with monsters but this time a definite improvement from Resident Evil Degeneration the animation movie from 2008. Plus some sentimental scenes were pretty far stretched almost to the point of annoyance.Bottom line I watch Resident Evil films for Milla and the monsters. I like the monsters but I like Milla more. This film had more story no Milla and was 3D animated. There was less gore and no horror. While I find it hard to admit I think I've enjoyed this film more than the live actor versions.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's been a long time since our little Japanese folks have made a CGI feature film boasting a successful video game in the racks. To be exact if possible you may have seen Final Fantasy The Spirit Within 2001. It's a groundbreaking milestone for such films to improve with less mediocrity. And when it comes to reviving the Resident Evil films it's the salvation. Starting with the first CG feature of RE titled Degeneration the new sequel brings something if not good refreshing to the tables. With its eyecandy CGI and sharp storytelling Damnation is the best Resident Evil to date. Why does RE fans have to suffer from Paul W.S Anderson's liveaction mash up? It's not just me that's saying this. We all somehow hate the franchise that this director made since 2000. We could've preferred George A. Romero's version if it wasn't because of staying too far from the video games' jaded narrative. In Damnation we get a solid touch of the games' serious story. The film starts with a backstory of the American and Russian's civil war. Afterwards Leon S. Kennedy voice acting by Matthew Mercer get sucked it on the Eastern Slav Republic determined to destroy the BOWs abbreviated as Bio Organic Weapons. The BOWs have a masterslave relationship with the Plaga parasites a jellylooking infecting organism. The Plaga parasite may introduce gamers to Resident Evil 5 where it played a huge role. But in the film it may introduce well for the plot.Meanwhile another RE character Ada Wong voiced by Courtaney Taylor also disguises as a member of the BSAA under the republican President Svetlana Wendee Lee. Ada's mission is to retrieve a sample of the Plaga. Other than that she's under incognito.Resident Evil Damnation combines what's fun when playing the video games The story is intriguing and thrilling the voice acting is cheesy but otherwise good and the action setup is overthetop. I had fun with the Bluray version of the film the CG elements has never been this jarring. Although the camera setups looks like it's been ripped out as game cutscenes. Comparably Degeneration focused more on escapism and the story looks solid as its sequel.The movie made the videogame feel. There are scenes where we experience firstperson perspective. There's no good and bad with it. Although we expect something more with the movie other than seeing the characters do their exploit maneuver fight scenes to make the CG elements eye popping without the 3D glasses. But the highdefinition elements is not pretentious it's a guiltfree ride.The only main downside is that it is less scary than that of its predecessor. Because it focused not on the usual zombies but on the Lickers creatures with vicious tongue and the Tyrants huge stomping creatures. But when it comes with the games it's fatal to kill. All we could do is to plead with Leon to kill it for us.Now that my hands are down for another installment Damnation is the kind of movie that hang RE fan for a sequel. It's a thrill ride and a technical breakthrough.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of the Resident Evil universe but personally as far as the way that the concept has evolved and mutated away from it just being zombies and zombie dogs to strange biological mutations used in warfare to giants and what else do we have well... Not really much fan of that. I guess I am just old fashioned that way leave it at zombies not all this stuff that is just hard to buy into.I thoroughly enjoyed the first CGI animated Resident Evil movie Resident Evil Degeneration and I was thrilled when they announced this one to be released.And now having seen it I sit here feeling somewhat disillusioned. This was just too much remnant of the Resident Evil 4 game which I didn't enjoy that much. Plus there were no zombies in the movie at all. It was all 'lickers' strangely infected podpeople infected with something that looked like a mutated flower then making them look like zombies but they weren't! and giants. Giants! Are you kidding me. I could appreciate Nemesis but these? No way! They looked like cousins of the blue guy from Watchmen it was just ridiculous.Don't get me wrong Resident Evil Damnation is not bad not at all. It is an amazing treat for the eyes to behold. The CGI graphics were off the charts. There were so many great details in the scenery and on the characterscreatures. The movie is well worth watching a second time just to pay attention to the details in everything on the screen. And the animation of the characters and creatures was really great and very believable.The movie had a good amount of action and fighting which was very nicely choreographed. And the storyline was fastpaced and continuous although it was a bit shallow. It didn't really offer much new to the Resident Evil universe sadly.The characters in the movie were nicely portrayed and it was good to see some familiar faces revisited. The voice acting was also good which is really important in an animated movie. However I don't understand why these Slavik people weren't speaking in their native tongue. Why were everyone speaking English with a slight Eastern European accent? It is just like World War 2 movies where the Germans speak English with a prominent German accent it just doesn't work that great. Had they opted to have them speak in their native language and had English subtitles the movie would have worked on a whole other level.Now the bad things in Resident Evil Damnation was the lack of a deeper storyline. It was fairly shallow and didn't really offer much for anyone in the story to work with. And what was up with those giants? When I saw that I was ready to turn off the movie and find something else to watch. Nemesis was acceptable as he was a zombielike mutation towering over humans but these giants were just downright ridiculous. The worst flaw in the movie in my opinion was the lack of proper zombies as seen in the first three games. Resident Evil should have and not just zombielike podpeople.I had my hopes and expectations way up high for this movie and I was shot down hard because of a shallow storyline and laughable mutated creatures and the lack of zombies just appalled me. Sadly Resident Evil Damnation is not as enjoyable as the preceding Resident Evil Degeneration CGI movie.But if you are more open for various mutations and a deviation away from the original Resident Evil concept then I am sure that you will find Resident Evil Damnation to be rather enjoyable.The movie is well worth watching for the amazing graphics and CGI alone.".

The narrative follows a familiar structure to 'Degeneration' which comes across as uninspired especially the final boss fight which looks incredibly polygonal given the outstanding CG motion effects throughout.

The characters look so life like that you forget you're watching CGI characters.However some of the characters seem to have been nothing but wasted space as they did little or hardly anything new to the story. This of course not counting Leon and Ada two Resident Evil Legends.The voice work is good with creative writing and quotes however again some of the characters just feels out of place and made you wonder why they even were put in the movie in the first place.I'm not saying this is a bad movie but I'm not saying it's a great one either. It just seem Resident Evil Damnation was only made to entertain the fans which I am a fan of the series however this one just felt weak mislead and out of place in the Resident Evil world. If not for the weak characters in the movie it might have work it does have good action scenes but you can only do so much for a movie based on a hit series.I give Resident Evil Damnation an 6 out of 10".

The animation was really well done and that's saying something since this review is being written in 2017 for a CGI movie made 5 years ago.The animation is very realistic compared to other RE CGI movie that are more cartoonish. The plot is actually very engaging too! What impressed me the most is the intelligence of the characters. Even the faceless fodder bad guys were smart. They would communicate with each other and actually make smart decisions to try and stay alive. As a result when they died it felt more intense as they would die in a way that really seemed like there was no way to avoid death. I also had a few moments with legitimate jump scares which no CGI movie has ever been able to successfully achieve on me in the past.If you have played Resident Evil 4 you will be able to appreciate a few easter eggs related to that game. Like when Ada comments about the last time she saw Leon which was during RE 4. However there is nothing in the plot of this movie that requires you to have played any of the games or watched any of the CGI or live action movies. Everything you need to know for the sake of the movie is explained to you.There was also lots of action and a respectable amount of gore. Not on the level of a SAW movie but enough to feel the impact of it. I had paused the movie a few times just to admire the detail of how bad guys would be blow up or torn apart. There was also surprisingly a few adult sections with revealing cleavage that helped show the maturity of the film.For whatever cheesy parts that happen in the movie inherit of any video game CGI movie it is completely forgivable as it is greatly overshadowed by the entirety of the movie.This isn't a movie that you will spend days thinking about but it is a movie you will not regret watching.

	schema:headline " Better than Degeneration still not very good";
	schema:reviewBody "The CGI quality has improved slightly in motions and lipsync. It also feels far darker bloodier and grittier.The setting is more interesting as it takes place in a war zone located in a city. No more silly fluffy areas and annoying civilians running around.Voice acting is laughable especially for Leon. I mean come on it's like he didn't even care to perform.The story moves away from the style of the first three movies which was basically a zombie epidemic in a civilized area with some secret laboratories. It moves to the later trilogy where there are no innocents. The civilians are all hostile and in this case armed and dangerous plus the whole place is in the middle of a civil war.There are technically no zombies in this film but rather possessed people. The result is pretty much the same but surely it looks closer to tentacle monsters using human hosts.This time it is not so much about evil multinational organizations trying to take over the world with bioorganic weapons. It is a lot more about localized political intrigue and messages around terrorism and wars for natural resources. I must say it made the set up to feel far more realistic and interesting.Of course they hardly do anything smart with the whole thing. It's still gust a slugfest to the most part with the resolution being weak and almost anticlimactic. But at least it gives you the impression that the villains got away and almost won. It made it feel catchier this way.There are Tyrants as bosses. We can't do without them. Only this time they are mass produced and felt like they were beaten easily by mooks. Lame! Leon grows a goatee and looks even more badass now. Other than that he acts extremely uncaring and spouts lots of lame oneliners.No more of that bimbo Claire thank God. Now we get Ada Wong being badass manipulative and even taking part in a cat fight. Now that's more like it! Some rebels are in this movie and try to offer drama by mentioning how the stronger countries are manipulating them for resources and now that they resist decided to wipe them out. They could have made something interesting out of this but in just half an hour you stop caring about them since the plot is basically Leon walking around and killing mutants. Very weak presence and importance.There is a politician present again only this time it's not a weak fat clich asshole. This one was smart cunning strong and willing to do all it takes to have it her way. Yes she is a woman to boot.And then we have undead sort of. Closer to mutated bioweapons in the form of Crimson Heads and Lickers. And apparently this time they are controlled telepathetically by a human who acts as a bee queen or something. It was an interesting twist to the mindless hordes of monsters up to now but still complete mooks to the plot.Overall the second film had a smaller and more interesting cast though clearly in terms of coolness and not depth.It is surely better than the first less of a Romero ripoff and more of an attempt at delving into politics and conspiracies. It still remains nothing but a onetimer as it doesn't escape the tired Hollywood braindead action formula it is based upon while the short duration makes it impossible to feel anything for the war drama. Which is kind of a shame considering how it began in a very interesting way.".

	onyx:emotionText "The CGI quality has improved slightly in motions and lipsync. It also feels far darker bloodier and grittier.The setting is more interesting as it takes place in a war zone located in a city. No more silly fluffy areas and annoying civilians running around.Voice acting is laughable especially for Leon. I mean come on it's like he didn't even care to perform.The story moves away from the style of the first three movies which was basically a zombie epidemic in a civilized area with some secret laboratories. It moves to the later trilogy where there are no innocents. The civilians are all hostile and in this case armed and dangerous plus the whole place is in the middle of a civil war.There are technically no zombies in this film but rather possessed people. The result is pretty much the same but surely it looks closer to tentacle monsters using human hosts.This time it is not so much about evil multinational organizations trying to take over the world with bioorganic weapons. It is a lot more about localized political intrigue and messages around terrorism and wars for natural resources.

In 1996 he starred in RAGE a nonstop action movie with a very high concept premise. Injected with a deadly drug an ordinary man becomes a one man army. Hunting down the bad guys on the run from the cops and trying to get his normal life back  the film was stunt filled madness. 10 years later we have CRANK which is essentially a rehash. Albeit a big budget MTVstyle version. Our hero is still a Brit the location is once again Los Angeles but there are gangster movie connotations wild visuals and a tongueincheek tone you cannot take the name Chev Chelios seriously and I don't think you're supposed to which makes this a lively engaging ride which knocks Daniels' effort for six. The similarities between the two cannot be ignored but this is clearly the superior of the two. RAGE was the prototype but CRANK takes it to the limit with setpieces and jokes as silly as they are inventive. In addition there are connotations to films such as Tony Scott's MAN ON FIRE and DOMINO and Brit gangster movies such as Mike Hodges' GET CARTER and Guy Ritchie's LOCK STOCK and TWO SMOKING BARRELS which add to the thrills and keep us entertained. Much more restrained than CGIfilled action pantomime that was TRANSPORTER 2 CRANK is Statham's best star vehicle yet. He's a pure physical presence with a maniacal glint in his eyes. There are no Corey Yeunstyle martial arts scenes but it doesn't matter. The film is OTT but somehow grounded. The action is rough fierce. Statham's character is a relentless one man army in classic tradition. Young guys and longtime action movie fans are going to love this for its sheer vigour. With creativity in the genre previously limited to new twists on chases and fight scenes it's a real pleasure to see films such as CRANK ONGBAK and BANLIEUE 13 District 13 emerging. Not to be taken too seriously Crank is one of the best popcorn movies of 2006.".

It takes a marginally believable and undeniably awesome premise adds one of the brightest upandcoming action stars around stirs in some new ingredients that the genre hasn't really seen before and bakes until the final product rises beyond all expectations. The catch phrase a thrill a minute doesn't really go the distance to describe how ridiculously action packed this film is. A thrill every ten to fifteen seconds is more like it. First time directors Mark Nedveldine and Brian Taylor relentlessly bash you over the head with the action hammer. Their cinematography is manic and the style is reminiscent of that used by Tony Scott in Domino. It fits the pace of the film quite well.Jason Statham delivers to audiences the only thing he knows how to deliver and that is pure distilled ass kicking. That is his job and he is very very good at it. Make no mistake the film is very strongly 'R' rated. There is a bounty of flesh and a strong smattering of violence and drug use. Don't be thrown off by Amy Smart's name on the poster. Even though she does a fine job as Statham's on screen girlfriend Eve hers and every other part takes a deliberate and distant backseat to Statham's charismatic portrayal of hitman Chev Chelios. He also manages to wind more than a few threads of pretty solid humor into the performance. All in all its Statham's most impressive job in a leading role yet.In a nutshell the plot revolves around Chev Chelios poisoned by his employer after a hit went sour with a synthetic Chinese compound that blocks his adrenaline receptors. The only way for him to stay alive is to get pumped up and stay pumped up. Anything he can get his hands on to raise his adrenaline is fair game from drugs to energy drinks to raunchy public sex and more as he tears a path of carnage and mayhem through the streets of L.A. in search of the man who tried to kill him.Crank is everything you could feasibly ask it to be and more. The filmmakers take an iffy premise work their magic read 'good casting and direction' on it and produce reel after reel of pure adrenaline on film. It packs over the top action in with incredible stunts clever and biting humor a decent story and some above average acting. It's one of the most entertaining films of the year and may well be a career highlight for Statham. It's one of those films that you'll definitely want to go see with a bunch of the guys. What it lacks in depth it makes up for in pure fun and distilled manliness. A high 8 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Crank a fast paced clever and coolasHell adrenaline rush of a film!!";
	schema:reviewBody "I walked into Crank with low expectations as I do with many films. The previews made it look like it had a clever story but I was worried that with Jason Statham playing lead I might just get a rehash of his Transporter films.I got a pleasant surprise. From the very beginning the film moves. And moves damn fast. Not in an obnoxious way either. In the first minutes of the film we are set up with a possible story of corruption between hit men a botched job and the setup for the whole movie Statham's Chev Chelios being fatally poisoned with a Chinesemade serum that slows his heart rate and will eventually literally make his heart stop killing him. The only solution get the adrenaline pumping and keep his heart rate up! The whole movie is like one long action sequence with pauses for story elements. This is the common thing now in films but in other movies it generally doesn't work so well. But with the premise of Crank being the need for speed Literally the idea of allaction littleplot actually works. And works well.However don't be mistaken there is genuine plot in the film. Clever stories about the pasts and workings of crimelords and their cronies and how they all relate to Chelios. Some of it went over my head because of the constant action but I was able to understand everything enough to enjoy the film.The direction and editing is something I want to talk about briefly before I wrap this up. For a film like this one would expect flashy camera work and crazy fast cutting but I must say the directorwriter and the editor went beyond the call of duty. The film is shot as though the cameraman himself was the one who was poisoned with the camera flashing and moving around nearly constantly only settling during the slow scenes. Quite a genius use of camerawork to emulate the story. And the editing certainly adds a lot to the already excellent camera work. We get cutting when necessary and when not necessary to further illustrate the needs of the main character.Overall I would say Crank was the coolest movie I've seen in the last several years leaps and bounds beyond the standard Hollywood action flick. I would recommend to any actionfan or adrenaline junkie because take it from me this film is the ultimate rush!".

	schema:reviewBody "Crank was... Great. It's was what you hope it might be Cool fast and Jason Statham kicking butt and Rated R  It's great to hear Statham be able to go off. It was also much funnier than I expected and once I figured out the tone I was in for the ride. I should've figured out the tone when the movie started with an 80's classic song from Quiet Riot. Or when the director and writer spoke before the movie and thanked Jesus and then said something like Hold onto your seats it's going to be fckin great. This movie will probably be considered a cult classic soon. But it could be a huge box office success too. So here's my story I was invited to the Cast screening. My friend worked on the crew of Crank and I got a call Monday morning to go after another friend had to cancel  I'm always last to get the call but glad I did TD  So don't worry. I loved Snatch and I was probably more excited to see Jason Statham in the flesh than to see the movie. Well I was simply surprised. Jason was phenomenal. The movie was weird really good weird. The action never stopped and right when you were cringing from a needle or something gruesome you would be hit with something hilarious. It's was a great blend of action and humor. The writer obviously wrote this tongue in cheek. It was like he was making fun of other films. At least I think so. The movie was subtitled in a couple of random places and I found myself keeled over laughing when the Cab Driver was subtitled. The action really stood out. It was very violent and at times very real. The bad guy Verone also stood out. And I think Amy Smart did a good job playing naive. The movie starts with a bang and I was surprised that the bang held up to the final scene in the movie which I think was simply great. My heart is still racing a bit two days later. Yes it's that's good.".

This shaky hand camera effect is reused  throughout the movie adding to the perspective and helps one get  plunged in the movie.  The special effects are mainly car crashes and explosions but are  really well executed and very inventive. And the story well the story  isn't really what you seek when choosing to go see this kind of movies  but in crank the storyline is actually pretty good.

Then top that by having an intelligent plot that keeps you thinking and characters whose motivations and decisions make sense. Then top that by adding in some humor that doesn't blow the seriousness of the movie but adds some charm and  listen up Jet Li  originality to the stunts.But then pump it up with cinematography that unlike The Bourne Identity which didn't work for me makes the whole thing even more original and adds to the drama instead of being puffery. Then add Amy Smart yum. Despite the fast pace there is actually real chemistry with her as the love interest.Every action movie lover should go out and see this film immediately. It is everything that Snakes on a Plane which is cheesy and bad and I don't mean goodbad is not.Who should see this movie Action movie fans you might not want to bring your SO it's pretty hardcore with the gore and violence Enraged assassins with 2 hours to live I'll give Crank a 9 out of 10 the only missing point being that there's no real depth to the drama it's strictly just for the action.".

Jason Statham of the Transporter movies is a hitman who has a lethal Chinese poison coursing through his veins. If he slows down if his adrenaline level drops he drops dead. In his last moments he rushes to find his killer and others responsible snatching as many energy drinks and drugs as he can get his hands on along the way. This is some fun stuff and hilarious too. The editing is the MTVstyle of many modern action movies so avoid it if you can't stand that. I hope the directors who also wrote the script succeed even more so in the future.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a scene in this movie where the main character needs a boost of adrenaline so in the middle of chinatown he starts ripping off his girlfriend's clothing. She yells NO! NO! and he continues to rape her. She eventually gives in and starts liking having sex in public so it turns out to be okay.There is another scene where he needs a boost of adrenaline and the lead singer of Linkin Park tells him that he should snort tons of nasal spray. That it will make him high.I'm all about films that blur the line of good and bad. I'm all about films with characters that have questionable morality. But this film completely glorifies such horrible things with no sense of irony. It's told in the dumbest of ways with quite possibly the worst looking cinematography I've seen in a mainstream movie and editing that's not even worthy of mtv. There are people that cut quickly and do flashy things but here the effects remind me of something that would be on that show blind date.All of this could be forgiven if the action was good. But really all the action consists of are people running around holding guns. And every once in a while there's a loud noise with shaky camera work and quick cutting so you never quite understanding what's happening.It's just bad filmmaking with even worse writing. And Jason Statham's such a great actor his performances in Snatch and Lock Stock are terrific. I can't imagine why he'd say yes to such a subpar script. And none of his fighting talents are really showcased here either. I mean he rides a computer generated car sideways up an escalator. And every once in a while punches someone. But none of the grand choreography from the Transporter movies is even on display here.The filmmakers definitely have visual ideas. But none of them are actually there to tell the story or even help in the mood. I mean do we need to zoom in on a pigeon's chest to then go inside and watch it's heart beating? Not only is it poorly done and the effect terrible forget that it doesn't move the story forward if it's only intent is to look cool they completely failed at that and somewhat rips off what the more brilliant visual stylist Joseph Kahn did in his brilliant and underrated Torque.If you'd like to see a smart film that actually has an agenda and is also edgy rent Dan Minahan's Series 7. It's brutal uncompromising and violent but has one major thing that this film is lacking. Vision.".

It's told in the dumbest of ways with quite possibly the worst looking cinematography I've seen in a mainstream movie and editing that's not even worthy of mtv. There are people that cut quickly and do flashy things but here the effects remind me of something that would be on that show blind date.All of this could be forgiven if the action was good. But really all the action consists of are people running around holding guns. And every once in a while there's a loud noise with shaky camera work and quick cutting so you never quite understanding what's happening.It's just bad filmmaking with even worse writing. And Jason Statham's such a great actor his performances in Snatch and Lock Stock are terrific. I can't imagine why he'd say yes to such a subpar script. And none of his fighting talents are really showcased here either. I mean he rides a computer generated car sideways up an escalator. And every once in a while punches someone. But none of the grand choreography from the Transporter movies is even on display here.The filmmakers definitely have visual ideas. But none of them are actually there to tell the story or even help in the mood. I mean do we need to zoom in on a pigeon's chest to then go inside and watch it's heart beating? Not only is it poorly done and the effect terrible forget that it doesn't move the story forward if it's only intent is to look cool they completely failed at that and somewhat rips off what the more brilliant visual stylist Joseph Kahn did in his brilliant and underrated Torque.If you'd like to see a smart film that actually has an agenda and is also edgy rent Dan Minahan's Series 7. It's brutal uncompromising and violent but has one major thing that this film is lacking. Vision.";

	schema:reviewBody "What a disappointment. I really look forward to Jason Statham movies as he has all the tools to be a major action star. He is fit projects a great screen charisma and knows enough martial arts to allow for nicely choreographed fight scenes. But his movies continue to be weak. Well his previous movies seemed weak at the time but compared to this stinker they rocked.He may have jumped at this movie based on the script. I can imagine getting excited just reading the screenplay. The premise is not original by any means but still nifty he wakes up with a video love note from enemy gangsters letting him know that he has one hour to live due to a designer poison in his system. A nice touch was the video showing them administering the drug while he was asleep. There is apparently no cure but the death can be delayed by keeping his adrenaline up. The script then lends itself to what could have been nicely overthetop moments involving him starting fights he cannot hope to win having sex with his girlfriend in front of a cheering crowd of Chinatown onlookers mutilating himself with a waffle iron starting police chases and generally embarking on what the news station in the movie called a citywide spree of destruction.All of these scenes with so much potential were wasted in the unimaginative hands of director Mark Neveldine. He goes through every clichd tool available fast edits fast pans odd tilts slowmo etc. all supported by a fast generic soundtrack. Okay granted pretty much all action movies use these tools but in the good ones the directors use them imaginatively and well. Neveldine did neither. If the Cardinal Sin of any movie is to boring how much worse is it for an action movie to suffer that? The movie is barely workable. I don't believe it even lends itself to the enjoyment of picking it apart with friends. Statham does maintain his favorable screen presence but very little else. Amy Smart is not terribly attractive here. That's got to be the movie as she looks charming in other venues see The Best Man and Just Friends though she was outshined by Anna Faris in the latter. Efren Ramirez is always enjoyable including his violently brief role here. For much better examples of his talent see Napolean Dynamite and Employee of the Month.I'd really recommend a pass on this movie.".

Crank however was a ridiculous mess a waste of time and offensive on top of that. Jason Statham plays the same character he always plays. Everyone else in the movie is essentially an archetype. The portrayal of people of color and women is standard which is by no means a good thing. At one point Chev Chelios Statham's character pulls a Middle Eastern driver out of his taxi and yells Al Qaeda. Then a group of people viciously attack the taxi driver as Chelios steals his car. That scene is pretty representative of the film and its depth. There are a wide variety of racist portrayals and comments. Chelios forces his girlfriend to have sex public. She resists but then loves it and starts asking for more. Typical. There is plenty of the now common but still annoying and detractive product placement. The plot is barely worth discussing. Basically Chelios has been injected with a Bejing Cocktail a drug that slowly kills a person unless the person's adrenaline levels stay at an abnormally high level. So he has to do outrageous things to keep himself alive. At the same time he has to get revenge on the people responsible for administering the drug. The action sequences are okay. They aren't that impressive compared to say The Protector which is also in theaters as I write this and is considerably better. There ARE some good special effects and gore if you are into that. Now some might argue that the film is really a comedysatire. The completely impossible and outrageous ending would suggest as much. If this is the case the movie is better but not by much. It remains offensive and lacking. Plus it seems doubtful that the intention was to create a clever satirical film which actually poked fun at other movies starring Jason Statham but cast him as the main character also. Sure it's possible that the people behind this movie meant for it to be taken as big joke and I simply didn't get it but I sincerely doubt that. 1 out of 10".

	schema:headline " The Most JackedUp Joyride of All Joyrides!";
	schema:reviewBody "Freshmen writerdirectors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor's helterskelter cartoonish actioneer Crank qualifies as a violent liveaction Rrated equivalent of the Energizer bunny battery commercial with agile Transporter star Jason Statham displaying amazing resilience as he rants and raves across L.A. on a mission of vengeance to kill the villains that are trying to kill him. Neveldine and Taylor have penned and lensed an audaciously original firstperson style shooter video game melodrama. Crank will literally nail you to your seat with its runaway plot that updates the venerable Edmund O'Brien deathbypoisoning thriller D.O.A. 1950 with a nod to Jan De Bont's Speed 1994 where a bus wired to blow up will remain intact as long as the driver doesn't slow down. Nevertheless despite its homages Crank amounts to an entirely unusual exercise in energetic Dutchtilt camera angles enlivened considerably by its maniacal methhead editing Atarivideo game graphics Google map search inserts and a gallery of truly warped minority characters. From the first frame to the last Neveldine and Taylor ignore gravity and accelerate this epic into overdrive with gleeful abandon.A coldblooded professional hitman Chev Chelios intends to quit the paid assassin gig so he can live the quiet life with his girlfriend Eve Amy Smart of TV's Smith who thinks that he earns his living as a video game programmer. Sadly Chev realizes to his chagrin that he has picked the wrong day to pursue the straight and narrow. Our agile antihero awakens to discover that a vile Asian mobster has injected him with a lethal dose of synthetic 'scifi' Chinese poison. Indeed Chev watches with incredulity on his bigscreen television a DVD that nefarious Ricky Verona Jose Pablo Cantillo of Shackles made for him that shows the dastard administering a hypo of the deadly toxin to him in his bedroom the previous evening. Chev brought this all on himself because he iced an Asian mobster Don Kim Keone Young of Dude Where's My Car but the surprise is that Chev didn't whack Kim. Meanwhile Ricky boasts that Chev has no more than an hour to live. Chev destroys his television in a fit of rage and leaves a message for his disreputable doctor Doc Miles Dwight Yoakam of Sling Blade to call him back before an hour elapses.No sooner does Chev discover his predicament than he hits the road in search of Ricky. He calls his transvestite friend Kaylo Efren Ramirez of Napoleon Dynamite to put the word on the street that he is looking for Ricky. Next he storms in to see an AfricanAmerican gangsta Orlando Reno Wilson of Fallen who he believes is associated with the infamous Ricky only to learn that Orlando is looking for Ricky himself to collect 7 500 that the Asian owes him. Chev snorts some blow from Orlando and tears off in his car. At the Las Vegas airport Doc Miles rings Chev up and listens to his description of the poison The flow of adrenalin is what's keeping you alive Miles explains. You've got to keep moving Chevy he adds. If I'm right they gave you the Beijing cocktail. Miles continues with his diagnosis. It works on the adrenal gland blocks its receptors. The only thing you can do to slow it down at all is to keep the flow of adrenaline constant. Meaning if you stop you die. During this vital expository passage Neveldine and Taylor don't slow down the action. Instead the entire conversation occurs while the L.A.P.D. chases Chevy who crashes into a shopping mall to elude them and smashes through it with reckless abandon until he slams into the escalator and bails out for a cab. As cops swarm the mall Chev rides off in the cab plotting his next move.

	onyx:emotionText "Freshmen writerdirectors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor's helterskelter cartoonish actioneer Crank qualifies as a violent liveaction Rrated equivalent of the Energizer bunny battery commercial with agile Transporter star Jason Statham displaying amazing resilience as he rants and raves across L.A. on a mission of vengeance to kill the villains that are trying to kill him. Neveldine and Taylor have penned and lensed an audaciously original firstperson style shooter video game melodrama. Crank will literally nail you to your seat with its runaway plot that updates the venerable Edmund O'Brien deathbypoisoning thriller D.O.A. 1950 with a nod to Jan De Bont's Speed 1994 where a bus wired to blow up will remain intact as long as the driver doesn't slow down. Nevertheless despite its homages Crank amounts to an entirely unusual exercise in energetic Dutchtilt camera angles enlivened considerably by its maniacal methhead editing Atarivideo game graphics Google map search inserts and a gallery of truly warped minority characters. From the first frame to the last Neveldine and Taylor ignore gravity and accelerate this epic into overdrive with gleeful abandon.A coldblooded professional hitman Chev Chelios intends to quit the paid assassin gig so he can live the quiet life with his girlfriend Eve Amy Smart of TV's Smith who thinks that he earns his living as a video game programmer. Sadly Chev realizes to his chagrin that he has picked the wrong day to pursue the straight and narrow. Our agile antihero awakens to discover that a vile Asian mobster has injected him with a lethal dose of synthetic 'scifi' Chinese poison. Indeed Chev watches with incredulity on his bigscreen television a DVD that nefarious Ricky Verona Jose Pablo Cantillo of Shackles made for him that shows the dastard administering a hypo of the deadly toxin to him in his bedroom the previous evening. Chev brought this all on himself because he iced an Asian mobster Don Kim Keone Young of Dude Where's My Car but the surprise is that Chev didn't whack Kim. Meanwhile Ricky boasts that Chev has no more than an hour to live. Chev destroys his television in a fit of rage and leaves a message for his disreputable doctor Doc Miles Dwight Yoakam of Sling Blade to call him back before an hour elapses.No sooner does Chev discover his predicament than he hits the road in search of Ricky. He calls his transvestite friend Kaylo Efren Ramirez of Napoleon Dynamite to put the word on the street that he is looking for Ricky. Next he storms in to see an AfricanAmerican gangsta Orlando Reno Wilson of Fallen who he believes is associated with the infamous Ricky only to learn that Orlando is looking for Ricky himself to collect 7 500 that the Asian owes him. Chev snorts some blow from Orlando and tears off in his car. At the Las Vegas airport Doc Miles rings Chev up and listens to his description of the poison The flow of adrenalin is what's keeping you alive Miles explains. You've got to keep moving Chevy he adds. If I'm right they gave you the Beijing cocktail. Miles continues with his diagnosis. It works on the adrenal gland blocks its receptors. The only thing you can do to slow it down at all is to keep the flow of adrenaline constant. Meaning if you stop you die. During this vital expository passage Neveldine and Taylor don't slow down the action. Instead the entire conversation occurs while the L.A.P.D. chases Chevy who crashes into a shopping mall to elude them and smashes through it with reckless abandon until he slams into the escalator and bails out for a cab. As cops swarm the mall Chev rides off in the cab plotting his next move. He gets the cabbie to stop at a convenience store where he pilfers a supply of energy boostingoverthecounter medications and chugs a Red Bull.Chev takes a plunge with another gangster his boss Carlito Carlos Sanz of Backdraft who operates a West Coast crime syndicate in his penthouse swimming pool and plies him with questions about Ricky Verona.

Some will say it's unbelievable but it's not meant to be an accurate portrayal of life it's a very funny and totally action packed movie and leave your logic at the door and just enjoy the chaos and the comedy throughout the film.This is much better that 'Shoot Em Up' of the same year as it just enjoys itself and you can tell that everyone involved in the film just had a blast making it. The key to this film lies in the comical aspect to the characters dilemma such as realising he's injected himself with way too much synthetic adrenalin and has to run as fast as he can anywhere dressed in a hospital gown.Although very cheesy but memorable is the scene in the shopping mall where the car crashes and flips onto a moving escalator and comedy is to found in the very public sex scene watched by a bus of Japanese school girls. I think that 'Crank' is better than Statham's other famous vehicle 'The Transporter' as it makes no excuses for itself as a shameless addition to the thousands of action films out there.The best thing though about this film is the fact that it is a real live video game played out in a film.

Of course this may be a little dig by the filmmakers complaining that they needed more money to make a sequel and I hope more coins are inserted so that I can 'Play' the character of Chev Chelios againbring on the sequel.This is easily in my Top Ten Action movies ever because of the sheer entertainment value for lots of action and damn good laughs.

	schema:reviewBody "It's no accident that Crank is named after a hardcore narcotic and while I don't happen to have any personal experience with it myself I imagine that if the experience were made into a cinematic version it would look something like this movie. It feels like a fastpaced action movie boiled down to it's basest elements with pesky things like character and plot development mostly tossed out the window. Or out of the helicopter whichever looks better with a death metal soundtrack. A lesser movie however would have made such a simplified approach feel exploitative and cheap but Crank gives the feeling that such baggage would only slow things down which is just contrary to the whole idea. I can respect that. There is no setup we are immediately thrown into a lifethreatening situation where Jason Statham's character Chev Chelios stumbles out of a daze and finds a video left for him by a Hispanic gangster who gleefully explains that he has injected a Beijing cocktail of synthetic something or other. The details are not important what matters is that he now has an estimated hour or so to live until the drugs cause his heart to stop. The only way to survive of course is to keep his heart pounding and the adrenaline pumping through his veins. It's sort of like Speed except it's his body that can't slow down not a bus.And basically that's about all there is to the story. The premise is mostly an excuse for Jason Statham to run screaming through the streets and hospitals as it were of Los Angeles with a level of disregard for the law that by itself is enough reason to watch the movie. There is a part of the movie where Chelios is speeding down the street on a stolen LAPD motorcycle wearing nothing but a hospital gown and a gun. Try to imagine a situation which would lead to something like that and you'll have some idea of what your frame of mind will be like while watching the movie.My only real problem with the movie is Amy Smart's character who is written stupendously wrong. Chev Chelios is given some minute background as a contract killer for a widespread crime syndicate sort of like Arnold Schwarzenegger's character in True Lies but without quite so much government backing and his girlfriend is this airheaded blonde who thinks he's a video game programmer. Chelios is collected and focused even while drugged and on the verge of death. He concentrates a hardedged anger on his enemies and his girlfriend hiccups and grins like an imbecile when he tries to get her to get dressed and get out of the house before he drops dead on the spot. Are we going on a trip? she blurts.You get the idea. Their relationship is so wrong and so ineffective that it probably would have made more sense if she had been cast as his daughter instead. Then again that would mess up their scene in Chinatown but I'll leave that for you to find out about.The main villain a punk gangster curiously named Verona and yes he does invoke Shakespeare's name early in the movie is also wildly overacted for most of the movie but that's in fitting with the rest of the film. If he had delivered a subdued performance he would have looked totally out of place like the girlfriend who really serves no purpose other than to enter the film in her underwear and you know the Chinatown thing. There is of course some great humor in the movie which is to be expected in this kind of overthetop action comedy. It's brutally violent but knows when to slow down for a few laughs and many of the laughs are real. There is a great periodic interaction between Chelios and his shady doctor buddy played by Dwight Yoakam who is out of town and can only help over the phone but who calmly explains while on crowded planes and such that the fire in his chest and his steely erection are perfectly normal for what he's suffering from but that if he doesn't keep his adrenaline pumping he's gonna die. But for the most part Crank is a hard boiled action movie that is specifically designed to give directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor free reign to bombard your senses with every little trick they can imagine which includes split screens animated views of the pounding hearts of humans and pigeons alike car chases gun fights dazed point of view shots subtitles viewed from both sides and even a couple of shots where people that Chelios is speaking to on the phone appear on screen  once projected onto a nearby wall and once briefly in a sideview mirror as Chelios speeds down the street.Crank was made with a very specific audience in mind and for what that audience wants to see the movie definitely delivers. There will of course be plenty of people who will attack the movie for being shallow or exploitative or too violent or for having an ending that didn't wrap everything up in a nice little package or whatever but the fact that there is a Crank 2 coming up seems to answer the one big question that many people have had about the ending. Personally I didn't see how there was any mystery. The end of the movie fits perfectly with the rest of it. It's totally outlandish and preposterous but if you don't get a thrill from the last half second of this movie you missed something.".

Whatever girl in the movie Amy Smart's character fell for him as being some meanlooking video game programmer is a total bimbo and deserves this crazed maniac of a man. Jason Statham who's previous roles in The Transporter could've easily been played in this one is basically a guy's excuse to check out some dude who has it all nice furniture and underground goingson and it forced to figure out how to live however long he can with this Oriental serum in his bloodstream. And for actionfilm fans' sake he has to keep his adrenaline up like an extra in a Mountain Dew commercial on crack throughout the whole 88 minutes of filmtime.When did filmmakers decide that the machines should do all the work for them? I counted too many filters being used all the time too many cheap transitional effects from shot to shot too many boring shots of JS looking out of it and heard way too many corny sound effects a goat when JS laughs around the end? to forgive the filmmakers for this ridiculousness. If you're going to wear the action film jacket on the DVD don't sell me a comedy. But it was the directors' first film which means they shouldn't be allowed to make any more after this one. Someone should take their computers right out of their studios because they rely on them to make the shot better than their eyes do. Anyone seen Biker Boys? They were visual effects guys on that bomb too.The music was just annoying like something off a bad modern rock station even though it drove the film as if we are watching a long music video. The cinematography relied on Statham all the time in fact I got so sick of seeing him in almost every shot. Just like in Transporter when they had him sliding around in oil now they got his ass sticking out of a hospital gown and banging a chick in public...I question the image Statham is allowing himself to become.All in all never see the film. It's a giant commercial for manly actions with a poorly thoughtout gangster plot line for no reason. You will wish that the movie was made in the 80's so that rental stores will stop shelving this release for the public. What happened to cinema?".

	schema:reviewBody "Chev Chelios has just been poisoned with a strange drug that lowers his adrenaline and will eventually kill him. Unless he keeps his adrenaline up and being a super tough hitman he is not one to go out quietly nor get revenge on those that poisoned him.Jason Statham fits the role of the intense crazy ultracool badass Chev Chelios so perfectly that it's just amazing. Maybe he is being type cast from his role in 'The Transporter' but when you have a movie as exciting and awesome as this even he wouldn't care. Packing a terrific high octane direction that never lets up the tension nor the action this is possibly the best pure action film of 2006. From the getgo it's all about the action. Forget logic. Forget realism. Just hold on for an intense and amazingly entertaining movie.It all works because from the very first scene sets up the craziness of the rest of the film up perfectly. On a rough comparison you could say that this is 'The Transporter' meets 'Snatch' but that hardly does the film justice. It is not just a blending of two previous movies it is a adrenaline packed ride that is often only found on bmovies these days some of which are good some of which are not but they are just action films. And this is just an action film. Pure. Simple. And terrifically badass. It also features what may be be one of cinema's most hilarious sex scenes. 810Rated R for strong violence and profanity and for drug use".

Unless he keeps his adrenaline up and being a super tough hitman he is not one to go out quietly nor get revenge on those that poisoned him.Jason Statham fits the role of the intense crazy ultracool badass Chev Chelios so perfectly that it's just amazing. Maybe he is being type cast from his role in 'The Transporter' but when you have a movie as exciting and awesome as this even he wouldn't care. Packing a terrific high octane direction that never lets up the tension nor the action this is possibly the best pure action film of 2006. From the getgo it's all about the action. Forget logic. Forget realism. Just hold on for an intense and amazingly entertaining movie.It all works because from the very first scene sets up the craziness of the rest of the film up perfectly. On a rough comparison you could say that this is 'The Transporter' meets 'Snatch' but that hardly does the film justice. It is not just a blending of two previous movies it is a adrenaline packed ride that is often only found on bmovies these days some of which are good some of which are not but they are just action films. And this is just an action film. Pure. Simple. And terrifically badass. It also features what may be be one of cinema's most hilarious sex scenes. 810Rated R for strong violence and profanity and for drug use";

After watching the first few minutes I could see another Snatch or The Transporter or a combination of the two with a little Pulp Fiction thrown in.But after 20 minutes I was starting to get disappointed and after 30some minutes I hit the eject button and returned the film at the video store. What a piece of garbage! Talk about gratutitious. That's all this is  gratuitous violence sex language  all for the sake of style and shock? I guess.The story  if you want to call it that  was that a guy was injected with a poison with no known cure so he goes after his killer. By the way this is a ripoff of the 1950 classic D.O.A. but instead of the victim being a good guy trying to catch the bad guys  as that story was  this is just an excuse for a pigofaguy going after worse pigs. The good guy Statham playing Chev Chelios' has no respect for anybody or anything and really isn't any better than the slimy people he's after. Profanity also loses its impact when you use it every sentence too. I realize much of this excess of everything is there on purpose. I just don't think it worked. When you overkill things even on purpose you can overdo the overkill...and then it's not entertaining.I will say this after 30 minutes of this pure crap it made me appreciate much of the other films that are out there.".

The director is Kurt Hoffman and this is not one of his most or least known works. The script was created by a whole lot of writers based on a play and this is baffling as the film does not have a plot for almost the entire second half. The reason why this 1.5hour film is still not forgotten today is the very young Romy Schneider in one of her earliest performances. She is basically sharing the female lead role with Lilli Palmer and these two are also far more interesting than all the men in here. The film is in color already as always for Schneider and it has a touch of drama a touch of romance and a touch of comedy. Schneider's character is one that rebels against the rules of the grownups and this description fits her other works pretty nicely too also her careerdefining Sissi trilogy. But back to this one here The consequence of an argument is that she runs away to see the circus in town and pretty much the entire second half of the film is a circus show that lacks a plot completely though. Admittedly it is still not worse really than the first half. It is just never a good film at any point unfortunately but it shows again that the actually decent cast cannot make such a messy script work. I give it a thumbsdown. Only the very biggest Romy Schneider fans may want to giver it a go. It's actually fairly difficult to get a hand on a copy of this one here but don't worry If you don't manage to do so you really aren't missing much. Watch something else instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can remember when this film came out I was adamantly against seeing it. I had my preconceived notions that it would be some other heroic Jewish Holocaust film where good triumphs over evil and in between we would see some brutal atrocities committed by the Germans to add some flavour.How wrong I was.This is one of the best films I have ever seen and what it did to me I cannot describe in words. But in a nutshell it moved me made me cry made me feel like I was in the Polish ghetto in 1940 and ultimately made me kiss the sidewalks as I walked out of the theater and thanked God that I live in the free society that I do. Roman Polanski has proved that he is a great director with films like Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby but this is his crowning achievement. I think the fact that this won the awards that it did at this years Oscars goes a long way to validate the brilliance of this film. I believe that the Oscar's are rigged for the most part and films and actresses and such win based more on their pedigree or business associations than anything else so when it won best actor and director and adapted screenplay this year it tells you that it should have won best picture but the Weinsteins seem to have a spell over everyone hence a charlatan like Chicago takes top prize. Sorry for the digression here but when you compare a film like Chicago to a masterpiece like The Pianist there really is one clear cut winner. They handed out the statue to the wrong movie.The Pianist follows up and coming piano player Wlad Spielzman from his days as a local hero to a prisoner of war to his time in the ghettos surviving only by the kindness of strangers. I think many people have touched on this before but what makes this film so amazing and well crafted is because Spielzman is a man that we can all relate to. He is not a hero he is not a rebel and he is not a kamikaze type that wants and lusts after revenge. He is a simple man that is doing everything in his power to stay alive. He is a desperate man and fears for his life and wants to stay as low as he can. Only from the succor he receives from others does he manage to live and breathe and eat and hide. And this is how I related to him. If put in his position how would I react? Exactly the way he did. This is a man that had everything taken from him. His livelihood his family his freedom and almost his life. There is no time for heroics here. Adrien Brody embodies the spirit of Spielzman and his win at this years Oscars was one of the happiest moments I have had watching the festivities. His speech was even better but that is a topic for another time.Ultimately it is his gift of music that perhaps saves his life and the final scene that he has with the German soldier is one of the most emotionally galvanizing scenes I've witnessed. With very little dialogue it is in the eyes the face the mouth and the sounds that chime throughout their tiny space that tell you all you need to know. I think it is this scene that won Brody his Oscar. This is one of the all time great performances.I think Polanski spoke from the heart here. He has taken a palette of memories and amalgamated them with what he has read and given us one of the best films of our generation and any other. I think The Pianist will go down as one of the best films of this century and when all is said and done Chicago will be forgotten the way Ordinary People was forgotten and when people talk about the film The Pianist they will do so with reverence and respect. This is a cinematic masterpiece.10 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Man I can not get this film out of my head. It is so rare that a movie can affect me the way The Pianst did. The last movie that did that was Casino. I was really tired when I was watching the movie. It was almost midnight so I was thinking that I'll start watching and I'll finish it in the morning. Did I? No indeed I did not stop watching. I couldn't stop it. I just wanted to see what would happen next. I cried during Schindler's List I sobbed in this film. Everything that happens in this film is so sad. Adrien Brody does a remarkable job of acting in this film. I would very highly recommend this film. Especially if you are a history buff. Please I think this film should be in the top 10 best films of all time.I looked on the message boards you know and some other user comments that didn't enjoy this film much they criticized Adrien Brody's performance and say that he was boring and only showed emotions that are easy to act. Please you have got to be kidding me. This man portrayed the total feeling of hopelessness being alone being hated. I one time had an audition in high school like this to see if I could improvise and the way I imagined this feeling is like in dodgeball where you have no one else on your team and you're the only one left standing yet on the other team there is 20 big men that are just waiting to wack that ball at you. Adrien couldn't have done a better job I was so frightened for him and cried for him during the whole film while he was one the run.Roman Polanski as the director he himself escaped the terrors of being a prisoner in The Holocaust yet he lost his mother and other family members. Yes I'm sure this film must have been hard to re create for him but he was probably the only director that could have done this movie as brilliantly as he did. He created this story and made it so effective I called up my mom and told her that I loved her so much because we take so many things for granted. True this isn't the 1930's or 40's and we are in America. But it's still frightening to think that human beings are capable of that much hate and being so brutal to another human. World War II is one of the most frightening wars in history if you read more about The Holocaust you get more into it and you should. If you are not interested then watch this film. It's a must see otherwise how else will we learn from our mistakes? The Pianist is a beautiful and extremely dark tale about a man and the struggle to survive. The ending is so powerful and moving to know that sometimes one man can make a difference in a crowd of so many and I'm not talking about Adrien Brody's character. You'll see what I mean.1010".

	schema:headline " An astonishing film";
	schema:reviewBody "The Pianist is the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman at the time Poland's most acclaimed pianist whose life is transformed during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw beginning in 1939.  The film spans several years and maps his many personal trials in addition to providing the perspectives of his family rebel factions and sympathizers.Brilliantly directed by Roman Polanski and starring an amazing Adrien Brody The Pianist is bound to garner comparisons to Schindler's List for obvious reasons.  However similar the subject matter the approach is different. While Schindler's List was filmed in a beautiful crisp black and white that offered many incredible images The Pianist was filmed with almost muted color.  Schindler's List featured what has been argued as a complicated hero.  Oskar Schindler did save many Jews but not without battling his own materialistic demons first.  The Pianist's Szpilman is a sympathetic character throughout.  His plight was desperate and the demons he fought were over his own guilt in surviving a fight that eventually turns into a primal will to live.Polanski does not spare the viewer any grief with his film.  The horrific scenes between the Nazis and the Warsaw Jews were more terrifying and horrible than any horrorsuspense movie I have seen in some time possibly ever.  The humiliation and complete loss is wrenching.  In several scenes Jews are lined up in the middle of the night and subjected to either torture or death.  In one case a woman asks of a Nazi officer What will happen to us? and is promptly shot point blank in the head.  The camera does not flinch or subdue any of these atrocities.A mention must be made of Brody's performance.  Having only previously seen Brody in two other films Spike Lee's Summer of Sam and Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line a part that was supposed to be his launch into stardom before his part was unfortunately cut drastically I knew his potential was great.  After his Oscar win I viewed this movie with more criticism than I normally would have and he certainly did not disappoint.  He transcended my expectations.  His physical transformation was amazing but more importantly he conveyed the sorrow of this man shockingly well  in both verbal and nonverbal contexts.  It will be very interesting to see what kind of opportunities this role will afford him and the kinds of roles he will accept.Something worth mentioning is the affect this movie had on the audience with whom I viewed this film.  Normally when a film ends the regular hardcore filmsters like myself will stay and watch the credits in their entirety. The rest of the audience stands up and leaves usually to the chagrin of the remaining enthusiasts.  This was one of the few times I have seen a film at a theater where not one person stood to leave during the final credits. It wasn't until the house lights came up at the end did people begin to disperse.  Personally I hightailed it out of the theater the second the lights came on because not only was my face a mess from crying during the film Tammy Faye comes to mind but I had this overwhelming need for an emotional release so when I reached my car I sat and wept for about five minutes.  It has been years since I have watched a film that upset me to that extent. Conversely while discussing this film with my brother someone who loves movies as much and has similar tastes as I do he mentioned that while he thought the movie was excellent he wasn't as profoundly emotionally effected as I was.  After thinking about this for a couple of days I realized the difference The music.  As a classical music enthusiast and erstwhile musician the thought of not being able to enjoy much less play the music you love is a tragic one.  Then the emotional outpouring that comes when you return to it  there aren't words to describe how intense that is.  Not having the same appreciation for this musical genre one will be able to sympathize with the physical and emotional tribulations but perhaps not in the musical sense.The Pianist was truly an astonishing film.  I was riveted from start to finish and so emotionally affected that I couldn't even consider writing a review until a week later.  Having said that I am filing this away with my list of movies which include Schindlers List and Philadelphia as films that I love but cannot rewatch for a long time after due to their intensely emotional content.Shelly".

Instead the film gains in intensity by displaying the war from the pianist's own point of view through windows halfopened doors holes in the walls  with big emphasis on the use of point of view shooting by the cameraman. One cannot help feeling disturbed by the most enthralling scenes of the film as the isolated pianist tries to ensure his survival in the ghetto and ruins of Warsaw hiding and fleeing moving from one bombed house to the next gradually becoming a shadow of his former self hungry and afraid merit largely attributed to the extraordinary performance by Adrien Brody who visibly loses half of his weight throughout the film.Does the pianist raise any sympathy from the audience? Not immediately in my view. The pianist is more than often a drifting character almost a witness of other people's and his own horrors. He seems to float and drift along the film like a lost feather with people quickly appearing and disappearing from his life some helping generously others taking advantage of his quiet despair always maintaining an almost blank dispassionate demeanour. One may even wonder why we should care in the least about this character. But we do care. That is I believe the secret to this film's poetry.In one of the strongest scenes towards the end a German officer forces the pianist to play for his life in an episode that suddenly brings a much lighter beautifully poetic shade to the film this German officer will be probably compared to Schindler although his philanthropy does not quite share the same basis.This is also a wonderful tribute to Polish artists through Chopin's music with the concert at the very end of the film and the opening performance by the pianist at the local radio station with the sound of bomb explosions in the background forming an harmonious link between the beginning and end of the film following Polanski's usual storyframe.Overall The Pianist is one of the most detailed and shocking accounts of the treatment of the Jews by the Nazis with the atmosphere in Warsaw well captured and believable. Quite possibly The Pianist will remain in the history of filmmaking as the most touching and realistic portraits of the holocaust ever made.Polanski's film deserves a strong presence in the 2003 Oscar nominations including a nomination for Adrien Brody's amazing performance Polanski's sublime direction best adapted screenplay and obviously best picture. This could be at last Polanski's long awaited triumphal comeback to the high and mighty Hollywood.".

This could be at last Polanski's long awaited triumphal comeback to the high and mighty Hollywood.";

In my opinion it is one of the finest depictions of the holocaust. This movie came close to Schindlers list in depicting the horrors of Holocaust. Brody puts in a marvelous and utterly touching performance. The story depicts the emotional and cultural breakdown of persecuted Jewish community as Nazi policy tightens around them. Excellent acting by Brody.".

It's not easy to command the screen when your character often has to be passive deliberately trying not to draw attention to himself to keep from falling into Nazi hands in wartorn Poland but Brody pulls it off.  It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes plus his body language speaks volumes these fill in the emotional cracks especially in scenes where Szpilman alone and in hiding can't speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away.  Brody is the youngest actor to date to win the Best Actor Oscar BTW having gotten his little gold man only a month before his 30th birthday. While there's no lack of haunting scenes thanks to the deservedly Oscarwinning work of director Roman Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood the one that always gets me is the one where Szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest safe house' has a piano. We see Szpilman sit at the piano we see him in a headandshoulders shot shoulders moving we hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for music is about to give him away  and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize with both relief and a pang of regret that the music is only in Szpilman's head.  Terrific as the other 2002 Best Actor nominees were now that I've seen THE PIANIST as well as the fascinating makingof documentary on the DVD's flip side showing what a physically and emotionally grueling experience Brody's job often was I'd be really ped off if anybody but Adrien Brody had won! Besides the rest of the 2002 Best Actor nominees already won Oscars  this time it was dark horse Brody's turn! ".

	schema:reviewBody "Polanski has depicted the gory details of the holocaust without much restraint. But the most wonderful aspect of the film is that the director has not lost focus of his story and instead of focusing too much on the holocaust horror he has weaved the truelife narrative of survival around devillish happenings.Every single act of escapade Szpilman goes through is depicted like a drop of water on a barren desert. However the Oasis in the driest desert comes in the end and it is here that Polanski captures the essence of human emotion. I had this very strong urge of jumping into the theater screen and magically adopting a character in the movie and doing something about the helplesness portrayed so convincingly.Overall Polanski has given a stunning visual narrative of the cold war. Survival indeed is a privilege though it is taken for granted today. Performances by Brody Kretschmann deserve applause.Pawel Edelman's camera work is moving and he has brilliantly captured the dark sadness in the visual canvas in an effective way. The lighting is amazing. Predawn shooting schedule could have helped a great deal.Herv de Luze's editing work has ensured that the narrative does not slip away from focus. Most notable is the scene where the human bodies are lit on fire and the camera raises to show the smoke. The darkness of the smoke is enhanced and is used effectively to fade the scene out.The scene where Brody's fingers move as he rests his hands on the bars of the tram handle only goes to show the brilliance of Polanski as a filmmaker.Great film that will be in the running for this year's Oscars. I will give it a 9 Out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Pianist is an incredible film in many aspects. Roman Polanski's account of the survival of the pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman is a document about how one man can overcome the worst possible situations in a world gone completely mad around him.The only fault one can find with the adaptation of Mr. Szpilman's story by playwright Ronald Harwood is the fact that we never get to know the real Wladyslaw Szpilman the man as some of the comments made to this forum also have indicated.There is a very interesting point raised by the the pianist's father who upon reading something in the paper comments about how the Americans have forgotten them. Well not only the Americans but the rest of the world would not raise a finger to do anything for the people that were being imprisoned and made to live in the confined area of Warsaw. The exterminating camps will come later. What is amazing in the film is the frankness in which director Polanski portrays the duplicity of some Jews in the ghetto. The fact that Jews were used to control other Jews is mind boggling but it was a fact and it's treated here matter of factly. Had this been made by an American director this aspect would have never surfaced at all. Yet Mr. Polanski and Mr. Harewood show us that all was not as noble and dignified as some other films have treated this ugly side of war.  Wladyslaw Szpilman as played by Adrien Brody is puzzling sometimes in that we never get to know what's in his mind. He's a man intent in not dying but he's not a fighter. He accepts the kindness extended to him. He never offers to do anything other than keep on hiding which is a human instinct. He will never fight side by side with the real heroes of the ghetto uprising. His role is simply to witness the battle from his vantage point in one of the safe houses across the street from where the action takes place.Adrien Brody is an interesting actor to watch. As the pianist of the story he exudes intelligence. There is a scene where Szpilman in one of the safe houses he is taken discovers an upright piano. One can see the music in his head and he can't contain himself in moving his fingers outside the closed instrument playing the glorious music from which he can only imagine what it will sound in his mind.The supporting cast is excellent. Frank Findlay a magnificent English actor is the father of the pianist and Maureen Lipman another veteran of the stage plays the mother with refined dignity.In watching this film one can only shudder at the thought of another conflict that is currently brewing in front of our eyes. We wonder if the leaders of the different factions could be made to sit through a showing of The Pianist to make them realize that war is hell.".

In Polanski's movie all the conventional elements of the drama are at peaks of excellence Family union When a father has to bargain to buy a single piece of caramel and divide it in six pieces to share it with each member of his family...Starvation When a ghetto inhabitant assaults a helpless woman for a bowl of soup... Confusion When a distraught woman wails on a platform because she smothered the cries of her baby with her hand...Love When a young musician turns to his younger sister and utters with sad regret I wish I knew you better. Survival When one man observes the war through his hideouts around the city...Cruelty When an old man in a wheelchair is thrown off the balcony by the Nazis because he failed to stand upon their entrance...Fear When a talented musician sits down at the old piano and pretends to play his music keeping his fingers flowing with control above the vertical ivories...Discrimination When bored Nazi guards entertain themselves by forcing grotesquely mismatched old and sick couples to dance to a Jewish street band by the ghetto gate...Horror When condemned Jewish workers lie facedown in the street while one SS guard walks down the line shooting without remorse each one in the back of the head... Isolation When a fugitive emerges from his harrowing hiding place and walks through a field of deserted ruins exactly like the last man alive on Polish soil..Adrien Brody gives an absolutely moving performance based on descriptive facial expressions as the Polish composer and pianist who stays alive as a Jew and remains true to his ideals... Brody captures the character's desperation his anger and grief his willpower and perseverance his passion and love of music... Polanski gives us the chance to better know his shock and disbelief his ordeal and tragedy his hope for fairness and humanity...Nominated for seven Academy Awards this captivating drama went on to win three Oscars including Best Director Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay... Once Brody took the stage to accept his Oscar he was so overwhelmed with happiness that he swept the gorgeous Academy Awardwinning Halle Berry off her feet with a long steamy kiss...".

While Spielberg's rendition of German atrocities always had a slightly staged feel to augment their dramatic purpose here they are so true to life there impact is much greater  you watch and are being reminded in horror that this things actually happened.While being very hard to watch sometimes this is a movie that Schindler's List was supposed to be.

During this he narrowly escapes and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something ala in Cast Away this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish ChristiansJewish resistance or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips.  This is the kind of magnificent filmmaking that shows a director not only being as true to the story given to him that of Painist Szpilman based on his autobiography but to his past as well Roman Polanksi faced similar conditions as a boy in the early 40's and has found the best line to show never crossed or misstepped in representing the characters and the period. There aren't any hints of tightened suspense no clues as to where the film could veer to it just is.  The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler's List is not just in the people and situations Schindler's List was a film about two people Schindler and Goeth in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European.  And while the accents on the PolishJewish actors sounds a bit too British that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project thank heavens he didn't put in English speaking Germans.In conclusion Brody turns in a superb performance and this indeed is in with Polanski's best a deserved of 2002's Palme D'Or.  Great music too. A".

The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler's List is not just in the people and situations Schindler's List was a film about two people Schindler and Goeth in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European.  And while the accents on the PolishJewish actors sounds a bit too British that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project thank heavens he didn't put in English speaking Germans.In conclusion Brody turns in a superb performance and this indeed is in with Polanski's best a deserved of 2002's Palme D'Or.  Great music too. A";

Every aspect of the film is really done for an reason and in his place and you don't feel this as entertainment.the music is what hit me the most. the classical tunes had such an enormous impact on me and portrayed the feelings of the main role of the pianist. The fact that there are no hero's in a war movie is for me more than a welcome benefit. No war in the world should have hero's who can't die. Everybody in this movie can die every second of it. The scary moments are real scary.bottom line ten times as realistic as the also brilliant Schindler's list. and twenty times better than Saving private Ryan for the lack of hero's and there is no patriotism at all.ten out of ten best movie of 2002".

There have been equally brutal programs of ethnic cleansing in places like Southeast Asia and Rwanda in which hundreds of millions died but nothing like this in Europe since the Middle Ages. The victims here were not only Jews but Gypsies the mentally ill homosexuals socialists communists and political undesirables. The Nazis eliminated not six million but some uncountable number between 12 and 15 million. An event like that can't be treated lightly and milked for easy tears or the event itself is cheapened.Fortunately the films that have explored the subject have been uniformly well done as Roman Polanski's The Pianist is well done. Polanski himself suffered in much the same way as the protagonist Vlad Szpilman Adrien Brody. Polanski has a habit of embellishing his tales but there's no question that in this instance he knows what he's talking about.Szpilman is a wellknown young pianist on Warsaw radio but the German occupation puts the station out of business. He and his family are herded into the Warsaw ghetto where they are subject to constant abuse and occasional murder. Szpilman barely escapes being sent to Treblinka with the rest of his family. And for the last half of the film with the help of some friends who endanger themselves by lending him aid he scuttles ratlike from one hiding place to another each more dismal and perilous than the last. He suffers jaundice his hair and beard grow long his clothes turn to tatters his food disappears he's half frozen and he seems to shrink.He's reduced to living in the attic of a nearly demolished apartment building and is ecstatic to discover a gallon can of pickles overlooked on the top shelf of a kitchen cabinet. The can falls out of his hands while he tries to open it and rolls across the floor to come to rest at the boots of a German officer Captain Hosenfeld Thomas Kretschmann. The only Germans we've seen so far have been brutes  ridiculing the insane executing Jews who ask simple questions or simply shooting people chosen at random.We expect nothing from Hosenfeld except a quick shooting. But Hosenfeld is a human being and having discovered that Szpilman is  or rather was  a pianist he asks him to play a piano left in one of the flats. Szpliman has been unable to play for years and when he seats himself we worry that he might not bring it off and indeed his first chords are tentative uncertain. Then his playing becomes automated the old habits return and he dashes off a dramatic and exquisitely executed piece of Chopin. Hosenfeld has been leaning back enjoying the music then leaves Szpilman quietly to his attic. He returns a few times later before the Germans withdraw before the Russians and unceremoniously hands him a few packages of food and finally his overcoat. The matteroffact compassion shown by Hosenfeld and Szpilman's desperate need for contact with another human are very moving.When the Russian troops finally arrive Szpilman stumbles out of his hovel to greet them but seeing his overcoat the Russians open fire on him. Szpilman finally convinces them that he is a Pole not a German and one of the befuddled soldiers asks Then why the ing coat? Szpilman is trembling with fear but manages to gulp I was cold. An epilogue tells us that Szpilman went on with his career and Hosenfeld wound up in a Soviet prison camp where he died in 1952 despite Szpilman's attempt to find him. Under the end credits a smiling Szpilman plays a lively sparkling composition by Chopin.It's a remarkable film. Polanski is no longer the Wunderkind but a mature film maker. Nothing is excessive. We need only as much as we need to know to understand Szpilman's travails  one tragedy following another. There are no sentimental speeches at the final parting of Szpilman and his family. Szpilman himself never breaks down. He simply does what needs to be done to survive. And Adrien Brody captures what Szpilman must have been like. From some angles he resembles the young Arthur Rubenstein. Kretschmann gets Hosenfeld down pat as well. In their scenes together we sense their respective positions  one man with nothing left to lose the other with nothing left to gain. The story and the historical facts it's based on raise many questions about human nature of course. I'm not at all sure that if we could find the answers to those questions we would like what we found.One of the better films of the year.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Pianist is a movie that often gets bundled together with Schindler's List as being about the holocaust. But this is a misunderstanding a simplification even of this picture and of Schindler's List. It relates to the holocaust but it is not the story of the holocaust  it's the story of one man. Wadisaw Szpilman was an artist with great talent in his hands and his mind and in him is represented something very precious in humanity. He also appears as many such people really are someone to whom the music mattered far more than current affairs. As such he provides a unusual view on atrocity that of someone who rather than actively fight against it for the most part tried simply to exist in spite of it.This somewhat passive yet dignified stance is ably reflected in Roman Polanski's direction which has always been characterised by an excruciating intimacy with his subjects and a certain detachment from the world in which they inhabit. Here we see Szpilman glimpsing the war through windows and doorways yet often himself or his hands in closeup. But Polanski's boldest strokes of genius are in his creation and presentation of the ghetto and its inhabitants especially as regards how he draws our attention. The soldiers giving a cigarette to an elderly Jewish man and the couple fighting over a can of stew are foregrounded. Seconds later a corpse lies innocuously in the background. When Wadek's father is accosted by two Germans we see a couple of Polish women hastily get out of the way. When the shot changes to reveal the officer's back the focus is suddenly on his gun holster  it draws our attention to things that give a little extra breadth and context to a scene.Central to The Pianist is Adrien Brody's portrayal of the title character. It's an incredibly sedate performance with everything below the surface utterly commanding of our attention despite its understatement. His emotions seem muted  when reunited with a friend the merest ghost of a smile plays across his lips but by now we know the character and understand that this is a deep and sincere expression. Brody virtually carries the movie alone and one of the unfortunate things about The Pianist is that not one other performance stands out at all and the inadequacy of some of the supporting players does hurt the earlier scenes a little.But perhaps the greatest thing about The Pianist is in the fine construction of its story. Although most of it is based incredibly faithfully on Szpilman's own memoir the adaptation by Ronald Harwood gives it a certain dramatic course. There is one intensely poignant scene and one of the few entirely fictionalised episodes in which Szpilman is being sheltered by Dorota wakes to the sound of her celloplaying and just for a moment he can imagine what life would be like if she had been his wife. Finally the scene where Hosenfeld asks Szpilman to play for him seems to be the key to the whole thing. It's as if every moment every narrative line points towards that scene. We've seen Germans forcing Jews to dance for their entertainment which makes us first question Hosenfeld's motives. We've seen Szpilman's desperation to be reunited with a piano his fingers making keystrokes in the air. In retrospect this all seems a setup for that encounter. In effect The Pianist becomes a tale of a harrowing time filtered through the beauty of a musical performance.".

I've read many comparisons between The Pianist and Schindler's List on this board and even though the films are quite different the overpowering portrayals of Man's inhumanity against Man will leave the viewer forever affected. Adrien Brody's Best Actor award was stunningly achieved here as his character arcs through an incredible series of circumstances to barely survive life in the Warsaw Ghetto during World War II. What little I knew of director Polanski outside of his marriage to Sharon Tate the grisly Manson murders and his rape conviction in the late 1970's was put into an entirely different perspective when I learned about his own life in the Polish Ghetto. Much of what we see in the film must emanate from his own unique experience as a child during the War and experiencing Nazi atrocity first hand. I don't envy anyone who survived that experience enduring the painful daily memories of those times.Given the film's title I guess I was somewhat surprised by the paucity of musical sequences though what was offered was artistically presented. Particularly poignant was the scene when Wladyslaw Szpilman Brody was left to hide in an apartment where a piano was available and he mimed his way through a selection from memory by the need to maintain silence.Many years following the end of World War II a single film cannister simply marked The Ghetto was discovered revealing valuable insight into how the Nazi propaganda machine attempted to manipulate public opinion about 'rich' Jews who lived in luxury alongside fellow Jews in squalid conditions. Even more intimate details of life in the Warsaw Ghetto are presented in Shtikat Haarchion A Film Unfinished describing conditions that are even more horrific than those depicted in The Pianist or Schindler's List if that can even be imagined. These movies exist for a higher calling as a constant reminder that the term Never Again be one to constantly take seriously in an ever increasingly dangerous world.".

In one scene they even take time to play the whole piece of music without interfering. Secondly the actors in the movie none of them arewere really well known but WOW! for lack of a better word. Thirdly it's one of the few movies where you can actually watch the credits forever and wish the movie wouldn't end.Personally I think it's a perfect 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Pianist' is a bit like Schindler's List' as seen from the inside out.  The one flaw in that earlier film always seemed to be that by choosing to make a Gentile  Oskar Schindler  the protagonist in his film Spielberg turned the Jews themselves almost into background players in their own story.  That doesn't happen with The Pianist' since the hero in this case happens to be himself a Jew  the real life Polish pianist and composer Wladyslaw Szpilman  who managed through strength determination and the assistance of a number of brave and caring individuals to survive the horrors of that darkest and most inexplicable chapter in 20th Century history.This is not to say that The Pianist' is a better film than Schindler's List'  far from it.  For while this latest work from Roman Polanski is a fascinating tale of survival in its own right the film lacks the moral and psychological resonance that made Spielberg's work such a universally acclaimed masterpiece.  Because Schindler was an outsider looking in he was forced to make the kind of moral choices that Szpilman never really faces in the situations in which he finds himself.  In fact the one time that the protagonist is confronted with such an option  having to decide whether or not to betray his people by joining the Jewish police whose job it is maintain order in the Warsaw ghetto  Szpilman flat out declines the offer. This may indeed be the way circumstances played themselves out in real life but this elimination of any kind of psychological depth makes The Pianist' seem frustratingly superficial at times.Although the film isn't as rich and powerful as it might have been The Pianist' is still exceptional on a lot of different levels.  First of all Polanski and his screenwriter Ronald Hardwood both of whom won Oscars for their work here capture the brutality and sadism of the Nazi regime with frightening candor and almost reportorial' objectivity.  As in Schindler's List' people in this film die in very believable very graphic ways. Particularly interesting are the early sections of the film in which we witness the gradual steps leading up to the eventual deportation and extermination of the Warsaw Jews beginning with the curtailment of Jewish civil rights then to the branding of them with stars of David on their clothing then to their imprisonment in the Warsaw ghetto and finally to the inexorable walk to the gas chamber.  The Pianist' doesn't take us that far on screen but we sure sense the presence of those death camps in the loss of Szpilman's entire family.  The Pianist' brilliantly recreates this shameful era in recent human history and does so without becoming sentimental and pretentious in the process.  Adrian Brody won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance here and he is very good indeed especially given the fact that the role calls for him to be more of a reactor to the events around him than a catalyst.  Polanski and Hardwood have provided this fine young actor with a veritable tour de force assignment that he executes with a great deal of skill and aplomb. Unfortunately a number of the other characters  particularly those who go out of their way to help him  remain stubbornly enigmatic throughout.The Pianist' is an honorable addition to the list of fine films that have attempted to come to grips with the subject of the holocaust.  But for my money the best still remains The Shop on Main Street' the Oscarwinning Best Foreign Language film of 1965.  This superb Czech film does what The Pianist' is never quite able to do which is to find a way to involve us in the momentous moral dilemmas that undoubtedly faced many of the people involved in this lifeanddeath event.  The Pianist' by making its tale strictly a story of survival and not a study of human psychology fails to illuminate much of what we really need to know about that time. And about ourselves.".

Neither of us had any expectations and figured if it won a couple of Oscars it must be decent. I had no idea it was an absolute masterpiece. This may be one of the best movies I have seen to date. Days after I saw this movie I cannot stop visualizing the images and feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. The cinematography is breathtaking. The beauty of predevastation Warsaw is sharply contrasted with the bleakness of the ghetto and it would be understatement to say how haunting the visuals of Warsaw after the bombings were. The acting here is tremendous. Brody who I had really not seen in anything else significant prior to this carries the entire movie on his wan shoulders. He conveys so much with pain anguish hope and loss with just his eyes. It is quite the actor who causes the viewer to feel the pain he is experiencing as a character. This was an extremely well deserved acting Oscar.This movie is extremely depressing considering the subject matter but it is told and portrayed with grace and power by Polanski. So many scenes are powerful and haunting. To me in many ways this is a perfect movie. Yes I know this review is filled with hyperbole but I simply cannot remember the last time I was so moved and impressed by a film as I was with the Pianist. See it at least once.".

	schema:headline " Sobering Depiction Of Warsaw Under German Occupation";
	schema:reviewBody "The first thing that should be said is that this is most definitely more than a Holocaust movie. Although that dreadful event stands firmly in the background this movie is really about one man's struggle for survival. The one man is Polish Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. Adrien Brody played that lead role and he played it well. Szpilman comes across as both pitiful in his desperation to survive but at the same time as noble in his desperation to survive. Brody portrays him as a man with great dignity. It was a challenging role because as the movie progresses there's less and less dialogue for the simple reason that almost everyone except Szpilman has been taken by the Nazis. Brody ends up playing long stretches without voice but it doesn't stop him from rendering a brilliant portrait of the man whose friends and family are gone and who simply tries to live day by day hoping for a way out of this madness. Just as haunting are extended scenes in which director Roman Polanski simply shows us a devastated Warsaw  not just the Jewish ghetto but other parts of the city as well. The scenes of rubble the scenes of innocent people being gunned down in the street by German soldiers  sometimes just for sport without any other obvious reason the scenes of burned out buildings. It's all haunting.For all that  and all that was very good  there was something about the story that didn't really click with me. For some strange reason I found it difficult to follow and I did think that at almost two and a half hours it was a little bit too long. As much as was accomplished in that running time could have been accomplished in two hours flat. It's a good movie but just failed to reach the level of greatness that some have assigned to it. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "The Pianist is not a movie made for entertainment. It's either more or less than that and only the viewer can decide. You have to ask yourself sometimes if the main reason films about the holocaust are so popular is because of shock appeal. If a movie depicts these terrifying events well does that make it a good movie? The Pianist has many scenes showing the Nazi's brutality that feel almost voyeuristic. Some scenes show Adrien Brody's character looking out the window at these terrible things and you feel as if you're looking out a window too.I hope shock appeal isn't the reason this film is liked so much though. Because this is an amazing story about the will to survive. Music is the character's passionand throughout his struggles he can only fantasize about playing piano. There is one scene near the end in which he finally gets the opportunity. What follows is a touching moment that transitions from rusty skills warming up to an intense and passionate display of artistic talent. In this moment there is no longer a war going on no longer the agony of hunger or memories of lost loved ones just beautiful music. His reputation as a musician and his desire to go on to play again is essentially what keeps him alive. And who says art isn't important?Adrien Brody is very good in this. Well obviously he is he just won the Best Actor Oscar. I think he can be compared to Tom Hanks in Cast Away even in scenes of silence there's just something about the actor's movements and expressions that keeps you engaged.There's another scene near the end that defines the entire performance the entire movie for me After all the trouble Brody went through trying to survive he is almost killed by the people who would save him. He is wearing a coat that a German officer had given him earlier and when Russian troops spotted Brody they thought he was German. They shot at him and almost killed him but they finally found out he was Polish. An officer asks him Why the fcking coat? Brody with his hands still in the air a terrified look on his face almost crying replies I'm cold. That did it for me.The Pianist is certainly a shocking and even depressing film but like most movies that aspire to provoke thoughts and emotions the audience takes out of it what they bring in to it. Surely Szpiellman wasn't just a lucky bastard who survived in times of inhumane brutality. It was through the kindness and compassion of others who helped him if only because they found themselves inexplicably moved by his music.My rating 1010".

The end.Szpielman seems strangely unaffected by the horror unfolding around him. He witnesses various atrocities sees his family get deported and watches 2 executions and a cremation yet his facial expression never changes. He goes from starving before liberation to playing the piano on the radio afterward with no explanation of what happened in between. And why does a man in hiding pull aside the curtains to watch a shooting outside?I'm not afraid of a film where most of the action is internal like The Hours but this film has almost none of that. We get no clues about what Szpielman thinks or how he feels about anything. Schindler's List and Life is Beautiful convey the horrors of he Holocaust much more effectively including their effect on the survivors. The Diary of Anne Frank tells a much better story about life in hiding.To those who say Holocaust movies are needed as long as there are Holocause deniers I can only say this there literally hundreds of Holocaust movies out there. If a small number of people are still denying the existence of the Holocaust making another 100 movies isn't going to convince them.".

	schema:reviewBody "So this film has won the Palme D'Or? I didn't see any reason why...The film is well executed in its use of the usual Hollywood visual clichs rendered in a more European style. A fusion of the worst of Hollywood and the worst of Europe. The result unfortunately is even less than the sum of its parts. I am extremely concerned by the lack of any real ideas beneath the thin veneer of story. I felt that the film rubbed my nose in one awful even after the other while presenting only caricatures or often no characterisation at all of the participants and victims  especially the German characters. So we have caricatures versus caricatures without a caricaturist's sense of humour or insight.I found these caricatures quite obscene  they obscured the fact that the Germans who committed such atrocities were ordinary men and women  not merely evillaughing monsters. That European Jews who survived this period went on to murder and torture Palestinians and reproduce the exact same ghettos imposed on them for every year since 1945 is testament to that. I wonder if I'd win the Palme D'Or by switching the roles and making a film about the Israeli organised Chatila massacres or atrocities by the Israeli Army in the West Bank? The result is that the real power of the film was completely lost in the process of presenting the facts of Szpilman's experience of that period. I found no insights in this movie  either into artmusic nor the Holocaust and certainly nothing about Szpilman. Is it true to fact in its unrelenting depiction of atrocities committed? I didn't care anymore after 30 minutes. I am no historical revisionist so after the 4th violent atrocity in the first section not only these acts but the whole film became silly and patronising. A far more unsettling and profound film about evil art personal responsibility and racism from this period is definitely Istvn Szab's Taking Sides. It leaves Polanski's film far behind in every filmic and intellectual aspect.The Holocaust compels us to think and act even if entirely beyond comprehension. In this regard Polanski's movie is both bland and abhorrent.And no I don't mean that to be a complement.".

Their best films like this one offer a combination of levity social criticism and black comedy which is extremely appealing and unique. That said Monicelli and Risi would never have done such great films without great actors.

Amidst the horrors of war there's a strong criticism of war in general and also of the way the soldiers are treated by their own country.

The battles are bloody chaotic situations when it shows Giovanni and Oreste watching a bombardment in the distance we share with them the relief we're somewhere else. We rejoice when they think their way out of a dangerous situation and commiserate with them over fallen friends.And like the best war movies La Grande Guerra manages to show the best of mankind.

Monicelli who does not get a single mention in the Wonders In The Dark 3000strong list! belongs with other notable Italian film directors like Pietro Germi Elio Petri Dino Risi and Ettore Scola whose work had long been unjustly overshadowed by the big five namely Antonioni De Sica Fellini Rossellini and Visconti. Bestknown for his classic starstudded caper spoof BIG DEAL ON MADONNA STREET aka PERSONS UNKNOWN 1958  a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar contender that is still my favourite among his films and possibly my favourite comedy not in the English language period!  but THE GREAT WAR that was equally recognized by the Academy is probably his masterpiece. Winner of the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival  tied with Roberto Rossellini's WWII drama IL GENERALE DELLA ROVERE starring Vittorio De Sica both here  over such superior titles as Otto Preminger's ANATOMY OF A MURDER Kon Ichikawa's CONFLAGRATION and Ingmar Bergman's THE MAGICIAN both 1958  and at the David di Donatello awards Italy's own equivalent of the Oscar it is still underrated enough to have been given a baffling  rating by Leonard Maltin's Film Guide  where incidentally its running time is given as 118 minutes rather than the full 137 minutes  and the nonEnglishfriendly Italian 2Disc Set which after missing out on it a couple of times on TV over the years is how I eventually watched it on the centenary of WWI no lessalbeit jettisoning the supplements altogether due to time constraints is still its only home video release worldwide. The film's constant veering between drama and comedy requires some initial adjustment from the viewer but it eventually reaches an exquisite seamlessness. Leading man Vittorio Gassman had been renowned for drama up to his revelation as a comic actor in the aforementioned BIG DEAL ON MADONNA STREET conversely his sparring partner here Alberto Sordi was popular for his own comedy vehicles prior to this indeed Sordi would again go to war in two notable subsequent films Luigi Comencini's similarly bittersweet EVERYBODY GO HOME! 1960 and the more typically comic THE BEST OF ENEMIES 1961 costarring David Niven. THE GREAT WAR is an impressive Dino De Laurentiis production notable for distinguished cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno's sinewy tracking shots along the trenches and Mario Garbuglia's awardwinning expansive sets. The film also offers a showy role for De Laurentiis's actress wife Silvana Mangano as the proverbial whore with a heart of gold who possibly bears Gassman's child interestingly this is just one of several GassmanMangano teamings that included the starmaking BITTER RICE 1949 and the epics TEMPEST 1958 and BARABBAS 1961. To portray the colourful supporting characters that make up the irrepressible duo's comradesinarms an excellent cast of familiar character actors was dutifully enrolled Bernard Blier Romolo Valli Folco Lulli Livio Lorenzon Tiberio Murgia returning from BIG DEAL ON MADONNA STREET Ferruccio Amendola and Gerard Herter.Considering its significant length it is understandable that the film follows an episodic structure but is decidedly replete with memorable vignettes new enlistee Gassman bribing 'veteran' Sordi to avoid joining the Army in the opening scene Gassman and Murgia's punishment for waking up late in the barracks is to have their hair completely shaved off Gassman and Sordi asking their chaplain the way to the local brothel and he points them to Mangano's modest but highly popular dwelling Amendola being constantly hit by the barracks' door whenever it is opened to herald a newlyarrived army bigwig on a moraleboosting tour of the trenches cultured Valli being pestered by an illiterate private to write love letters to his beloved and read his mail and eventually having to lie to him when the local priest replies that she has married a rich old man a messenger is killed when delivering a note from HQ that only wished a Happy Christmas to the troops which causes the muchloved and usually wellbehaved Lulli to throw a cup of brandy in his overzealous young superior' face Murgia is constantly waxing about his love for famous actress Francesca Bertini but when he does actually receive word from her he tears up the letter after yet another casualtyridden assault on their trenches Gassman and Sordi giving their money collected for an intended visit to a whorehouse to Lulli's asyetunaware widow whom they chance to meet at the train station  subsequently joining a band of soldiers partying there amongst themselves with a minimum of girls to go around Gassman and Sordi are continually volunteering for missions to shirk trench duties and often save their lives in the process this stretch of good luck catches up with them at the end when the remote outpost they have ventured to is unknowingly abandoned by their army and they find it occupied by the Austrian enemy when they wake up the following morning this leads to their heroic death when they refuse to divulge attack plans to Herter followed by the film's sublimely ironic closing sequence where their longsuffering sergeant Lorenzon complains that these two ne'erdowells have once again managed to have it the easy way cutting to an image of their lifeless bodies and back again!".

	schema:reviewBody "Winner of the 1959 David Italy's equivalent of the Oscar Award for Best Film shared with Generale della Rovere. Winner of the 1959 Venice Film Festival's Golden Lion for Best Film also shared with Generale della Rovere. Alberto Sordi was voted Best Actor of 1959 for his performance in The Great War by the Syndicate of Italian Film Journalists. The Syndicate also voted Garbuglia's art direction as the best of the year. Nominated for the 1959 Award for Best Foreign Film The Great War lost to Black Orpheus. COMMENT For the most thrilling and effective use of genuine CinemaScope it's hard to go past Mario Monicelli's La Grande Guerra. In this exceptionally lavish recreation of WWI Italian battlefields Monicelli never allows a single square foot of waste space to appear on his screen. Instead his images are constantly crowded  almost always with men ragged men jostling men cheering men fighting men slaughtered men training men retreating men advancing men hungry men weary men stupid men brave men victimized men dead men. Vast columns of marching men are stretched across the screen thousands often forming just a distant background to the forefront knockabout. Monicelli's idea was obviously to fill his screen to bursting with overflowing action. Somehow he has managed to persuade the producer to open his purse and spend more money on soldiery than Selznick did on Gone With The Wind. Just as the overwhelming hideousness of it all is beginning to lose its power Monicelli skilfully pulls off a lastminute twist that drives home the film's firmly pacifist message with uncommon force. I'm not a fan of Vittorio Gassman especially not Gassman in boisterous mode as here  well cast though he may be. But Sordi is ever appealing. Miss Mangano is saddled with a conventional and unlikely characterization which she plays with spirit if not conviction. Folco Lulli effectively repeats his Wages of Fear vignette. Blier's performance seems tired but the Italian dubbing of his dialogue makes it difficult to judge. The other players are unknown to me but all these minor roles were credibly cast with Elsa Vazzoler especially compelling as Bordin's wife and Gerard Herter suitably menacing as the Austrian captain. It's true that the 140minutes version does seem just slightly too long towards the twohour mark though as said interest is cleverly lifted soon after. The problem is what scenes to cut? Those that could easily be removed with little loss of continuity are often the most effective and affecting. Personally I'd take out Gassman's first long scene with Silvano Mangano  but no exhibitor in his right mind is going to do that!".

Not an original message but your treatment of this theme was unique.Vittorio Gassman is such an amazing actor. In India someone who looked like him would never play a loser.

	schema:reviewBody "Theme song Porque te vas was a huge hit in Europe in 1976 and appealed even to people who didn't understand a word of Spanish. Actually many people went to see this movie because of the song. As a film I found it rather austere and difficult to understand if you are not familiar with Spain's recent history so I am amazed by the generally good reaction of the public to it.1976 was the year after Franco died ending a 40year period of civil war and dictatorship which makes Cria Cuervos a historical marker in Spanish cinema. Actually Spanish cinema had until that date been rather poor very far surpassed by the Italian one but this situation has lastingly reversed since that date. In 1976 the political future of Spain was still unclear and this is maybe why Saura remains so allusive.Action is taking place in the early seventies when Franco was still around. It is centered around 10 year old girl Ana the second of three daughters. Her father is is a military which is no innocuous detail in the context of the Franco regime. Her mother is dead but keeps appearing to her as a ghost and talks to her while Ana remains silent. What is going on is a bit unclear because very much like in Bunuel movies reality and dream are hard to tell apart. We don't know if Ana poisons her father who has affairs with mistresses but what is certain is that she imagines that and that he dies too. A symbol for Franco's death?After their father's death the girls are fostered by a rigid aunt who tries to get their affection but fails. Ana is a silent child obsessed by death. She plays with poison spends a lot of time playing with a doll in an empty swimming pool. She also talks to her mute grandmother in a wheel chair and asks her at one point if she would like to die. As the grandma nods positively Ana offers to help her dying but the grandma recoils. There is always a grandmother character in every film by Carlos Saura.Like in many Saura movies each character seems to incarnate an aspect of Spanish society. The father most likely represents the Franco regime the mother would be the murdered Republic the grandmother is probably a reminder of old Spain before the Civil War and the children Ana especially seem to be the symbol of Spanish youth uncertain about its place and future.The title refers to a Spanish proverb  Feed the ravens and they will tear your eyes up. Does it mean that the Spanish dictatorship did not trust its own children? Possibly why would there be a dictatorship otherwise?The ending scene is powerful as the girls go back to school after the holiday. We see a crowd of children in white blouses walking up the stairs of a high building towering over Madrid while the theme song plays out loud Because you are leaving. A vision of future? Looks like it. And who is leaving? Franco? Tempting guess but the movie lets many questions unanswered.Geraldine Chaplin who plays Ana's mother was by then the wife of Carlos Saura and as she learned speaking perfect Spanish she played in several of his movies. As for Ana Torrent she was at the start of an important career as she has remained a major actress in Spain as an adult.".

The techniques in the film are very modest but it's amazing what the director does with them. I liked very much this sad and quiet girl. The scene where her pet dies and she buries him is so solemn and heartbreaking. I felt sad about the old Grandmother who watches the old pictures in sadness. I also liked Geraldine Chaplin she is very good in this role her intimate bond with the daughter and how she looks at Ana with sadness when the girl doesn't notice it. The scene where the girl imagines her mom combing her hair is mesmerizing. Maria's pain is very palpable.By the way I found some interesting information about this film. Geraldine Chaplin was dubbed in the episodes where she plays the grown Ana. It was done because the actress has a slight British accent which is not annoying or too prominent for me at least but the point is that she plays a grown girl and it would be rather weird if a grown person acquires an accent in one's mother tongue if this accent did not exist during the childhood. So it was an intelligent consideration of the director.I recommend this movie very much.".

But the camera maintained the same distance and the story was fundamentally allegorical.

	schema:headline " Simple but labyrinthine. Truly fantastic.";
	schema:reviewBody "A perfect sister film to one of my absolute favorites Spirit of the Beehive. It also stars Ana Torrent and has similar themes. And I like it probably as much. Torrent three years older but looking pretty much the same plays the middle child of three girls. At the beginning of the film their father has just died. Their mother played by Geraldine Chaplin died a while back. The film is told through the mind of Ana who is still mourning her mother and she often sees her. It can be confusing at the beginning. Chaplin also appears as the adult Ana who narrates some of her thoughts or possibly as what Ana believes she will become. This is very ambiguous. The girls' aunt Paulina is now taking care of them. The duty was kind of forced upon her and while she's trying her hardest it's taking its toll. She's stern and not well liked by the girls especially Ana. There isn't much plot per se and what little there is shouldn't be ruined. We often see Ana's imagination and memories come to life. We see her witness fights between her parents. Later on she reenacts them with her sisters. The film is about what children observe how they interpret it and how they act on those interpretations. The film also has political ramifications subtle ones that are pretty difficult to grasp. The title is the beginning of a Spanish proverb that goes Raise ravens and they'll tear out your eyes. Like Spirit of the Beehive the film depicts a child experimenting with her own cruelty and violence. Supposedly this is all a criticism of the Fascist government Franco had just died by this point so his regime was just on its way out. It's a very dense and fascinating movie. You'd probably still be swimming through its mysteries on a hundredth viewing. If you thought possibly that Ana Torrent was not acting in Spirit of the Beehive this will set you straight. Her blank soulful expression is here in full force of course but here you see the slightest smile creep across her face and you can just tell exactly what she's thinking. I'm afraid I've done an awful job reviewing Cra Cuervos. I haven't expressed how touching it is when dealing with Ana's loneliness there's a scene where she dreams that her mother pops into her bedroom to tell her a story that's just heartbreaking or how it often straddles dark comedy like the scenes between Ana and the maid. I think that difficulty in reviewing it shows just how layered and confounding the film is. It shoots right up my favorites list. It's easily the best film I've seen all year. Bravo to Criterion for bringing this one to DVD. Hope they also get to Saura's La Caza sometime in the future.".

Ana is a melancholic girl fascinated by death after seeing her mother having a painful death and her father dead in bed.Cria Cuervos is a beautiful and sad movie of Carlos Saura that can be watched in two levels in the first plane it is a film that recalls the style of the family dramas of Ingmar Bergman. However in a deeper level the story is actually a metaphor of the recent Spanish political history and each character represents a segment of their society Ana's father represents the military dictatorship of Franco her dying mother the republic her grandmother those who miss the republic Ana is probably the youth with a sad childhood surrounded by deaths. The conclusion is a message of hope for the people. I believe that those familiarized with the Spanish history would find many other elements but in both levels this movie is wonderful. The title is a reference to the Spanish proverb Cra cuervos y te sacaran los ojos which means Raise the ravens and they will remove your eyes. Ana Torrent shows her amazing talent in the beginning of her successful career. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Cra Cuervos Raise Ravens".

	schema:reviewBody "I agree with some other reviewers I think this might just be my favorite film of all time. The contrast between literal reality and imagination is beautifully portrayed. I found the way Saura plays with distance esp at the end to be perfect. The recurrent view of chicken bones is a deft touch. The acting by Ana Torrent is the best acting work by a child that I have ever seen. Geraldine Chaplin is awesome as is her Spanish and the scenes between mother and child are painfully tender. As someone who works in the medical field I also found the scenes of the woman with the lockedin stroke to be very true to life. The song porque te vas is perfect catchy pop and sad all at the same time. I saw this with my mother in Paris in 1976 and we both walked out irretrievably altered by the film.".

	schema:headline " Sensitive as well as thoughtprovoking picture starred by an extraordinary little actress  Ana Torrent";
	schema:reviewBody "Sensational film that dispenses a brooding plot and considered to be one of the best Spanish films  in fact was voted one of the best Spaniard film by professionals and critics in 1996 Spanish cinema centenary . Well directed film by Carlos Saura  including his own story and screenplay  who tried to create an enjoyable flick plenty of symbolism and metaphor by tackling a description about a particular family formed by three little girls  their stiff aunt and grandmother . This slowmoving and intelligent picture is well set in Spain of the 70s  in Madrid the orphan sisters Ana  Irene and Maite Ana Torrent Conchita Perez  Maite Blasco are raised by their spinster aunt Monica Randall after dieing their mother by a painful illness  and living together their silent and wheelchairbounded grandmother . Melancholic Ana is traumatized after viewing death of her daddy Hector Alterio  in bed and painful disappearance her mum Geraldine Chaplin who married Carlos Saura  and she drifts into her own fantasy world . The fragile  single little Anna dreams of meeting her mom and she is obsessed by death . Sensitive film full of feeling  haunting moodpieces  wonderful images and sense of wonder . However  it turns out to be some claustrophobic  being mostly filmed at a Madrid mansion and brief outdoor scenes in Quintanar Segovia Castilla y Len . This extraordinary flick spells through intricate patterns of frames  sets  sound and color . The title in Spanish stems from the phrase Raise ravens and they'll pluck out your eyes  the equivalent phrase in English would be you reap what you sow. This film was notorious in the years of the Franco's downfall dictatorship including provoking and polemic issues and played by known and prestigious actors as Geraldine Chaplin  Monica Randall and Hector Alterio . In addition  a magnificent support cast such as German Cobos  Mirta Miller and special mention to Florinda Chico as a likable servant . His style is pretty much dry in the atmosphere as in the fresh dialog  as well as realistic  and including fantastic elements as when appears the ghost mother . Cria Cuervos is one of Saura's undisputed masterpieces and fundamental in his filmography where shows efficiently some peculiar characters and shot at the height of his creativity in a period cultural difficult where the enormous censorship of the political regime exacerbated the ingenuity and imagination of the scriptwriters . Splendid  luxurious photography with juicy atmosphere by Teo Escamilla who along with Luis Cuadrado are considered to be two of the best Spanish cameramen  both of whom worked for Saura . Interesting screenplay by the same director based on a original story . Moving and emotive musical score by Federico Mompou and of course the unforgettable theme song Porque Te Vas sung by Jeanette that was an enormous European hit  and appealed even to people who didn't understand Spanish language . This touching picture will appeal to Spanish films buffs  being deservedly nominated for Golden Globe  and another 8 wins  3 nominations . Rating  Topnotch and outstanding movie  worthwhile seeing .The motion picture perfectly produced by magnificent producer Elias Querejeta was stunningly directed by Carlos Saura  a good Spanish movies director. He began working in cinema in 1959 when he filmed Los Golfos 1962 dealing with juvenile delinquency from a sociological point of view . He subsequently made LLanto por Un Bandido 1964 starred by an European allstarcast . Saura is a well recognized filmmaker both nationally and internationally and in proof of it he won many prizes among which there are the following ones Silver Bear in Festival of Berlin for Peppermint Frapp 1967 and the successful La Caza 1966 that also won numerous prizes in International Festivals and in which four characters facing each other and terminating into a jarring burst of violence . Saura achieved Special Jury Awards in Cannes for La Prima Anglica 1974 in 1973 and for Cra Cuervos 1976 in 1975. Also the film Mam Cumple Cien Aos 1979 got an Oscar nomination in 1979 as the best foreign film and it also won the Special Jury Award at the San Sebastian Festival. He subsequently made Deprisa  Deprisa based on facts about juvenile delinquency in Spain since the 80s  as he tried to take a position in favour of outcast people and he got to make a both lyric and documentarystyle cinema . In 1990 he won two Goya  The Spanish Oscar  as best adapted screenplay writer and best director . Saura became an expert on Iberian musical adaptations as Carmen  Amor Brujo  Bodas De Sangre  Sevillanas  Iberia  Salome  Fado Flamenco  and even recently Opera as Io  Don Giovanni".

It is unbearably painful for a child to lose their most beloved and close person in the world to miss them enormously to try to come to terms with their loss to make sense of it. It is hard to live during the time of historical changes in your country even if you live during the time of peace when the devastating wars are over and your family belongs to the privileged ones. Is childhood really a happiest most innocent brightest time in life of a person or is it confusing scary sad? Or both? Is a child who honestly wishes her caregiver dead a little psycho or is she innocent and the wish is her way to cope with the reality that her beloved mother would never again smile at her kiss her and play piano for her and nobody would ever substitute her however hard they try? I kept asking all these questions while watching the truly beautiful dreamlike absolutely nonsentimental serious yet optimistic and darkly funny film Cria Cuervos aka Raise Ravens or Secret of Ana writtendirected and produced by one of the Spanish most celebrated filmmakers the favorite director of Luis Bunuel Carlos Saura. Nine years old Ana Torrent a delicate little girl with the huge sad dark eyes that look directly in your soul and see something way beyond this world is IMO one of the most memorable and touching children actors I recall. Continuing with the theme of her fascinating and unforgettable debut at 1973 Spirit of the Beehive she gives in Cria Cuervos performance of the life time as a little girl who creates the fantasy world where death has no power over her love for her dearly departed mother. Cria Cuervos is an amazing must see movie. Very much can and has been said about its complexity and symbolism and analogies with the real changes in the political and social life in Spain at the time. I just want to add that it is a perfect sublime movie made by a very talented and intelligent director about complexity of the times of childhood that could be happy yet very sad.".

Although most Europeans are familiar with this film I have never met one person in America who ever saw or even heard of the film.  What a shame.";

	schema:reviewBody "A quietly brilliant film Cra cuervos is a touching and funny but profoundly serious meditation on the end of the Franco era. Clearly there is a wealth of material in the basic metaphor of children growing up around dysfunctional and disingenuous parents. Carlos Saura goes out of his way to make a more ambivalent film though. The children are not on the cup of adolescence but buried in the depth of childhood  the only conventional passage is that of the denouement which shows the girls on the way back to school. Within the film there is all manner of quietly teasedout misdirection and surrealism the constant overlay of Ana the child and woman and the same with her mother dead and alive a child's plainfaced obsession with death which simultaneously she fails to really understand a plate of chicken's claws ominously preserved in a fridge.So there's the meditative oddity of Jodorowsky but also the child's eye perspective of Bergman Fanny and Alexander was yet to be made though. I think the most affecting thing may be the monopace of the camera and editing which never rushes to artificially stimulate the drama. That's left to the story as seen and told by Ana. Ana Torrent in this role is fairly miraculous composed but engaged in almost every frame usually in closeup. Geraldine Chaplin is also wonderful as the motherolder Ana maintaining the opaque gaze of a Spanish woman at the heart of the injustices of Franco's warped society. An economical uncomplicated poetic film of lasting power. 810".

	schema:headline " A criminally overlooked classic of Spanish cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "As yet unavailable on DVD in the UK this brilliant Spanish classic is now back on the big screen in a beautifully restored print. Thirty five years after it was made Cria Cuervos is by and large just as potent and relevant as it was when first released.There is a scene quite early on in the film where a young girl called Ana and her two sisters walk into their aunt's bedroom and start playing with her makeup and wardrobe rouging their cheeks and applying lipstick in copious amounts. I think at that point almost everyone in the screening tried to hide a sardonic smile.However it is not for its ironies when seen in the present day that we remember this film most. We remember it because it offers us something we very rarely see in cinema an honest sincere evocation of childhood and the gradual warped loss of innocence. That is the premise of dozens of films I realise but seldom is anything like this achieved movies of this type are either cloying and sentimental or else sensationalised and melodramatic. Neither obtains the poignant sense of disquiet that 'Cria Cuervos' generates.The film begins with Ana losing her father. Her mother we quickly learn died a few years ago and Ana is left an orphan. She and her two sisters are sent to live with their aunt  a fundamentally kind but authoritarian guardian who Ana yearning for her own mother instinctively rebels against. We follow Ana's story from the time of her father's death to the end of the summer holidays after which she will start school with her sisters.This I hasten to add is a very simplified desiccated overview of the plot. It is a film packed with nuance and subtlety. We learn that Ana's father was in fact a soldier under Franco's regime and had at one time fought alongside the Nazis. In one of the most memorable scenes in the film Ana finds her father's gun still loaded leading to a tense scene with her aunt and her aunt's lover.Ana is a fascinating child. The eagle eyed film buff might remember the actress who plays her from 'The Spirit of the Beehive' another Spanish classic which deals with similar themes albeit in a different way. Most striking are those large brown eyes of hers Ana is a quiet observant child disturbed by her brief glimpses into the adult world gradually accumulating as she grows older. How much does she understand? Obviously when Ana grows into an adult and narrates the story through flashback hindsight will let her comprehend the things she has seen. But what of when she is younger? The answer is largely subjective. The film draws many comparisons between Ana's grandmother and the young Ana herself  the old woman is paralysed in a wheelchair. She is capable of hearing and seeing  and understanding the things other people say. But she never says anything. Whether this is part of her affliction or a conscious choice is left deliberately ambiguous. What we can see is that Ana sympathises with her grandmother and a gentle compassionate relationship evolves between the two.I could go on. Perhaps the most impressive thing about the film is the way it seamlessly blends fact fiction and memory so beautifully and precisely without ever losing sight of its ultimate goal indeed this very blending lends the film an incredible authenticity. Ana feels isolated and alone  her fantasies from the shocking to the seemingly banal are desperate and painful. The opening montage as well of a collection of family photographs is extremely subtle and masterful in the way it has us beginning to formulate questions and suspicions  some of which are assuaged some of which aren't.What a treat this is for any film fan! Carlos Saura the director was of course one of the great opponents of the Franco regime while also rated as one of the most important Spanish directors of the 1970s. This is probably his most well known and powerful film. Childhood can be a frightening confusing and sad time and Saura with what is arguably his masterpiece has captured that beautifully. Don't miss!".

There is social commentary an astute condemnation of the Franco regime and the patriarchal hypocritical repressive social system that he imposed. Filmed when cranky Franky was on the deathbed and released immediately after he succumbed this film is an enlightening indictment and a reminder. It portrays the old the repressive and the new and the differences between them. The film is also just a brilliant piece of artwork. It is slowlypaced revealing its prizes and drama in a slow sad buildup. It is overall subtle something which should be highly prized. Franco and the evils of fascism and patriarchy are not standing around in masks shouting out slogans. No they are not in your face. They are covertly placed and symbolically represented. Ignore them if you want but recognizing them enriches the experience of the film. Of course simply enjoying the film simply for its aesthetic and narrative beauty is very much sufficient. The acting is phenomenal. Childactors are problematic things but Saura and crew managed to extract astounding pure talented acting out of the young girls as well as the other actors. The protagonist of course stole the show. Doleful beauty is the most deeply affecting thing there is.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ana Ana Torrent a sadeyed little girl of about eight years old unable to sleep overhears a conversation as she walks down the stairs to get a glass of water. The voices coming from her father Anslemo's Hector Alterio room are exchanging expressions of mutual love. Ana hears the gasp of a man's voice crying that he is suffocating and then silence. A woman that she recognizes as Amelia Mirta Miller the wife of army officer Nicols Germn Cobos her father's best friend hurriedly leaves the room and heads for the front door her blouse still unbuttoned. When the girl goes into her father's room he is dead. She calmly takes the almostemptied glass of milk next to his bed and washes it in the sink then carefully puts it back on the kitchen rack.It's title derived from the Spanish proverb Raise ravens and they'll take your eyes Carlo's Saura's haunting Cria Cuervos is a masterful insight into the mind of a little girl traumatized by the death of both of her parents. We see events from Ana's perspective and its fragmented view of an imaginative but angry and resentful child is a mixture of fantasy and reality that is often hard to separate. The film is also seen by some as an allegory for the mindset of the dying days of the Franco dictatorship. Whether it is viewed as a political statement or not Cria Cuervos' evocation of the painful memories of a child whose grasp on reality is fading is masterful and deeply moving especially given Ana Torrent's heartfelt and authentic performance.Ana is one of three sisters. The older one is Irene Conchita Prez and the younger one is Maite Maite Sanchez. The little girl has visions of her mother talking to her giving her advice about staying up too late and reading stories to her in bed. Ana deeply longs for her mother Geraldine Chaplin who died of a painful illness before her father passed away. In voiceover we hear the adult Ana also played somewhat confusingly by Geraldine Chaplin recalling her memories from childhood and she has little good to say about them saying that she remembers it being interminably long and sad full of fear. The children are now under the care and protection of their Aunt Paulina Mnica Randall who lacks warmth and affinity and some have compared her haughty nature to the authoritarianism of the Franco government.As a result the children are much closer to Rosa the family maid who talks to them about family secrets even though much of what she says goes over their head. Also living with them in their country estate is the girls' grandmother disabled and unable to speak who loves to look at family pictures on the wall trying to recapture her fading memories of the past. The girls play at being adults. Irene puts on her aunt's bra and does her lashes. Pretending to be her father Irene draws a moustache on her face while Maite wears high heels. Ana puts on lipstick as they act out their version of memories recalled from the many arguments they heard between their unfaithful father and their depressed and anxious mother.The motif of death runs throughout the film. Ana believes she poisoned her father and fantasizes about also killing her aunt. She even mixes some baking soda in her aunt's milk thinking it is poison. In one sequence Ana looks down a busy Madrid street from her roof and pictures herself jumping to her death. The children also play hideandseek in which the one whose hiding place is discovered has to pretend to die and remain dead until Ana offers a prayer to her guardian angel to revive my sisters. Although we are somewhat buoyed by the scene of the end of the summer with the girls going back to school we are left to wonder whether the family's cynicism and negativity will carry over into the children's adult life. The adult Ana's voiceover heard without any context is not promising.".

However if they're good friends they will just think you've got simply the best taste on Earth and you care about the good films. In any case this film is just a treasure and yes this film was shot during Franco's times but it could be filmed now and still would have gotten the same structure and an atmosphere of weirdness excellence tragedy suffering mysticism innocence lust and mystery you breath while watching Cria Cuervos. Ana is just a terrific character sometimes you don't know it's a kid a creature a woman. You end up realizing it's just a kid has been living stories that do not correspond to her short age. Ana's relationship with her mom is a mixture of intense love intelligence and somehow creepy love. It's just exquisite the combination of feelings and antifeelings the director draws for his characters. Ana plays with her dolls becausesheisakid but at the same time she keeps poison just in case though she knows why she keeps it. You see her innocent face but it's also a face of decision and character of a woman that it's still a kid. The main song of this classic movie is Por Que Te Vas and it becomes pretty much a hymn rather than just a song especially when it's played for the last scene... you can't no love this scene and its music! Cria Cuervos is just marvelous and undoubtedly a unique piece of art.".

	schema:headline " A beautiful film.";
	schema:reviewBody "This gorgeous film can work as something of a companion piece to the sublime 1973 Spanish film Spirit of the Beehive also starring wideeyed girlwonder Ana Torrent. It tells the tale of a a group of three young girls whose parents both die in separate incidents. They are put into the care of their Aunt who doesn't want them to dwell upon their tragic experiences. The story is told through the perspective of Ana an imaginative and rather morbid girl who tries to understand the complicated adult world and the authority figures that surround her. She believes that she murdered her father with poison and that her mother visits her in the night. The film doesn't really have any other narrativeit's more of a glimpse into the life of a young girl's summer after experiencing tragedy. Due to this unconventional structure it can be a bit slow and frustrating at times but if you stick with it you might find it to be a rewarding viewing. It's an exceptionally beautiful film and like Spirit before it it is never condescending to its lead character. The film is also a fascinating sociopolitical commentary on postFranco Spain and is rich with symbolism and metaphor much of which I probably didn't catch upon first viewing. However if you don't have a working knowledge of Spanish history the film does a fine job as a family drama.".

After watching the video I knew I had to watch it. I did some research first to see if it was worth my time. And it was. From what I found many had said it was just a drama movie and what not. Until I watched the movie and realized how deep it actually is. While watching it I realized the little girl was curious about death. Another thing I didn't know was that the entire movie was a flashback which makes it much better too. The way she stands there and looks at everything going on in the world she didn't acknowledge any of it until she was older and retelling of that summer. Now the movie is in Spanish but there is an English version on YouTube if you look up the English title Raise Ravens you can find it. Just a warning that the English voice over isn't completely correctly translated and the voices don't match the characters well at all but there isn't that much dialogue in the movie anyways so it's easy to get over. But if you get the chance I say watch this movie. It will stick with you like it has with me.".

Peekay makes frequent visits and meets Geel Piet an inmate who teaches him to box. Geel Piet spreads the myth of the Rainmaker the one who brings peace to all of the tribes.

	schema:reviewBody "The Power Of One is based on a novel by the very talented Bryce Courtenay. The sequel novelTandia which picks up right where The Power of One left off is equally moving and compelling reading.I am promptly going to go out and read everything else he has written. Both The Power of One and Tandia have moved me beyond words. I am a white South African girl who spent 19 years of my life in SA. I led a very privileged sheltered childhood growing up in South Africa. I was just 15 when apartheid fell apart. My parents were not racist and in fact my father dedicated his life to working as a doctor in a very poor area but I still  unbelievably never really had a very clear picture of the horror of apartheid until Mr Courtenay outlined it so vividly in these books.as I said I was sheltered as a white childI feel extraordinarily blessed and lucky to have directly avoided the violence and sickness that invaded my country for so long just because I was lucky enough to be born with white skin. I now live in the States but South Africa will always be home. I wept most of the way through both books. I have never been so moved in my life.Mr Courtenay summed up perfectly the collective guilt that white South Africans must carry with them forever more for our people's legacy of hate and brutality and oppression Even if we ourselves are not guilty  our people are guilty.He also of course inspires us to believe that one person can make a difference and that sanityjustice and compassion can win in the end even if the fight is long and hard.For those of you who think the characters are too stereotyped in some aspects you are right. Not all Afrikaaners are the evil racist villains that are portrayed in the books . However I certainly encountered people growing up with unbelievable racism fear and hate who do match some of the characters in the book.So there is truth to his characters also. I have no doubt that the brutality was accurate. One only has to look at historical events in SA history to confirm that. Thank you Mr Courtenay for your wonderful gift and for sharing it with the world. As for the movie I must admit it has been years since I happened upon it on television late at night. I do remember being quite swept up in the film but then being disappointed with the direction they chose to take it in. A Hollywood ending on what could have been a remarkable African movie.I do understand that film is a completely different medium and changes were necessary to adapt the book to film. Still I cannot help being disappointed with some of the changes that I deemed uneccessary such as the changing of Peekay's name from the wonderful mysticalThe Tadpole Angel or onoshobishobi ingelosi to The rainmaker Come on! That's lame! The rainmaker?!That has none of the same feeling the other names invoke.The addition of the girlfriend just to give Peekay a love interest is unnecessary fluff and her character not well developed enough to warrant such an addition.Nonetheless the film is still worth seeing. I must say that I truly do hope that someone else remakes this and does a better job.Tandia would make a fantastic film also. I am going to buy a copy on DVD and rewatch it and the post my thoughts here after refreshing it in my mind. I highly recommend reading both The Power Of One and Tandia to all interested in the history of apartheid in South Africa or just those looking for a good drama and a fascinating stories with strong characters.Even if you hate to read and are intimidated by the thought of reading such large books just start I guarantee you you won't be able to put both these books down!If you haven't seen the film or read the books I guess you should watch the film first. Otherwise you will be sorely disappointed and outraged at all the negative changes and you won't be able to truly enjoy the film for what it is a nice attempt at an adaptation of a marvellous book.".

So much so that my fianc took me to our local cinema during a festival to see the film in 92. For those that have read the book all I wanted to know was how were they going to do the chicken scene? However for those of you that haven't read the book the chicken scene did not matter. For once a film is so fantastic that you cease to compare it to the book. I enjoyed this film in a cinema with fewer than fifteen people in. I laughed and cried and it was so sad that no one had made the effort to come and see this masterpiece. Years later when I talk about the film people say  Oh it's the one about the boxer but it is so much more. If you think this is a boxing film think again. It is a film about love about being different  about perseverance and about not only wanting to make a difference but doing so. It shows that you may be a small fish but you can make a difference to the world if only you believe in yourself. Morgan Freeman is just fantastic in this film. As is Stephen Dorrf. For Morgan it is on par with Shawshank Redemption and beats performances in anything he had done written by James Patterson. I was so chuffed recently when seeing Enduring Love with Daniel Craig I realised he was PK's enemy Jaapie Botha in the film from 13 years ago. I am lucky to have The Power Of One on video and I wait for the day when it is released again on video or DVD and I can purchase it for friends to watch. You cannot watch this film without getting something positive out of it. I have since parted with the chap I first watched the film with but have married a man born in South Africa who appreciated this film as much as me. I only hope and dream that one day we together we will make a difference. If we touch on PK's achievements I will feel I have succeeded.".

The last part of the Novel is just as great as the first. If you liked the movie or at least the first part read the book it's worth it!To sum it up I believe The Power Of One had the potential to be an outstanding picture.

But unfortunately somebody tried to write an american ending for an african story and couldn't have failed worse.";

Also his mother does not die and Peekay does not stand for Peter something something or whatever it was.  In the book it has a special meaning and the film failed to highlight this.  He also does not gain the scholarship to Oxford.  The film failed to portray Peekay they way the book intended him to be.  Since peekay was around 6 he has dreamed of being the welterweight champion of the world. The film totaly missed this out. It missed out alot of the things that happened to him during his upbringing which molded his charcter.  Of course the film could not include all of these but I felt they missed out a few of the important ones.However I did give this film a 8 out of 10. If we take away the book the film is great.  The actors are superb and it moves along at a good speed. Dorff and Freeman are excellent.".

	schema:reviewBody "CautionMinor Spoilers ahead John Avildsen could be considered the most interesting director of his generation if only for the huge range of quality among his films and the fact these differences seem to have little correlation with his level of experience. His best films include Joe one of his first efforts Rocky several years later and this film late in his career. Mixed in between these high points are some moderate successes Lean on Me and Save the Tiger and some total dogs Neighbors The Karate Kid WW and the Dixie Dance Kings and Rocky V. It is hard to believe that it was same person you either have to credit Avildsen with the 'courage' to take on even the most hopeless of scripts or with such financial desperation that he had to take anything that came his way. With Avildsen the 'courage' angle willing to attempt something without fear of failure and able to bounce back after failure is the more likely since courage is the recurring theme of most of his films the solitary individual pitted against the oppressive and dehumanizing forces of the 'status quo'.This is certainly true of 'The Power of One'. Bryce Courteney's book had that same theme and the film adaptation preserved it. Critics of the adaptation and lovers of the book complain that this is about the only thing that Avildsen preserved. While they are technically correct their complaints are rather silly because the books were basically unfilmable at least commercially and film is a different medium making comparison illogical anyway. While all adaptations contain many elements of a story there will be omissions and changesparticularly with a novel like Courteney's. Those who complain that this adaptation was incomplete and inaccurate probably complained that 'Clueless' was an inaccurate adaptation of Jane Austin's 'Emma'. The point is that a movie is a movie and a book is a book. Actually this film was a blending of Courteney's story with Stephen Covey's 'The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People' with the main character having to move from dependence to independence private victory before he can become effectively interdependent public victory and influence others. As someone said earlier 'The Power Of One' despite ending with a statement proposing a bland union of absolute conviction is not expansive but rather interior in its meaning. And this is indeed the paradox of art when experiencing something the details are rapidly subsumed as in subjective.This is a more political story than the novel but the political elements are superficial and simplistic. And the premise of a white boy leading a whole race of people to their salvation is a bit over the top an unnecessary and forced way of extending Courteney's individual inner power to a collective unity. But such is the nature of film where pacing considerations and time constraints make reliance on stereotypes necessary to economically convey a message. And in a sweeping historical story like this there is no way to provide a great deal of depth to the characters. But Avildsen does a good job with his main character a consistent style of frequent reaction shots of PK remind the viewer that the film is entirely his pointofview and his impressions as he grows up. The solitary individual pitted against an oppressive power structure his 'power of one' being an ability to experience personal tragedyinhumanity and yet retain his humanness as a child he learns to not let fear restrict the experience of living.What makes the film good is that while Avildsen's political message is heavyhanded and stereotyped he makes good use of the time this buys him for other story elements. Some have asked why Fay Masterson's 'Maria' character was added to the screenplay Maria was not in Courteney's novel. This was a special subtle touch by Avildsen. Masterson is as perfect looking as Nicole Kidman but somehow much more real. Two of the best visual scenes in the film revolve around her character. The first is PK's initial glimpse of Maria in the audience at his championship fight homage to Rocky's search for Adrian in the crowd. It is visually amazingMasterson has an angelic glow in this shot which makes PK's instant enthrallment and improbable pursuit seem quite believable. And Masterson handles the subtle acting requirements of this difficult role extremely well representing those Afrikaners who were able to overcome their childhood indoctrination see their racist institutions for what they were and work for change. The other key scene is Maria's funeral where Avildsen shows her father's sudden grasp of what a special person she was and special for the very qualities he tried to suppress in her while she was still alive. This scene could have been clumsy and silly but Avildsen stages it with such subtlety that we accept that her father has been inspired to work for reform. Film is such a powerful medium because when done correctly it can visually tell a story in a few seconds more convincingly than in a hundred pages of text. Bottom line this is not a perfect movie nor is it an accurate adaptation of the book. It is a very entertaining film more 'inspired' by the book than adapted from it. It has great visuals of the veldt and has wonderful African music. The historical subject is worth telling and the individual themes of justice hope and courage offer a very positive message. 7 out of 10".

I saw the movie yesterday at 10 pm.I should have waited a little bit longer.Usually I first see the movie then the book it is based on as not to get disappointed by the differences in it. I should have kept following the rule.The movie The Power of One is a perfect example of how a producer can buy a story lent it to a screenwriter who shreds it to pieces and then gives it to a director who mutilates it even more.I am angry at how the book was mistreated. Angry at how so many characters were eliminated from the screen angry at how many of the ones left were changed angry at how the story was folded twisted and changed for no reason at all meeting no objective whatsoever.Killing characters before time changing names cutting important scenes and creating some that don't even come in the book thus looking artificially inserted.I know it's standard procedure for Hollywood to change a book in order to fit its necessities. But what have they done to this story is a criminal deed.It will always forever be known that the first version of this book was put into screen in such a horrible way.I feel so angry. My book my story. The 513 pages I was so eager to read every night every break I had were gone.The book is about THE POWER OF ONE. Of how a man can change its life not depend on others if he wants to or depend on others if he wants to.To live your life at full extent. Not to fear things that are not worth fearing.That's what it is about.The book is not about apartheid and teaching black people. It's not about boxing and eight punch combinations. It's not about music and a mule named Beethoven. It's about persons. It's about A person. The movie totally missed that.Why change the uncommon the singular the unique mythic name given to Peekay of The Tadpole Angel to one as clumsy over used simple and obvious as The Rainmaker?The made the character of Doc a wimpy old guy who at the first chance abandons Peekay. In the book he is a powerful mentor that sticks to his protege. He is the father figure.Peekay's mom is not around sufficient enough.Mrs. Boxall Mrs. Bornstein Gert Marie Dee and Dum Mevrou Hettie... all those characters you learn to appreciate not love are gone in screen.Morris Levy Hoppie Greenvald are transformed into something else besides what they are in the book.The character of Maria Marais is made up for the movie. There was no need for that. How cheap. How low. How commercial.Just let me tell you this the director the producer whoever was in charge of the actors at the time wasted away the presence of Armin Muehler Stahl as Doc Morgan Freeman as Geel Piet and Sir John Gielgud as Sing'n'Burns with such tiny little useless appearances. That alone is a sin in the cinema universe.They three must have read the book and expected their characters to be the figures they had read about.Peekay is a superb and excelse student athlete and human. He has a pure innocence will and love. Nothing of that sort is in the movie. They present him as a punchable boxer he is untouchable in the book but because he really makes an effort who has no problems with money he has to struggle even to get school stationary in the book and who cares not one bit about the Rainmaker Tadpole Angel in the book where he does and fully accept the honor.His determination to be the welterweight champion of the world the representation of his desire to be unafraid to be independent to fulfill his power is nowhere to be seen on screen.I wasn't surprised to see the ending of Bryce Courtnay's book changed a 100.Hopefully the author of the book expressed his strong discontent to the the movie makers about the treatment of his work.Justice must be done and a remake must be filmed. The story can be done showing its richness onscreen.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Stephen Dorff's character of PK sees the African child reading from the U.S. Declaration of Independence about that all men are created equal he knew he'd started something. Literacy is always the key to freedom and accessibility to read everything is the second step. The southerners in the slave holding part of the USA knew that well. It was a crime back in the day to teach a black slave to read. In our own country Frederick Douglass knew that well and he counted his education as a first step for freedom for his people.What I liked about The Power of One is that it goes into the history of the Union of South Africa as seen not from a historian but from the point of view of a growing boy who was of English parentage. The young man who grew up to be Stephen Dorff because he's orphaned as a child has to go to a school for Afrikaans children. Their resentment of English encroachment and victory in the Boer War runs deep. Their ministers in the Dutch Reformed Church preach a brand of Christianity that can now only be found in the USA among white supremacist fringe groups. It wasn't so long ago it was more in the mainstream here let alone in South Africa.Dorff identifies with the blacks because he's an oppressed minority as well. The film takes us through the late twenties. thirties and forties in South African history. The year 1948 is a critical one as shown here. The coalition building of Jan Christian Smuts came to an end as his South African Party was voted out of office and the white supremacist Nationalist Party of Daniel Malan was voted in. What was informal before became established law at that point. Of course even then a lot of people of good will in all races living there opposed that policy. It remained in affect until Nelson Mandela was elected president.Young people are shown as the engineers of change in South Africa. Dorff his friend Dominic Walker his African boxing rival Alois Moyo and even Fay Masterson whose father is high up in the Nationalist Party are the opponents. All of them give fine performances.The two most well known names in the cast are Sir John Gielgud as Dorff's English headmaster and Morgan Freeman the African who teaches him to box. The first half of the film is a flashback as Dorff's is reciting an autobiographical essay for class which we don't realize until the classroom is shown. He learned to box to combat the unceasing bullying he took from the Afrikaans kids. Freeman gives a wonderful performance and the coda to it was supplied by Dorff when he says that the Afrikaans policeman who beat Freeman to death was later found strung up in an isolated area. One of the kids who bullies Dorff grows up to be Daniel Craig who also becomes a policeman who now have powers greater than they had before. Their confrontation in the end is something to see. As a kid Craig idolized Hitler and as an adult we see how he put those ideas into practice. It's a truly malevolent portrayal of hate you could tell Mr. Craig had a good career ahead of him.As did Stephen Dorff. He's got a great ear for dialect right in the tradition of Robert Mitchum. Hard to believe he's an American.For a great picture of South Africa turning a dark corner in its history I highly recommend The Power of One.".

Daughter of separated parents Cayetana spends most of the time on her own and under the care of their employees. After returning from a long trip the mother Agnes gives her some unexpected news she is pregnant. With this news Cayetana's fragile world collapses. She locks herself in her room and solemnly declares that the day of birth of her brother will be the day of her own death. Only your imagination and the emergence of the national heroes of their textbooks  Olaya Grau Bolognesi  may save her from an increasingly alienated family environment in a country about to collapse.";

	schema:reviewBody "We have long admired Chilean director Andres Wood. Having seen his Historias del futbol and La fiebre del loco we were eagerly anticipating the arrival of his new film La buena vida. Cowritten for the screen by Rodrigo Bazaes and Mamoun Hassan this film follows in the favorite narrative of a lot of Latin American creators most notably Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and his long time collaborator Guillermo Arriaga.Supposedly this film is based loosely one would suspect in real stories. We are taken to meet a few people in Santiago that have nothing to do with one another much less know anyone of the other characters in the story yet at some point of the film their lives touch each and everyone of the lives of the people being followed.As the film opens we are taken to a class being directed at what appears to be a group of prostitutes where they are shown how to avoid being exposed to AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases. Teresa the therapist needs all the help she can get unknown to her her teen age daughter is pregnant. Her estranged husband is fond of visiting places where encounters can be easily arranged by the same women Teresa is trying to teach safe sex.The next story centers around a male beautician Edmundo who at the start of the movie goes to ask for a loan. Esmeralda the lending officer tells him in no uncertain terms he has no chances in what he wants to secure because he has no collateral. Esmeralda who feels attracted to the man becomes involved in an affair with Edmundo that seems to go nowhere. Edmundo who wants to convince his mother to help him financially gets no help from anyone. Eventually Esmeralda realizes he is not the man for her.The third narrative involves a talented clarinetist Mario who goes for an audition with the Philharmonic. His performance is rudely interrupted by the judges who don't seem to pay attention to the musicians they are supposed to rate. Mario's most treasured possession is the clarinet his girlfriend gave him as a gift and which he takes to all important dates. When the orchestra position doesn't materialize Mario applies and gets a position with the police band.The last and most eluding story involves a woman who is obviously a prostitute who is seen with a young child.

	onyx:emotionText "We have long admired Chilean director Andres Wood. Having seen his Historias del futbol and La fiebre del loco we were eagerly anticipating the arrival of his new film La buena vida. Cowritten for the screen by Rodrigo Bazaes and Mamoun Hassan this film follows in the favorite narrative of a lot of Latin American creators most notably Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and his long time collaborator Guillermo Arriaga.Supposedly this film is based loosely one would suspect in real stories. We are taken to meet a few people in Santiago that have nothing to do with one another much less know anyone of the other characters in the story yet at some point of the film their lives touch each and everyone of the lives of the people being followed.As the film opens we are taken to a class being directed at what appears to be a group of prostitutes where they are shown how to avoid being exposed to AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases. Teresa the therapist needs all the help she can get unknown to her her teen age daughter is pregnant. Her estranged husband is fond of visiting places where encounters can be easily arranged by the same women Teresa is trying to teach safe sex.The next story centers around a male beautician Edmundo who at the start of the movie goes to ask for a loan. Esmeralda the lending officer tells him in no uncertain terms he has no chances in what he wants to secure because he has no collateral. Esmeralda who feels attracted to the man becomes involved in an affair with Edmundo that seems to go nowhere. Edmundo who wants to convince his mother to help him financially gets no help from anyone. Eventually Esmeralda realizes he is not the man for her.The third narrative involves a talented clarinetist Mario who goes for an audition with the Philharmonic. His performance is rudely interrupted by the judges who don't seem to pay attention to the musicians they are supposed to rate. Mario's most treasured possession is the clarinet his girlfriend gave him as a gift and which he takes to all important dates. When the orchestra position doesn't materialize Mario applies and gets a position with the police band.The last and most eluding story involves a woman who is obviously a prostitute who is seen with a young child. She appears to be sick. She cuts a tragic figure snubbed by other street workers because of her appearance.What Andres Wood has accomplished is excellent performances from all the principals. Aline Kuppenheim stands out as the tormented Teresa. She gives a nuanced performance. Eduardo Paxeco makes a valuable contribution as the taciturn Mario who knows that in spite of having a great talent he is ignored by the people that can help him. Roberto Farias is seen as Edmundo in a role that was tailormade to show his abilities.La buena vida is highly recommended for lovers of good cinema thanks to the work of Andres Wood its director.";

Stunning visuals abound and the titlecards are spare and to the point Redtop's mother is shown cronelike and a title card says it all nasty gossip. Soon we are introduced to the eponymous Carrot Top her youngest son and here Duvivier superimposes stunning images of his tormentors onto the sheet of writing paper in front of him as he sits at his desk in school. The use of Opticals throughout is breathtaking for the time and enhance what is basically a Cinderella story with a happy ending. The novel was clearly close to Duvivier's heart because he filmed it again in 1932 with a cast that was more wellknown Harry Baur Catherine Fontenay and Robert Lynen but apart from Sound there is little to choose between two brilliant films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Herr Julien Duvivier was a great French film director well known for his talkie career specially during the 30's of the last century a time when his films were very appreciated for their poetic realism. However it is unfair to neglect his remarkable silent career a very interesting time during which Herr Julien established his style working as an assistant director to great French silent film directors like Herr Andr Antoine Marcel L'Herbier and Herr Feuillade.Poil de Carotte is a great film and a good example of Herr Duvivier's stylistic virtues. It is a beautiful and classical oeuvre that tells the story of the complicated relationships within a French family in a provincial town. It is a film adaptation of the French author Herr Jules Renard's eponymous oeuvre which Herr Duvivier would later remake as a talkie in 1932.Many longhaired youngsters might think that with such a plot this German aristocrat couldn't appreciate or understand those peasant family French conflicts depicted in the film but it isn't so because family conflicts is also a customary habit in the aristocracy and certain particular attitudes of the local inhabitants of that provincial French town  gossip politics  are very usual too in aristocrat circles.Everything is brilliant in Poil de Carotte from technical and special effects that enrich superbly the film narrative of the oeuvre  imaginative and varied camera tricks  to splendid cinematography by Herr Ganzli Walter und Andr Dantan that emphasizes masterfully the different surroundings of the film. There are moody shots that give a particular atmosphere to indoor scenes  beautiful and dark and complicated to be filmed  or outdoor scenes that are bright and reminiscent of Herr Renoir or Herr Van Gogh paintings.The acting is perfect and the actors are inspired in their interpretations Francois Lepic  nicknamed by his family as poil de carotte  redhead  is performed convincingly by Andr Heuz a child who is continuously maltreated by his own family especially his wicked mother Madame Lepic  Charlotte BarbierKrauss  a dominatrice woman with a splendid moustache not unlike the one sported by this German count  and his brother and sister Flix and Annette  Fabien Haziza und Lydia Zorena respectively  his fatherpatient but distant is Monsieur Lepic  Henry Krauss  who doesn't know how to deal with such complex family relationships and conflicts. The supporting cast is also excellent particularly a local singer who's also the provincial French vamp Ernestine  Rene Jean  who this German count likes specially.Poil de Carotte is a film with a strong regional French flavour but also with Dickensian overtones a wonderful oeuvre of a director who has a splendid but unfortunately not wellknown silent period that deserves rediscovery.And now if you'll allow me I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count has an appointment with a Teutonic redhead heiress with a big moustache.Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzienhttpferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com".

These are modest heroes. Problems that come their way are solved unfussily. No one expects medals they just get on with it. Being a war film the characters are the usual cross section of society united by the common peril. In the cold and the darkness they do their duty. You feel these are real people not just actors.This is not a spectacular film. The director does not go for high drama or self conscious acting. There is a death scene which is powerful in its understatement. The narrative is straight forward but exerts a gentle grip. You want to know what happens in the end. This is definitely an under rated film".

The crew spend some time marooned in a lifeboat but eventually return to the stricken ship and manage to patrol it back to safety in the United Kingdom.Codirected by Charles Frend and Robert Hamer the film has its roots in documentary ranging from the use of stock footage to the way in which it examines the lives of ordinary sailors coping with extraordinary situations.

He is given a funeral with full naval honors. Likewise Messboy John Jamieson's Gordon Jackson's transition from callow youth into mature deckhand is cleverly depicted as some of his suggestions  initially dismissed as impractical by Chief Engineer Pollard Walter Fitzgerald turn out to be inspired helping the crew survive their ordeal.The film as a whole extols the value of community of human beings setting aside their regional and national differences and learning how to pull together in times of extreme stress. Yank Preston played by the Canadian Robert Beatty an American passing for a Canadian begins the film as something of a rebel preferring the bottle to the responsibility of hard work but soon proves to be an invaluable member of the crew. It is he who provides the Bible so that Boyle can be given an appropriate sendoff to the other world. Even though the bombing of British cities had largely ceased by 1943  the time of the film's release  it was important that people on the Home Front bonded together to aid the war effort and SAN DEMETRIO London fulfilled an important purpose in communicating this message.As befits a studio relying mostly on performances and directorial cunning rather than elaborate special effects the film concentrates on characterization rather than incident. Some of the action sequences might seem a little rudimentary now  especially with the use of backprojections  but we have to remember that the film was produced under difficult conditions with a limited budget. Directors Frend and Hamer make skillful use of such constraints to produce a film that is at once surprisingly touching as well as stirring in its impact.".

A third junior officer enters the compartment and the others invite him to join them. What? At this time of day? Thanks. Alas today no more booze on British ships.It's 1940 and the San Demetrio loads up on oil at Galveston Texas. Two new hands are hired one a stereotypical bragging Texan. I eat boatswains raw! He shows up at the gangway drunk and is splashed with a bucket of water. He's a terrible actor but there are some familiar and reliable people in the cast Mervyn Johns aka Bob Cratchett in Alistair Sims' Christmas Carol James Donald Ralph Michael and a youthful Gordon Jackson. Always nice to see old friends.On the return trip the San Demetrio runs into a German raider is hit twice set afire and abandoned. You don't want to be aboard an oil tanker on fire. The lifeboat carrying the officers is picked up by another ship in the convoy but the enlisted men's boat is alone on the icy sea. They row until they're battered about sick and exhausted and the next day find the San Demetrio burning but still afloat. They board her and set about making the scorched and broken vessel seaworthy again.Admirable attention is paid to the details of the work. How do you steer a ship towards home without a compass? The snipes get their due. In its depiction of minor circumstantial demands often dangerous it reminds me a little of The Wreck of the Mary Deare. The screenplay is original not from a novel and the writers knew the lingo. The San Demetrio is low in the water and a large wave sweeps over her stern. That's what I call pooping the chief yells out. He's right. The stern was and sometimes still is called the poop deck.The special effects are of the period. There is little drama  a man dies and is buried at sea  and what there is is all the more effective. It's a modest tale of the gallantry in hard and skillful work and it's pretty good.".

Regardless of this I was glad I watched it as it was different from the usual wartime propaganda in some ways and was quite enjoyable if not thrilling.  The plot shows the men battle through difficult conditions and being heroes without realy thinking of it  they were just doing their duty and being themselves.  This message is still important today and is told in a lowkey way with the need for action etc.However being lowkey means that not all the tension of them being on a burning ship that could explode comes through.  Likewise the majority of the danger they face remains with them and I never felt gripped or on the edge of my seat  the most I could say is that it was interesting rather than involving.  The cast do well despite the irritating addition of an American to the cast yes the studios have been doing it that long! but this is a minor annoyance.  The rest are all good British stiff upper lips regardless of class or rank.Overall this is an enjoyable little film but I wanted it to be as exciting on the screen as it could have been.

	schema:reviewBody "Just for the record San Demetrio London is not a religious movie and it has nothing whatever to do with any sort of sacred personages. In fact the characters depicted in this movie are quite the antithesis. San Demetrio was the name of a ship a British commercial tanker operated by the Eagle Tanker Company that was sailing during World War II. The incredible story recounted in the film is true and the jawdropping ordeal endured by the members of the crew took place exactly as depicted. Without giving the story away suffice it to say that had these men been members of the military rather than mere civilian merchant seaman it is very likely that every one of them would have been awarded the Victoria Cross. I had heard of this movie for many years but only recently finally got the opportunity to actually view it. It is an extremely dramatic story told in a very simple and straightforward manner. That is as it should be because the story itself is so dramatic that no embellishment is necessary and would probably only diminish the impact of the story.It is acknowledge that some of the special effects are less than firstquality by today's standards. However allowances must be made for the fact that this film was produced in Britain in 1943 and there was a war on. That being said the depiction of the tanker itself and the details of the manner in which it was operated are extremely accurate. I've sailed on several elderly merchant ships that had been built during WWII including an old T2 tanker and I can vouch for the movie's authenticity. This is not altogether surprising when one considers that San Demetrio London was directed by the same man who later made The Cruel Sea. Highly recommended as a depiction of WW II at sea.".

The incredible story recounted in the film is true and the jawdropping ordeal endured by the members of the crew took place exactly as depicted. Without giving the story away suffice it to say that had these men been members of the military rather than mere civilian merchant seaman it is very likely that every one of them would have been awarded the Victoria Cross. I had heard of this movie for many years but only recently finally got the opportunity to actually view it. It is an extremely dramatic story told in a very simple and straightforward manner. That is as it should be because the story itself is so dramatic that no embellishment is necessary and would probably only diminish the impact of the story.It is acknowledge that some of the special effects are less than firstquality by today's standards. However allowances must be made for the fact that this film was produced in Britain in 1943 and there was a war on. That being said the depiction of the tanker itself and the details of the manner in which it was operated are extremely accurate. I've sailed on several elderly merchant ships that had been built during WWII including an old T2 tanker and I can vouch for the movie's authenticity. This is not altogether surprising when one considers that San Demetrio London was directed by the same man who later made The Cruel Sea. Highly recommended as a depiction of WW II at sea.";

I'm not quite sure why they spent two days rowing doggedly  admittedly they had to distance themselves form the flaming tanker and its cargo of oil but surely it would have made more sense to remain reasonably close to where they had been as that would have been  and was where the search for them would have begun.There are a number of situations and obstacles the resourceful sailors have to cope with and for the most part they meet each one with jutjawed resolution.

The title is derived from the popular number 'Kambakkht Ishq' from Ram Gopal Varma's film 'Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya'.Directed by Sabbir Khan 'Kambakkht Ishq' is loud crude clichd campy and utterly predictable. And if you are curious about the advertised roles of its Hollywood supporting stars let's say that their parts are so cheesy you can open a pastry shop with them. Imagine a geriatric Stallone reprising his Rambo role and you will know what I mean.The movie is a remake of the 2002 Tamil film 'Pammal K. Sambandam'. It is about a 'super' Indian stuntman in Hollywood Akshay Kumar as Viraj Shergill who meets an Indian supermodel Kareena Kapoor as Simrita Rai at his brother's Aftab Shivdasani as Lucky wedding in church. Both the leads are unhappy about the marriage of Lucky and Simrita's sister Kamini Amrita Arora and the battle lines are drawn at the wedding reception where we see the movie's most dazzlingly choreographed number that ends in a tasteless and farcical brawl.Yeah Viraj and Simrita hate each other. In Bollywood terms it means they are gonna do lots of idiotic things before they finally realise that they love each other right from the getgo.The first half is more tolerable than the second. Sabbir Khan loads the first hour with actionpacked stunt sequences and dance numbers that take us from Hollywood to Italy. Then he has to take such a long time to render the outcome of the 'battle of the sexes' plot which everyone in the audience already knows. And if that is not bad enough Sabbir Khan also does recaps of his scenes  in case we missed them or forget them! The director also could not resist crude 'American Pie' gags like having the protagonist fart in the face of a bride having the heroine curse like a sailor and going overthetop with an 'anal search' scene. Character development is minimal and the cast are unimpressive with the ageold device of having the 'hero' supported by a clownish aide in the form of Vindu Dara Singh. And whose idea was it to have Viraj undergo open abdomen surgery without anaesthesia? Of the stars Kareena shines brightest in a badlywritten role. She is the most watchable but alas not quite enough good to stop this Dumbakkht from sinking.".

Akshay Kumar and Kareena Kapoor are the lead actors the film is produced by Sajid Nadiadwala and has 3 Hollywood Supertstars Stallone Routh and Denise Richards. But with all these trumps does this flick entertain? The answer is NO!The problem with Kambakkht Ishq is that it's a senseless film. The film hardly has a script Debutant Director Sabbir Khan makes a disappointing fare. The first hr of the film is yet passable but the second is just unbearable. The film has 'A' class production value but script wise its a complete disappointment.Pluses of the film Sajid Nadiadwala is a classy producer he has left no stone unturned to make this flick. Akshay Kareena Stallone Routh  Denise Richards are the pluses as well. Akshay is in form once again but he's again done a film that throws even the least amount of logic into the trash bin. Kareena looks great and delivers a good performance. Stallone Routh Denise are perfect in cameos. Stallone's action scene where he bashes up the goons will be will loved by one and all. Aftab  Amrita do their parts perfectly. Vindhu Singh is just right.Minuses Sabbir Khan's direction and screenplay. Anu Malik's music is mediocre. Talented actors like Kirron Khan and Jaaved Jaffery are wasted in apologetic roles.

	onyx:emotionText "'Kambakkht Ishq' has been in the buzz for a longlong time. The film has been awaited... why? Akshay Kumar and Kareena Kapoor are the lead actors the film is produced by Sajid Nadiadwala and has 3 Hollywood Supertstars Stallone Routh and Denise Richards. But with all these trumps does this flick entertain? The answer is NO!The problem with Kambakkht Ishq is that it's a senseless film. The film hardly has a script Debutant Director Sabbir Khan makes a disappointing fare. The first hr of the film is yet passable but the second is just unbearable. The film has 'A' class production value but script wise its a complete disappointment.Pluses of the film Sajid Nadiadwala is a classy producer he has left no stone unturned to make this flick. Akshay Kareena Stallone Routh  Denise Richards are the pluses as well. Akshay is in form once again but he's again done a film that throws even the least amount of logic into the trash bin. Kareena looks great and delivers a good performance. Stallone Routh Denise are perfect in cameos. Stallone's action scene where he bashes up the goons will be will loved by one and all. Aftab  Amrita do their parts perfectly. Vindhu Singh is just right.Minuses Sabbir Khan's direction and screenplay. Anu Malik's music is mediocre. Talented actors like Kirron Khan and Jaaved Jaffery are wasted in apologetic roles. Those 5 stars are in order  1 for Sajid Nadiadwala's high class production 1 for Akki 1 for Kareena 1 for Stallone and 1 is shared by Denise and Routh. To sum up the review 'Kambakkht Ishq' is a letdown.";

I don't know if this matches Indian practice in some way but it certainly doesn't represent even a nodding acquaintance with the American hospital scene.The situations and language will not shock anyone used to US films though they are probably fairly shocking for Bollywood and I do not know to what extent the subtitles represented a taming of the language in Hindi. Someone complained about nudityI don't count presumed nudity under sheets as nudity.That said there are some nice moments and a great sense of energy throughout. If you have high tolerance for silliness this is fun. My husband who is not a Bollywood fan enjoyed it.".

Story This movie is about a dog and a bitch who cannot say filthy words onscreen because of censorship. So they go out hurling abuse on the opposite sex without any justification. The audience is dumbstruck on their own foolishness to spend 150 bucks and more so 140 minutes on the 'datum of the datums' movie. Direction Now they know every asst director cannot and should not become a director. Even a stunt man could have done a better job on KI. Guest Appearances Neither Nadiadwala nor Sabbir has a degree in management. Else they would know that you cannot offer a product whose functionality is unknown to the customer. Stallone is OK but how many Indians know Routh or Dennise Richards probably less than 0.5. Why waste so much money on big Hollywood starts who cannot translate it into revenues?? Acting Akshay is the least exploited actor in last few years. He has such great acting potential last seen in Hera Pheri and Namaste London. But since then he has done some of the worst movies of his career. KI is just an addition to the list. Kareena is the biggest letdown of the decade. No point hailing her as a superstar we all know how her acting has deteriorated over the years. Her acting in Refugee Asoka and Chameli showed such great promise. But its all gone now. In KI she not only acts poorly but also looks ugly. Sorry to say she looks like a transsexual in her zero figure. Instead of Kareena they should have gone for any voluptuous babe with sexy figure like Bipasha Shilpa or even Deepika. Aaftab and Amrita has gone down from supporting actors to side kicks to now kicked in the corner. And what the hell are Boman Irani and Javed Jaffery doing in here?? This movie is not meant for them. Music This could have been the saving grace for this dumb movie just like Singh is king. But alas music is more pathetic than the movie itself. I don't remember even one nice song to hum. Once again a complete disaster.".

Akshay Kumar please get back to the Khiladi mode or get into the mode the reel son of Amithabh Bachchan.Kareena Kapoor is way toooo loud in the movie i do not know was it for emphasis or was the acoustics in the new theater. At the same time if you want to see whats in fashion you need to check out the outfits that Kareena Kapoor is wearing. If the clothes were any shorter then this movie would have been given a A grade certification. Talking about the much hyped swimsuit sequence of Kareena Kapoor yeah swimsuit was good but it was not that great on her.From the Hollywood brigade there is Sylvester Stallone Denise Richards Branden Routh i think all of them are wasted to some extent they should have be given some more meaty role. Starting with Brenden Akshay is his body double the first action sequence is the only one that might be original. Then there is Stallone who has just his presence Then there are these action sequences that are have used the sets of Beverly Hills Cop III starring Eddie Murphy and Waterworld starring Kevin Costner.If we want to watch the swimsuit models i will still prefer going back to watching Baywatch but a whole movie where all of the extras wearing swimsuits. Someone must be having a very hard time to choose two different swimsuits which cannot repeated in very scene. That would be the worlds best and worst job to do specially if you are suffering from amnesia.Aftab Shivdasani Amrita Arora get overshadowed with loudness of Akshay and Kareena. Javed Jaffey is also there in the movie as a Sindhi Mr. Keswani was hoping that he might save the day with another act like Crocodile Dundee in Salaam Namaste. Like most of the scenes end very abruptly.If this an entry of Hollywood stars in Bollywood movies then for a fact then we can surely see a trend of Johnny Depp fighting a battle with Aamir Khan then Depp loosing the battle Megan Fox and Frieda Pinto setting a ramp walk on fire then Frieda taking the crown away. Or the movie producers will make two version of movies one for the Indian audience where the Indian actor wins and the other one for the global audience where the Hollywood actor wins that would be ultimate movie customization based on bias.".

The cinematography and editing was good and so were three of the songs. The script was bad and seriously it was bad. And the only thing about the movie which I liked was well Bebo.How the hell did a superstar like Sylvester Stallone wind up in the middle of a gangway alley to save Bebo from gangsters? Yes Sylvester Stallone is himself in the movie. How can a superstar of his fame arrive there JUST at the time required??

And the only thing about the movie which I liked was well Bebo.How the hell did a superstar like Sylvester Stallone wind up in the middle of a gangway alley to save Bebo from gangsters? Yes Sylvester Stallone is himself in the movie. How can a superstar of his fame arrive there JUST at the time required?? Ageoldtraditional bollywood rigidity one that shall never change I guess.Time's up Akki. Time up. 410 ONLY for Bebo and the songs.";

	schema:reviewBody "I give it a 1 on the scale of 10. If IMDb had negative ratings I would have chosen 10. It is a typical bollywood crap of a movie showing how desperate bollywood directors producers and actors are that they would do just about anything to associate themselves with Hollywood. What they don't realize is that there should be a good storyline good acting skills and some class that would result in making the movie a hit. Just by having Hollywood actors act in a few scenes would not make a horrible movie any better. I heard this happens to be one of the most expensive bollywood productions. I'm sure it would have taken a lot of money to convince Hollywood actors to star in the film. I'd rather watch Hollywood actors in a Hollywood movie rather than in a bollywood movie.The stunts were unimpressive and not really required. I know Akshay was playing a stuntman but there was no need to have all the expensive sets and stunts in the movie stunts on a smaller scale would have done the job. The story as I mentioned earlier was a waste and the acting just made me feel agitated. I couldn't help rolling my eyes through out. By the way I couldn't wait for the movie to finish to write my comments here. For people who are into cheap low class comedy or who are big Akshay and Kareena fans might like this a lot. For me it was a waste of time. I wonder what all the good Indians actors and directors are doing these days. Maybe making money in buying cricket teams. Oh and the character of Kareena comes from greys anatomy's Izzie Stevens character a girl from a middle class family trying to make money from a little modelling prior to getting into med school in an attempt to fulfil her dream of becoming a doctor. Unlike Kareena she wasn't all dolled up and expensively dressed. I think they've shot scenes in the same hospital set grey's anatomy is shot in.One last thing the real English translation of 'kambakht' is not 'incredible' it's 'pathetic' and thats exactly what this movie is...simply kambakht.".

But a two hour film needs more than ten minutes of high quality eye candy to live on. Unfortunately you will not find it here.Its hard to know exactly where to begin but really the screenplay here is diabolical  clichd to within an inch of its life you know just where this is headed after the first five minutes. Then it has the temerity to stretch the obvious out for two more hours. The dialogue is atrocious to say the least and even by Bollywood standards the plot holes here are roughly the size of the Indian Ocean. Whoever thought the Keswani character was a good idea should be taken outside and beaten to death. That one character alone is all the proof you need to explain why this is a festering turd of a film to paraphrase Billy Mack from a rather good film.Its hard to know exactly where Akshay Kumar's career started to really hit the sewerage farm. I mean Namastey London wasn't too bad and Heyy Babyy was tolerable but something went seriously wrong after there and it has been getting progressively worse ever since. This? Woeful overacting with all the emotional sense of a piece of granite that grates more every time you see it. Kareena Kapoor was okay but boy did she have some crap to play with. From there it gets worse. Amrita Arora cannot act to save her life but kudos for looking very good in a bikini Aftab Shivdasani was awful what happened to him after Koi Aap Sa? and the rest of the Bollywood brigade don't exactly shine in any way. However special mention should be made of Rajesh Khera for the finest display of atrocious overacting since the last Under 12's school play you saw. As for the Hollywood crowd oh lord they must have been desperate not that I really expect much from the likes of Sylvester Stallone or Denise Richards neither of whom could ever be accused of being great actors.Even the music here which can often redeem at least partially any Bollywood film is sadly way off the mark.Not even the visual delights of Amrita Arora and Kareena Kapoor could entice me to watch this piece of rubbish in its entirety ever again. Its hard to imagine a film as bad as this across the board although some comments passed about Akshay Kumar's more recent films would indicate that he is trying to make this look like a pinnacle of his career.Believe me you do not need to watch this film  find the stills of Amrita in bikini that are floating around the internet you would then be seeing the highlights of the film just about.310 only because its got Amrita in a bikini and Kareena looks good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kambakht Ishq is more irritating than entertaining. Kareena's worst performance till date even worse than her role in Tashan. After watching her poor performance I just realised that Indian film industry board should also introduce award for worst performances and worse movies just like Hollywood's Razzie Award. If it was introduced than Kareena would have been lucky for this award. But Akshay is so normal and interesting though I'm not his fan. His performance is better than other roles he has been offered and he proudly handled playing his role along with some renowned Hollywood celebrities like Stallone Denise Richards or Holly Valance. There is not a single sign of tension in his appearance. So far he is lucky of getting such chances.It is not necessary to describe briefly the story of Kambakht Ishq because there is nothing new which can be pointed out. But it is just a LoveHate HateLove and finally a Marriage Story.Only impressive moments were when both Viraj and Simrita shout wildly against each other and they performed it uniquely. Aftab Shivdasani had nothing much to offer than a sidekick to Akshay. The script of Kambakht Ishq is totally wastage and most of it is out of sense. As the characters roll on it is not hard to guess or predict as to what can we see in the next few scenes. According to me the most minus point in the movie is with short role of Boman Irani. I feel really pity for his short and useless role. If it was extended then I hope it would bring more attention in the boring story. One more is with Kiron Kher. Her role is so neglected less important and can easily be compared to her parts in Dostana with Abhishekh and John.Amrita Arora Javed Jaffrey and Ashwin Mushran hardly come into notice as they are most boring roles played here. But Vindu Dara Singh's role as Tiger who is costuntman of Viraj is completely well balanced and justified to his character. It is clear that the American celebrities with short appearance were just to bring out some magnetic touches to market the film for large number of audiences. No doubt it failed finally. Even Akshay could not carry out the whole movie alone himself.".

His performance is better than other roles he has been offered and he proudly handled playing his role along with some renowned Hollywood celebrities like Stallone Denise Richards or Holly Valance. There is not a single sign of tension in his appearance. So far he is lucky of getting such chances.It is not necessary to describe briefly the story of Kambakht Ishq because there is nothing new which can be pointed out. But it is just a LoveHate HateLove and finally a Marriage Story.Only impressive moments were when both Viraj and Simrita shout wildly against each other and they performed it uniquely. Aftab Shivdasani had nothing much to offer than a sidekick to Akshay. The script of Kambakht Ishq is totally wastage and most of it is out of sense. As the characters roll on it is not hard to guess or predict as to what can we see in the next few scenes. According to me the most minus point in the movie is with short role of Boman Irani. I feel really pity for his short and useless role. If it was extended then I hope it would bring more attention in the boring story. One more is with Kiron Kher. Her role is so neglected less important and can easily be compared to her parts in Dostana with Abhishekh and John.Amrita Arora Javed Jaffrey and Ashwin Mushran hardly come into notice as they are most boring roles played here. But Vindu Dara Singh's role as Tiger who is costuntman of Viraj is completely well balanced and justified to his character. It is clear that the American celebrities with short appearance were just to bring out some magnetic touches to market the film for large number of audiences. No doubt it failed finally. Even Akshay could not carry out the whole movie alone himself.";

I know one could hardly expect anything from Akshaye Kumar after CC2C but this really broke the barrier of making some real hard core senseless cinema.

I wonder what the director was thinking while filming this song. The scenes right after the song make you feel like walking out of your seat right away. Kambakkht Ishq is not a comedy movie if you think it is. Its a movie that even the director is not sure to which genre this movie belongs to. You can actually count the parts that are actually funny ignoring the cheap scenes which lack every hint of homour. Actors like Javed Jaffri Boman Irani and Kirron Kher are seen on roles which are poorly written and absolutely make no sense in the movie. The cameo's by Hollywood stars adds no value whatsoever. The scenes meant for a star like Sylvester Stallone are lame and adds to your frustration.The music by Anu Malik is as pathetic as the script. The songs are lousy and definitely something that you would love to fastforward if given a chance. I waited patiently till the credits actually rolled for something that could make me like this movie. But sadly there's wasn't one thing that you can like abut the movie.For fans of Akshaye Kumar please avoid this flick if you want to remain his fan for long.

We can only wonder how such a brilliant storyline escaped the consciousness of all script writers past present and future.Apart from the general brilliance there is also a very tasteful scene in which an AfricanAmerican lady digs into Akshay Kumar's butthole looking for smuggled goods. Of course this is all in good humour and hence the movie is rated UA.Annuuuu Mallliiiikkk  dear Lord. He with any other spelling would smell the same. The song 'Bebo main bebo' had me tapping my feet in the cinema hall but I had to stop because the person seated in front of me had a slight dislocation of the spinal cord. I also saw many others tap their feet out of the theater at this stage. They must have had something real important to do because they missed one HELL of a movie.There is also the presence of Hollywood thus validating this movie for kewlness. I mean really we are cool so we must like Hollywood films and their stars right? So Stallone plays a cameo as himself and not only does he give a Taurus award to Akki at an awards ceremony studded with fake stars he even rescues surgeon Kareena and lingerie model Amrita Arora while they are driving through a shady neighbourhood with that Aftab fellow who never does any major roles. Mr Balboa just happens to be walking by at that time. After punching the lights out of the goons he says 'Kambhaaaakt Eeeeessshk' for no particular reason and resumes his walk this time hold your breath in slow motion.Also there is Denise Richards who seems to have reduced in quantity to Denise Richard as AkkiplayaKumar calls her. We couldn't handle more than one of her but one is just about right I think. Especially since our man dumps her for the surgeon with whom he finally finds trulowe.So please take your infants toddlers preteenagers and other family members to this movie. It's an experience you will never forget. Never.Rating 0.5  10".

	schema:headline " Akshay is finally back in form but could not hit a clear six.";
	schema:reviewBody "Once again Bollywood delivers a half baked product called Kambakkht Ishq which has an enjoyable and entertaining first half but miserably fails to sustain the same energy in the second.The director Sabbir Khan starts off shiningly and straight away comes to the point. Introducing all the lead characters in the first five minutes only he brilliantly directs the opening sequence of a church wedding where Akshay  Kareena have their first verbal clash. From here on you start expecting more entertaining stuff coming down the lane related to the battle of the sexes but sadly you are not served a better dish later on.The good news for all Akshay Kumar's fans is that he is back in form with his impeccable comic timing in the first half. Portraying the role of a Hollywood Stuntman he is simply superb fighting with Kareena in his own freak out style trying to prove the supremacy of men over women. And equally good is the ravishing Kareena Kapoor who tends to burn the silver screen with her electrifying hot persona. In fact Kareena is only one who truly deserves the title of Bollywood Diva among her current Bollywood contemporaries. Her performance in the movie also proves the immense acting talent she has as expected from a lady from the Kapoor Family.So the first half is high on entertainment where you keep on enjoying the scenes even when there is no story being developed. As seen in Akshay's last successful movies this one also has no story plot as such and the movie revolves around only an idea of a Hollywood Stuntman having an affair with a hard to convince girl. The second half talks more about the love affair and the emotional misunderstanding between the characters which unfortunately falls flat as compared to the initial moments of the movie. Though from the scripting point of view post interval the movie has a very interesting plot where Akshay is hearing Om Mangalam mantra everywhere around him due to an alarm clock left in his body during an operation. But the writers couldn't develop the hilarious plot for long which could have been the highlight of the movie. Coming to the grand budget of the movie it had a highly supportive producer who actually spent more than required on the project to make it look glossy majestic and larger than life. And the movie does have the Royal look with all those famous Hollywood actors featuring in it for the first time. Though it gives you a feeling that it was all done for bringing in the international audiences still the foreign Icons have performed pretty well more than what was being expected. Among the three Sylvester Stallone Brandon Routh and Denise Richards the most famous in India is THE RAMBO Sylvester Stallone who also gets the maximum scenes in the movie. Brandon and Denise are just fine in their short cameos but Stallone is super cool in his scenes and leaves an impression.In the supporting cast Aftab Shivdasani and Amrita Arora play their roles perfectly. Javed Jaffery and Kiron Kher are cast in an underwritten role giving them the same characters which they have already played in many of their previous movies. Boman Irani is completely wasted in a one scene performance and Vindu Singh surprisingly comes up with a calm comic performance. Annu Malik's music does have a new sound but the compositions still have his unique Annu stamp written all over them. Out of the numbers being played all over only the title song by RDB has the right groove and beat to catch on. Bebo Main Bebo is not as enjoyable as projected by its promos on air. Cinematography is first rate capturing the Hollywood Studios Kodak Theater and the grandeur of the subject magnificently.Talking about the drawbacks of Kambakhht Ishq there are many to state but since it's a comic movie made only with an intention to entertain without any social message so logic has to be kept aside for this particular genre. The movie goes on the similar lines of Welcome and Singh Is Kinng having a very weak script but an enjoyable narration with entertaining moments. This time we have a flick surely better than Chandni Chowk To China but still not a clear winner all the way.However there were some major flaws in the movie which should have been looked upon importantly. Firstly in a movie based on the life of a Hollywood Stuntman you don't find any amazing stunts and action sequences performed by Akshay Kumar. All the fight sequences are too fast routine and executed in a clumsy manner. Secondly it was quite strange to find out that Kareena Kapoor is actually there as a professional surgeon in the movie whereas in all the promotional campaigns she was shown as a Top Model. She only does one modeling assignment in the movie and that too for raising funds to pay her medical fees.In a nutshell Kambakkht Ishq falls in the same genre of senseless movies based on a thin plot made only with a motive to entertain. It is also said to be the remake of a Tamil film Pammal K. Sambandam 2002 featuring Kamal Hassan  Simran which was a huge Hit in the south. Regarding its Hindi version the excited fans of Akshay  Kareena are sure going to have a good time but the rest may not take it in high spirits. In other words Akshay is finally back in form but could not hit a clear six.".

Brandon and Denise are just fine in their short cameos but Stallone is super cool in his scenes and leaves an impression.In the supporting cast Aftab Shivdasani and Amrita Arora play their roles perfectly. Javed Jaffery and Kiron Kher are cast in an underwritten role giving them the same characters which they have already played in many of their previous movies. Boman Irani is completely wasted in a one scene performance and Vindu Singh surprisingly comes up with a calm comic performance. Annu Malik's music does have a new sound but the compositions still have his unique Annu stamp written all over them. Out of the numbers being played all over only the title song by RDB has the right groove and beat to catch on. Bebo Main Bebo is not as enjoyable as projected by its promos on air. Cinematography is first rate capturing the Hollywood Studios Kodak Theater and the grandeur of the subject magnificently.Talking about the drawbacks of Kambakhht Ishq there are many to state but since it's a comic movie made only with an intention to entertain without any social message so logic has to be kept aside for this particular genre. The movie goes on the similar lines of Welcome and Singh Is Kinng having a very weak script but an enjoyable narration with entertaining moments. This time we have a flick surely better than Chandni Chowk To China but still not a clear winner all the way.However there were some major flaws in the movie which should have been looked upon importantly. Firstly in a movie based on the life of a Hollywood Stuntman you don't find any amazing stunts and action sequences performed by Akshay Kumar. All the fight sequences are too fast routine and executed in a clumsy manner. Secondly it was quite strange to find out that Kareena Kapoor is actually there as a professional surgeon in the movie whereas in all the promotional campaigns she was shown as a Top Model. She only does one modeling assignment in the movie and that too for raising funds to pay her medical fees.In a nutshell Kambakkht Ishq falls in the same genre of senseless movies based on a thin plot made only with a motive to entertain. It is also said to be the remake of a Tamil film Pammal K. Sambandam 2002 featuring Kamal Hassan  Simran which was a huge Hit in the south. Regarding its Hindi version the excited fans of Akshay  Kareena are sure going to have a good time but the rest may not take it in high spirits. In other words Akshay is finally back in form but could not hit a clear six.";

	schema:reviewBody "Mask of Murder is another of those mystery thrillers that borrows plot points from the slasher movies and giallos that had been popular around the time. Just like Baby Doll Murders Out of the Dark and Dead End Mask of Murder puts a mysterious killer up against a struggling and scarily inept Police Force. Christopher Lee's credits over the last ten years have included three megablockbusters which isn't bad going for an actor that made his first movie appearance way back in the midst of World War 2. He was initially John Carpenter's first choice to play the Sam Loomis character in Halloween but he didn't accept something he admits he's always regretted. He even went as far as to call it the biggest mistake of his career. Obviously annoyed that he'd missed out on some supreme slasher action perhaps the reason he took a supporting role here was because he didn't want to make the same mistake twice? Or maybe he was blackmailed into doing it? I really don't know but one thing is certain however he was definitely slumming it hereIt's all set in a small snowy Canadian town. Almost immediately a loony in a mask grabs an unsuspecting woman and slices her throat with a straight razor. Later that day in another location a second victim suffers the same fate at the hands of the gruesome killer. He removes his disguise and heads back to a remote cabin where he proves his dementia by gnashing his teeth and staring into the screen. Ooooh scary! We next get to meet the members of our cast over dinner. First off there's John Christopher Lee the chief of the local Police Force. His best detective Bob Rod Taylor has been having problems with his wife Marianne Valerie Perrine. These difficulties must have a lot to do with the fact that his partner Ray Sam Cook is busy banging her every time that he gets the chance. The dinner party is cut short when Bob receives a call informing him that they have the assassin surrounded. They rush to the scene and to cut a long story short the city of Nelson should be a little quieter from now on. But the tranquillity doesn't last. It begins to look like there's a copycat murderer at work when more women turn up with their throats slit. Is someone mimicking the murders? Or is the killer back from beyond the grave? Why on earth Christopher Lee turned down Halloween but chose to play a part in this turkey is one of the world's biggest mysteries. I mean seriously come on surely the screenwriter must have known that the killer's identity was patently obvious from the start. This is perhaps the dumbest and most basic premise for a murder mystery that I have ever seen. The Scooby Doo cartoon offers less obvious plot twists than this rubbish. Swedish filmmaker Arne Mattson directs so sloppily that he manages to drag surprisingly wooden performances from an inviting ensemble of screen veterans. Lee's the best of the bunch but he's not on screen long enough to warrant his fans to hunt this down. The pace is nonexistent and perhaps the most obnoxious thing about Mask of Murder is the horrible music that accompanies every 'twist' in the story. It sounds like a onehanded guitarist attempting to mimic a Jimi Hendrix lick after one too many bottles of cider.The throat slashings are quite bloody and in one scene a girl is murdered in a cinema  a trick that has become a slasher trademark after He knows you're alone and Scream 2. The only problem is that the killings are so poorly executed that the gratuitous blood gushes just look like a poor attempt to flog a dead horse. I knew from the off that I was in for a bad time with this movie and my suspicions were confirmed when I witnessed Rod Taylor sniffing his adulterous wife's underwear. Don't ask!I'm led to believe that Mask of Murder has become extremely rare which is certainly a blessing. If you want to keep your sanity intact then please don't bother trying to hunt this one down. If you must buy this waste of space for the inclusion of Christopher Lee then all I can recommend is don't get the UK version. The BBFC rated print is missing all the throat slashing which makes it even less rewarding. This is an exceptionally bad film riddled with uninspired hamstrung performances and dumb pathetic scripting. Shame on you Mr. Lee...".

The plot is actually a decent base for a film in spite of not being very original and focuses on a serial killer who butchers women. The main bulk of the plot focuses on an investigation into the killings. The film kind of feels something like an inept Giallo as we have several Giallo trademarks without much intrigue to string it all together. The reason why I would assume many people tune into this film is almost certainly down to the fact that Christopher Lee is billed as the main star but this is actually a bit of a rip off as he doesn't have a great deal of screen time and he isn't put to very good use in the time he does have. The killer himself fails to generate a great deal of intrigue and the way that the investigation plays out is largely laughable and not in good way. Director Arne Mattsson fails to give the film much in the way of atmosphere and overall it's a largely lacklustre affair. Still at least the film does have a plot and it never becomes completely boring  though that might owe more to the fact that it isn't very long rather than the execution.".

This effectively dilutes the proceedings of both tension and interest especially since our antihero goes on about his Police business regardless i.e. probing locations and witnesses for possible clues to the killings he is himself clearly responsible for and even adding further red herrings in the unconnected razor assault on a drugdealing barber committed by a gangland collector! Alas all the satirical socio political points brilliantly made by Elio Petri via an exact same scenario in the Oscarwinning INVESTIGATION OF A CITIZEN ABOVE SUSPICION 1970 are completely bypassed here in favour of the lowest common denominator read gratuitous softcore nudity. That said we are still spoonfed the protagonist's having the cloud of suspicion over himself he happens to have a similar razor as the murder weapon and one of the people he questions actually says that the current perpetrator has a similar build as hisand all the while the bedridden Lee having been shot by the first slasher before being machinegunned by an already unbalanced Taylor contemplates whether the dead man's spirit could have found a new 'vessel' in order to continue his apparently motiveless killing spree but which Taylor perversely suggests might be brought on by sexual inadequacy!The snowy backdrop supposedly Canada but really Uppsala Sweden  that is to say Ingmar Bergman's birthplace! is undeniably attractive and unusual for this type of fare however this is continuously undercut by the kitschy 1980s fashions and settings including obligatory and awfullyscored discobar and stripjoint sequences and some hilariously overstated moments notably Taylor and Lee's reactions at respectively his wife's infidelity  captured from a distance via binoculars  and his friend's guilt  by the symbolic throatslashing of Playboy centrefolds conveniently stashed in a drawer of his workdesk!.The finale then emits a false air of cynicism by not only having Taylor frame his duplicitous pal for the murders he foolishly reenacts the slaying of a woman witnessed by her young son who of course exclaims That's him! upon seeing the masked assailant but by the fact that he is allowed to get away with it though assured by his superior that he is on to him! For the record Lee would reunite with Mattsson on the director's subsequent effort i.e. THE GIRL 1986 which also happens to be my next entry in the ongoing tribute I am paying to the recentlydeceased Horror icon incidentally Rod Taylor also passed away earlier this year  so I got to watch MASK OF MURDER for his sake as well".

Being a gigantic fan of gialli I really wanted to watch Mannequin in Red but  alas  I only found this Mask of Murder instead. The first thing that becomes quite obvious here is that Mattsson was quite a lazy and patriotic Swede The events are supposed to take place in a winterly Canadian village but everyone drives around in Volvo cars with Swedish license places and I'm pretty sure I also spotted a couple of Swedish signposts as well. The only thing missing to make it abundantly clear that filming took place in Sweden is an Ikea warehouse in the background or guest appearances from the ABBA band members! Secondly I presume this movie is supposed to be a whodunitmystery thriller yet the identity of the killer as well as his motivations are pretty obvious straight from the first murder so all that remains is a goofy giallolite flick with the almighty Christopher Lee in yet another inferior supportive role. The police are hunting down a misogynist and masked killer who slices the throats of his female victims with a razor. He's a dumb killer I may add because he allows himself to get caught rather easily. During the arrest Lt. Bob McLaine shoots the suspect much against the will of his superior Chief Lt. Jonathan Rich Lee who also gets injured during the conflict. By the way did you know the Canadian police use machine guns?!? A few days later Lt. McLaine painfully discovers that his wife Maria lies about going on holiday to Bermuda in order to spend time with her lover  and her husband's colleague  Ray Cooper. Poor Bob emotionally cracks and at the same time the misogynous killer with his hideous mask and razor starts murdering again. Oh gee I wonder who he is! The regretful thing about Mask of Murder is that plot and the denouement hold quite a lot of potential so in case Arne Mattsson and his crew would have bothered to uphold the mystery and create suspense just a little bit more this honestly could have been a nice 80s horror sleeper. Now Mask of Murder mainly comes across as a lazy effort. Even the killer's mask is an uninspired and ugly piece of scenery in spite of its significant role in the plot. Was it that hard to come up with a slightly more creative mask?".

	schema:reviewBody "A couple years ago I was working at Blockbuster right after graduating from college.  I saw the cover to this movie on the shelf since I'd starting working there but judged it as kinetic crap by its horribly cheesy cover and name.  Yes I judged this movie by its cover.  A customer about my age 25 then told me unprovoked that it was one of the funniest movies he had seen in years.  He said he was surprised by it and that I should check it out.  So I did.Wow. I laughed and laughed and laughed.  I hadn't seen a movie that made me laugh that hard in a long time.  I actually couldn't wait to watch it againthis time with my girlfriend.  What a disaster. She absolutely hated it as much as I liked it.  We didn't even get through 45 minutes of it because she couldn't take it anymore.  Apparently she thought it was one of the most unfunny movies she'd ever seen.  A negative funniness even if that's possible.What does this tell us?This movie probably has a target audience of 1830 year old males.Its rather dark view of the motives of women and to that end perceived psycho women is fitform to any man who's been with a woman that went too far too fastno matter how well the both of you got along. This movie is funny because of the powerlessness men feel in the face of a psycho womanthey can absolutely tear you apart and make everyone else think that it's your fault because you're the one who is falling apart.  As Yoda might say Dark this movie is.French Stewart is completely impotent emotionally physically and mentally in this relationship.  If you're a man you probably know this emotion all too well.  This movie capitalizes on that darkest of dark corners with which to view a woman in a relationship such as this.  In that sense the movie is almost hyperbolic. Needless to say it doesn't paint women in any sort of real favorable light.  No wonder my girlfriend hated it.So guys watch this movie laugh you arse offand don't show it to your girlfriend she'll hate it.  I on the other hand watched it three more times.".

I highly recommend this movie to those who like their comedies as black as they come.Plot French Stewart who is a TV writer falls in love with a babe who MUST get married soon.  She does everything to advance the relationship far beyond its years.  Of course French does not want this and it leads to some very dark and funny circumstances.  It uses sophisticated humor i.e. how this affects his show and life overall as well as completely lowbrow humor i.e. using farts as a weapon of revenge.Script This movie has some very funny lines.  There are some lines that I almost choked on because I was not suspecting them.  I am sure that the next time I see this movie I will pick up some very quotable quotes.  Listen carefully to what they say and you will be highly rewarded.Acting  This has some of the funniest and truest acting that I have ever seen.  I actually liked Bill Bellamy in his role.  Go see this movie when it comes out just for him.  French is really decent but you have to go with him because Love will make you do fed up things.  Everybody else works especially the girlfriend.The ending just rocks and it is very fitting.  Unfortunately I have been seeing the ending in the previews...it should be saved.   Everybody should go see this movie.  It is very good and I did not even notice the editing because I was laughing so hard.  I took a point off simply because some of the scenes I had seen before.  910".

We all know that euphoric feeling of early infatuation and it's captured perfectly in this film. I felt myself falling for Chelsea. But as a relationship matures those feelings fade and reality sets in. Sometimes it isn't pretty. This film is about one of those times and it's truly hilarious.

	schema:reviewBody "Love Stinks is a generally unfunny comedy that will leave you wondering why anyone financed something that promised so little and delivered about what you would have expected from a simpleminded script and an unimpressive cast. Fans of French Stewart 3rd Rock From the Sun will at least be entertained by his many oneliners. Unfortunately they are the only elements that work in this illadvised movie. Like a lot of this midbudget stuff Love Stinks places its characters in ultra upscale surroundings and shows them living posh life styles trying to fool viewers into believing it is a highend production. But few moviegoers come from the richest portion of the 20 something demographic. Those living a less than swank lifestyle found viewer identification difficult so the movie was quickly pulled from its theatrical distribution. Almost everyone else will have difficulty connecting with the film which is basically the story of Seth's Stewart efforts to escape the grasp of the beautiful Chelsea his materialistic and totally controlling interior decorator. Like this is a continuing problem for all of us! Chelsea is played by former beauty queen Bridgette Wilson I Know What You Did Last Summer. Wilson is a better actress than she is given credit for people tend to dismiss her because of her nonacting background and she is well suited to this type of bad girl role. But the script gives her no opportunity to add dimension to this character. At least most of us have seen this sort of megamanipulative blonde at work. Desperate to marry Chelsea gets the rich Seth in her sights pressures him into a quick commitment moves in and alters his priorities then makes his life hell when he postpones the marriage. Most of this is told in an extended flashback necessary for no reason other than to pad the running length so the movie will qualify as a feature. Of course Wilson and Stewart's acting gets a boost by relative comparison to the barely competent performances of the supporting cast which includes talent challenged Tyra Banks and Tiffany Amber Thiesen. Steve Hytner Kenny Bania from Seinfeld also appears but adds little to the comic quality of the film. Love Stinks was written and directed by the guy who is blamed for creating Full House and Hangin' with Mr. Cooper. Ultimately all you are left with are Stewart's occasional oneliners and Wilson's beauty. These are not enough to carry a whole feature film but are at least something for which to be thankful if you should be forced to actually view the entire film. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

Desperate to marry Chelsea gets the rich Seth in her sights pressures him into a quick commitment moves in and alters his priorities then makes his life hell when he postpones the marriage. Most of this is told in an extended flashback necessary for no reason other than to pad the running length so the movie will qualify as a feature. Of course Wilson and Stewart's acting gets a boost by relative comparison to the barely competent performances of the supporting cast which includes talent challenged Tyra Banks and Tiffany Amber Thiesen. Steve Hytner Kenny Bania from Seinfeld also appears but adds little to the comic quality of the film. Love Stinks was written and directed by the guy who is blamed for creating Full House and Hangin' with Mr. Cooper. Ultimately all you are left with are Stewart's occasional oneliners and Wilson's beauty. These are not enough to carry a whole feature film but are at least something for which to be thankful if you should be forced to actually view the entire film. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.";

	schema:reviewBody "Right out of the chute I have to tell you this is one scary movie. That's right scary.  I mean to think that there are people running around out there in the world who actually think this kind of inane prattle is funny' is downright frightening.  And if anything about Love Stinks' directed by Jeff Franklin reflects real life in even some remote unimaginable way then please stop the world I wanna get off.  This is a one note movie about a television sitcom writer named Seth French Stewart who gets involved with a woman Chelsea Bridgette Wilson  with marriage on her mind and him in her sights.  She wants to he doesn't and that's about it one note and even at that it's out of tune.  Unfortunately what the makers of this movie would pass off as humor is no laughing matter it's merely a nojoke display of meanspiritedness and bad acting that is at it's best moments infantile gross and disgusting.  Comedy of course is the most subjective of genres and individual tastes and sensibilities will weigh in heavily in regards to how this movie will be received.  But to anyone with half a brain and any selfrespect whatsoever being subjected to ninety minutes or so of this would have to be considered nothing less than cruel and unusual punishment. Suffice to say that after this debacle director Franklin will not be making the Hollywood A' list anytime soon.  Nor the B' C' D' or F' lists.  The good news for him is that whatever project he takes on next couldn't possibly turn out any worse than this  and that means he's only got one way to go from here and that's up.  As far as the performances go French Stewart who obviously went into this with his eyes wide open had better hope that Third Rock From the Sun' lasts well...forever.  Because if this is the best he can manage after the jumpstart his career's received from TV he'd be well advised to take the Rock' money and run.  And Bridgette Wilson?  What on earth could've possessed her to take this part? With her talent and looks this is the best she could come up with?  It makes you wonder if she even read the script before signing on to this project. I'd like to think she either owed someone a BIG favor or better yet was the victim of a plot by a bitter and disgruntled manager or agent to malign her for personal as yet undisclosed reasons.  The bottom line is Stewart and Wilson both have a lot to offer it just seems so sad to see them wasted in something as unworthy as this ridiculous offensive movie that isn't worth the film that retains it's untoward images. The supporting cast includes Bill Bellamy as Larry Tyra Banks as Holly proving here that beauty does not necessarily equate with acting ability Steve Hytner as Marty Jason Bateman in a horrendous performance as Jesse and TiffaniAmber Thiessen as Rebecca.  A supercilious effort that has to resort to bathroom humor cat cruelty and an Elvis impersonator in it's feeble attempt at getting a laugh which it doesn't and note that even the word humor' is used loosely within the context of this sentence Love Stinks' is a movie to be avoided at all costs.  If someone perchance suggests to you that this one is entertaining and good for some laughs RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!  Or at least for the nearest exit.  Immediately.  And don't look back...  I rate this one 010.".

	schema:reviewBody "Firstly I'd like to mention that this movie is a rather overthetop and not very intelligent or realistic comedy containing rudeinsulting humour looking at the rating many would probably call it just stupid mainly about a woman who turns into a quite sheSatan when the welloff man she has sinked her claws on refuses to marry her. If that sounds like it will make you feel bad don't watch this go have a glass of milk and some cookies instead.After seeing 'Love Stinks' I thought it probably hasn't got a very good rating here because of bashing from some ferocious feminists and other people who take themselves and things in general too seriously. However when I checked the ratings which weren't very high as expected I saw that women didn't in general give lower points than men which was a pleasant surprise. I guess there are more than few women who can take even a little provocative joke after all.The reason why I expected women to bash this movie is that it portrays many women as either rather bimbolike many of the side characters or manipulative control freaks especially the main character and also to some extent her woman friend.The main plot revolves around Chelsea and Seth who meet at a party. Chelsea is the bridesmaid and Seth is the.. umm..

	onyx:emotionText "Firstly I'd like to mention that this movie is a rather overthetop and not very intelligent or realistic comedy containing rudeinsulting humour looking at the rating many would probably call it just stupid mainly about a woman who turns into a quite sheSatan when the welloff man she has sinked her claws on refuses to marry her. If that sounds like it will make you feel bad don't watch this go have a glass of milk and some cookies instead.After seeing 'Love Stinks' I thought it probably hasn't got a very good rating here because of bashing from some ferocious feminists and other people who take themselves and things in general too seriously. However when I checked the ratings which weren't very high as expected I saw that women didn't in general give lower points than men which was a pleasant surprise. I guess there are more than few women who can take even a little provocative joke after all.The reason why I expected women to bash this movie is that it portrays many women as either rather bimbolike many of the side characters or manipulative control freaks especially the main character and also to some extent her woman friend.The main plot revolves around Chelsea and Seth who meet at a party. Chelsea is the bridesmaid and Seth is the.. umm..

First once it gets going which takes about 15 minutes it has pretty much continuous hilarious jokes that are unique and wellwritten. Second it has a great surprise ending that makes it memorable. So again sure it's silly and a bit clich at times but it isn't for the Oscars. It's for watching something funny on a Wednesday night. It is probably a bit more of a guy movie than a girl movie but not by much. Both sides get it pretty well in this one. If you appreciate humor you will most certainly laugh and possibly very hard.

	schema:reviewBody "Technically speaking I have seen this Fritz Lang silent scifi before but this was the first time I saw it in any shape by which I could fairly evaluate it. I had previously watched Metropolis on a public domain VHS from the 80s. The print was terribly scratched and while there were a few memorable images the story was so incoherent that their context was usually unclear. Though this was clearly not the best way to see Metropolis I was still left with an impression of this supposed classic as a dusty museum piece that was praised by critics because they were expected to like it. So finally seeing a restored and expanded copy was as much as a revelation as seeing Once Upon a Time in the West letter boxed in how it led me to reevaluate my opinion of the movie. The movie is a strange mixture of political speculation political parable apocalyptic fantasy and religious allegory. It depicts a futuristic city that is divided between the wretched workers who toil in the depths tending the machines and the upper classes who dwell in luxury up in the skyscrapers. The hero the idle pampered son of the city's supervisor Joh Fredersen changes his ways and becomes concerned with the plight of the lower classes after catching a glimpse of Maria the Madonna of the workers. His father meanwhile is plotting to thwart Maria with the help of the mad scientist Rotwang who has discovered how to create robot replicas of human beings. One of the most surprising things about watching this version is just how much I didn't see. In addition to restoring scenes to the film the DVD also includes inter titles to explain pieces of the plot that cannot be found in any version. With these changes the story becomes much clearer particularly the machinations of Rotwang and the master of Metropolis. Perhaps most importantly a whole new subplot is added involving the hero's dead mother Hel who was loved by both his father and Rotwang. With this clarification of the backstory the close but adversarial relationship between Rotwang and Fredersen becomes much clearer. In some ways it recalls the family backstory of the Star Wars movies. Of course the real strength of Metropolis isn't the story which is pretty silly and probably wouldn't have worked in anything but a silent film but its amazing visuals which in their scale and ambitiousness look forward to 2001 and Blade Runner. Actually though in most respects silent films now look primitive one area in which they have the edge over modern filmmaking is in their frequently grandiose production design. Metropolis employs huge sets to show the hellish factories of the subterranean world. The models of the city's towering skyscrapers are also surprisingly convincing for a 1920s film. Even beyond the expansive production design and for the time special effects Lang's visuals are all consistently inventive. The robot Maria provides some of the movie's most iconic images including her transformation into a human being. In a later scene she performs for upperclass men in a nightclub and as she performs a striptease that in 1920s Germany was apparently seen as very decadent the screen is filled with wet staring eyeballs. A sign of Lang's visual lavishness and the studio's that he doesn't hesitate to throw in lavish dream and hallucination sequences to drive home a point or illustrate a character's state of mind. For instance when the hero first enters the subterranean city and sees rows upon rows of workers toiling on huge machines he imagines the furnace transforming into a monstrous idol's head into which the workers are being sacrificed. At another point while he's sick in bed he imagines statues of the Seven Deadly Sins coming to life and advancing out from a wall in a cathedral. When Maria preaches her message of peace and understanding to the workers she tells them the story of the Tower of Babel of a management vs. labor parable and Lang gives us spectacular images of the tower's construction and fall. In a sound film many of these scenes would have seemed redundant and overliteral but they're what silent cinema does best tell a story without the advantage or obstacle of dialogue. The story is a little slow to start but once it picks up Metropolis becomes one of the most directly involving silent films that I've seen. In addition to being a pioneering example of the cinematic possibilities of science fiction Metropolis also has to be one of the earliest disaster films as the workers riot and sabotage the machines endangering the entire city. Lang creates a sense of rising fury and nihilism in the last hour that in a strange way reminded me of what was going to happen to Germany in less than 20 years.".

	schema:headline " Early science fiction story that presents a pessimistic prediction of a future society.";
	schema:reviewBody "Who ever heard of an epic science fiction film? Especially in the 1920s? Sure some science fiction movies are huge today such as George Lucas' latest goofy Star Wars movie but in 1926 Fritz Lang came out with a brilliant film about what the future would be like if people went on living the way they were living back then. And sure enough we went right ahead living the way we were living the population got bigger and more crowded and now modern society is not a whole lot different from what was presented in Metropolis. The story is about a young rich kid without a care in the world who becomes concerned about the way that society Metropolis was run by his father John Frederson the master of Metropolis. He lives in a Pleasure Garden' high above the level of the workers' and he worries about what would happen if the huge number of workers were to turn against his father given the terrible conditions under which they live and work. Some of the best scenes in the film take place in the underground mines showing the workers portrayed as little more than components on a gigantic sinister looking machine. The scene where the machine overheated even contained some impressive stunts as well as interesting cinematography as the machine transforms into a giant devillooking monster.  After countless workers are consumed by it no wonder this was Hitler's favorite film they are immediately replaced by other workers who go right to the same spots that the previous men left and resume their robotic movements. If some of these scenes men can be seen being carried away on stretchers after having been injured and the rest of the workers keep right on working hardly even noticing.The way that the workers are portrayed as lifeless machines is one of the more potent elements of this film as well as the most revealing about the directors intentions. When his son complains about the tragic things that go on in the mines Frederson replies that such accidents are unavoidable but his son still insists that they deserve credit for building the city. This is the kind of content that foreshadows some serious mutiny and at the same time it shows what may very well happen when large groups of people feel mistreated. Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups' is a saying that doesn't necessarily only apply to stupid people as Metropolis suggests. Fritz Lang brilliantly portrays this very complex story with extremely limited dialogue and the result is still compelling today. The special effects in this film are decades ahead of its time  it even resembles The Fifth Element in many ways except that the two films can hardly be compared  and the acting and especially the elaborately created sets are stunning to say the least. An excellent film Metropolis is one of the few that should never be forgotten.".

	onyx:emotionText "Who ever heard of an epic science fiction film? Especially in the 1920s? Sure some science fiction movies are huge today such as George Lucas' latest goofy Star Wars movie but in 1926 Fritz Lang came out with a brilliant film about what the future would be like if people went on living the way they were living back then. And sure enough we went right ahead living the way we were living the population got bigger and more crowded and now modern society is not a whole lot different from what was presented in Metropolis. The story is about a young rich kid without a care in the world who becomes concerned about the way that society Metropolis was run by his father John Frederson the master of Metropolis. He lives in a Pleasure Garden' high above the level of the workers' and he worries about what would happen if the huge number of workers were to turn against his father given the terrible conditions under which they live and work. Some of the best scenes in the film take place in the underground mines showing the workers portrayed as little more than components on a gigantic sinister looking machine. The scene where the machine overheated even contained some impressive stunts as well as interesting cinematography as the machine transforms into a giant devillooking monster.  After countless workers are consumed by it no wonder this was Hitler's favorite film they are immediately replaced by other workers who go right to the same spots that the previous men left and resume their robotic movements. If some of these scenes men can be seen being carried away on stretchers after having been injured and the rest of the workers keep right on working hardly even noticing.The way that the workers are portrayed as lifeless machines is one of the more potent elements of this film as well as the most revealing about the directors intentions. When his son complains about the tragic things that go on in the mines Frederson replies that such accidents are unavoidable but his son still insists that they deserve credit for building the city. This is the kind of content that foreshadows some serious mutiny and at the same time it shows what may very well happen when large groups of people feel mistreated. Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups' is a saying that doesn't necessarily only apply to stupid people as Metropolis suggests. Fritz Lang brilliantly portrays this very complex story with extremely limited dialogue and the result is still compelling today. The special effects in this film are decades ahead of its time  it even resembles The Fifth Element in many ways except that the two films can hardly be compared  and the acting and especially the elaborately created sets are stunning to say the least. An excellent film Metropolis is one of the few that should never be forgotten.";

In any case whatever I had seen before had nothing like the clarity and beauty of the Kino restoration.  I expected to be distracted by the restoration's technique of concise written descriptions of missing sequences but the narrative coherence that these provided was definitely worth it.  As exaggerated as the style of acting seems by contemporary standards some performances such as the Master of the city are amazingly nuanced and layered and Brigitte Helm is stunning as both Maria and her evil clone. The meticulous design of the film the unerring camera placement and Lang's muscular choreography of the crowd scenes are breathtaking. I'd thought of METROPOLIS as a curiosity important  dull but now I've come to appreciate it as the seminal work it has always been.".

The special effects were far ahead of their time and the set designs were in some cases phenomenal. I can see where some people may not enjoy this movie. It is hard for some to really appreciate a movie that is 77 years old because a lot has happened in film since then. Yet if you look at the basic elements of this movie  its story characters artwork cinematography etc. I believe this movie has just as much to offer now as it must have in the late 1920's. Also take into consideration the asthetics of German expressionist film when viewing this. The performances and set designs are going to be over the top. That was part of the style.

Huge buildings explosions flooding picture phones however did he come up with the very idea? transformation sequences robots and so on. No movie has ever pulled the limits of special effects as much as this one. Star Wars and Jurassic Park are also known as limit pullers in special effects but they don't even come close.Then you have the filming. Everything is perfect. The use of body language is tremendous the light setting perfect everything well timed and perfectly captured by the camera. I've never been witness to such a treat in filming other places.And the story!!! Perfect in every detail. Intriguing exciting and thrilling with lots of religious undertones and tyranic leaders. No wonder Hitler liked this movie...I don't know how the original music of the film was but the new music for the restored 139 minute version I saw was really good and moodseting.All in all.

If you belong to the first category you can lead a life of luxury above ground but if you're a worker your life isn't worth a penny and you're doomed to perilous labor underground. The further expansions and intrigues in the screenplay are too astonishing to spoil so I strongly advise that you check out the film yourself. It's essential viewing anyway! Metropolis is a very demanding filmexperience and definitely not always entertaining. But as it is often the case with silentcinema classics the respect and admiration you'll develop during watching it will widely excel the enjoymentaspect. Fritz' brutal visual style still looks innovative and few directors since were able to recreate a similarly nightmarish composition of horizontal and vertical lines. Many supposedly 'restored' versions have been released over the years in 1984 and 2002 for example but the 1926version is still the finest in my opinion even though that one already isn't as detailed and punctual as Lang intended it.

	schema:reviewBody "'Metropolis' is my alltime favourite movie so I've saved this for the last review that I plan to write for this wonderful website IMDb. I've enjoyed sharing my experiences of the movies I've seen but now I'm moving on to other passions.Although written by Fritz Lang's wife Thea von Harbou 'Metropolis' was originally Lang's idea he was inspired by the sight of New York's skyscrapers when he sailed to America in 1925. During his American trip he visited the set of 'The Phantom of the Opera' and met Lon Chaney! Too bad the encounter wasn't filmed.Despite its epic power 'Metropolis' makes very little sense. The two major male characters are a father and son named Freder and Fredersen so why is the one named Fredersen the father not son of the one cried Freder? Why does the master of Metropolis deliberately connive to destroy the city that he built? Why is Rotwang's crude little cottage the only preFredersen building that wasn't demolished during the construction of this city? Von Harbou's very long and unwieldy novelisation of her script establishes this fact but never explains it. How and why did Rotwang's hightech laboratory manage to get constructed BENEATH that cottage without disturbing it?For modern viewers some of the plot's incoherence can be blamed on missing footage particularly in American prints. The distributors for this film's original Stateside release commissioned playwright Channing Pollock to translate the German titles. A major subplot of the backstory features a deceased woman named Hel who was married to Rotwang but left him to marry Fredersen and give birth to Freder. This unseen woman's name could not easily be changed for the American version due to a couple of shots of her memorial engraved with the Teutonic name HEL. Apparently Pollock feared that American viewers would be offended by this word's similarity to 'Hell' so he simply excised the entire subplot from this long movie.The reallife drama on the set of 'Metropolis' must've been quite interesting in itself. Mad scientist Rotwang alias Doctor Strangeglove is played by actor Rudolf KleinRogge who had been married to scenarist von Harbou before she left him to marry Fritz Lang the mastermind of this film. In 'Metropolis' Rotwang's wife left him to marry the master of Metropolis. I'd love to know how KleinRogge felt about the fact that his reallife marital and sexual situation was the inspiration for key plot elements of this movie ... and I wonder how KleinRogge felt about knowing that the entire cast and crew knew this as well.Most astonishing about this gargantuan production is the fact that nearly all of 'Metropolis' was actually built to scale with just a couple of miniatures.Trivia tidbit actress Brigitte Helm was cast in the dual female role largely because she was flatchested and therefore she could easily fit inside the mechanical suit for the Robotrix. A more busty actress would have suffered constant discomfort inside those galvanised bosoms of the metal costume. I learnt this more than 20 years ago from an eldery Austrian stagehand who worked on the film.For all its flaws 'Metropolis' will always be my favourite movie. I've enjoyed writing all these reviews for IMDb. The joy of posting my reviews on this site has brought me many friendships and a few enemies. Well you can't win 'em all.Nitrate film stock doesn't last forever and all good things come to a happy ending. This is my last review here. I'll keep watching movies but other passions are important to me as well. Thank you IMDb and thank you to everyone who has read my reviews. I will happily rate 'Metropolis' a full 10 out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "'Metropolis' is my alltime favourite movie so I've saved this for the last review that I plan to write for this wonderful website IMDb. I've enjoyed sharing my experiences of the movies I've seen but now I'm moving on to other passions.Although written by Fritz Lang's wife Thea von Harbou 'Metropolis' was originally Lang's idea he was inspired by the sight of New York's skyscrapers when he sailed to America in 1925. During his American trip he visited the set of 'The Phantom of the Opera' and met Lon Chaney! Too bad the encounter wasn't filmed.Despite its epic power 'Metropolis' makes very little sense. The two major male characters are a father and son named Freder and Fredersen so why is the one named Fredersen the father not son of the one cried Freder? Why does the master of Metropolis deliberately connive to destroy the city that he built? Why is Rotwang's crude little cottage the only preFredersen building that wasn't demolished during the construction of this city?

	schema:headline " Stunning imagery pity about the plot";
	schema:reviewBody "One definitely can't fault the breadth and ambition of Fritz Lang's vision even if as always with depictions of the future there are a few forgivable blind spots. The cars that swarm up and down the multiple levels of Metropolis are unmistakably the standard models of the 1920s as are the flyingmachines that buzz about them while the business dress of tomorrow's rulers unlike their exotic leisure wear doesn't appear to have advanced one iota!H.G.Wells criticised the film for its adherence to arty image over scientific rigour and as a piece of coherent science fiction it's certainly as lacking as he claimed. The machines exist to appear awesome and to torment their workers rather than to perform any apparent task and there is no explanation of how this society functions how it evolved or how it is sustained let alone of the incongruities that must surely lie behind such anomalous locations as the catacombs and the cathedral. But Wells' own futuristic film Things to Come conceived in direct riposte to Lang's 'unscientific' approach is tedious and talky as a result didactic in its heavyfooted philosophy and explanations and lacking in artistic vision Metropolis may be 'soft' SF but its approach undoubtedly makes for better cinema.I am not however impressed by it as a film. Masterpiece of Modernism it may be  but great design and special effects can't save today's bigbudget clunkers from deficiencies of character and plot and they don't save this one. Ironically I suspect that its reputation has benefited greatly from its being the only silent film many of its viewers have ever encountered reading through the IMDb pages I see wellmeaning comments like Great  when you consider how primitive cinema was in 1927 and once you get used to the fact that it takes about ten gestures to convey one sentence... It wasn't  and it doesn't!As silent films go this is in many places agonizingly slow and repetitious marred by clumsy acting tendentious titles and overwrought gestures. By the late 1920s cinema had progressed far beyond this laboured pantomime in Lang's case the heavy stylisation may have been a deliberate choice but compared to the fluidity of contemporaries such as Sjostrom's The Wind or The Scarlet Letter Asquith's Underground or Shooting Stars and Murnau's Sunrise the film comes across as ten years behind the times. The problem is not necessarily with the actors  Brigitte Helm as has been observed does an excellent job in differentiating her two characters  but with the direction and pacing.We saw the restored version with the original Gottfried Huppertz score the latter didn't always seem to fit too well with pops jumps and awkward silences but this was I assume due either to the difficulty of fitting it to allow for the missing material or to problems in the projection booth when running a newlyarrived print for the first time. However the painstaking summary of the various 'missing scenes' only ended up increasing my appreciation of what a good job had been done in the editingdown in the first place! To take a single example where the edited version conveys Freder's sudden recollection that he is supposed to be the workers' longawaited 'mediator' via the simple juxtaposition of three shots  the shiftchange whistle announcing the meeting the catacombs and Freder suddenly struck by an idea and rushing off  the restoration betrays the fact that a couple of scenes of mimed dialogue were originally provided to spell out the message at painstaking length...It is interesting to see how it was done but most of the cuts are either an improvement or a very clever abridgement and by and large I didn't feel that what was omitted had been any great loss. In fact frankly I felt that the film was in need of further editing at certain points such as Rotwang's pursuit of Maria through the catacombs. She screams and runs and screams and runs and is pursued by a searchlight effect it's clever selfconsciously clever the first couple of times but the repetition becomes tedious to the point of caricature. Plot infelicities abound in increasing numbers culminating in the infamous 'Hunchback of Notre Dame'style ending where the mad scientist carries off the girl across the roof of the cathedral hotly pursued by Our Hero which raised giggles in a hitherto serious and respectful audience with which I couldn't help but sympathise.This is a film to see once in a lifetime so that you can say that you have seen it  not least because most of the impact lies in the visuals. But it's all surface and no substance the characters act arbitrarily the plot is subservient to the Message the pacing is like treacle the storytelling technique is primitive and really all it has going for it is the visual flair and the special effects. I quite honestly believe that this work would be better appreciated as a set of stills in a glossy brochure an exhibit in a design exhibition. This is not cinema as I love it  it's innovative it may be Art but as an actual film it's only a poor shadow.".

	schema:reviewBody "There can be no understanding between the hands and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator. This is the predominant theme of Metropolis and director Fritz Lang finds numerous ways to say and visualize his message during the course of the film. The movie relies on repeated visual imagery to make it's point and does so effectively even if tedious at times. Particularly effective is the representation of the worker society as an almost single living unit moving trance like to their appointed time and task. The use of a ten hour clock in the workers' chamber constantly draws our attention as does the hangdog posture of the individual slaves who grind out their workday as if in a daze.Amid this rabble worker Maria Brigitte Helm is the inspirational voice of the workers offering hope for a brighter future by a mediator yet to appear. However the Master of Metropolis John Frederson Alfred Abel sees in her a way to quell the underlying frustration of the workers commissioning his scientist Rotwang to create a robot Maria to plant discord among the workers. Rotwang's laboratory would have done Frankenstein proud and the creation of the robot is a marvel of cinematic imagery. The robot Maria's belly dance transforms into a scene of such raw energy and sexual awareness that it awakens the statues of the Seven Deadly Sins one of the master strokes of this expressionist film.So much imagery in fact is layered into Metropolis that it's safe to say that repeat viewings will lead to even more interpretations of it's vision and not simply for it's denunciation of a class society. Both timely and timeless the film captures a dynamism that inspires passion even after nearly eighty years following it's original release.".

	schema:headline " The Mother of Modern Science Fiction Spoiler";
	schema:reviewBody "This review contains Spoilers. But since the story is by far the least reason to watch Metropolis feel free to still read it even if you haven't watched it yet.Metropolis is a film that was far ahead of it's time. It influenced a great lot of sciencefiction films and how The Blade Runner Batman or Dark City would look like if there wasn't Metropolis  who knows. Even The Matrix Reloaded is heavily inspired by this classic that is as old as my grandmother. Now what is it all about? About Freder the son of the head of the city of Metropolis a Christlike figure who falls in love with the preacher of the working class a saintlike woman who happens to be named Maria. When a robot who is modeled to look like Maria makes the workers almost extinguish their city and their children Maria and Freder save the children and in the end Freder makes his father and the workers cooperate for a brighter future.Sounds silly to you? Yes and that's exactly what the story is silly. That's also the reason why still today Metropolis isn't accepted as the masterpiece it is by a few film buffs. But these people don't understand one thing A good film does more than only tell a story. A film can be great even without a story at all and a silly story combined with amazing visuals can make you forget all the other weaknesses a film has. And wow what amazing images Metropolis offers. What an art direction! What wonderful special effects! And remember as I already said this film is as old as my grandmother! Just have a look at the workers. They hardly ever seem to be individuals. In the mass scenes they look like one big creature moving forward or backwards. When they are working they look more like machines than like human beings whereas the machines resemble monsters more than they do technical devices best seen in the moments when Freder hallucinates and sees the big machine as a workereating Moloch. We also see a worker and later Freder work on a machine that looks like a clock with 100 blinking light bulbs doing some that looks as exhausting as it looks senseless. Or think of Rotwang the mad inventor who lives in a little hut that looks in this film like it was from another world. He has a black prosthesis for his right hand it's not a coincidence that Stanley Kubrick gave his mad scientistinventor Dr. Strangelove a prosthesis for his right hand too. He builds the robot that he makes to look like Maria and that transformation scene is one of the most magnificent scenes ever and looks more convincing than some scenes of modern scifi flicks. I also have to mention Brigitte Helm who plays Maria and the robot  and the look in her eyes would already be enough to tell which of her characters is on screen at the moment. If something like awards already would have been given in the 1920s she sure would have walked home with quite a bunch of them. And just look at her sexy dance! It is just as memorable as the shot of the many eyes watching her dance  or the many faces watching her preach just a few minutes later. Metropolis is a film no scififan should miss. I had the good luck that my first viewing of Metropolis one year ago was in a cinema when it was a rereleased after its restoration. I can only recommend you to watch it in a cinema if you have the possibility to as Metropolis is just as 2001  A Space Odyssey one of those rare films that are masterpieces on your TV set but a revelation on the big screen.".

	schema:headline " How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?";
	schema:reviewBody "Francis Ford Coppola once said that 'Apocalypse Now' wasn't just about Vietnam is was Vietnam. In a similar way 'Metropolis' isn't just about the Twentieth Century it is the Twentieth Century. Almost every image in it reflects or more often predicts the realities of life in the West over the past hundred years in a way that is truly uncanny.From small details  the traffic jams and blackouts that plague city dwellers  to major historical events  the climactic flood predicts every industrial disaster that has destroyed the lives of thousands of workers from Chernobyl to the Bhopal disaster whilst Fredersen's vision of workers being fed to Moloch can't help but bring to mind the holocaust  'Metropolis' feels prescient in any number of ways. In the image of the Manhattan skyline Lang really did find the perfect symbol of the coming century  progressive new faceless oppressive.This is far from the simple Marxist fable it is often taken for  although the Socialist message can hardly be ignored. It's also a Christian parable Maria flanked by crosses is counterbalanced by the Machine brought to life under a pentagram informed by the book of Revelation a retelling of the Orpheus myth with Freder as Orpheus and Maria as Eurydice lost in the underworld and a Kafkaesque nightmare of depersonalisation although the Gothic expressionistic production design is a long way from Kafka's more sterile style.It's also lest we forget a silly adventuremelodrama with a mad scientist an evil twin a bad father with a noble son and an impossibly virtuous idealised heroine. In many ways it anticipates 'Star Wars' in dressing up mythic standards with Science Fiction tropes  with Fredersen as the misguided King Freder as the handsome Prince Maria the goodhearted peasant's daughter Rotwang as a scheming sorcerer and the Machine as the wicked witch appropriately burnt at the stake by the 'villagers'.The Machine'Man' a confusing name for a construction so obviously feminine is the single most indelible image of the film the scene in which Rotwang brings her to life for the first time is a real moment of magic and awe untarnished by eighty subsequent years of cinematic showmanship. Even better is the scene in which she becomes a duplicate of Maria  such an obvious influence on James Whale's 'Frankenstein' that it's hard not to shout out 'It's alive!'. The optical effects are years ahead of their time certainly the best of their kind until the sixties at least. It also marks the beginning of Brigitte Helm's truly extraordinary turn as the false Maria.This is only the third silent film I've seen after 'Nosferatu' and 'The Cabinet of Dr Caligari' and it's taken me a while to acclimatise to the acting style which can seem close to parody. What it really reminds me of however is modern dance which similarly seeks to communicate with the audience visually rather than verbally. 'Metropolis' encourages this comparison with the highly choreographed movements of the workers operating the machinery. Bearing this in mind Helm is hugely impressive in multiple roles. Maria could be a rather dull and virtuous heroine she enters the film surrounded by poor children in rags but Helm invests her with enormous energy and expressiveness. It helps that the script allows her to take an unusually proactive role for a female character organising workers' meetings and racing to the rescue of the endangered children. However it is her performance as bad Maria vamping up a storm that lingers in the memory  the twitching jerking movements of her head and body the Anne Robinson style halfwink that changes the shape of her face that malicious little grin that makes it hard not to root for her mischief. The entirely weird 'erotic dance' that she performs isn't technically very good or erotic but it is utterly unforgettable. Subtextually she's the Whore of Babylon.The other performances are mainly very good particularly Alfred Abel as Fredersen proving that it is possible to underplay in a silent film.

	onyx:emotionText "Francis Ford Coppola once said that 'Apocalypse Now' wasn't just about Vietnam is was Vietnam. In a similar way 'Metropolis' isn't just about the Twentieth Century it is the Twentieth Century. Almost every image in it reflects or more often predicts the realities of life in the West over the past hundred years in a way that is truly uncanny.From small details  the traffic jams and blackouts that plague city dwellers  to major historical events  the climactic flood predicts every industrial disaster that has destroyed the lives of thousands of workers from Chernobyl to the Bhopal disaster whilst Fredersen's vision of workers being fed to Moloch can't help but bring to mind the holocaust  'Metropolis' feels prescient in any number of ways. In the image of the Manhattan skyline Lang really did find the perfect symbol of the coming century  progressive new faceless oppressive.This is far from the simple Marxist fable it is often taken for  although the Socialist message can hardly be ignored. It's also a Christian parable Maria flanked by crosses is counterbalanced by the Machine brought to life under a pentagram informed by the book of Revelation a retelling of the Orpheus myth with Freder as Orpheus and Maria as Eurydice lost in the underworld and a Kafkaesque nightmare of depersonalisation although the Gothic expressionistic production design is a long way from Kafka's more sterile style.It's also lest we forget a silly adventuremelodrama with a mad scientist an evil twin a bad father with a noble son and an impossibly virtuous idealised heroine. In many ways it anticipates 'Star Wars' in dressing up mythic standards with Science Fiction tropes  with Fredersen as the misguided King Freder as the handsome Prince Maria the goodhearted peasant's daughter Rotwang as a scheming sorcerer and the Machine as the wicked witch appropriately burnt at the stake by the 'villagers'.The Machine'Man' a confusing name for a construction so obviously feminine is the single most indelible image of the film the scene in which Rotwang brings her to life for the first time is a real moment of magic and awe untarnished by eighty subsequent years of cinematic showmanship. Even better is the scene in which she becomes a duplicate of Maria  such an obvious influence on James Whale's 'Frankenstein' that it's hard not to shout out 'It's alive!'. The optical effects are years ahead of their time certainly the best of their kind until the sixties at least. It also marks the beginning of Brigitte Helm's truly extraordinary turn as the false Maria.This is only the third silent film I've seen after 'Nosferatu' and 'The Cabinet of Dr Caligari' and it's taken me a while to acclimatise to the acting style which can seem close to parody. What it really reminds me of however is modern dance which similarly seeks to communicate with the audience visually rather than verbally. 'Metropolis' encourages this comparison with the highly choreographed movements of the workers operating the machinery. Bearing this in mind Helm is hugely impressive in multiple roles. Maria could be a rather dull and virtuous heroine she enters the film surrounded by poor children in rags but Helm invests her with enormous energy and expressiveness. It helps that the script allows her to take an unusually proactive role for a female character organising workers' meetings and racing to the rescue of the endangered children. However it is her performance as bad Maria vamping up a storm that lingers in the memory  the twitching jerking movements of her head and body the Anne Robinson style halfwink that changes the shape of her face that malicious little grin that makes it hard not to root for her mischief. The entirely weird 'erotic dance' that she performs isn't technically very good or erotic but it is utterly unforgettable. Subtextually she's the Whore of Babylon.The other performances are mainly very good particularly Alfred Abel as Fredersen proving that it is possible to underplay in a silent film. Only Rudolf KleinRogge hits any wrong notes  difficult as it undoubtedly must be to play a mad scientist in a silent film with subtlety some of his more unrestrained gesticulations leave you worried about the safety of the other actors.Ultimately though it all inevitably comes back to the imagery. Lang's film remains unmatched even today.

	schema:reviewBody "We have seen so many movies now that even those of us who study them tend to forget where certain familiarities were born. The science fiction elements presented in Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis' are so familiar to us that they have become not just the genre standard but almost a given. The notion of a city as an urban hell ruled by the upperclass and operated by slavelike poor. The notion of the city that seems to touch the heavens. The notion of a mad scientist giggling in his lab as he plays God. The lone hero who discovers the diabolical machinations of the villain and tries to throw a monkey wrench into his plan. These elements can be found in this film's ancestors 'Frankenstein' 'Batman' 'Gattaca' and the cities of 'Blade Runner' 'Star Wars' and 'The Fifth Element'. All of these films contain elements that were inspired by Lang's work.'Metropolis' has gone down in history as one of the most influential films ever made certainly one of the most studied silent films and yet the movie sort of languishes. After its success in 1927 the film has had an uneasy time. It's pedigree as a silent film turns off the usual science fiction audience and it is sort of a footnote in the history of the genre. One restored version after another has tried to reconstruct the film as best it could because some of the footage of the film has been lost through neglect and silly studio censoring. Some of the restorations work but most do not so we sometimes wonder what an experience this must have been like in 1927. Unless a lost version surfaces as it did with the recently uncovered print of Valentino's 1922 film 'Beyond the Rocks' the complete work my never be seen again. The restored version released on DVD in 2001 was based on a digital restoration at 2K resolution from all available sources. It's the best version that I've seen and I would highly recommend that one if you haven't seen the film. The worst is a 1994 print put out by GoodTimes video which contains not an ounce of restoration the film in grainy and difficult to see it doesn't even have a soundtrack. I call that one the worst because I'm still a little ambivalent about the 1984 restored version by Georgio Moroder with color tinting good sound effects not so good and a soundtrack that includes songs by Loverboy Freddy Mercury Bonnie Tyler Adam Ant and Pat Benatar yuck!.Those who study the film myself included find the story impenetrable. Some films you can easily decipher but 'Metropolis' has a plot that is so maddeningly erratic that it's hard to pin it down as a whole. Many conceded that as a fault but I think it adds to the film's chaotic nature. It takes place in the future restored versions offer title cards that suggest that it's the year 2000 but I don't go by that in an overcrowded city with immense skyscrapers the Gothic sometimes grotesque architecture suggests that the buildings were constructed in a hurry. The rich in Metropolis are content with their lives dancing in their penthouses and spending their money. The poor work as slaves beneath the city like cogs in a machine. Lang choreographs the scenes in the subterranean levels magnificently so that the workers are never out of step. They don't so much work as toil under oppression like Ramses' slaves building his pyramids. The rich and poor of Metropolis are ignorant of one another. One person that isn't ignorant of the class division is Joh Fredersen a ruthless businessman who rules Metropolis from his office.His son Freder happily enjoys the Pleasure Gardens one day when he notices a woman rising from the underground caves with a group of the worker's children. Curious he follows her to the depths and is aghast at the tyranny in motion there. The woman is Maria a revolutionary who holds sermons to remind the workers that a peaceful resolution can and must be found.Freder uncovers a plot by Rotwang the mad scientist to create a robotic version of Maria to convince the workers to rise up and take arms. This leads to the film's most famous scene when the robot becomes flesh and blood and the false prophet opens her eyes to reveal two dead sparkling orbs. Rotwang kidnaps the real Maria and sends the false one to convince the workers to rise up and then taunt the rich men and drive them into a sexual frenzy.Then all Hell breaks loose but the rest I must leave to you to discover.Lang based the film on the book written by his wife Thea Von Harbou. In the book the story is about a chaotic as the film and therefore less successful the difference is that Lang has the visuals to suggest the chaos where the book did not. He uses every technical tool at his disposal to visualize the Hell of the subterranean machine run by the workers. At one point Freder disguised as a worker witnesses one of the huge machines explode and visualizes it as a horrendous monster swallowing workers by the dozen. Another suggests an odd device a giant dial in which the worker is made to keep the arms in the same place as the light bulbs go on and off around it's edge. The machine doesn't seem to have any purpose until Freder imagines it as a giant clock and tries to pull the arms forward to end the merciless day.The film is one of the pinnacles of German Expressionism astonishing in its use of light and shadow. One of the best examples is the scene in which Rotwang pursues the real Maria through the caves using only a beam of light to strike terror as he closes in. Another brilliant moment comes with Maria's erotic dance as the men gawk the camera filled with their moist eyes. This scene was completely removed after the initial release and not restored until home video.Other moments have deeper resonance. There is something unsettling about the hundreds of workers toiling in the underground caves. Walking to work they march with their heads down dressed in uniforms and caps. It reminded me of the Jews being led into the Nazi Death Camps. There is a buried foreshadowing of Hitler. More obvious are Lang's biblical references. The rise of the city parallels Maria's retelling of the story of the Tower of Babel. The giant pentagram in Rotwang's lab as he plays God. The breathtaking image of the plaguebringer who comes wielding an obscene scythe. The very heaven and hell nature of Metropolis itself. There is even a Christlike quality in Maria who gives her sermons and reinforces that indeed blessed are the peacemakers.These elements and images are brought to the film because of Lang's insistence on no less then absolute perfection. He was known as a sometimes cruel taskmaster working his cast and crew like a dictator. He cast some 20000 extras 1500 of them for the Tower of Babel sequence alone and worked them from morning till night. The water which covered the set for the climactic flood was ice cold. Many of the extras were soaked through from morning till night. Actress Brigette Helm was nearly killed several times once by a fall and another by the fact that the bonfire scene was real! Helm was so rattled by her experience working with Lang that she thereafter refused to make another film with him.I could go on and on this film all great films invite lengthy discussions. It can be seen in at least a hundred different ways as a foreshadowing of fascism or the tyranny of communism or just capitalism boiling over. But when you get down to it the best way to view 'Metropolis' is not as a film to pick apart but simply as a film of it's time Lang created the story of a world gone mad while the world around him was going mad.".

	schema:headline " Great Work";
	schema:reviewBody "MetropolisMetropolis is one of the most exciting and exceptional works of art that humankind has produced. This epic science fiction film is one of Germany's famous silent movies created by Fritz Lang and liberated in 1927 the period between the two World Wars.This movie represents the expressionist cinema and shows us the repression of human needs by the machine age. Lang's creation of a selfdestructive society is a protest against the machine age. Metropolis is one of the most magnificent cities of 2026 is kept 'alive' by the unceasing work of the underground people who live in slavery and is enjoyed by wealthy and educated people. The Austrian director of the movie Fritz Lang presents the story of a master John Federsen who sees people as machines working constantly to maintain the luxury and technology of his metropolis. On the other side his son Freder falls in love with one of the underground workers who is a spiritual leader for the slaves. The son recognizes the unsentimental heart of his father and starts a revolution. The city gets flooded and Maria Freder's love regains the workers' trust after a robot had stolen her identity she finds her loved one after saving the city's children and the workers shake hands with the master.Expressionism tries to simplify the world and to understand it emotionally in a subjective way. It is very important to understand this definition of this dynamic violent and distorted movement in order to understand that Lang tried to externalize his own internal vision of the world through simple expressions. The name 'metropolis' comes from the Greeks and means mothercity. It has this significance because a metropolis is the biggest form of a technologically and economically developed city. Nevertheless referring to the movie name this film can be considered as the mother city of all cinematic clichs. In this story there are two main characters Maria and Freder. These two characters are also the heroes of the story because they are the ones who rescue the population from being drowned in the flood. John Federson is a person full of empowering feelings who only thinks of himself and of his city forgetting about the ones who work for him. All the fantasies that he has come true through the power of his workers but he never thinks about the danger they are in while working for him. This man wants so much power that he is almost hypnotized by it he is obsessed and possessed by the power of inventions and creations.On the other hand Maria is just a symbol of munificence her soul is pure and she is seen like an angel who brings peace to the world. Maria convoys the people in a church settling area. She is shown as sanctity a holy person that is surrounded by the light of the candles. She is positioned higher than the workers who carefully listen to her as she speaks about peace unity and their salvation by a mediator that will soon come. Her eyes inspire confidence and kindness as she kisses Freder in the church scene. In general all she does is for the good of humanity. One thing that she repeats in the movie is 'Between the head and hands there must be a heart. ' This means that she realizes the bad things that the head John Frederson does and the good things that the hands workers do. But she knows that these workers should not be treated poorly or like robots and that she can be the heart which can persuade the head and the hands to cooperate to come to common interests. Maria as her name suggests is also a biblical motif. She explains to the workers the story of the Tower of Babel. The workers in the story destroy this tower which parallels how the movie will end with the destruction of the machines by the workforce. Maria is still the representation of Jesus mother because she is trying to save the lives of the underground children. She would sacrifice herself and alike Mother Mary she has a strong faith in the creator of the world. All the scenes of this film are perfectly created at the eye level so that anyone is able to view the action. However there is also a bird's eye view at the beginning of the movie as the panorama of the city is shown from high above the ground. This view was created to give us an impression of how widely extended and huge Metropolis is. In addition the focus of the dramatic camera angles with bold shadows is on the disproportioned landscape as well as on the rightangled buildings. There are moments in which the camera focuses on fast movement scenes like the dancing of the robot in the nightclub and scenes where it focuses on slow movement like in the beginning of the film where the 'slaves' are shown going into the working area at a certain pace and aligned as robots. When more people are involved in a scene like the one in which all the children are surrounding Maria as she rings the danger bell the angles are vertical triangular but when only one person is focused there is a closeup to allow us to read that character's expressions and feelings. A good example would be the closeups on the master Fredersons' eyes as he asks his secretary why his son was allowed to go underground and as well after that scene when he is thinking in order to suggest this dictator's meditation and frustration. Another important aspect of the camera and of Expressionism that I have remarked was the scene in which the mad scientist tries to run away from Freder and kidnaps Maria. He is walking up on the roof of a sharpangled building holding Maria under his arm as if nothing would happen. The same scene was notable in Robert Wiene's film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari as Cesare walks up on the roof with the kidnapped fianc and the city crowd follows him.Time also is significant in the film because the clock keeps showing up in the most important scenes. Time is evident in Fredersons' office as his son challenges him to have mercy for the people as well as he is talking to his secretary. Still only a small portion of the clock is shown in these shots and it means the time in which the master can think what decisions to take. On the other hand a gigantic clock is shown as Freder finds an exhausted worker trying to turn a wallclock. Freder understands the struggle of this man and replaces him. There is where he finds out that at 2 pm Maria will have a meeting.But all that we have seen in this movie is not only made to show us the great importance of this silent SF film that can keep the watcher alive by its impressive music and can inspire contemporary movies like Matrix  but for its great historical importance. Fritz Lang expressed a social life in this movie as well as a political one. After WWI when Germany had lost a war people's lives were a disaster. Everyone was disoriented and could not keep up with the tragedy that was going on and maybe there were some influences of the great antiSemitism that was supposed to follow. But Germany was a great disaster as well and there was nothing it could have done to prevent it because many troubles kept adding up over the years and this country had to be defeated morally and politically as well as economically. Even if Germany's wish of reconstruction was as utopic as Fredersen's wish of a technological city the postwar inflation had a big contribution on cinemas development.".

Metropolis is one of the most magnificent cities of 2026 is kept 'alive' by the unceasing work of the underground people who live in slavery and is enjoyed by wealthy and educated people. The Austrian director of the movie Fritz Lang presents the story of a master John Federsen who sees people as machines working constantly to maintain the luxury and technology of his metropolis. On the other side his son Freder falls in love with one of the underground workers who is a spiritual leader for the slaves. The son recognizes the unsentimental heart of his father and starts a revolution. The city gets flooded and Maria Freder's love regains the workers' trust after a robot had stolen her identity she finds her loved one after saving the city's children and the workers shake hands with the master.Expressionism tries to simplify the world and to understand it emotionally in a subjective way. It is very important to understand this definition of this dynamic violent and distorted movement in order to understand that Lang tried to externalize his own internal vision of the world through simple expressions. The name 'metropolis' comes from the Greeks and means mothercity. It has this significance because a metropolis is the biggest form of a technologically and economically developed city. Nevertheless referring to the movie name this film can be considered as the mother city of all cinematic clichs. In this story there are two main characters Maria and Freder. These two characters are also the heroes of the story because they are the ones who rescue the population from being drowned in the flood. John Federson is a person full of empowering feelings who only thinks of himself and of his city forgetting about the ones who work for him. All the fantasies that he has come true through the power of his workers but he never thinks about the danger they are in while working for him. This man wants so much power that he is almost hypnotized by it he is obsessed and possessed by the power of inventions and creations.On the other hand Maria is just a symbol of munificence her soul is pure and she is seen like an angel who brings peace to the world. Maria convoys the people in a church settling area. She is shown as sanctity a holy person that is surrounded by the light of the candles. She is positioned higher than the workers who carefully listen to her as she speaks about peace unity and their salvation by a mediator that will soon come. Her eyes inspire confidence and kindness as she kisses Freder in the church scene. In general all she does is for the good of humanity. One thing that she repeats in the movie is 'Between the head and hands there must be a heart. ' This means that she realizes the bad things that the head John Frederson does and the good things that the hands workers do. But she knows that these workers should not be treated poorly or like robots and that she can be the heart which can persuade the head and the hands to cooperate to come to common interests. Maria as her name suggests is also a biblical motif. She explains to the workers the story of the Tower of Babel. The workers in the story destroy this tower which parallels how the movie will end with the destruction of the machines by the workforce. Maria is still the representation of Jesus mother because she is trying to save the lives of the underground children. She would sacrifice herself and alike Mother Mary she has a strong faith in the creator of the world. All the scenes of this film are perfectly created at the eye level so that anyone is able to view the action. However there is also a bird's eye view at the beginning of the movie as the panorama of the city is shown from high above the ground. This view was created to give us an impression of how widely extended and huge Metropolis is. In addition the focus of the dramatic camera angles with bold shadows is on the disproportioned landscape as well as on the rightangled buildings. There are moments in which the camera focuses on fast movement scenes like the dancing of the robot in the nightclub and scenes where it focuses on slow movement like in the beginning of the film where the 'slaves' are shown going into the working area at a certain pace and aligned as robots. When more people are involved in a scene like the one in which all the children are surrounding Maria as she rings the danger bell the angles are vertical triangular but when only one person is focused there is a closeup to allow us to read that character's expressions and feelings. A good example would be the closeups on the master Fredersons' eyes as he asks his secretary why his son was allowed to go underground and as well after that scene when he is thinking in order to suggest this dictator's meditation and frustration. Another important aspect of the camera and of Expressionism that I have remarked was the scene in which the mad scientist tries to run away from Freder and kidnaps Maria. He is walking up on the roof of a sharpangled building holding Maria under his arm as if nothing would happen. The same scene was notable in Robert Wiene's film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari as Cesare walks up on the roof with the kidnapped fianc and the city crowd follows him.Time also is significant in the film because the clock keeps showing up in the most important scenes. Time is evident in Fredersons' office as his son challenges him to have mercy for the people as well as he is talking to his secretary. Still only a small portion of the clock is shown in these shots and it means the time in which the master can think what decisions to take. On the other hand a gigantic clock is shown as Freder finds an exhausted worker trying to turn a wallclock. Freder understands the struggle of this man and replaces him. There is where he finds out that at 2 pm Maria will have a meeting.But all that we have seen in this movie is not only made to show us the great importance of this silent SF film that can keep the watcher alive by its impressive music and can inspire contemporary movies like Matrix  but for its great historical importance. Fritz Lang expressed a social life in this movie as well as a political one. After WWI when Germany had lost a war people's lives were a disaster. Everyone was disoriented and could not keep up with the tragedy that was going on and maybe there were some influences of the great antiSemitism that was supposed to follow. But Germany was a great disaster as well and there was nothing it could have done to prevent it because many troubles kept adding up over the years and this country had to be defeated morally and politically as well as economically. Even if Germany's wish of reconstruction was as utopic as Fredersen's wish of a technological city the postwar inflation had a big contribution on cinemas development.";

	schema:reviewBody "For its time this movie has stunning visuals kind of Kubrickesqe in appearance especially the opening scenes of workers going and coming from work. It's very strange with the group leaving walking with their heads down like zombies.The set designs in here are also something that might draw your attention. This really has a futuristic look. I thought the visuals were fascinating. This was German expressionist filmwork at its height I would think. Director Fritz Lang went on to become a very famous man in his profession. This wasn't his first effort but I think this might have been the film that put him on the map so to speak. Several years later he gained a lot more fame with M. At any rate with the photography sets and overall Flash Gordontype scifi look this must have been a real eyeopener to movies viewers 80 years ago. I still think they look very cool today. The music was also very dramatic at least in this restored 5.1 surround sound restoration DVD put out by Klino.Obviously the eye makeup on men and the exaggerated motions by actors in silent films look a little hokey but I was mesmerized by Brigitte Helm who plays Maria and her evil clone. She is something else! I also appreciated Klino's explanation of lost footage and how they did the best they could do to still make the story flow together. They did an outstanding job. I wouldn't attempt to watch this on anything less than this DVD which looks pretty darn good.This is a worker story about a man wanting to trade his comfortable life to join the oppressed workers who do their thing beneath the earth in Metropolis. Workers are seen as nothing but replaceable robots. If someone gets hurt they get carted away and replaced immediately but some other zombielike human. Of course people being mistreated can only take it for so long before rebellion. That's history from the days of the Jewish slaves in Egypt to today so that's part of this story too. I won't say more to ruin it.I don't want to mislead people on one major point today's audiences watching this. Few people in 2008 watch silent movies. To ask them to sit through two hours of a silent film is obviously asking a lot. I had to break this up into several viewings myself but that's okay. I still enjoyed it.....but it a silent movie this long is not easy to sit through. You have to be a student of film or a big film buff to watch this....but those people will be rewarded. Over 250 reviews in here show you this film has enough to offer or at least take a look. Now that this restored version is available check it out!".

A rating of 8.3 is much too high and at 93 there are plenty of better films ranked below it.First the good parts of the film 1 The special effects are excellent for a pre1930s film. 2 The mindlessness of the working class is portrayed well in how they work the decisions they make and in how easily they are ledmisled. 3 The main character is well developed throughout the film and the audience can relate to him well. 4 The film is visually stunning and impressive. 5 The story of the working class vision of the future machinemen etc. have had a very strong influence on many films which came later.On the other hand here is a list of what could have been done better 1 Many scenes dragged on too long and were tedious.

More background on Maria would have helped develop her character and improved the film.In its defense it could be that I was not as impressed by this film simply because so many films which came after it have copied borrowed stolen or reworked ideas that appeared here first.  Metropolis certainly was a trendsetter.  Like I said before I don't think this is a bad film.  It's simply overrated and I've seen plenty of films that are better but are rated lower.".

I finally saw it at a silent movie theater in Hollywood and my feelings were to say the least mixed.The film is visually stunning. Monumental sets brilliantly directed scenes amazing special effects by the standards of the time. In fact I might say that I was more enthralled by the visual effects of this movie than I was by say Lord of the Rings or Avatar. Whereas Cameron and Jackson used CGI to make their visions come true Lang had to use camera trickery paint and wood.This movie no doubt set the lexicon for the SciFi and blockbuster genre in stone. The images of Metropolis have been repeated in innumerable movies. The scene of the underground city being flooded has curious similarities to James Cameron's Titanic. Even the villainous Rotwang can be seen in the characters Dr. Strangelove and Doc Brown from Back to the Future.But then there's the story. And the dialogue. And the acting which is overwrought even by the standards of the time. But I don't have enough room to go into that.Starting with the opening line LookThese are your brothers a violent cringe would run through my body every time the intertitles would appear.The later line about the head and hands needing the heart as mediator caused a huge outburst of laughter in the theater.

Essentially it can boiled down to this Somebody according to writer Thea von Harbou's later beliefs this turned out to be Adolf Hitler needs to appeal to the hearts of capitalist managers and tell them to be nice to their workers. The outcome is a grudging handshake between the head manager Joh Frederson and the leader of the workers Grot and thus begins a shining new day!Metropolis also incorporates religious symbolism which is to say the very least heavyhanded. Scenes of the Seven Deadly Sins The Tower of Babel an altar to Moloch and the Flood all warn of doom to decadent societies that exploit the weak and kill the righteous.In the end this muddled mixture of Socialist calls for justice and Christian Apocalypticism creates a political message that Lang himself described as silly.I recommend this film for its artistic brilliance and groundbreaking techniques. But don't go into this expecting an award quality film.If you want to get into silent film this is a relatively easy one to get start with. However I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing. I've met too many people who've said that Metropolis was the best silent movie they've ever seen which probably means that it was the only one that they ever bothered to watch.

	schema:headline " a visual fable of the highest order one of the five great future films ever made";
	schema:reviewBody "Fritz Lang was constantly experimenting with ways to tell stories by way of the visual medium and his 1927 opus Metropolis is the cream of the crop of examples of this. Perhaps it was seeing the film in the greatest possible format a fully restored print on the KINO DVD filled with intertitles to keep the story complete that had me appreciate it more but even if I had seen the film on a scratchy print or with not very appropriate music i.e. Giorgio Moroder's experimental cut it would still be affecting. At the core of the story Lang and his collaborator Thea von Harbou the sides of good vs. evil or at least the complete lack of understanding of the powerful over the weak is set up so strongly that even when it has it's fairytale type of heaviness to it it doesn't seem to feel compromised in strength or relevance for adults. This is the kind of film that should work for anyone young and old as it deals with universal themes i.e. The mediator between Head and Hands must be the Heart!The story leaves room for the visual style to come through Freder is the son of a kind of Imperial man over the workers who die for the machines of Metropolis Joh Frederson. He feels the sorrow and pain of the people and goes down to their level to be one of them. He falls in love with the most compassionate and angelic of women Maria played by the beautiful Brigitte Helm in multiple roles she plays without a fault who succumbs to capture after the jealously of Freder's father. Enter the robot a marvel of a mad scientist who gets transposed from Maria and becomes the havocwrecker of the part of Metropolis. I won't reveal too much of the story except to mention that as a foreshadowing for Freder for the last act as he wakes up in one scene the Book of Revelations sits in his lap.Amidst in all of this Metropolis is a masterpiece of visual effects cameratricks and of course editing if I wouldn't quite rank Metropolis in my alltime top ten favorites I would rank it in terms of the editing and pacing Lang uses which is apparent even in a permanently truncated version. It starts off with the image of the machine transposed over steam and then soon moves to a vision of a city that was not far off from how it is in present day cars moving on roads built to the sky airplanes flying everywhich way and mammoth skyscrapers built in extravagant ways. But it's not just the use of the models or the sets or the backdrops or even the use of space and atmosphere in most of Lang's shots which are all spectacular it's also the use of light that really caught my attention throughout the film. One thing I remember still days after seeing the film is the use of one spotlight on the character of Maria in a suspense scene it also appears in other scenes I think. It's little things like that which make as big an impact as the montages the superimpositions of faces and eyes in the dreamlike shots.And of course Lang's greatest innovation with the film is that in telling a futuristic story he goes beyond his time period in stylizing. As I mentioned with the pacing being unique it was surprising though maybe not as much from seeing his classic M that many of the suspense sequences mob scenesriots chases I knew that this is the same kind of styling that's used today for many of the most modern of sciencefictionaction films. In its own way much like Stanley Kubrick's 2001 Space Oddysey it breaks the mold of conventional forms of storytelling while not completely abandoning the storytelling form. Although Metropolis has a checkered history of being cut down by countries and it hasn't been seen in its full form in almost eighty years what remains doesn't seem at all dated or crude. Quite the opposite its visual expressiveness its use of time and character and action and its deliberate pacing makes it ahead of its time and influential and at the same time keeping itself unique. It's a tale we're all familiar with being the tale of love and compassion coming into play in an industrial cruel world which I'm sure was even more relevant to post WW1 Germany at the time filmed with a mix of overthetop melodrama megabudget setpieces and designs that confound the senses.

	onyx:emotionText "Fritz Lang was constantly experimenting with ways to tell stories by way of the visual medium and his 1927 opus Metropolis is the cream of the crop of examples of this. Perhaps it was seeing the film in the greatest possible format a fully restored print on the KINO DVD filled with intertitles to keep the story complete that had me appreciate it more but even if I had seen the film on a scratchy print or with not very appropriate music i.e. Giorgio Moroder's experimental cut it would still be affecting. At the core of the story Lang and his collaborator Thea von Harbou the sides of good vs. evil or at least the complete lack of understanding of the powerful over the weak is set up so strongly that even when it has it's fairytale type of heaviness to it it doesn't seem to feel compromised in strength or relevance for adults. This is the kind of film that should work for anyone young and old as it deals with universal themes i.e. The mediator between Head and Hands must be the Heart!The story leaves room for the visual style to come through Freder is the son of a kind of Imperial man over the workers who die for the machines of Metropolis Joh Frederson. He feels the sorrow and pain of the people and goes down to their level to be one of them. He falls in love with the most compassionate and angelic of women Maria played by the beautiful Brigitte Helm in multiple roles she plays without a fault who succumbs to capture after the jealously of Freder's father. Enter the robot a marvel of a mad scientist who gets transposed from Maria and becomes the havocwrecker of the part of Metropolis. I won't reveal too much of the story except to mention that as a foreshadowing for Freder for the last act as he wakes up in one scene the Book of Revelations sits in his lap.Amidst in all of this Metropolis is a masterpiece of visual effects cameratricks and of course editing if I wouldn't quite rank Metropolis in my alltime top ten favorites I would rank it in terms of the editing and pacing Lang uses which is apparent even in a permanently truncated version. It starts off with the image of the machine transposed over steam and then soon moves to a vision of a city that was not far off from how it is in present day cars moving on roads built to the sky airplanes flying everywhich way and mammoth skyscrapers built in extravagant ways. But it's not just the use of the models or the sets or the backdrops or even the use of space and atmosphere in most of Lang's shots which are all spectacular it's also the use of light that really caught my attention throughout the film. One thing I remember still days after seeing the film is the use of one spotlight on the character of Maria in a suspense scene it also appears in other scenes I think. It's little things like that which make as big an impact as the montages the superimpositions of faces and eyes in the dreamlike shots.And of course Lang's greatest innovation with the film is that in telling a futuristic story he goes beyond his time period in stylizing. As I mentioned with the pacing being unique it was surprising though maybe not as much from seeing his classic M that many of the suspense sequences mob scenesriots chases I knew that this is the same kind of styling that's used today for many of the most modern of sciencefictionaction films. In its own way much like Stanley Kubrick's 2001 Space Oddysey it breaks the mold of conventional forms of storytelling while not completely abandoning the storytelling form. Although Metropolis has a checkered history of being cut down by countries and it hasn't been seen in its full form in almost eighty years what remains doesn't seem at all dated or crude. Quite the opposite its visual expressiveness its use of time and character and action and its deliberate pacing makes it ahead of its time and influential and at the same time keeping itself unique. It's a tale we're all familiar with being the tale of love and compassion coming into play in an industrial cruel world which I'm sure was even more relevant to post WW1 Germany at the time filmed with a mix of overthetop melodrama megabudget setpieces and designs that confound the senses. Add the appropriate music and you've got a classic fantasy. A tremendous film to see two three a dozen times over though some of those too impatient for films without spoken words or by the operatic dramatic side of it all may become disappointed or frustrated.";

	schema:reviewBody "I really hate it when I don't enjoy a classic film. I really want to enjoy it but I just can't. I want to understand some people's love for it but I just can't. Metropolis falls under this category. An unbearably slow film I watched the restoration which is over 2 hours longthat may have been a bad idea that starts off with interesting ideas but then seems to not really do much with them. It is the year 2026 the wealthy rule the city of Metropolis while the lowerclass work for hours on end underground in awful conditions. The Master of Metropolis is Joh Fredersen Alfred Abel and his son is Freder Gustav Frohlich who spends his days with other rich people in a place called the pleasure garden where he truly does nothing at all. A woman named Maria Brigitte Helm brings a group of working children up for a visit in pleasure garden and Freder is quickly enamored by Maria. Freder decides to explore the underground part of the city only to be shocked as an explosion goes off and kills multiple workers. He reports this to his father who is disappointed his son was the first to report it over his assistant Josepha Theodor Loos and his assistant is quickly fired. This does an immediate job of showing the coldness of Joh but they never do much else with his character. In fact very little of the characters are developed in anyway. Most of them are completely uninteresting and the setting itself is compelling at first but quickly loses anything interesting halfway through the film as the film moves at a snail pace. Anyways the main aspect of the plot here is that the workers are led by Maria to stop this feud between the rich and the poor with nonviolence and the eventual arrival of a mediator to make it happen. My real issue is that the film starts with such a great idea and had potential to become something like 1984 I'm aware it came out afterwords and that it's a novel but still just an example but it instead becomes filled with strange religious allusions and becomes a witch hunt essentially by the end. They never really do any decent social commentary at all. If any at all. This wouldn't matter if the film was actually entertaining but it only is in spurts and then quickly becomes a repetitive bore. I do think the special effects were impressive and this film is obviously important for being the first full length science fiction filmwell ever. That doesn't mean it holds up because it doesn't. In fact it'd be hard for me to believe the film was entertaining in 1927. I still wonder if I had watched the shorter version of the film how much more I would've enjoyed the film. It certainly would've have been paced better considering so much of this film is unbelievably uninteresting. But I don't think that changes the fact that this movie doesn't really do anything. It isn't entertaining. It doesn't really have a message. What is this movie? I guess good special effects for 1927? Whatever. I'm glad I gave this classic a chance but I highly doubt I'll revisit it anytime soon.".

I think this and My Favorite Season are as good as anything Deneuve has ever done. Both are quite remarkable given that she has been in movies for over forty years. All the actors are quite remarkable  and Emmanuelle Seigner whom you may remember from Frantic with Harrison Ford Bitter Moon with Hugh Grant is all slender strong beauty  and a wonderful blonde contrast with the older blonde heavysetblowsy in character Deneuve.The movie completely jumps any moral compass headings  and yet somehow one doesn't mind. So even though you may feel you must watch it twice you'd enjoy it both times. It's as cool and elegant a movie as I've ever seen. And yet almost as sad a movie as I've ever seen. It's wonderful.".

	schema:headline " worth a look especially for Deneuve fans thriller lovers";
	schema:reviewBody "To truly appreciate this film you may either have to be French a mystery lover or a diamond connoisseur three things I am not. That said the shadowy film noir Place Vendme set in Paris' haute couture jewelry district is a relatively wellcrafted third film by French writerdirector Nicole Garcia.While I'm also not a huge Catherine Deneuve fan the 57yearold famed beauty steals the show in a performance that won her the 1998 Venice Film Festival's Best Actress award. It's a challenging multifaceted role that she plays with due restraint making it less maudlin and emotionally charged than it easily could have become.Deneuve is Marianne wife of Vincent Malivert Bernard Fresson with whom she starred in Buuel's 1967 film Belle de Jour owner of one of the most prestigious jewelry shops in the world. Once a gem broker herself the middleaged Marianne has fallen into an alcoholic stupor. Her relationship with Vincent is cold and hollow she has slept at home only 17 nights in the past year preferring instead to convalesce at various rest homes.'Vincent is also a troubled person. He hides the extent of his misery and the fact that his debtridden business is quickly going bankrupt. plot spoiler? When he intentionally drives his speeding Mercedes into a lumber truck his desperation is revealed.Garcia spends the bulk of the picture depicting Marianne's process of recovering from her addiction. Faced with relative penury in the wake of her husband's death she relearns the art of the diamond deal as she tries to sell a handful of probably stolen gems Vincent has left her. Her turning point comes when she gazes at the stones through a loupe and revels in their inherent beauty. This in stark contrast to the rest of the cast sundry thugs and swarthy millionaires who view the rocks as nothing more than money in the bank. In fact one could argue that all concerned are addicts addicted to their work and financial gain and suitably jacked up ruthless and miserable.This for me is the film's most absorbing storyline Marianne's renaissance and her rapprochement with actions and people from the past. Specifically after a 20year hiatus she reconnects with a former lover the Russian mafiaconnected Battisstelli Jacques Dutronc in a fascinating performance who had once sorely burned her during a jewelry sale. It's a moving moment when she finds herself able to let go of her anger toward him and both characters connect with their fundamental humanity. But again it's a very subtle strand that Garcia only begins to caress near the film's end. Had she moved such human plotlines to the foreground the film would have emerged much stronger and more poignant.But I suppose it's unfair to expect a French film to depict Marianne's reawakening in the hattossing style of Mary Tyler Moore. After all the French did coin the word anomie. Still I wish the main character's development had become less buried in the film's insistence on utter subtlety and dreariness. I suppose the dark interior shots and seemingly unending rainy days could feel atmospheric if your antidepressant is working particularly well but mostly they just seemed morose. That aside Laurent Dailland's cinematography frequently stands out. I still haven't forgotten a wideangle shot of vertical blinds in a boardroom nor the splashes of crimson  symbolizing Marianne's suppressed then emerging passion  laced throughout the drear.The film incorporates many classic noirish elements  that is noir of the 1940s rather than the excessive violenceparading Quentin Tarrantino variety. In the intrigue over the stolen gems shadowy figures emerge from the woodwork. Tall svelte beauties reveal themselves as jewelry sellers then mistresses then accomplices in crime. Remnants from the past seemingly long disposed of come back to haunt the players in nefarious ways. Truth is stark brutal and straight no chaser. And yet the surfaces remain as shiny and sleek as the polished glass boardroom tables at which lives and deaths fortunes and demises are determined with stonefaced certainty.There's something of a doppelgnger theme here too which bears noting. Soon after Vincent's death Marianne meets Nathalie Emmanuelle Seigner a young woman she suspects of being her husband's mistress. The two femmes fatale match their men as they match their hairstyles frequently mirroring the past and future for each other.Place Vendme offers enough to admire that it's worth a look especially for thriller lovers. However it does have its share of flaws. The plot gets overly complex and becomes difficult to track in places. Though presumably adding to the air of mystery the cuts are sometimes so quick that the action becomes confusing.I also would have preferred more of a focus on the psychological and emotional elements rather than the wheelingdealings of taciturn Gallic businessmen who seem to multiply like champagne bottles at a French wedding. Despite a good dose of suspense in some places it was tough to care about these rapacious specimens and their greeddriven lives. In embracing her passion and extending her forgiveness Deneuve's Marianne proves the only character truly worth watching.".

We're introduced to various mysterious characters when Deneuve is offscreen but they seem lifeless and uninteresting by comparison.And yet the final halfhour actually works.

French dramas are dull depressing films about people smoking cigarettes and talking about nothing in particular.  And French comedies are like bad Jerry Lewis movies with subtitles.  Nonetheless I was dragged to see Place Vendome and was pleasantly surprised.This is a thriller about Marianne Catherine Deneuve the widow of a prominent Parisian jeweler who is involved in some shady deals before he commits suicide.  Marianne is an alcoholic who spends 348 days a year voluntarily confined in a mental hospital.  When she is out she needs a nurse to look after her.  When she is sober her hands shake and she is frightened of everything.Before her husband dies he tells her about some hot rocks stashed in the house.  After he dies she tries to sell them so she doesn't have to sell her husband's business or go bankrupt.  Everyone is too frightened to buy them but plenty of people want to take them.She also finds out her husband had a mistress named Nathalie Emmanuelle Seignerwho looks exactly like she did twenty years ago.  It turns out they have more than that in common.  They are both intimately acquainted with the jewelry business legal and otherwise.  There is not a man that one has slept with that the other has not.  And they are both in over their heads on both the business and romantic fronts.What I really liked about this film was that it reminded me so much of Hitchcock's romantic thrillers particularly Vertigo.  There is a scene at the beginning where Marianne has a breakdown in the middle of a stairwell while Richard Robbins' or is it Bernard Herrmann's swirling clarinet fugue score plays.  This I thought was a wonderful homage to the belltower scenes in Vertigo.There are faults of course.  There is just too much coincidence to keep my disbelief suspended for long.  And I really would have liked to see more of Nathalie.  But overall this is a stylish thriller from a country where I least expected it.  8 out of 10.".

We are taken to meet Caco a man that is being threatened by an opposing clan because his brother Mario killed one of the Caracava men something that will not be forgotten until justice is done. Since Mario is hiding in Morocco Caco is a marked man because he represents his brother the assassin.Caco is a man who loves his nephew Diego that suffers from cerebral palsy. Diego who is Mario's son enjoys women like other normal young men his own age. Caco takes care for Diego to have a discreet encounter with a beautiful prostitute la Catalana. Caco learns how the Caracavas are vowing to avenge their dead brother by sacrificing Diego.Vengo mixes the action with music song and dance performed by some of the best flamenco interpreters of the genre. Antonio Canales does a good job in his take of Caco the head of his clan and the loving uncle of Diego. Orestes Villason Rodriguez who is physically handicapped appears as Diego who like any other member of this clan loves his music and women with the same passion. Antonio Dechent appears as Alejandro Caco's right hand man.Tony Gatlif brings all the colors of Andalucia to a film and does justice to some of that exotic music and mixes the local gypsy music with Moroccan performers that add color to the movie.".

Since Mario is hiding in Morocco Caco is a marked man because he represents his brother the assassin.Caco is a man who loves his nephew Diego that suffers from cerebral palsy. Diego who is Mario's son enjoys women like other normal young men his own age. Caco takes care for Diego to have a discreet encounter with a beautiful prostitute la Catalana. Caco learns how the Caracavas are vowing to avenge their dead brother by sacrificing Diego.Vengo mixes the action with music song and dance performed by some of the best flamenco interpreters of the genre. Antonio Canales does a good job in his take of Caco the head of his clan and the loving uncle of Diego. Orestes Villason Rodriguez who is physically handicapped appears as Diego who like any other member of this clan loves his music and women with the same passion. Antonio Dechent appears as Alejandro Caco's right hand man.Tony Gatlif brings all the colors of Andalucia to a film and does justice to some of that exotic music and mixes the local gypsy music with Moroccan performers that add color to the movie.";

To complicate matters  Caco eventually wishes to forget his past but a gypsy clan seeks vengeance against his brother . They are seeking revenge and have come to Caco for justice .

They then realize they are getting nowhere they threaten to murder Diego . Caco has become involved with the violent gypsy faction that puts him at odds with his own responsibilities .

	schema:reviewBody "For me there's nothing better than a film about the affairs of exotic people from other lands that is full of spirited music no matter how flimsy the plot.  Vengo is an exemplary case.  It is the latest in a series of films about Romany people and their music made by Tony Gatlif.  He brings impeccable credentials to the task born in Algeria raised in Marseille his mother is Roma and his father a Berber.  His best known film is the 1993 homage to Roma music Latcho Drom Safe Journey which I have yet to see. Vengo is set in Andalusia in southern Spain in the city of Seville and surrounding villages.  Here a rich tradition of Berber Romany and Jewish origins has shaped the culture and given the world a distinctive music flamenco.  This film is best viewed as a flamenco concert featuring a number of different singers instrumentalists dancers and ensembles most of whom are outrageously good.  The musical numbers are connected by an insubstantial narrative a loosely unfolding story of a blood feud a dialectic of deaths between two rural Roma families.  Caco the flamenco dancer Antonio Canales who doesn't get to dance at all here is a bereaved nightclub owner and heavy boozer whose teenage daughter was killed by members of the Caravaca family.  In return Caco's brother Mario killed a Caravaca man and is hiding in Morocco. The Caravacas now demand their turn for revenge and in Mario's absence let out word that they plan to murder Mario's son Diego Orestes Villason Rodriguez a 20something man who suffers from cerebral palsy.  Caco dearly loves and dotes on Diego his nephew and is set into a crazed state by this news.  The story moves toward a tragic sacrificial climax.  The plot does serve to convey the essential truth that grounds the passion of these people that suffering and death itself are inevitable counterpoints to love and family loyalty.  This backdrop gives embodiment to the deep emotions expressed in the music. There is also a single very humorous scene featuring cells phones perhaps the funniest bit about these obnoxious instruments in all of filmdom. The turn contributed by Rodriguez as Diego is impressive it is welcome indeed to see a person with cerebral palsy act a major role especially when the performance is built much more on humanity than on handicap.  In Spanish".

Tony Gatlif.Well with this been said I don't think I have very much more to add. It's everything what the director said. I never really liked musical movies I am like most people. And I must admit that as well as me others missed out on great movies.I have worked for a long time in a video store and I saw that many musical movies were put aside. It doesn't mean that musicals are by definition good but it's like our system block them automatically away and we won't watch them. Why? I don't know. Because of our childhood? Does our body protest thanks to movies like Sound of music and Mary Poppins and etc.Could be. Even Dancer in the dark didn't do well in the video store. From an instant when people heard that some people sing in it they left it behind and didn't wanted too see it although it was directed by Lars Von Trier.But those who did see it thought it was great! Well it is the same with this movie those who saw it thought it was great those who heard people sang in it didn't even bother to turn their back and try out on something they always rejected and therefore missed something. I really liked Vengo and I enjoyed the music allot. And I didn't regret it for a second.".

	onyx:emotionText "Vengo is a call a song a hymn to life to love to mourning to blood money. A hymn to the Mediterranean spirit.' Tony Gatlif.Well with this been said I don't think I have very much more to add. It's everything what the director said. I never really liked musical movies I am like most people. And I must admit that as well as me others missed out on great movies.I have worked for a long time in a video store and I saw that many musical movies were put aside. It doesn't mean that musicals are by definition good but it's like our system block them automatically away and we won't watch them. Why? I don't know. Because of our childhood? Does our body protest thanks to movies like Sound of music and Mary Poppins and etc.Could be. Even Dancer in the dark didn't do well in the video store. From an instant when people heard that some people sing in it they left it behind and didn't wanted too see it although it was directed by Lars Von Trier.But those who did see it thought it was great! Well it is the same with this movie those who saw it thought it was great those who heard people sang in it didn't even bother to turn their back and try out on something they always rejected and therefore missed something. I really liked Vengo and I enjoyed the music allot. And I didn't regret it for a second.";

The setting is unique a South African diamond mine located deep in the desert is targeted for a daring hit Hugh O'Brian Christopher Lee and a smirking O.J Simpson and Telly Savalas in menacingly oozing form plays the company's security chief trying to prevent it. A cynically scruffy Peter Fonda is a field security officer who gets caught up in it all when he agrees to go undercover stealing a diamond and escaping capture to get the attention of an insider who they believe is smuggling diamondsand who is also helping prepare a heist. However noone else knows about this job including his girlfriend the radiant Maud Adams and the security chief.The knotty if absurd plot offers a neat array of dangerous twists and unrelenting turns which keeps the rhythmic story moving and constantly interesting. It really does pick up things in the backend as the plans are set in motion and the rough nature breaks out. The character interactions remain dynamic especially the scenes when Fonda's character meets the heist group. Mechanically directed but it consists of fun biting dialogues allout nobull violence wellshot locations and many big egos trying to mug every shot they're in. Backing this up is a titillatingly groovy soundtrack which simply makes you want to boogie. It does.".

The setting is unique a South African diamond mine located deep in the desert is targeted for a daring hit Hugh O'Brian Christopher Lee and a smirking O.J Simpson and Telly Savalas in menacingly oozing form plays the company's security chief trying to prevent it. A cynically scruffy Peter Fonda is a field security officer who gets caught up in it all when he agrees to go undercover stealing a diamond and escaping capture to get the attention of an insider who they believe is smuggling diamondsand who is also helping prepare a heist. However noone else knows about this job including his girlfriend the radiant Maud Adams and the security chief.The knotty if absurd plot offers a neat array of dangerous twists and unrelenting turns which keeps the rhythmic story moving and constantly interesting. It really does pick up things in the backend as the plans are set in motion and the rough nature breaks out. The character interactions remain dynamic especially the scenes when Fonda's character meets the heist group. Mechanically directed but it consists of fun biting dialogues allout nobull violence wellshot locations and many big egos trying to mug every shot they're in. Backing this up is a titillatingly groovy soundtrack which simply makes you want to boogie. It does.";

	schema:reviewBody "Carl Jung the Swiss psychiatrist having decided to go on his own set his practice treating people according to his own principles. Having been associated with Sigmund Freud for a while he was getting known for his work with difficult cases one of which involved Sabina Spielrein a Russian young woman that is brought over to him to see if he can help her. Basically Sabina's problems were difficult to detect although Jung determines to experiment the work he had developed with Freud in order to treat her illness. There are two narratives in this film. The other one takes us to the present time Russia where a young French woman goes to Moscow to do research on Sabina's case. Marie is determined to get to the bottom of Ms. Spielrein's work and her work in the famous White School that she founded during the Stalinist era. Marie meets a Scottish scholar Richard Fraser who sees in the young woman a determination and resolve to get to know what happened to Sabina.After successfully treating Sabina Carl Jung developed a passion for his patient something that might have been considered as unethical. Dr. Jung was married to a cold woman who did not appreciate his work or at least took no interest in what her husband was trying to accomplish. The relationship ended badly as the doctor came to his senses thinking in his family and his standing in the medical community. Sabina on the other hand decided to go back to Moscow where she married and had children. Those were hard times in the old Soviet Union but she prevailed in establishing a school that was revolutionary in its own right. Mary's research gets to the bottom of the story as she goes to Rostov where the last part of Sabina's life were spent and where she died with the thousands of Jews that lost their lives in the conflict.Directed by Italian Roberto Faenza with an international cast we saw an English version of the film. We do not know whether the film was shot in Italian or was conceived just as we watched it on a DVD transfer. We had enjoyed Mr. Faenza's According to Pereira with the great Marcello Mastroianni. Mr. Faenza contributed to the screenplay which was written in collaboration with about six other writers. The film presents a good story but the screenplay does not do justice to the story of Sabina. No doubt the creators had the best intentions in mind to present an interesting account about a subject that unfortunately leaves a lot to be explained and the second narrative seems a bit superfluous in our humble opinion.Iain Glen the Scottish actor is seen as Dr. Jung. Emilia Fox plays Sabina. Craig Ferguson and Caroline Ducey are the researchers that uncovered the facts of Sabina's fate.".

Basically Sabina's problems were difficult to detect although Jung determines to experiment the work he had developed with Freud in order to treat her illness. There are two narratives in this film. The other one takes us to the present time Russia where a young French woman goes to Moscow to do research on Sabina's case. Marie is determined to get to the bottom of Ms. Spielrein's work and her work in the famous White School that she founded during the Stalinist era. Marie meets a Scottish scholar Richard Fraser who sees in the young woman a determination and resolve to get to know what happened to Sabina.After successfully treating Sabina Carl Jung developed a passion for his patient something that might have been considered as unethical. Dr. Jung was married to a cold woman who did not appreciate his work or at least took no interest in what her husband was trying to accomplish. The relationship ended badly as the doctor came to his senses thinking in his family and his standing in the medical community. Sabina on the other hand decided to go back to Moscow where she married and had children. Those were hard times in the old Soviet Union but she prevailed in establishing a school that was revolutionary in its own right. Mary's research gets to the bottom of the story as she goes to Rostov where the last part of Sabina's life were spent and where she died with the thousands of Jews that lost their lives in the conflict.Directed by Italian Roberto Faenza with an international cast we saw an English version of the film. We do not know whether the film was shot in Italian or was conceived just as we watched it on a DVD transfer. We had enjoyed Mr. Faenza's According to Pereira with the great Marcello Mastroianni. Mr. Faenza contributed to the screenplay which was written in collaboration with about six other writers. The film presents a good story but the screenplay does not do justice to the story of Sabina. No doubt the creators had the best intentions in mind to present an interesting account about a subject that unfortunately leaves a lot to be explained and the second narrative seems a bit superfluous in our humble opinion.Iain Glen the Scottish actor is seen as Dr. Jung. Emilia Fox plays Sabina. Craig Ferguson and Caroline Ducey are the researchers that uncovered the facts of Sabina's fate.";

Nowadays any film that enters into the psychoanalysis field and its world should be at least seen. In this case Faenza shot a  non Italian film with a multi national coproduction about a sort of small biography of Carl Jung the famous psychologist who has funded a personal current beside the one developed by Siegmund Freud. The film has some very good moments specially when Jung is at his very beginning of his career in a house hospital in Zurich and meet Caroline Ducey as his very first patient. The developing of her illness and Jung's very modern approach compared to the rest of his colleagues in the hospital is really the best part of the film this together with the start of their love affair worth the whole film. Unfortunately the rest of the film is not well driven a sort of general and confused flashback brings the old scenes to a today situation through a path that a relative of Caroline is following in Russia with the help of some old books.

A reality show webcast offers five young people the opportunity to make money by staying in a house for six months with the only catch being that if any of them leave then none of them win anything. After some time in the house with loads of boredom one of them gets a letter saying his grandfather has died. He wants to leave but nobody wants to make it that easy for him to blow all their money. When bricks get delivered instead of supplies and a stranger who happens by the house says he has never seen or even heard of their reality show alarm bells start to ring.When this came out I just assumed it was a slasher movie that decided to try and ride the wave of reality show popularity all the way to the box office. Even if that was the case it didn't really work and this film didn't do a great deal of business in the UK  although respectable returns considering it was low budget anyway. The film takes a very Blair Witch approach to things by being pretty unnerving rather than out and out scary or gory. The director cleverly uses the angles and grainy appearance of Big Brother night vision included to invoke the feeling of the series but also to raise the tension. It is a bit of a gimmick but it does work because despite it showing its budget the cuts and the angels do raise tension.The problem is that the plot is never as good as it should have been. It goes where you expect it to do and there isn't much more to it than that. The film could easily have been making a point about the exploitative nature of such reality shows the type of people that go on them and the sort of things that we turn in to watch lets be honest  the fights and the sex. It does these if you think about it but the delivery lacks the intelligence that the concept potentially had. It is a shame because this would have been better if it had had this commentary because it would have covered up for the lack of substance plot and development of the film. The cast are fairly average which suits the reality TV feel of the film.Overall then this is a film all about atmosphere and tension  well handled by director Evans. The concept offers commentary but the film delivers none or very little what remains is a simple thriller in the low budget mould of Blair Witch. As such it works for the majority of the running time on atmosphere alone but the descent in the final 20 minutes didn't really work for me. An interesting film for this aspect but sadly lacking in things like commentary substance development and total worth.".

It's viewed primarily through web cams. Thus we're treated to some interesting pointofviews and techniques as the cameras focus on the participants. There's a nice nightvision element where everyone is in green with eerily lit eyes. There're also some nice sounds via a white noise effect. Some found this grating but I found it more effective in creating a sense of things being off kilter than the traditional orchestral effect. There's an ending which made me smile and despite their scarcity one or two relatively decent jump' moments. The sense of it being just that bit different helps lift it out of forgettable mediocrity but it cannot elevate it to a description of being good. I think a 5.810 is about fair.".

It's unnerving getting under your skin like THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE did. There is no comic relief whatsoever. The film's allpervading nihlism spreads  relentlessly  like an ever increasing black ink blot. To say it won't end well is not spoiling anything really it's clear from the opening scenes that we're on a one way journey downwards.Essentially stripped of all it's visual trickery and clever manipulation it's a teen horror flick at core a teen slasher movie at that but it's a million miles away from genre films like URBAN LEGEND and it's ilk.MY LITTLE EYE a British film made in Canada with American actors is a gruelling hour and a half it's endurance test horror. It's the kind of 'entertainment' and I don't mean the inverted commas in a derogatory way I just find it  hard to equate this powerfully morbid film with that notion which I never thought I'd see in the cinema again in this country. Judging by the total silence in the cinema as the harrowing final shots faded I doubt anyone else did either.Real fans of the genre miss it at your peril!".

Some of the shots done in nightvision are really weird and creepy. Add to this a really good twist ending and you have a very solid film. Definitely one to check out  8.5 out of 10".

If they manage to stay there for six months without contacting the outside world each of them wins 1.000.000. If someone breaks the rules everyone loses their million. The movie takes place in the final week of the competition and suddenly weird things start to happen. It seems that the contestants' pasts have come back haunting them. But as it usually is some things aren't what they seem to be...The cast of My Little Eye is great since all of the few actorsactresses are pretty much 'nonfamous' for me at least helping to create an illusion of an Big Brothertype of game where ordinary people do stuff for money.There is this certain tension throughout the movie creating a disturbing feeling that 'something isn't right'. However in my opinion this movie wasn't scary. I'd rather call this movie a thriller than a horrormovie.Don't get me wrong but the movie disappointed me a little. Everything in this movie was a bit pale. I admit that the nightvision scenes were cool but at the end of the movie you've definitely had enough of web cams.Anyways... There are lots of much crappier movies than this so if you consider yourself a voyeur or if you like Big Brother you should give this movie a shot.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes and No. I really like this whole concept of the reality show gone wrong  and a horror movie is always good in my book. But for all the bits I liked about the film it didn't add up to a whole that I particularly liked. But yes there were some good bits.The idea of people in a house being films raises all interesting possibilities about how people react when they're isolated and how they would cope if people started dieing or they had to start killing each other I thought house of 9 was really good because the behaviour of the characters was very interesting when they realised their host wanted them to kill each other.Here only one of the characters seems to have any idea that something dodgy is going on and then when people start dieing its over so quickly there isn't really time to watch the interactions of the people under stress and terror.Some of the build up is good though  like the whole child that killed his parent's thing coming back. However I just didn't believe the rest of the plot. When the guy goes on the web if there was nothing on the internet about this then what was the internet site at the beginning which they applied through  surely that would still be on the web and there would have been at least some information about the show that it had been canned that it had disappeared. However the idea that they were being watched in secret by some group of rich clients with the intent on watching them all die was pretty scary.Anyway forget that its ridiculous how this guy managed to wire a broken global satellite navigation system and get it to act as a modem to hook up to his computer. He also managed to try and hack into the website with some of the worlds most sophisticated hackers. I have a couple of questions here why don't you send an email for help? Why don't you then email friends and family and find out if they know about the show? OR ASK THEM FOR HELP! And all this seemed to happen in a very short time span. I guess suspension of disbelief is required  but when its all about being a reality show gone wrong which is meant to frighten with its reality type visuals then when the plot is anything but its just wrong. There's also this sequence about someone that visits which just doesn't make any sense.The first murder that we know is a murder is very shocking. But once the secret is out I was really not scared any more. I knew that each person was going to die in turn it was just waiting for it to happen and thinking man just escape leave the house! As I say I like the concept and there are some good ideas and some bits that were a little bit scary. But for me the plot didn't really hang together they didn't keep us guessing long enough on who the killer was and they didn't get the people scared enough when they realised people were dieing. And man if I'd had email access I would have sent some emails  and called in the army to get me outta there!!!!".

What it does deliver is patchy tension and a slasher climax. I kept hoping every step of the way but the pace lagged just enough to let me dwell on the plot holes.The start is good with the 5 house inmates cleverly introduced through clips of their audition interviews. And the almost 6 months spent in the house is conveyed through a quick clockwise 14 screen split of various scenes. But then we're introduced to the everyday interaction of characters who are already tired of each other. The solution is to introduce an outsider and see what mayhem he can cause. But the 6th character is used just as a plot device and all that ensues is a seduction scene and suggestions of an offscreen death. The plot is resolved by revealing the least likely character as a psychopath traitor. So what? In the very end the last victim was left alive in a cell  why? For the sequel? The frequent loss of focus through the webcams is irritating and the whirring camerafocus noises are done way too much. The nightvision effect with glinting pupils is overused and Emma's guntoting scene is a continuation of the Silence of the Lambs cellar sequence.Charlie was sexy  whoopee! Emma was a Mia Farrow lookalike. The male actors didn't register.Great concept. Just so irritating to have to carp and carp and ... hey after 2 hours viewing I'm allowed to have a go. Maybe the Japanese will run with this concept and score with truly disturbing scenes.".

I have just spent two of the most excruciatingly unenjoyable hours of my moviegoing life watching what can most kindly be termed a pile of witless crap not wanting to walk out for fear of offending the friends that my wife and I went to the cinema with.I was quite frankly glad when the five central characters were dispatched in tediously unimaginative fashion but was disappointed to note that noone appeared to have done the decent thing and ensured that the director cameraman and scriptwriter now that's GOT to be an offence under the Trades Description Act joined them in gory oblivion. If they'd asked I'd have done it myself only too happy to help.This film is utterly devoid of any plot worth noticing they have a plot device but it's more guff than mcguffin. Characterisation is minimal risible and banal. The script makes Conan the Barbarian sound like Citizen Kane. Their attempt to coopt Teh Intarweb as a dramatic device is possible the only bright moment in the film as one of the characters converts his GPS receiver into a wireless modem and gets better page load times than I get with a 512kbps cable service. How dey do dat den? The film is poorly shot with abysmal wacky camera angles.On another level the films treatment of the female characters is actually downright nasty  and I'm not talking about Halloweentype scream queen stuff it's just deeply unpleasant.I don't even have much of an objection to dumb films but this one doesn't even fall into the so bad it's at least a good laugh category.All in all I can heartily recommend this film to anyone that I really don't like  but you guys here do yourselves a favour and avoid this one.This has been a cinematic health warning thank you for your attention.

The twist being that it's all being filmed for the internet and if just one of the house mates leaves? Then the task has failed. Pretty soon the house mates' resolve is tested as the mysterious company starts doing all they can to make the group implode.Riding in on the wave of Big Brother style reality shows and low budget documentary type films such as Blair Witch My Little Eye is an unsettling and claustrophobic horror piece. The set up is perfect an old dark house setting filled with darkened rooms and the whirring of cameras. Five unlikable characters a reality TV staple it seems. And then there's us the viewers. Observing as these five beings three boystwo girls are steadily tortured psychologically. We be voyeurs to edgy emotion as the group start to crack under duress things from their pasts are used against them. And of course nothing is quite what it seems. Given the truly creepy first hour the piece is not as scary as a whole as it could have been. But Evans utilises the cleverly conceived premise for a series of shocks and unease inducing sequences. The sound effects are jolting and the night time green tint moments are hugely effective. The cast are standard fare but that's most likely the point of it all in that we need wannabe stars instead of stars and the finale has a nice bent to it that lifts it away from the film's it has took influence from. Good and creepy horror piece that has a terrific DVD release that further implicates us in the story. 710".

The premise is quite simple. Five people enter a netcam rigged house for six months all they have to do is stay for the duration and they get one million each. Pretty tempting reward I have to admit and the film started off quite well. Light references to 'The Breakfast Club' made the opening a lot more enjoyable. The characters are all well presented and we have no problem understanding exactly their personality although the relationships to each other seem unrealistic considering they have been spending the last six months together. There is bitchiness but the group dynamic is not pushed to its limit and it seems unbelievable that these people would live together for so long considering they have so little in common even for a million bucks. The arrival of a letter telling one of the contestants his grandfather is dead is the start of supposedly manipulative techniques on the part of 'The Company'. A series of events and arrivals lead up to an ending that for me made little sense even in the realms of cinema. In modern society where 'reality' based shows are becoming more popular this film tries to add a 'what if' factor that just doesn't pan out. The climax ends up being little more then a cheap frill that we have paid good money to see. A sentiment echoed in the film but without the impact to make any real statement. I understand what the filmmakers were trying to say about modern society and our voyeuristic needs as well as our morbid desires but they just didn't exploit the films potential enough. The dynamic of the group the location and the theme of the film could have been presented a lot better and the concluding effort to twist the story and surprise us just left me with a feeling of disappointment and frustration. There was so much more potential in this film that could have been executed if the filmmakers looked at what it is that makes reality shows popular in the first place before trying to make a horror hybrid.".

Instead we fast forward to the last couple of days of the stunt and endure some lame incidents which result in a lot of clamour and shoutiness  from novice actors squawking predicatable and largely worthless lines.Convenient in terms of a short film  but poor plotting story wise.The climax  as it is  comes as no surprise and the film is almost entirely shockless and goreless. My happygosplatter cheery demeanour was crushed with bored misery by the time the credits rolled  and due to a printing error in the running time I had expected indeed looked forward to another 25 mins of screen time but as soon as the final die is cast the film abruptly ceases  just when there was scope for a bit of extreme nastiness and depravity onscreen  I won't elaborate but I was sorely aggrieved that nothing further happened. ha ha haIt's as if the Texas Chainsaw massacre hadn't been made.  Now that is a low budget movie that delivers the goods  in fact it is almost a blueprint for every film that came after. A pity the makers obviously hadn't heard of it really as in the 28 years since it was made  it seems that the horror genre has completely lost the power to be original or shock  and is regressing in quality.Too many stupid contrivances. No depth. Pointless in the extreme. Characterlessfacelessuseless. I really cannot think of a single good reason to watch this absolute crying disgrace of a film.Really  see it yourself by all means  I'm only writing this to get it out of my system so I no longer feel spavined by abnegation  but if you dig Halloween Texas Chainsaw massacre Argento Hooper Romero movies etc peter jackson even his pre LOTR stuff and you know your horror movieslike me  then you will sit there stunned that people as giftless and feckless as this are allowed anywhere near a movie camera.On the other hand if you thought Jeepers creepers  was good well the first 15 mins are OK then you may be enthralled by this little flick. If you are scared by flapping birds or green lights then you'll love it.I simply left the cinema with a really miserable face on. As a writer I make a point of seeing 100's of films a year to hone my craft and each year I swear that the decent ones are both fewer in number and lesser in quality.

Even more amazing when you realize anyone with a vacant house and a few aspiring actor buddies could have shot this thing over a long weekend. If you are thinking about watching this movie you could do worse and you could do better. It is just slightly below average.The concept of a thriller based on a sixmonth season of The Real World sounds promising and it actually starts out fairly well. It is a relief to find that none of the five housemates are anywhere near as irritating as Trashelle Puck or Mulie. Unfortunately as things progress the plot holes begin to overshadow the whole concept. Just the idea of waiting almost six months to begin killing off the characters strains all credibility. Apparently the rich clients who are paying for this exercise in torture get some enjoyment from watching six months of mundane Real World stupidity then they really get off on witnessing the longanticipated demise of the cast. A more promising idea would be if the rich clients were people with a past grudge against each cast member who pay contract killers to wipe out their specific enemy as part of a group kill. The screenwriter vaguely hints at this possibility but it is never confirmed so such a scenario was probably not part of the story.Like Blair Witch the videography is intentionally horrible because it is supposed to be from eye in the sky surveillance cameras. Unfortunately they decided that limiting the POV to wide surveillancetype shots would be uninteresting so they quickly destroy the illusion with handheld tight shots and nervous editing.If you saw Jennifer Sky in the Three Blondes episode of Charmed or on Xena you would be hard pressed to identify her in My Little Eye. They actually manage to make her look dowdy in this movie which was quite an achievement certainly more difficult than anything else they attempted.".

Discovering his prodigious talent in boyhood overshadowed by his parents' failing marriage Luzhin's lyrical passion for chess has become his refuge and rendered the real world a phantom. Already matched up by her family to the very suitable Comte de Stassard when Natalia meets Luzhin she is drawn to the erratic genius and offers him a glimpse outside of his chess obsession. But it is a world he is not equipped to deal with and his two worlds collide to tragic effect.";

	schema:reviewBody "Obsession comes in many flavors and exists for a variety of reasons for some it may be nothing more than a compulsive disorder but for others it may be an avenue of survival.  Lack of nurturing combined with an inability to negotiate even the simplest necessities of daily life or the basic social requirements may compel even a genius to enthusiastically embrace that which provides a personal comfort zone.  And in extreme cases the object of that satisfaction may become a manifested obsession driving that individual on until what began as a means of survival becomes the very impetus of his undoing and as we discover in The Luzhin Defence' directed by Marleen Gorris a high level of intelligence will not insure a satisfactory resolution to the problem and in fact may actually exacerbate the situation.  Obsession it seems has no prejudice or preference moreover it gives no quarter.At an Italian resort in the 1920's Alexander Luzhin John Turturro is one of many who have gathered there for a chess tournament the winner of which will be the World Champion.  Luzhin is a Master of the game but he is vulnerable in that chess has long since ceased to be a game to him rather it is his obsession that one thing discovered in childhood that saw him though his total ineptness in seemingly all areas of life and enabled him to cope with the subtle disenfranchisements of his immediate family.  So Luzhin is a genius with an Achilles heel a flaw which perhaps only one other person knows about and understands and furthermore realizes can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament.  That man is Valentinov Stuart Wilson Luzhin's former mentor who after an absence of some years has suddenly reappeared and made himself known to Luzhin.Valentinov is an unwelcomed disconcerting presence to Luzhin and once again life threatens to overwhelm him.  Not only is he about to face a formidable opponent in the tournament Turati Fabio Sartor against whom in a previous match he emerged with a draw after fourteen hours but he is also attempting to resolve a new element in his life his feelings for a young woman he's just met at the resort Natalia Emily Watson.  And genius though he may be dark clouds are gathering above him that just may push Luzhin even deeper into the obsession that has been the saving grace as well the curse of his entire life.To tell Luzhin's story Gorris effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that very quickly led to his obsession with chess.  And as his background is established it affords the insights that allow the audience to more fully understand who Luzhin is and how he got to this point in his life.  For the scenes of his childhood Gorris textures them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that carries on into and underlies the present more pastoral setting of the resort.  The transitions through which she weaves the past together with the present are nicely handled and with the pace Gorris sets it makes for a riveting yet unrushed presentation that works extremely well.  She also underplays the menace produced by the presence of Valentinov concentrating on the drama rather than the suspense which ultimately serves to heighten the overall impact of the film making Luzhin's tragedy all the more believable and unsettling.The single element that makes this film so memorable however is the affecting performance of John Turturro.  For this film to work Luzhin must be absolutely believable one false or feigned moment would be disastrous as it would take the viewer out of the story immediately.  It doesn't happen however and the film does work because the Luzhin Turturro creates is impeccably honest and truetolife.  He captures Luzhin's genius as well as his inadequacies and presents his character in terms that are exceptionally telling and very real.  It's a performance equal to if not surpassing Geoffrey Rush's portrayal of David Helfgott in Shine.'  And when you compare his work here with other characters he's created from Sid Lidz in Unstrung Heroes' to Pete in O Brother Where Art Thou?' to Al Fountain in Box of Moonlight' you realize what an incredible range Turturro has as an actor and what a remarkable artist he truly is.As Natalia Emily Watson is excellent as well turning in a fairly reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely.  Though she has to be somewhat outgoing to relate to Luzhin Watson manages to do it in an introspective way that is entirely effective. Most importantly because of the detail she brings to her performance it makes her accelerated relationship with Luzhin believable and lends total credibility to the story.  You have but to look into Watson's eyes to know that the feelings she's conveying are real.  It's a terrific bit of work from a talented and gifted actor.The supporting cast includes Geraldine James Vera Christopher Thompson Stassard Peter Blythe Ilya Orla Brady Anna Mark Tandy Luzhin's Father Kelly Hunter Luzhin's Mother Alexander Hunting Young Luzhin and Luigi Petrucci Santucci.  Well crafted and delivered The Luzhin Defence' is an emotionally involving film presented with a restrained compassion that evokes a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection upon man's inhumanity to man.  We don't need a movie of course to tell us that there is cruelty in the world but we are well served by the medium of the cinema when it reminds us of something we should never forget inasmuch as we all have the ability to effect positive change and to make a difference in the lives of those around us.  I rate this one 910.".

Emily Watson is excellent as the beautiful young woman who tries to stay Luzhin's descent into insanity and John Turturro does his best with Luzhin himself.But I don't think Vladimir Nabokov would've liked this movie much. For one thing the poppsychologizing the screenplay inflicts on Luzhin blurs and ultimately ruins the purity of his madness. And there is the matter of Luzhin's name. Throughout the novel for reasons that become clear as you read it he is known only as Luzhin even to his wife until on the very last page we learn his name and patronymic Aleksandr Ivanovich. But in the movie everyone calls him Aleksandr Ivanovich his wife even calls him Sascha. Huge mistake.Worst of all the happysappy ending with its preposterous posthumous victory for Luzhin is so far removed from the tragedy of Nabokov's novel that it's actually offensive. I assume Nabokov's ending was deemed too stark and horrifying.".

Judging by the number of positive responses here they succeeded. There is only one problem the film has nothing to do with the novel. Indeed how would they make a commercially successful movie about a fat unattractive man who marries a dull woman who doesn't understand him? Yeah let's turn the loser into a winner even after the death substitute the dull wife for an understanding fiance throw in an antagonist add costumes remove thoughts and we have an amazing definitely worth seeing movie. Who cares about being faithful to Nabokov  he's dead.Either the film writers are braindead or they think that the audience is.

	schema:reviewBody "John Turturro Emily Watson Geraldine James Stuart Wilson directed by Marleen Gorris loosely based on the novel by Vladimir Nabokov The Luzhin Defence is set in nineteentwenties Italy's lake district where the world championships of Chess are being staged. Our hero Luzhin Turturro is a main contender for the title and recognized as one of the greatest chess minds of the era. He is utterly consumed by game and has utterly devoted his life to the contest since a young age. It has been both obsession and addiction for the man as it is both all he knows and what gives his life meaning. While competing in the championships he meets Natalia Watson a wealthy socialite. Showing his peculiarity he immediately asks her to marry him sight unseen. Intrigued by his straight forward manner she does not immediately dismiss him.This is due to the fact that she is here for her mother to choose a suitor for her and Luzhin's eccentricity is seen by her as a welcome change. Her mother James is completely taken aback by such an idea and wants her daughter to marry someone of similar prestige and means. All of this transpires while his old chess teacher Wilson tutors his chief rival wanting nothing more than to see Luzhin humiliated.Being a chess movie it could immediately be set aside as dull and unwatchable being as Chess is not exactly a spectator sport.However this movie is much less about chess and much more about the people surrounding the game making it a piece about the interactions of personalities and not pieces. The movie does find a parallel however as it is shown like a chess match between two sides the present and the past shown through flashbacks with one side prevailing at the end. This storytelling choice works surprisingly well as we gain much insight as to why Luzhin is the way he is and how he views the world.The movie begins with a telling piece of cinematography as the audience is given the perspective of a train conductor emerging from a tunnel. This is especially significant when viewed in the sense of Luzhin's later mental breakdown and can be seen as meaning the same thing. This scene is then segued into the first flashback giving us a pattern that can be seen in the rest of the film. Other notable scenes include the meeting of Natlalia and Alexander at a tennis court and later when he is thinking to himself in their bedroom There is a pattern emerging! cries the eccentric chess genius Alexander Luzhin. I must keep trackevery second! To which Natalia whom he loves can only reply It sounds like such a lonely battle.' This all encompassing effect of chess on him can also be seen earlier in the film as he is being driven by one of his old chess teachers chauffeurs into the middle of the countryside is dropped off there and does not notice. The end adds character to the film without being overly dramatic but is a departure from the finish of the novel however it is believable and adds to the sense that Luzhin does not really control himself or know how.Overall an enjoying piece of film more about camera angles and people then chess. After the first half the films pace drastically speeds up and the plot becomes much more intriguing. Can best be compared to other independent films of its ilk yet also suffices quite well as a period piece. Probably not a buy but a worthy rental for an evening at home.".

	schema:reviewBody "Walking home after the film I was humming the familiar waltz music that Natalia and Alexandre were dancing to. I've heard that before  where?  Ah from Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut track 2 'got it just as I arrived at the door. It's Waltz No. 2 from Jazz Suite No. 2 composed by Dimitri Shostakovich performed here by The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. Yes I went and picked up the soundtrack from Tower's. What a treat! The film score by Alexandre Desplat was fulfilling  there are fifteen tracks besides two tracks of the delightful waltz. It's not often these days we get a soundtrack entirely dedicated to a comprehensive film score. Reminds me of favorite scores by Maurice Jarre Ennio Morricone beginning notes of track 6 have traces of Nuovo cinema Paradiso Georges Delerue and John Barry. There are subtle nuances of strains and notes from the strings celeste piano and harp. Emily Watson and John Turturro delivered a credibly consuming paired performance. The love story their intimate connection is very much between Alexandre and Natalia  his childlike yet tormenting inner world and her generous and bold understanding of him  a relationship alone to them both. Director Marleen Gorris of Antonia's Line 1996 Academy Award's Best Foreign Language Film from the Netherlands gave us a quietly sensitive film  not without its unsettling human conflicts intrigues obsessions family strives lovingness and respect. The frontend subject is the mindgame and mathematical logic of chess. Beneath it can be a mild tearjerker of a drama set in the late 1920's. Cinematography captures the serene beauty of Lake Como in northern Italy near the Swiss border.I highly recommend the soundtrack if you don't feel like going to the movies. Alexandre Desplat's lyrical film score of The Luzhin Defence is complete.".

His brilliance is unquestioned but his obsession with chess has stunted his growth in all other aspects of his life. Natalia Emily Watson is a beautiful heiress who has come to the same resort with her mother Vera Geraldine James to scope out possible marriage partners. Vera leans toward a handsome count but astonishingly Natalia is more fascinated by Sascha whom she met on a walk. Sascha too is taken with Natalia and proposes marriage at their second meeting. But with the concentration that Sascha must give to the chess matches and with other happenings in his past still causing problems will he win the heart of Natalia? Oh and can he become the chess champion also? This is a lovely film based on a novel by Nabokov. The acting is amazing with Watson very fine as the beautiful little rich girl and Turturro utter perfection as the shy awkward chess enthusiast. James gives quite a nice turn as the overbearing mother and the other cast members are wonderful as well. As for the look of the film it could not be better. The scenery is of the putyoureyeout variety the vintage costumes are gorgeous and the cinematography is deserving of much applause. Yes the story is unusual and told with the use of flashbacks at times making it a film not everyone will appreciate. Then too the ending is bittersweet. However if you love romance period pieces great acting knockout scenery or the fine art of motion picture creation don't miss this one. You will be defenseless in resisting its multitude of charms.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Luzhin Defence' is a good film with fine central performances but too much of the novel and not enough of the filmmaker's craft shines through. It felt through most of the film that the characters just helped to push the narrative along. Marlene Gorris could perhaps have examined the psyche of Luzhin rather than depicting him as a tortured innocent victim torn apart by the cruel motives of others.Adapting literature for the screen is clearly a difficult task especially a novel written in the early 20th century. This film does not go deeply enough into the relationship between Luzhin and Natalia. Natalia's rift with her mother comes across a churlish disagreement by the mother rather than a dramatic flashpoint in the film. I felt that I was put through Luzhin's torment and eventual tragic end without being given the pleasure of having his unusual and complex personality unravelled. However this was a moving and enjoyable film but certainly not a great one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Emily Watson's Natalia is absolutely the most loving and romantic lead character I have ever seen on a screen.  She is the queen of this film beyond all doubt.  Or is she transmuted to the king?  The internecine weaving of the chess games and the families' struggles for control power and victory is stunning.  Just as the chess masters in the film do the director is playing many simultaneous games with our mind at once but all weave into either major or minor patterns.  The period the costumes and imagery of early 20th century Italy's lake district is captured magnificently.  Not a single square of space is wasted.So many brilliant scenes abound I cannot recount them all.  I recommend budgeting enough time to watch this movie twice possibly a week apart because you can't possibly capture all the poetry within a 64square yet multidimensional framework in one setting.  I did not read Nabakov's book but to try an analogy of my own what I am reading reminds of me of another romantically triumphant poetryasgame movie Barry Levinson's The Natural.  It totally jettisoned the downbeat ending of Bernard Malamud's fatalistic book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely American.  Well the director did that one better by seamlessly meshing Russian and Italian morals and mores as a backdrop to enlightenment.  The true story here is that games are zerosum there is a winner and a loser unless both contestants draw.  But in life and especially in the context of our immortal souls we are only limited by those constraints and life's conventions to the extent we let others break our spirit.  Pure love as personified by Emily Watson's Natalia can transcend and allow all of us to be enhanced by its gifts simultaneously.  Only the barriers erected by our fears can cut us off from it.This is a magnificent movie 1010.".

Similarly Emily Watson shows the wealth of her experience from her outstanding background on the stage. To reach the tortured chess master Turturro her character has to display intelligence as well as a woman's love. Watson does not portray beautypageant sexuality but she brings to her parts a selfawareness that is alluring.In a chance meeting between Natalia Watson and Luzhin she casually stops him from losing a chess piece that has fallen through a hole in his clothing  a specially crafted piece that we realize later in the film has come to symbolize his hopes and aspirations. Later as their love affair develops she subtly likens dancing to chess Luzhin has learnt to dance but never with a partner she encourages him to lead her with bold brilliant moves and in doing so enables him to relax sufficiently to later play at his best and also realize himself as her lover.This is a story of a woman who inspires a man to his greatest achievement and in so doing finds her own deepest fulfillment emotionally and intellectually Or so we are led to believe  certainly within the time frame Natalia is something of a liberated woman rather than someone who grooms herself to be a stereotypical wife and mother.The Italian sets are stunning. The complexity of the characters and the skill with which the dialogue unfolds them is a delight to the intelligent moviegoer yet the film is accessible enough to make it a popular mainstream hit and most deservedly so. Chess is merely the photogenic backdrop for developing an emotional and emotive movie although the game is treated with enough respect to almost convince a chessplayer that the characters existed. Although a tragedy of remarkable heights by a classic author the final denouement is nevertheless surprisingly uplifting.".

For this he isnt loved but used instead as a tool by people who has lets say an ambiguous relationship towards his talent. Cold loneliness arrives as soon as Failure turns its head toward the highstrung chessplayer. Dropped off into the street like a defenseless kitten by his mentor Luzhin is left to his own devices. He certainly is good but not winnermaterial the cruel jealous mentor have determined. Turturro is always interesting to watch as he usually gives life and depth to the character but alas he does not bring his magic to the party this time. Everything about this movie seems rushed and his portrayal of the great lonely genius does not ring true. Instead of subtlety there is mannerisms and instead of the chores of a chessmaster we are given an incredulous lovestory. And as Turturro acts out his bumbling fool routine enter love interest Watson  a rich gal on holiday with Mother for whom the world is filled with up and coming young fellas perfect matches all for her daughters hand in marriage. The two of course fall in love  and we are left wondering Why?The scenes themselves seem to be sadly detached from one another. Its as if director Gorris uses every angle in the book to show off her ability which is uncalled for most of the times. Sadly its  downright bad in some scenes as being prominently displayed in the scene in which Luzhin plays the Game of A Lifetime with the camera shooting him from a distorted nervous angle invariably bringing an alien overly dramatic feeling to the story which distracts the viewer as well as when Gorris cuts between the two lovers doing it and the chessplayers downstairs in their head to headbattle for glory. Or when Luzhins cigaretteintake increases dramatically as soon as he believes himself to be a Winner. These things seem to merely be tricks pulled from the sleeves. The subtleties are left to their own devices here letting a strange combination of being both rushed and overambitious replace any true feeling that could have come out of this interesting story. There is not one bad actor among them and yet the story fails miserably. Nabokovs books usually works on many different levels and that might be what gives this movie its limp. For chessplayers it is fun to recognize Capablanca in Luzhins nr 1 opponent as well as Alekhine Rubinstein and Morphy in Luzhin himself.  As for the end well....Who didnt see that one coming ? Its apparently not the ending of the book and one might see why. The true weakness is revealed in the final chessbattle when Luzhins genius are supposed to shine through. I dare anyone with some knowledge of the game to pause the movie and figure out the outcome when the chessboard is in the shot. It should take a few seconds to see whats to come or at least no more than a minute for sure. If you are into chess this is not for you. If you like tvmovies with nice sceneries and oldfashioned clothes and values then by all means see it.".

Listen closely to that description.When someone asks him a question he flashbacks to the past as if reviewing past moves. The flashbacks are beautifully lit by the way. The flashbacks are quite interesting as well for they give not only his point of view as a child but the point of view of the other character as well. It's stunning.Various characters become either his helpers or his enemies pawns bishops and knights their actions enlightening you as to who's side they are on. Even their placement in a scene is pivotal to understanding what is going on. Beautifully done.I will not comment more on what happens to the character of Luhzin but I hope that this will illuminate what is actually happening at the end.This film is constantly working on many levels which is why I endorse it. It was a treat and a joy to watch.If you like this film I would recommend a film called Fresh.

Translating such mental dynamism to a movie would be very difficult.  Alternately the approach taken by the film seems like it could have worked on its own level and one has to wonder why it was allowed to fail.  My guess is that there was pressure to cut this movie down to a shorter length perhaps figuring that audiences could only take so much of the tortured main character's wailings.  There are numerous instances of poorly done cuts not in keeping with the rest of the film where scenes look as if they were chopped short in midstride as if to get to the end faster.  I don't mean to be flip here either but there are such significant gaps in character development that one has to imagine that the released film is not what the directors and writers had in mind.   As a result we never appreciate fully either the nature of Luzhin's inner torment or the motivations of the villainous Valentinov who is just so cruel that his motivations demand some fleshing out.The sentimental ending which predictably is not based on anything in Nabakov's novel fits in awkwardly with the rest of the film though it does at least fit.  Considering the movie's terse treatment of its characters the more pointed ending supplied by Nabakov would have come off as unsatisfying and hollow.".

I don't mean to be flip here either but there are such significant gaps in character development that one has to imagine that the released film is not what the directors and writers had in mind.   As a result we never appreciate fully either the nature of Luzhin's inner torment or the motivations of the villainous Valentinov who is just so cruel that his motivations demand some fleshing out.The sentimental ending which predictably is not based on anything in Nabakov's novel fits in awkwardly with the rest of the film though it does at least fit.  Considering the movie's terse treatment of its characters the more pointed ending supplied by Nabakov would have come off as unsatisfying and hollow.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is clearly a movie made by intelligent people with a sense for setting and costume music and the right cast for the parts interesting camera work and a fine ability to move back and forth in time and place without confusing us.The cast is just right  Turturro is playing a part quite similar to others he's played  the wildly eccentric intellectual misfit. Think of The 64000 Question. The lovely Geraldine James most famous for the series Jewel in the Crown  though I later saw her on stage as a wonderful Portia with Dustin Hoffman in The Merchant of Venice virtually switches parts with her mother's character in Jewel in the Crown  archly conventional upset at her daughter's unconventionality. James had played that unconventional sweet hearted daughter in Jewel. Watson again as in Breaking the Waves plays a woman willing to sacrifice herself to the love she believes she has found. The problem I have is that the love story seems implausible. I suppose we need to see some flashbacks to Watson's character's past not merely the reference by her father to her past to understand why she would fall for this unprepossessing man. E.g. she seems to greatly enjoy the company of the charming handsome Frenchman who seems a far more likely candidate for her affection. Clearly we are not meant to think this love is merely rebellion against her parents  but there just isn't anything else to hang your hat on  to see WHY she is drawn to this man. Watson is a wonderful actress  the features of her face are extraordinarily facile  but her looks are so everyday EnglishIrish that it's hard to think of her as an aristocratic emigree. She has always struck me as looking like any young woman in the queue for the bus after a visit to the market or arriving at the dance with her friends. She merges so readily into any crowd. Cf. most famous English actresses  from Julie Christie to Diana Rigg from Margaret Lockwood to Vivien Leigh Vanessa Redgrave or Madeleine Carroll Catherine ZetaJones or Jacqueline Bisset Claire Bloom or Catherine ZetaJones from Greer Garson to Jean Simmons to Deborah Kerr or Elizabeth Hurley Julia Ormond or Kate Winlet or Polly Walker Natasha or Joely Richardson  they are all memorable looking stunningly beautiful generally tall distinctive  none of this is true of Watson  who is one of the finest actresses of the lot.I suppose that's to say that she has a VERY common look  though I don't mean coarse looking. There's simply nothing aristocratic looking about Miss Watson. In that sense she has more of the appearance of the adult Hayley Mills or Rita Tushingham or Toni Collette. She fits more easily into the world of the shopgirl than the aristocrat emigree.  So visually I never DID think of her as a wealthy aristocratic young woman  despite the beauty of her and her family's clothes or the opulence of her surroundings. Perhaps this is simply more realistic  in real life I don't find the wellborn any more aristocratic looking than the lowborn but in movie convention they certainly are and as a viewer it's what I have come to expect. At any rate I just don't believe the love story  Turturro does nothing to make me believe that this woman would fall in love with him. SPOILERS  And the moral of the tale is an odd one  the parents strongly urge her against this marriage  they believe he's a terrible match. They believe he's mad and will bring terrible heartache. And bingo! They're RIGHT! He fails to show up at their wedding and commits suicide that very day.The movie makes it seem as if there will be no terrible psychological consequences to Watson's character from all this  yet we all know that there would be. So this is an odd romance  one where the ogre mother is proved right!! A daughter's refusal to listen to her parents has now brought on a terrible selfinflicted wound  and aside from the rather silly ending has ended VERY badly indeed.Moreover does the movie understand what it's saying with the tackedon ending? Is it not vindicating the sickness of Luzhin by creating this silly ending? The fiancee unable to help her lover because she's unable to rid him of his obsessions  then shows he was right to have such obsessions? That seems confused.   SPOILERS END  I also had trouble believing that the villain would really spend the time and effort and energy and money to go to any length to stop the protagonist  when they had not even seen each other for over a decade  and the protagonist had never inflicted any injury upon the villain. Like the love story this remorseless villain just seemed  implausible. The motivation seemed lacking for both the love story and the villainy.All that said this is a beautiful movie with fine production values good acting. Those who loved A Dangerous Mind Hillary and Jackie or Rush or the sort of atmosphere of A Month by the Lake Enchanted April Up at the Villa or Tea with Mussolini  will probably quite like this movie.".

Snug in retirement he's closed off to his past the years he spent in the Special Forces training soldiers to become skilled killers. But when he realizes that these recent slaying is the work of a man he trained he feels obligated to stop him. Accepting the assignment under the condition that he works alone L.T. enters the woods unarmedplagued by memories of his best student and riddled with guilt for not responding to Aaron's tortured letters to him as he began to slip over the edge of sanity.

Do he and Bonham feel a fatherson bond for each other and if so when and why did that come about?The sloppy digital effects Tommy Lee's flailing torso spliced into the waterfall flashes of Benicio's face spliced onto the fountain's cascade as if he were in the cavity behind it.Really? You're going to stop in the middle of the chase to forge a knife from scrap iron? Really??? You know how long that would take and how noisy? So Bonham doesn't like guns he's gonna knap one from flint rather than ask an agent for a combat knife? In the middle of a pursuit? REALLY????The battlefield Kosovo set looked like a cross between Disneyland and Colonel Kurtz' most apocalyptic delusional nightmare. Too many pretty explosions overstuffed setting too populated by extras who don't even react to the pretty explosions occurring feet away too designed and manufactured looking etc.Yes the knife fight scenes were well choreographed bloody and inventive with nice portrayals of effort and gravity no wire work or movieland physics but they needed to be cut more tightly. The way aging Tommy Lee broadcast his moves Benicio would have filleted him like a fish nine ways to Sunday.If there's a deeper message to the film Show some respect for the beings you kill Honor thy Fatherfigure whatever it's trampled as badly by the pursuit as the ground is by the set dresser making blatantly overdone footprints for Tommy to track.I'd add more but this film's hardly worth it.".

Hallam is routinely ordered to execute strategic figures and he probably doesn't often know why. Sometimes he has to do his work in the midst of chaos and sometimes he has to take out people who get in the way. After a brief prologue establishing Hallam's character in the middle of the Bosnian conflict The Hunted has him back in the States trying to reintegrate with society. When Hallam can't do it L.T. is sent for to track him down.The Hunted is an actionchase film in the tradition of The Fugitive 1993. Thematically it is much closer to First Blood aka Rambo 1982 but it doesn't have the firepower of that film to its benefit the emphasis here is on brutal handtohand combat. On the surface at least the plot is an excuse for the chase and encounter scenes between Hallam and Bonham. If you're a fan of action and fighting films this may be right up your alley although there is more to be gained than the surface qualities.Director William Friedkin and the cast are able to create fairly complex characters in Hallam and Bonham through subtle means while the action material is occurring through wellplaced flashbacks and through two significant slower scenes that give us a momentary breather. But as much as Del Toro and Jones the stars of the film are the staging of the chases the staging of the fights and the spectacular stunt work. Del Toro and Jones seem to have done more stunt work than is the norm with Del Toro actually breaking his wrist at one point and halting the production of the film until it healed.Friedkin and editor Augie Hess deserve a lot of credit as action scenes like these can frequently become muddled. It's always perfectly clear what one location's relationship is to the next location what and why characters are doing what they're doing and just what is occurring in the fight sceneswho is injuring who and how. Friedkin never falls back on fast cuts blurry shots or speed control tricks to mask these scenes. The Hunted is also effective for retaining more realism than is the norm for contemporary action filmsnot that I ever subtract points for a lack of realism but the realism is novel here and in context works perfectly. Friedkin's choice of Johnny Cash songs for the opening and closing of the film was also inspired as were the beautiful locations.Of course there's also a more political subtext herenamely that we officially train persons to be fearless killers without a conscience and stick them into the middle of crazy situations often for extended periods of time then later expect them to be able to turn it off and meld back into society with all of its more mundane norms and mores. The film asks who is really responsible for the later behavior of these persons. The Hunter is also admirable for bringing up these issues but not providing definite curt answers. On this end it's not just an action film but a film to provoke serious thought and discussion.".

So if in the mood for a combination FugitiveRambo story with two very intense lead actors this is a convenient diversion to play numerous times.Tommy Lee Jones was the mentor who trained Benico Del Toro on the art of killing and now the exstudent has gone out of control and Jones must hunt him down something the police can't seem to do. That's the story simple as that. The only thing was a little implausible is that old man chasing down a kid for miles. Tommy Lee might be in shape but he isn't young enough to do what he does here. However both men are fun to watch and the action scenes are well done. You don't get bored watching this movie.No the film isn't highgrade mentality but it isn't totally stupid either. It doesn't get carried and is pretty believable until the final chase scene. Along the way we are treated the Portland cityscape and Northwest woods both of which are nicely filmed.".

Predator First Blood and Apocalypse Now all spring to mind. Indeed the film could be thought of as being a scenario on what might have happened to Capt. Willard from Apocalypse Now after he returned home after Viet Nam. Another connection is that The Hunted DP Caleb Deschanel served as insert DP on Apocalypse Now.Early on a payoff is set up when the filmmakers go to a small amount of trouble to show the audience that Tommy Lee Jones is afraid of heights. One of those moments where the viewer thinks 'that's gonna pay off later' it is never paid off despite Jones being caught in some tall situations as the story progresses.But I liked the film. Also worth noting is that I saw it having known absolutely nothing about it coming in. I have noticed a trend in my tastes where I seem to be drawn to films featuring deeplyflawed characters who nonetheless remain extremely capable. Think of John Anderton in Minority Report Agent Sands in Once Upon a Time in Mexico and even Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs and you begin to get the point. Well The Hunted features two such characters and they are in direct competition. I always liked films featuring worthy adversaries and The Hunted rates highly in this department. The scenes in the city where Jones attempts to track del Toro play this well with del Toro trained to vanish stalked by Jones trained to see.The Hunted also features a subtle and effective score by Brian Tyler and excellent photography by Caleb Deschanel with more than a slight nod to the aforementioned Apocalypse Now. Jones is good even if the audience does feel they have 'seen it all before' from Jones. But to his credit Jones is very physical in his performance and gives his all. Del Toro is also good playing a character murky of motivation and damaged of psyche.In closing I will say I see the film for the hugely derivative vehicle it is but I liked it anyway mostly because of the visuals and the physicality of the performances.Not recommended unless you can look past the similarities to other films. Or see it knowing nothing about it like I did. But if you've read this that is now impossible ".

Sure Its in the wilderness and Tommy Lee Jones said some things like Richard Crenna did in First Blood and his character trained Del Toro's character and Del Toro was being chased a lot but to Me it is a lot more than that! The scenes are spectacular! I don't think this movie deserves all of the bad comments it has gotten and I like Tommy Lee Jones' chase movies and I wouldn't mind to see him in another one! If you haven't see The Hunted and you like The above mentioned cast and action and chase films such as First Blood The Fugitive U.S. Marshals and Double Jeopardy then this movie is perfect for you!Movie Nuttball's note This is totally in My opinion and may offend people but I wanted to get this out. I like the subject in the plot of the Hunted of a man that made a sport hunting humans! I am not a fan of hunting and I think it is very bad for a person to do such a thing. Like one point in the film Benicio Del Toro said What if there was an animal higher than us on the food chain? And what if this suddenly lost all respect for us and started slaughtering us wholesale? Think about that! Also I like what he said to the girl about the animals about people being mean to them and such about people on purpose hitting them with their car. I see this stuff on the street and I think boy how would you like it if you were simply taking a walk and someone just hit you just for fun with their car? When he was talking about these things I almost cried! That's how good it is! I am an animal lover and I always been! Why can't others? I'm sorry to be like this but this is how I think and how I am.

Of course the FBI have to defer to Bonham and let him 'track' Hallem all over the woods and through Portland as well giving us the framework of the flick.Jone's looks old and tired in this movie and I never once believed he was up to the numerous combats he has with Del Torro but he also delivers his lines in a clipped unconvincing fashion. Speaking of bad acting Del Torro seems to put little thought into his delivery or character. What to make of these two fine actors slumming through this movie?The knife fighting was fun and mainly well done and the forest scenery was pretty but we would have done just as well with Stallone and Richard Crenna reprising their original roles and sadly Kotcheff too.".

Actually it is a movie I have already seen only then it was called 'First Blood' starring Sylvester Stallone as Rambo. Not that both movies are exactly the same even the atmosphere is very different but the basics are the same.Benicio Del Toro is Aaron Hallam a guy who fought in Kosovo in 1999. Four years later in the woods of Oregon he starts to kill hunters because he does not approve their methods. His technique is learned to him by L.T. Tommy Lee Jones and he must be the one to find Aaron. In one scene L.T. explains why Aaron does this and it sounds pretty reasonable. From this point the movie is basically a chase. Two men chasing each other.Like I said I had a good time. The story goes the way you would probably guess but it doesn't really matter. The images are always beautiful or interesting there is suspense and the man to man fights look very good especially the final one. Tommy Lee Jones Benicio Del Toro and also Connie Nielsen as a FBIagent make their characters believable. Not great but definitely entertaining.".

Now poor Hallam fearing both for his safety and sanity is out in the Portland woods killing what appear to be deer hunters.  Only these deer hunters have military telescopes attached to their rifles  not exactly a necessity when it comes to snagging yourself a buck.When L.T. Bonham Jones finds out that his former student Aaron Hallam is out in the woods eviscerating humans he reluctantly agrees to hunt him down and bring him to justice. When the two first confront one another in the woods Hallam asks Bonham why he never answered the letters Hallam had sent him.  It's obvious that the exsoldier was teetering at the edge of reality and Bonham was the only guy he felt that he could count on.  Ironically it turns out that Bonham is now the only person who can be counted on to kill the man he once taught how to murder quick and get away even faster.  So the chase is on ... and on ... and on and then the film ends.  It's honestly that simple.  Of course there are the tired your men can't take him out ... only I can because I was his ... teacher type dialogue thrown in presumably to make it seem even more like a gigantic First Blood ripoff than it already does.  Hallam's motives and Bonham's sense of guilt are both hinted at but neither character is fully fleshed out.  What could have been an excellent film ends up being chopped and hacked into nothing more than a cheap knockoff of a couple of Hollywood movies that worked well at the boxoffice in the notsodistant past.".

Hmmm... funny how the guy standing across from each of them never shot the goofball on the other side when it was on a stone floor! From beginning to end the script was FAR below the considerable abilities of both of the stars and I am pretty surprised that either of them took this feeble foppery on. As someone with familiarization with combat knife skills I know that a certain edged weapon expert was consulted for the film and this was its only saving grace. The bottom line is that a joke of a movie like this was far more in keeping with the tradition of GolanGlobus with Chuck Norris than legitimate attempts to show for one thing the very real suffering that some combat vets go through when they leave the military but NO we do NOT run around like lunatics cutting people apart shoot people from church towers and especially Special Operations troopers are specially screened in depth for any proclivity at all towards psychological instability.

Welcome to the Marseilles of Marseillesborn Robert Guediguian where nothing happens ... all at once. This guy has created and developed his own repertory company and like that other great regional specialist Marcel Pagnol returns again and again to his roots but not to flaunt the tourist side of Marseilles as filmmakers are wont to do with Paris merely to show the soft underbelly.

Once again she is more than ably supported by Guediguian stalwarts JeanPierre Darroussin who may have it written into his contract that he gets to dance every time he goes to bat  catch him in 'Un air de famille' and you'll see what I mean as Daniel and Gerard Meylan the Marius of 'Marius et Jeanette' as Marco the pilot. Midlife crises are not new neither are midlife affairs but whereas the couple in 'Brief Encounter' were terribly wellbehaved and kept a stiffupper lip whilst enduring the torment of middleaged longing the French menage a trois here let it all hang out.  The problem is that given the way Guediguian has elected to go with this story there's no real way to resolve it without upsetting some element of the audience.Brushing that aside this is a great movie by turns lyrical happy and heartbreaking. The three leads are outstanding but Neil Simon it isn't.  Rating   Four and one half stars going away.".

I have just watched the good movie 'La Ville Est Tranquille' and I have decided to see 'MarieJo et Ses 2 Amours' to know a little bit more about Robert Gudiguian. Inclusive both movies has the same cast. I found 'MarieJo et Ses 2 Amours' a nonoriginal tragic and moralist movie but again with a great performance of the cast. The storyline is identical to Ingmar Bergman's 'Berringen 1971' with the difference that 'Berringen' has an open end and is a great movie. 'MarieJo et Ses 2 Amours' is really a very disappointing film. My vote is six.Title Brazil 'MarieJo e Seus Dois Amores' 'MarieJo and Her Two Loves'".

Gudiguian I still have faith in your movies Marius et Jeanette ... but don't frighten me like this never more.";

	schema:reviewBody "Odd and unusual but nevertheless highly imaginative British supernatural horrorthriller story once more pairing the two legendary genre veterans Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing this time under the skillful direction of Peter Sasdy. Nothing but the Night somewhat plays in a league of its own as you definitely can't compare it to the extremely popular contemporary Hammer productions. I even daresay this is quite a unique piece of Brithorror which is probably why it required the constitution of a brand new production company named Charlemagne that didn't last very long afterwards. Nothing but the Night may be overly convoluted and full of irregularities but it's really not a bad film and it definitely doesn't deserve the embarrassingly low current IMDb rating of 3.2 out of 10! Adapted from a novel by John Blackburn the screenplay offers up a very ambitious and compelling mixture of mystery medical horror creepy country sides and typically British police work. The film is incredibly fast paced I can't fathom that some of my fellow reviewers call this movie boring and the plot is literally a nonstop series of red herrings and vague clues desperately attempting to avoid that any viewer would figure out the climax too fast. Let me tell you straight away you won't guess the full denouement no matter how clairvoyant you are as multiple story aspects and twists in Nothing but the Night are simply too absurd and implausible for normal human beings to even consider. Once again though this doesn't mean it's not fascinating and entertaining to look at. The film opens with an immediate attentiongrabber as we're right away treated to grisly images of three murders looking like suicide. Police Colonel Bingham Christoper Lee later explains to his friend Dr. Mark Ashley Peter Cushing that all victims were trustees of a prominent but highly secluded orphanage on a small Scottish island. When one of the orphanage's children is hospitalized after a mysterious bus accident the young doctor Haynes wants to investigate the girl's bizarre nightmares but the influential Van Traylen Fund trustees prevent this. The girl's flamboyant and aggressive birth mother also wants to reclaim her but the orphanage lies isolated and well protected a small island only reachable by ferry boats. Some abrupt plot twists work very efficient whereas other red herrings are blatantly obvious. For example we're supposed to believe that Anna Harb  the girl's real mother  is a complete psychopath but that would just be too easy. Peter Sasdy maintains a sinister atmosphere throughout and the Scottish isle and countryside filming locations are stupendous. There aren't many bloody moments but there's a fair portion of suspense and a couple of shocking insinuations. Other people claim that both Lee and Cushing are underused in the film which may perhaps be a little true but their characters are terrific and I swear I've seen films where their names were more shamelessly exploited for even smaller roles like Scream and Scream Again for instance. Not a masterpiece of Brithorror but a worthwhile movie in case you're looking for something creepy yet different.".

Then I was instantly transported back to the mid 1980's watching Saturday afternoon television on a local station.I may be in a great minority with loving this film which I don't even rank as a true horror film but it's pretty close. It has shades of The Wicker Man to be sure. Lee and Cushing give some of their best performances and thankfully have a great many scenes together. All of the other actors do fine as well. The countryside near the old fishing village is so succulent you can taste the mouldering old stone walls and outcroppings and imagine the wee folk running about playing tricks at twilight.This film is pretty slow going mainly talkywhich is a grand thing when you've got Lee and Cushing. There is minimal bloodshed almost G rated although there is a scene where Cushing examines the remains of some dead people but it's obviously just some leftovers from the butcher shop and not even worth fussing over.The plot involves a worn out old hoor trying to get her daughter back after the old mom was in the clink for a time on murder and prostitution charges. The daughter has been living in an orphanage run by some trustees to some dead lady's fortune on a small but enchanting isle. There are some Grated murders one huge red herring with red hair and a red coat no less and a longlimbed girl at the center of it who's all elbows and knees and is a damn pretty version of Anna Paquin. This movie seems to want to be a detective thriller until the last ten minutes when it switches gears unevenly into a strange amalgam of cultistswitcheryscience gone wild. But don't let the poor ratings others have given this flick put you off. Even if you aren't huge fans of Cushing or Lee you'll find some tastiness in this old forgotten relic. I'm glad I unearthed it and blew the dust off after so many years. Now it sits firmly in my guilty pleasure stack.".

	schema:reviewBody "Three trustees of the Van Travlen have died within the last couple of months their deaths looking less than natural. When a bus accident occurs involving the Van Traylen Trust the only survivor is the young girl Mary Valley. The behaviour of Mary has Dr Haynes worried so he tries his best to dig up information on her and this leads to her original motherconvicted murderer. She wants Mary back but the Trust manages to bring her back to their orphanage on the Scottish isle of Bala. Police Colonel Bingham believes there's more to these deaths and soon his trying to protect the Trust from Mary's mother who believes that they turned her daughter against her. Also pathologist Sir Mark Ashley and reporter Joan Foster start digging up some vital dirt which could answer many questions. Nothing But the Night seems to fall more in the interesting bracket than the successful one. Peter Sasdy's minor mystery chiller is a moderate attempt made more accessible due to the presence of Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. It was actually produced under Lee's Charlemagne production company and would be the last one too. These two icons of the genre can make anything watchable and even though they might not be as prominent here. They still have the ability to leave their mark when they aren't on screen. Brain Hayles' cryptic screenplay taken off John Blackburn's novel works up a smart if overly padded script and captivating dying half but the knotty plot doesn't seem to click as it moves all over the place making it hard to get comfortable and come to terms with the haunting payoff. You might find the twist kinda obvious but the true revelation throws you off. It does take quite awhile to hit its straps. Which could turn people off from its talkative and slow progression. However the timidly restraint and uncertain nature only makes the final 10 minutes even more unnerving as that's when the murder mystery makes way for some creepy horror strokes. Both Sasdy and Hayles do a good enough job in keeping the viewer interested. Sasdy uses the open locations to great effect and ably stages the set pieces with efficient slickness and ominously dark shades. Malcolm Williamson's lightly smooth jazzy score stays on the backburner and Ken Talbot's sturdy photography keeps it stark and upfront. The performances are considerably tailormade. Lee more uptight than usual and Cushing are at their assured best even if they only have lesser parts. The spruce Diana Dors makes for a good fiery eccentric turn and Georgia Brown's is equally impressive as the downtoearth reporter. Gwyneth Strong wonderfully draws up her part as Mary. A middling hot impeccably acted and cold unfocused story mystery thriller.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nothing But the Night of 1973 is a film with a bad reputation. The films bad reputation and a rating of only 3.210 on this site is not necessarily due to the films awfulness however but merely because it disappoints for what it is. Nothing But the Night was directed by Peter Sasdy who had also directed three very good Horror films for the Hammer Studios Taste The Blood of Dracula Countess Dracula and Hands of The Ripper and stars the great Horror icons Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. The film was produced by Christopher Lee's own production company Charlemagne productions and obviously picked up on the recent Horror trend of supernaturaloccult themes. This film is considerably weaker compared to Sasdy's aforementioned films and especially considering the many brilliant other CushingLee collaborations. Yet the film is not as terrible as the rating might suggest.After a mysterious bus accident the investigating Scotland Yard Col. Charles Bingham Lee suspects a relation to previous murders. The mystery about the accident is how the busdriver could have burned when there was no fire in the accident... The film is way too slow and the explanations are sometimes silly or illogical but as far as I am concerned the storyline which continues as a supernatural Horror mystery is not all that bad. The film bears some similarities to several other British Horror productions. The idea of occultists using children for resurrection had been used on several occasions before such as in the Hammer Studios' The Witches of 1966 which is also only mediocre. The Scottish island setting reminds of an absolute masterpiece from the same year Robin Hardy's The Wicker Man which is arguably the most brilliant film Christopher Lee was ever involved in. This resemblance can not be seen as a lack of originality though as this film was actually released earlier in 1973 than The Wicker Man. Christopher Lee as the police detective and Peter Cushing as the forensic doctor are a great enrichment as always and without their presence the low rating would probably be justified. Still this brilliant twosome always make a film worth watching in my opinion. Sadly their screen time could be longer. The other two leading characters a female journalist Georgia Brown and a doctor Keith Barron and especially the lady played by Diana Dors are quite annoying. Then 14yearold Gwyneth Strong is OK in her role. Overall Nothing But The Night has some creepy moments and as mentioned above I do not find the storyline to be THAT bad. The film is also quite nicely shot and CushingLee are always great. It is certainly not a highly memorable example of British Horror cinema however and can easily be skipped.".

The script by Brian Hayles was based on a novel of the same name by John Blackburn  for most of it's duration one could easily describe Nothing But the Night as a complex mystery thriller with a few horror elements thrown in there. The biggest problem with Nothing But the Night in my opinion is the fragmented bitty sometimes confusing  uneven narrative. It seems to go from one plot thread to another at random intervals  never really settles down into one consistent watchable story all of the character's seem like bit parts  no one in the film stands out as the 'star' whom the action revolves around. The mystery elements are played up a bit too much  the red herrings are about as subtle as a sledge hammer hit into your face the character played by Diana Dors has so much obvious suspicion placed on her you just know she's innocent. It's rather slow going at times although I thought the twist ending was just about worth sticking around for even if it does feature a young girl being set on fire  various other children committing suicide which seemed a bit distasteful. I will admit though the mystery elements did keep me watching  Nothing But the Night has that special ingredient that sort of draws you in to the point where you want to see where the films going.Director Sasdy does OK but the film has dated badly although I think the 70's fashions  decor gives it a certain charm. There's some really nice location shooting here  there are a few nice moments but the annoying dayfornight process doesn't do the atmosphere any favours  I'm not sure keeping dynamite  the detonators in a wooden shed is a good idea from a safety point of view either! Forget about any gore or violence as there isn't a single drop of blood in the entire film worth mentioning.Technically the film is fine with good production values although it's obvious the film was shot entirely on location rather than sets. The acting was alright  it's always nice to see the legendary Christopher Lee  Peter Cushing together.Nothing But the Night is an OK mystery but just don't expect a straight forward horror film because this ain't it a bit to confusing  uneven to be described as great but I thought it was OK nonetheless.".

It is far from easy viewing and the end doesn't come quick enough.This could easily be voted as the worst of the horror duo's collaborations!";

I actually dozed off a few times!  The film is sooooo dull!

	schema:reviewBody "Peter Cushing is pathologist Mark Ashley. Christopher Lee an investigator Colonel Bingham. Both are working to figure out the mystery behind the sudden deaths of trustees of an island castle orphanage. Diana Dors is a crazed mother Anna Harb just out of prison for three murders trying to retrieve her daughter MaryGwyneth Strong. The case intensifies when Keith Barron's Dr. Haynes a physician at Cushing's hospital interested in solving a puzzling recurring nightmare to a child in his care concerning a fire which caused harm to someone named Vincent and it seems herself is murdered. It's conceived that Anna committed the crime. Anna flees in pursuit of her daughter making her way to the island castle orphanage. Georgia Brown is a reporter Joan Foster for a dirtmag who had fallen in love with Haynes hoping to convince Ashley that this nightmare is of the utmost importance to the current situation. Begging to no avail by local police and the desperate urgings of Bingham for the remaining trustees to have guards inside the walls of their fortress it seems Anna might just accomplish her goal as her daughter has returned to her orphanage home supposedly safe and secure. But something much more sinister and unbelievable lies ahead for Bingham Ashley  company who have no idea what really has occurred to the little girl and the other children for that matter and it will all come to a head when a great birthday celebration for Mary bonfire fireworks and the like is prepared. Twist regarding transplanting knowledge into other brains resulting in possible immortality has drawn hostile criticisms but you can't say it's not unoriginal. It didn't quite work for me but Lee and Cushing make anything bearable. The twist I must admit was pretty wacky and hard to swallow. Sadsy's direction does ratchet up the suspense with the plot seemingly pointing a finger at Anna for a certain period of time but there are some very weird scenes containing Mary which throws the whole plot into question regarding who's really committing the murders and one does wonder why the remaining trustees would be so resistant towards police protection. Despite such a talented cast and an ideal overall setting and solid pace something just doesn't quite work maybe it's the farfetched discovery of the true answer to the mystery of the plot. It's a testament to Cushing and Lee to keep a straight face at such nonsense.".

	schema:reviewBody "I caught this on The Movie Channel and taped it planning to watch it later. Finally I sat down and tried to get into Nothing But the Night which from the plotline offered by the TV Guide looked pretty good.Eh....Well let's start with the plot. Different people I believe associated by an orphanage or some other organization are all being killed. In the first two minutes of the film. Then a bus with orphans and some others crashes and one little girl Mary becomes the focus of attention. A doctor and a colonel Cushing and Lee respectively are introduced but they really don't come into the plot much. First the focus is on a young doctor Peter who after being intrigued by hallucinatory ramblings from Mary begins investigating along with the help of a reporter Joan. Meanwhile Mary's estranged mother Anna wants her daughter back and will go to the extreme to get her. And then Peter is murdered supposedly by Anna and that's when Lee and Cushing's characters really come in. Eventually this leads them and Joan to the island of Bala where Mary has been returned to her orphanage and Anna is headed for to get her daughter back being refused many times. From there it's a mix of weak investigation a few murders and a The Fugitivelike hunt for Anna who is on the island and searching for Mary. But Harrison Ford Anna is not and the hunt is pretty cheesy. Nothing really connects or makes sense and stumbles along to a semicreepy climax.What the hell does this have to do with that bizarre very European title? I don't know.The movie is pretty bland. While Lee Cushing and Georgia Brown Joan give good performances Diana Dors Anna comes off almost like Bette Davis ala Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? with that big hair and brash disposition. The little girl who played Mary does a fine job though especially for a child actress and that boosts this film a bit. But nothing masks the fact that the plotline is weak and the film itself is overwhelmingly dull. As expected there are far too many scenes of people talking. I mean c'mon it's British after all. And why does every manhunt need all the town's drunks coming out with rifles and dogs to go looking? You can almost see some of this coming at some points. Still the movie has a pretty creepy climax albeit short. And the twist in the end could have made a nice shock but all the reviews for this movie give away the big shock as the plotline. In any event I don't recommend this. It's quite boring and except for the acting it's nothing to give the time to watching.".

Their conversations make up the majority of the exposition so even though there isn't a lot of action at least you're listening to two excellent speakers. The mystery is about the deaths of several trustees who are all connected to the same fortune. A young girl becomes an important character as it is believed she holds the key to finding out who is behind the killings. Then we are lead to believe the girl's mother is behind it and for a time the movie seems to have one of the kookiest villains of any film. Watching this British housewife trying to rough it and survive off the land as she is being pursued through the wild by search parties is one of the best bits of unintentional comedy not to end up on MST3K. Finally there is the ending. One of the most amazing climaxes of any horror movie it delivers like few movies have. Some viewers were troubled by the plausibility of the group transferring their minds into the bodies of children to be able to extend their lives. I thought it was horrifying enough to make the slow parts worth sitting through. It was a bit over the top but very memorable.".

Lethargic direction and an extremely confused storyline sink this one from the start despite the use of some nice locations and the efforts of a good cast.Things start off well with some unexplained murders and an investigation into them but quickly become muddled with a silly and ludicrous plot involving genetics and immortality. Okay so they made the film in a contemporary setting but how could they expect it to be realistic with such an implausible storyline? Much of the film is padded out with people walking around and driving cars  not very exciting. There's also far too much of child actress Gwyneth Strong who of course went on to play Cassandra in ONLY FOOLS AND HORSES.It's sad really that a good cast is wasted so much. Diana Dors spends most of the time crawling around moors and hiding in bushes much to her embarrassment. Peter Cushing is pretty good here as a prim and proper pathologist who has a surprisingly short temper in fact he's the best thing in the film. Christopher Lee is good too but isn't really given much to do except walk around and shout at the press. A female reporter pops up from time to time only to disappear again. Sadly the film is bloodless too although Lee does get to sport some fakelooking blisters when he gets too near a fire at the film's vaguely exciting climax. Overall this is a missed opportunity not helped by Sasdy's uninterested direction and a poor script.".

No matter what one thinks of a movie they shouldn't be spoiling things like that for the unfamiliar.Anyway Nothing But the Night tells the story based on a novel by John Blackburn about murders plaguing an orphanage located on a Scottish island and the subsequent investigations and certainly has an impressive pedigree going for it another teaming of cinematic greats Sir Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing direction by Peter Sasdy Taste the Blood of Dracula etc. and a fine supporting cast including Diana Dors Georgia Brown Keith Barron Gwyneth Strong Fulton Mackay and in his first major film role the young Michael Gambon now immediately recognizable as having replaced Richard Harris as Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series.This project came to fruition as an attempt by Lee to create more serious genre films and it was the first and sadly last production by Lee's then recently formed Charlemagne company named in reference to his Italian ancestry which he'd started with old Hammer associate Anthony Nelson Keys. Nothing But the Night proved to be unsuccessful back in 1973 which is too bad it has its problems but those have more to do with the wild story which some viewers may rightly question.That's not to say though that this interesting offbeat very atmospheric and in fact sometimes downright insane movie doesn't have its moments. Some of them may provoke unintended laughter but some of them are unexpectedly bleak and brutal although these don't really involve blood  gore. Some of the plotting is definitely too obvious like the way Dors's Anna Harb is always set up to look so utterly dubious anyone watching would reason that this is no more than a red herring. At least if one doesn't know how this will all resolve itself and admittedly it does take almost the whole movie for things to finally become more or less clear they may keep watching just to see things continue to develop.Lee and Cushing remain great fun to watch totally professional and displaying that ever present chemistry. Dors definitely has the showiest role and makes the most of it luscious singer Brown is striking as the overly aggressive reporter young Strong is absolutely adorable and the too briefly seen Barron is very believable as the young psychiatrist determined to solve the problems of his strangely traumatized young charge.Unfortunately the filmmakers would come to realize that they didn't have as much control as they would have liked and director Sasdy  personally chosen for the project by Lee  admits it's not among his best work. But fans of British horror can now check this out on DVD thanks to Scorpion Releasing so that it may be discovered or rediscovered.Seven out of 10.".

Most of the other characters were also lacking in depth.Perhaps if I'd been in the proper frame of mind I might have enjoyed some MSTiefication at this film's expense but.... Naaahhh... Didn't really seem to be worth the effort. It wasn't really very good it wasn't really very bad it was just mediocre.";

	schema:reviewBody "On one hand NOTHING BUT THE NIGHT tries to cram too many ideas into one movie. Is it a horror movie? A thriller? A murder mystery? A police procedure flick? A psychodrama? Characters and elements in the story point to all of these ideas. One theme that doesn't seem to be noticed I could be wrong because I haven't read all the reviews on this site is that of class. Now to some viewers particularly Americans the notion of class may fly over their heads but to Brits particularly Brits who originally viewed this film in the early 70s the disparities between classes and the concurrent eroding of class distinctions that was happening as the result of social changes in the late 1960s would have been glaringly apparent. Cushing's role as Sir Mark is an example of this situation. There are two instances where other characters who are speaking to him either make demands of him or speak to him brusquely only catch themselves and politely end their sentences with the word please. This is more than basic courtesy it's etiquette toward a sociallysuperior person dictated by the British class system a system that is in decline. Likewise when Sir Mark speaks to one of the trustees about Mary and the gentleman a Lord who outranks Sir Mark abruptly ends the conversation on the telephone Sir Mark tells the doctor I don't like being put in my place for anyone even you! Another example of adherence to the class system. It might be argued that the entire movie is set up on this premise. The old order is being bent and twisted by the way in which all the characters who inhabit varies social strata interact. Obviously Anna Harb an excon and prostitute is at the bottom. Mary by birth is on the same level. The psychiatrist who treats Mary and the female reporter might be described post class for their roles in early 1970s British society bespeak the newer more liberal attitudes. Col. Bingham and Sir Mark are part of the old order as are the trustees. The way in which they interactor the very fact that they DO interactindicates the twilight of the class system. However the fact that the trustees representatives of the old upper class are using the bodies of the lowerclass children to perpetuate their memories and personalities and thus the old class order is a fact that must have been more horrifying to contemporary Brits that a hundred gory beheadings.So with all the other ideas in this movie one could add social satire to the list.".

You keep watching because you want to know everything about it. Why that is I don't know but I find it very intriguing and I guess it only proves the quality of these movies.L'Adversaire or The Adversary is such a movie. From the first moment on you know that Daniel Auteuil's character JeanMarc Faure has done something terrible to his family. You know he has murdered his wife and children but you don't know why. Only when you keep watching until the end you'll see that the man has been living a lie for the past twenty years and that he wasn't able anymore to continue like that. He had made everybody believe that he was a successful doctor working for a prestigious medical institution. Next to his 'dayjob' he also invested money for his friends and relatives which in reality he used to live on buying his family more expensive homes and cars and sustaining a young mistress for himself. But eventually people wanted to see some returns on their investments or wanted to withdraw large sums that he couldn't possibly give them. So he kept stalling and putting them off until he ran totally out of options and his whole world came crashing down ... resulting in his final chilling act of desperation.What perhaps is even the most chilling thing about this movie is that it has been based on true events. Yes if you turn on the news you regularly get to hear news about a father who has murdered his entire family because they were in big financial problems but it is never shown in so much detail as it is in this movie. In this movie you get to see thanks to a complex series of flashbacks the investigation after the murder showing how he starts getting into trouble until he has only one option left. I'm pretty sure that a lot of people had to swallow a couple of times when seeing it all and I admit that I was one of them.Next to the chilling story the acting is something else that deserves noticing. I'm not very familiar with these actors but they all did a nice job. Especially Daniel Auteuil the only actor that I have heard of before who is absolutely terrific. He has managed to help you understand why the man did it without saying that what the man did was right or wrong. I'm not saying that you'll like the man but you'll understand him and that's something very special for a movie like this one. All in all this is some very powerful cinema like you don't get to see it very often. Even if you aren't too familiar with the director or with the actors even when you aren't used to watch foreign movies you still should give this one a try. It certainly deserves it. I reward this movie with an 810.".

He takes money from family and friends pretending to invest it in foreign ventures... but he just uses their money to live on buying his family more expensive homes and automobiles plus a hot young mistress for himself. But eventually people start demanding to see some returns on their investments... or want to withdraw large sums that the good doctor just doesn't have.

	schema:reviewBody "Emmanuel Carrere's novels are chilling desperate and very well told. This adaptation to screen by Nicole Garcia works pretty well. If it wasn't based on a true story you'd think that it's silly and a bit too much. The movie certainly doesn't leave a happy feeling with you it's hopeless and sad in everyone's point of view. So the story is told in the beginning of the movie in the matter of fact before to movie starts but the point isn't that at all. Film is about what's going on inside Jean Claude Romand's played by great Daniel Auteuil head and life during the times before he murders everyone he knows. The music in L'Adversaire is by Angelo Badalamenti one of my favorite composers escpecially Twin Peaks soundtrack and it fits perfectly. Latest adaptation of Carrere's work is La Moustache and it's directed by himself".

	schema:headline " Disturbing TRUE story";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw L'Adversaire last night 20 Aug 07 and I'm still trying to sort it out. It's very disturbing possibly because it's based on a true story an UNBELIEVABLY real and devastatingly true story as the old saw has it you couldn't make this stuff up. Director Nicole Garcia has apparently decided to present the truth more or less as it happened. She has done a wonderful job with material written by her son Frederic BelierGarcia and Emmanuel Carrere upon whose novel the film is based. This must have been very difficult to transpose to the screen  the subject matter requires a bombardment of raw visceral emotions. L'Adversaire is based on the sensational 1993 French murder case involving JeanClaude Romand who murdered his wife two children and his parents before attempting suicide himself. After almost two decades of blatant deceit not a mere 15 years as shown in the film he was about to bring shame on everyone most of all upon himself. Rather than face the inevitable he commits the atrocities. Romand was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1996.Everyone close to him believes that the cinematic Romand  JeanMarc Faure Daniel Auteuil  is a medical doctor at the World Health Organization a UN agency in Geneva. He doesn't work there at all  he isn't even a doctor. He hangs around the WHO halls briefcase in hand a haunted sad lonely man he pops in on occasional conferences he sleeps listens to his car radio giggles reads newspapers eats and then after his 'full day' he goes home to his wife and two children. He carries on this fiction for 15 long years financing it on 'donations' from family and friends who believe Faure is investing their money for handsome returns.The days of reckoning come as they must and Faure begins to implode. What follows is a minimalist excursion into terror but with an important caveat there's very little blood. The viewer fills in the killing scenes which as Hitchcock knew so well is always more frightening.Daniel Auteuil as Faure is perfect. This is a difficult performance  how does the viewer empathize with such an ostensible monster? And yet we do based on Auteuil's performance. He emerges as a pathetic tortured man who adopts his elaborate NONlifestyle early as a 'stopgap' perhaps. But the years zip by and he finds himself in so deeply that he cannot extricate himself. After seeing Auteuil's magnificent Gallic face twist and turn into 100 degrees of irony desperation joy and pain you're left to conclude that no other French actor alive could play this part unless it would be Aurelien Recoing. He superbly played a stunning similar role without the murders in L'Emploi du temps Time Out which was released in 2001 a year before L'Adversaire. The lovely Geraldine Pailhas as Faure's bewildered and longsuffering wife doesn't have very much to do but she brings shining femininity to her part. Emmanuelle Devos is as usual outstanding as Faure's flighty girlfriend.The film has a few problems there's a bumpy fuzzy beginning and the flashbacks are disruptive and often confusing. Auteuil was 52 years old when he made the film too old for a man who left medical school a dropout only 15 years before. And we're left with a big question at the end did he live or die? If you didn't know the real story of JeanClaude Romand that lingers as a loose end with the viewer. Despite these deficiencies it really doesn't matter. This is just a very disturbing REAL story  Sartrean nothingness existentialism brought to life  the 'nonperson' the artificial human being who lives a titanic lie for a very long time and gets away with it. No one really seems to notice which tells us a lot about our own sense of selfabsorption. This film is very dark but it couldn't be anything else. We are looking into the face of hell an assault of demons through the eyes of Auteuil. L'Adversaire is a splendid exploration of that part of all of us that is afflicted by deviant behaviour. We all deceive we all lie it's just a matter of how far we are willing to take it.".

Revealing the end of  this story won't bother the appreciation of this movie since it's a well known news item in France that deeply moved the population in the 90's. As a matter of fact the story is fascinating enough to make the script interesting and that is the main problem of the film. It relies almost essentially on the unbelievable destiny  of JeanMarc Faure and the performance of Daniel Auteuil one the best French actors actors actually. His acting is sober and at some moments is approaching madness with convincing realism. But the staging and the whole ambiance remain cold and distant as if there was since the beginning a shift between Faure and the others. This creates an embarrassment that keep us from understanding him.Anyway it is worth seeing this movie above all if you don't know the story yet. The only fact to know that this really happened makes you watch it with interest. Another movie was made upon this story L'emploi du temps' by Laurent Cantet.".

I left in 1989 as well but i was one of the fortunate ones and my family remained safe. What Joseph and Zozo actor were able to produce together was beyond remarkable. Beauty indeed is found in simplicity so is power. Carmen Lebbos who plays zozo's mother in this unfolding story is also able to bring the best of her game and i wouldn't be surprised if the film is able to capture more than one home run at the Oscars.

It is about the life of a young Lebanese boy during the time of war and having to immigrates to Sweden.It was very well casted and produced. Also there were many hilarious jokes in it. The grandfather plays a great role and Zozo the character is also amazing.If you have the chance definitely go see it. It is worth your time just be prepared for some tears to role down your face... Well done!".

This film reminds me his name to me. And it was so sad to see the Lebanon through the film. Actually I am not sure how this film represent about the nowadays real Lebanon but I guess it is not that different. The one thing that this film really makes me sad is the protagonist zozo is just a young little boy who are full of weak and soft senses that needs to be protected. But unfortunately he need to protect himself by his own strength. But fortunately he went to the right way that gives him a real strength and power to live. I really like the scene that he suppose to fight with the elder Swedish boys who bitten him before. He could have fight with him that means start to learn violence not peace. and there is one another way to solve his problem just like the war. and his mother came up at that time with some bombs in the Swedish school. and he says that 'why did you leave me?' that words really makes me sad and come out of some tears as well. yes he was just like that age who need mom and family's love as well. But at that time they all died only except him. But our zozo refuse to fight with those stupid elder guys and just leave them with his own friend who also has problem with his father who are violent. I think I learn some more other people's harsh life here in Sweden and also get some precious words from their life. This film also gave me those kind of words as well.

In Sweden he is welcomed by his loving grandparents Elias Gergi and Yasmine Awad but adapting to a new environment and learning a new language aren't easy for the boy who still suffers from painful memories of his old life in Lebanon.The first half of the film takes place in Lebanon which the brownish orangetinted cinematography paints as hot but full of light. In the midst of the frequent violent incidents in the city Zozo's family loves him and wishes to give him a better future abroad. After arriving in Sweden the mood changes from dangerous to longing partly due to the beautifully green and bright Swedish summer that highlights the contrast between the two countries. His grandfather's lovable antics help him to get over past traumas and lead to some comedic incidents but a sense of loneliness lingers on and Zozo knows that there's more to life than the grandfather's simplistic teachings suggest.Besides the realistic portrayal of Zozo's experiences at the Lebanese streets and the Swedish school the movie spices things up by adding an extra layer of fantasy in the form of creations from Zozo's imagination. Be it a talking chicken a Godlike ball of light or an explosive reaction to schoolbullies the visualizations of Zozo's inner world provide interesting insight to his character and make the film more memorable than the average dramas about adapting to new life.Zozo is director Josef Fares' first move into a more serious territory after the comedic Jalla! Jalla! and Kopps and as such it succeeds effortlessly. The story is inspired by Fares' own experiences as a young immigrant in Sweden and his insight on the subject produces an effective piece of cinema with well balanced tragic and comical aspects. Thanks to Imad Creidi's unforced performance as Zozo and the bubbling joie de vivre of his grandfather the film can be recommended to anyone interested in immigrationrelated cinema but the sense of being an outsider in a group should appeal to big audiences as well.".

It has great cinematography and sound and music. Elias Gergi as the grandfather is outstanding and it's a great role. Imad Creidi in the title role of Zozo is very good. I could do without the chicken however. There very few other characters of interest in this film. Zozo's survival and how he made his way to Sweden from Lebanon seemed a little farfetched. I felt the script was a little weak. This movie had some great production value to it but it wasn't enough to carry it beyond good to the excellent level and was no where near being superb. I would give this a 6.5 on a scale of 10 but I wouldn't see it twice.".

Usually you want to protect your kids from the horror of war but Zozo is so well done that children can see it easily. I find it really good for children in Europe to see so that they understand what is the meaning of war also to feel with people who look for refuge in their country. Behind the refugees is an important story and no one leaves his own country like that. Joseph Fares can communicate so well his message in a very nice full of humor way. He makes Europeans sympathize with Lebanese and foreign people. I am so impressed by Joseph Fares and I wish I can meet him one day. I really hope he will come one day to Holland as I can't wait to talk to him. Joseph many thanks for making people hear from our small country Lebanon.".

The last time it happened was when I watched that nasty assault on the braincells Tjenare Kungen by Ulf Malmros. Damn you Swedish directors for wasting my time like this!After changing film history with such epics as Jalla Jalla you know that movie with uh that guy which was so funny and touching and had that dad who knocked people down with his belly...uh... and Kopps yeah I know it was soooooo funny right? Like the bestest Swedish movie ever made right? Josef Fares decides to make the most personal of all his films Zozo's story is based on the director's own life as it depicts a boy escaping his warridden homeland to live in peace in Sweden. On paper it looks like a surefire Best Foreign Oscar winner right? Unfortunately there was a slight catch Fares decided to direct the movie. Oh and he cast Swedish actors for the lead roles. Whoops.Edit Granted most of the actors are actually rather convincing but they're stuck with a script so unbelievably stupid it makes Jalla Jalla look like 2001 A Space Odyssey.To its bare bones Zozo is little more than a rehash of a million other better films ranging from typical Swedish school dramas to Saving Private Ryan and it is riddled with ludicrous dream sequences which make you wonder if little Zozo recently arrived from Vietnam along with Jacob Singer. The plot works well enough as long as it actually goes somewhere unfortunately as soon as Zozo arrives in Sweden it decides to take a lunch break and never comes back. What we're left with are a few clichd school drama scenes we've seen millions of times before. New guy has trouble fitting in. New guy gets bullied. New guy makes friends with nerdy guy. YAWN! Someone wake me up when it's over. Josef Fares seems to be thinking the same thing. Man this movie is dull I better add another nonsensical hallucinatory sequence! Oh and screw editing continuity and closure I'll end the film with a scene that should have appeared somewhere during the middle ! Look at me I'm Sweden's answer to Kubrick!It's a film that lazily begs for your pity and sympathy when it should be begging for your attention. It's awkwardly cutesy isn't Zozo's chicken the CUTEST THING YOU'VE EVER SEEN???  Wait maybe we should get on with the plot? Nah. dull pointless jumbled and full of awkward preteen humour to appeal to the Kopps fans the chicken said it was going to chill with some buddies and have a couple of beers OMFG that is SO FUNNY Mr. Fares what ever will you think of next?!.The movie has little to say about the war itself about school about life as a kid or about anything really. On the surface it's an Oscar movie. Too bad some of the acting is so awful the direction so hopelessly bland the musical score so pathetically forgettable and the story so nonexistent. Without these petty flaws we'd be looking at a seriously great movie. As it is I say it's time we pull the plug on the Swedish movie industry. Run Zozo run!".

That will be not enough to talk about Imad Creidi in few lines... what is certain is that this actor has already a high sensibility of feelings in real life. Question why isn't he shooting another movie already?? He is perfect for any role.Back to ZOZO the movie Well Josef Fares the director and writer said something in his story when Zozo was writing a letter if only dreams came true. Well i think his movie came true and we can dream about hope and tolerance. Zozo criticizes violence by showing its presence everywhere and shows in a very subtle way many ways that could bring violence as well as the best way to avoid it. By his impartial look to facts viewers can feel or not the significance of every scene. Unfortunately some do not feel the movie they can just tell about the significance of some scenes. Therefore Zozo might not affect all people especially if viewers are not patient sensitive or take the time to listen and understand a Lot of symbolism. This is not only the story of very important parts of the life of an 11 years old boy. It is more than a dream a message of tolerance and of life. Once can dream but it will be confronted to the bitterness of life like a green apple mixed with some salt. Life seen through the eye of innocence... transition in the life of a child becoming soon an independent teen... love he can give... injustice he will face because he is different from other kids of his age... and finally his glory by finding his own way. The story of a boy we have pity on but later we might envy him. That's a glory too.".

He played the part to a T.Emmanuelle Beart who is possibly the most beautiful living French actress brings depth to her character. She doesn't overdo the part at all and she plays it with such coolness and sophistication. The best performance though would have to be Fanny Ardant's. Hers was the most subtle. I also like the fact that she works as a gynecologist in this movie because later on you'll see the connection this has in the plot which the director brilliantly ties together.My girlfriend claims she already predicted the twist ending but I admit I didn't see it coming.

This results in a very 'talky' film but still a very steamy and effective one. Ardant leads the film and manages to give an effective performance as a rejected wife in a passionless marriage although at some points during the film the audience is left to contemplate her motives and what exactly she is hoping to achieve from this experiment. Beart is the real star not only because she is stunning and makes it impossible to look away from the film but she also offers a complex character who is creating a complex character for herself within the film. At times she seems strong and in charge and sometimes she comes across as weak and insecure. The slow and subtle way the bizarre friendship between the two leads evolves is well handled by director Anne Fontaine. The slow pace of the film is also a delight as it perfectly presents the flow of the marriage itself. Gerard Depardieu isn't used enough we never get to know the character and characters opinions contradict what we see of him. However since the film is told from the wife's perspective this is understandable. Paris is represented with the usual busy streets and coffee shops with small apartments but this is certainly not a film about locale. Overall the film is a joy to look at and very well made. An underrated gem to sit down with on a quiet afternoon.".

They have been married for many years and their life does not have sexual desire anymore. One day Catherine listens to the message box of his cell phone and she believes Bernard is unfaithful to her. Catherine hires the beautiful prostitute Marlene Emmanuelle Bart to pretend to be a young woman called Nathalie seduce and investigate the sex life of Bernard and report to her his secrets and performance between walls. Catherine discloses a surprising revelation in the end.I saw the used DVD of Nathalie on sale in a rental and based on the names of Emmanuelle Bart Grard Depardieu and Fanny Ardant I decided to risky and buy and watch this movie without any previous reference. I found a great movie with a very credible story but for mature audiences only. I believe that only the public of a certain age who have experienced marriage will fully understand the characters of Bernard and Catherine their motives and how true the story is. I was also impressed with the elegance of the great French actress Fanny Ardant and with the eternal beauty of the sexy and also great actress Emmanuelle Bart. The direction of Anne Fontaine is very sensitive delicate and classy keeping the story in a very high level without using any type of subterfuge such as spicy scene or sexual exposition of the cast. The soundtrack is also excellent. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Nathalie XNote On 03 July 2011 I saw this film again to compare with the weak remake Chloe.".

	schema:reviewBody "The other night I watched two films Michel Deville's Le Voyage en Douce 1980 and Anne Fontaine's Nathalie 2003. It was a felicitous though accidental pairing. Both films negotiate the complex often hazardous subject of eroticism between women straight women. In such films the pairing of the actresses is absolutely crucial and in this respect Fontaine was more fortunate than Deville. In Nathalie Fanny Ardant and Emmanuelle Bart have what Fontaine called a profound alchemy. The film veritably sizzles from the first encounter of the two women in a brothel to the final affirmation of their friendship.Nathalie's plot line is rather cheesy  a woman Ardant finds out her husband Gerard Depardieu in a beautifully muted role is cheating on her. She hires a prostitute Bart to seduce her husband and after wards to relate every detail of their encounters to her. The hooker Marlne whom the wife renames Nathalie accepts. And thus begins the film's depiction of sex by proxy. Nathalie's descriptions of sex with the husband reminded me of the superbly erotic scene in Bergman's Persona when the nurse relates her seduction of a boy on the beach. And as with Persona this film heavily depends for its force on the subtleties and shadings in the acting of the three principals.As always Ardant commands our full attention. Her Catherine is beautiful elegantly at ease aloof. Bart's Nathalie is a kind of counterforce to Catherine. Her long sluttish blonde hair falls over her bruised blue eyes both to conceal and to allow her a wary sideways glance at the world. She is tough and watchful rarely does she smile. But as the story progresses a startled softness in her eyes begins to submerge the cold indifference of the professional.The first encounter between the two women sets the tone in a garishly crimson bar of a Paris brothel a somewhat apprehensive Catherine sits bolt upright on a leather sofa looking decidedly out of place. When Marlne approaches her Catherine is relieved and grateful. Marlne for her part is assured and even gentle with Catherine though she doesn't quite know what to make of her. She knows how to talk to johns but an elegant educated woman is of a different order of magnitude. Catherine soon relaxes into a confiding pleasurable intrigue with the hooker and the bargain is struck. The erotic undercurrent is palpable.".

Yet she is cold in bed and worse employs a beautiful winsome prostitute to whom she gives the name Nathalie as bait to see how her husband behaves when he plays around. In a seemingly obsessive manner the wife seeks Nathalie's accounts of her encounters with the unsuspecting husband. And the more she hears the more she is hurt and the colder she becomes towards her husband. The accounts are sexy and provide the momentum in the movie but as they grow in intensity the wife becomes more and more ridiculous as she listens and does nothing as her marriage seems to be going down the gurgler. Does she WANT to lose her husband?? Why doesn't she use the stimulus of Nathalie's accounts to regain some of her waning sexual interest? Why doesn't she respond to the attempts of her husband to woo her back?The twist in the end saves the movie however and just as well. This was a puzzling movie to me with such a great cast but with Fanny Ardant playing a dumb wife. French movies used to portray human relationships better this!".

Her hope is that once his sexual frustrations are worked out he'll stop his philandering and return to her loving arms...Want to bet on her chances?An odd story to say the least so I just had to watch it. Then I found out it turned into something else a real love story. Or perhaps  what we all think passes for love in marriage? Hence slowly and inexorably the protagonists strip away the rites of married life exposing the hypocrisy innuendo and outright lies that force people to continue in a sterile relationship.Very French very bawdy  in a wordy sense  and very introspective Lots of long searching looks sparse dialog mood swings tawdry night clubs and conversations when they occur about the finer details of having sex.Depardieu provides an excellent image of a man at a loss  at work and in his marriage and he's not at all sure why Ardant an actress I'd not seen much of until this outing underplays the aggrieved wife with what appears to be a stoic calm but which is actually calculated indifference and the very luminous Beart is perfect as the avaricious pro ready to make a few too many francs at the expense of the wife's dignity. I hadn't seen Beart in a movie since Manon des Sources 1986 in her role as the vengeful daughter of Jean de Florette she ages well no question...As I implied above however all is not what it seems to be especially when it comes to relationships. There is an exquisite twist a careful viewer will spot the clues that point directly to the twist to the story that forces the wife to face the reality of her marriage and thus make a choice. And the viewer is left with two questions was it all worth the expense? And did she make the right choice?If you like these French actors and French movies in general I thoroughly recommend this one.

Yes they are still gorgeous and marvelous actresses even when working with mediocre material.The film is now being premiered even before released in its native France in the 2nd Annual French Film Festival a translation of the event's Portuguese name. As such next to AMEN it is the most anticipated premiere of this event presented by the Brazilian Alliance Franaise in eight cities nationwide including Sao Paulo Rio and Recife during September and October.Miss Bart is Nathalie a beautiful prostitute hired by a suspicious wife Ardant who either wants to find out whether her husband Depardieu is cheating or is a complicated psychotic voyeur crazy to hear erotic stories about her husband's sex antics whether true or not.As I earlier said the cast seemed extremely promising. And the plot seemed rather exotic though not groundbreaking. The Parisian locales are fabulous as are the fashions exhibited by the glamorous cast. But ultimately the story and the film is boring. At the end we leave the cinema knowing very little about the characters are not greatly surprised by anything and gain no new insight into our own lives.I can understand why the film hasn't been released in France yet and is being timidly shown in Toronto and at events like this one. I can't imagine how even the best editor can do anything to fix it. A terrible disappointment. But Bart and Ardant confirm their status as two of the absolutely most glamorous stars of European and World Cinema.".

Actually I was expecting Ardant to adopt Beart's tricksofthetrade in her nightly dealings with Depardieu and not going out and having her own little flings. Anyway the film is too episodically structured to be anything but a series of taletelling in the frankest possible manner as can be expected from the French of illicit rendezvous and one grows impatient with the film once he realizes that it's going nowhere very slowly.As I said however the acting is topnotch and Michael Nyman's score is typically arresting. Being that the film is directed by a woman I suppose that some sort of profeminist statement is being made here but personally I was far more intrigued by the tantalizing promise on the DVD sleeve of watching Beart's routines as a stripper  of which there were far too few and far too chaste to boot for my liking alas...".

Neither of them speak to Nathalie about the truth of the relationship. I find this contrast to the 'let it all hang out' philosophy of marriage to be refreshing. There are many moral questions raised in this film is 'talking it out' a good idea when the partners have been married this long and will it change anything? Who is Nathalie's real customer? What would have happened if the husband and wife had had a row would the husband have stayed until the end when everything was revealed? These are good questions not often dealt with but the French seem to love having a go at them. Emmanuelle is well chosen as she does a lot of looking pensive and her face is good for that Fanny also stares a lot into the middle distance and her bone structure is good for the lateforties woman she portrays Depardieu is just such a nice guy underneath his philandery that you can almost believe he loves his wife and will wait to have her back.

	schema:reviewBody "An erotic game in which the temptress is commissioned to seduce a man caught in flagranti delicto and has her own little deck of cards which she decides to use against the person who sets her up to this game. It sounds complicated but it isn't and NATHALIE... is one of the breeziest movies I've seen in a long time. It never decides if it really wants us to believe that the call girl Christine hires to play with her husband is really doing so but Nathalie's own incursions into her own sensual world seem to play into the gnawing thoughts of Christine. All throughout there's this delightful feeling of suspense not because someone may wind up getting whacked in the head but because there seems to be more than one secret to be disclosed at a key moment and the story walks a tightrope between what is clear what is implied and what never has happened with the deft pacing of a graceful ballerina. It helps that even at its drabbest moments there's this intoxicating aura of saturation colors that wouldn't exist in real life but glow with their own inner life a suggestion of the inner lives of the two women at the center of the story. It's appropriate as well to a story steaming with erotic overtones all throughout  this is Marguerite Duras for the new century with two people engaged in a subtle battle of who's framing who while one tells stories and the other seems to take in like a sponge and only hint at reactions. Excellent is the choice of casting Emmanuelle Beart as the icy sex kitten and Fanny Ardant as the reserved professional who here bears more than a passing resemblance to Ingrid Bergman circa CACTUS FLOWER in more ways than one. If there's any less interesting character it's that of Gerard Depardieu and his small role is there for a crucial reason. It's a shame that this movie didn't get more critical acclaim because it's a very welltold story with modulated performances  the type that simmer like bubbles in champagne  and even when it is an erotic story of the oldest type it doesn't feel stale.".

I don't know but maybe it's possible in France a country which prides itself on the tidy management of sex in general. It does seem a rather bizarre way of putting some zing back into a flagging marriage. Fanny Ardant as the voyeuristic wife Catherine dominates the movie though she spends a lot of time staring off into the middle distance. Grard Depardieu as Bernard the husband is reduced to a bit player. The most intriguing character is Nathalie' the prostitute played with innocent charm by Emmanuelle Bart who though 38 manages to look 15 years younger. She might have a waiflike manner but she certainly has learned what men are like and what they want and her accounts of her sessions with the husband seem all too authentic.Unfortunately I worked out fairly early in the piece what was really going on. I won't spoil it for you dear reader but it is all a bit anticlimactic. The film does have a genuine Parisian feel to it  crowded apartments even that of the affluent married couple bars streets restaurants etc. All that elegant consumption and all that personal lack of fulfillment. It's almost a relief to discover that one of the patients at Catherine's gynaecology practice though in her early 20s is still a virgin. In its favour the movie does not drag on too long and has in Natalie' a genuinely intriguing character. She is not the usual desperate junkie  she is not without resources and when not being a prostitute works as a hairdresser and beautician. Is she able to have a normal' relationship with anyone? At one stage the temperature between her and Catherine gets quite warm. Or is she emotionally burnt out by the rigours of the game? Anne Fontaine as director doesn't seem to want to explore her most interesting character so we are left to guess.".

They also claim you can see the twist coming a mile away and all I can say to THAT is that I was too busy basking in Fanny Ardant's eyeacting to spot the clues such as they were. Put three heavy hitters like Depardieu Ardant and Beart together in one movie and SOMEONE SOMEWHERE is gonna think he's died and gone to heaven however lessthanperfect the script and this one is only a TAD less than perfect.  Though hardly needed there is also first rate support from veterans Wladamir Yordanoff and Judith Magre now incredibly in her 78th year and looking no more than fifty. Of the three Depardieu has the least to do but as always he does it so well it feels like he is carrying the thing.  Beart is the weakest link but she is always going to have problems with that incredibly unbelievable beauty that makes her look more like a genuine Stepford Wife than a REAL fleshandblood person.  If ever a face needed not a whit or a jot of make up it is Beart's and it is sickmaking to see it grotesqued up so ineptly with Hooker 7 lipstick and eye shadow. The movie belongs to Ardant and she takes it effortlessly giving what amounts to a MasterClass in eyeacting and if you haven't seen that gorgeous Ava Gardner lookalike face in repose while the eyes reveal the pain behind them you haven't lived.  Okay the clues WERE there and I missed them but I sure don't feel either cheated or a klutz because for one hundred and seven minutes I was in the presence of greatness. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "The French have a way with steamy films that makes the rest of the cinematic world seem bland in comparison. NATHALIE is fine case in point. Based on an idea by Philippe Blasband and transformed into a superb screenplay by Jacques Fieschi FranoisOlivier Rousseau and the director Anne Fontaine this incredibly well acted subtle understated film explores the many facets of adultery  from the woman's point of view. The result is a suspenseful erotic intelligent film that provides an opportunity for three of France's greatest actors to demonstrate their credentials.Catherine the still very beautiful and gifted Fanny Ardant is a gynecologist married to the successful Bernard Grard Depardieu in one of his more subtle roles and they have a stayathome hippy son Rodolphe Pauly who goes about his life much the same as his parents there is superficial companionship but little in depth relationship. The marriage seems satisfactory until Catherine suspects Bernard of having affairs a fact that Bernard very honestly confesses to having in his eyes the affairs are sexual dalliances that mean nothing. Catherine is shocked attempts to gain some support from her insular but worldly mother a fine Judith Magre who tells Catherine it is a normal situation in older marriages.Catherine visits a bar a private club for consignations and there she meets Marlne the extraordinary Emmanuelle Bart and eventually buys Marlne's services as a prostitute to meet her husband and then tell her all about the encounters. It is agreed that Marlne will be known as 'Nathalie'. From this point on Catherine and Nathalie meet after Nathalie has encounters with Bernard and describes the acts of the encounters in vivid and lurid detail. Catherine is fascinated and continues to pay Nathalie for on going encounters and subsequent voyeuristic descriptions. Catherine even has a onenight stand of her own with bartender Franois Wladimir Yordanoff in an attempt to understand her husband's need for infidelity.Despite the setup of 'private investigator and prostitute detective' the two women become friends. When Catherine realizes she has enough evidence against Bernard to leave him there is a final encounter of the three Catherine Bernard Nathalie that brings the ingenious surprise ending  an ending to fine to share as it would spoil the film for viewers new to the story.Ardant is simply radiant as Catherine playing the role of the victim wife of an adulterous husband with supreme dignity. Likewise Depardieu makes his Bernard so understated and profoundly honest that the conclusion in retrospect should have been suspected. Bart is at once wholly physical in her prostitute role yet maintains the inner core of a confused woman that keeps us on her side as she does her job. The production values are all first rate except for some ragged editing and the direction of Anne Fontaine is bristling with intrigue and wholly convincing in her development of this strange tale. Despite the dialogue being Xrated there is very little actual sex in this film that makes it not only more powerful but as the ending is revealed adds to the solidity of the story. In French with English subtitles. Highly recommended for art film lovers. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "Fanny Ardant plays Catherine a gynecologist of a certain age who discovers that her husband Benard Gerard Depardieu is cheating on her. She wonders if this is a onetime thing or something he does regularly. So she hires a prostitute Emmanuelle Beart as MarleneNathalie to test him. When the test turns up positive Catherine wants to hear the intimate details which Marlene agreeably supplies.The details of exactly what they do would seem a bit hard to take for the spouse who is being cheated on and Catherine does find some of the descriptions unsavory. However she insists on hearing them. The viewer begins to wonder if Catherine is not being sexually aroused by these details which is what Marlene thinks or is of a masochistic frame of mind.As Catherine and Marlene draw closer together the viewer now begins to wonder if Catherine herself would like to have a sexual relationship with Marlene. Since a lot of the tension in the movie relies on just what it is that Catherine wants I won't reveal the answer. She claims to love her husband but as the details get seamier and seamier she decides she no longer knows whether she loves him or not.How this will resolve itself is what kept me watching. The ending is a bit of a surprise. See if you can guess it.Ardant is excellent although her long suffering face may become a bit tedious for some. Beart is very good as a skillful and opportunistic prostitute almost too good perhaps because I found her a bit creepy. She was 40yearsold when this was released and there is nary a line on her face. Ardant's look was natural and for me anyway more agreeable. Both women are of course two of the most celebrated stars of the French cinema as is Depardieu whose part is rather modest. Anne Fontaine's direction is clear and focused.While not your typical chick flickcertainly it is not like American chick flick fairethis is nonetheless very much a woman's point of view movie with the kind of agreeable ending that will please most viewers regardless of sex.Best line and typical of the kind of psychology presented is this from Catherine as she is talking to Marlene Jealousy. For men it's a reflex. See this for Fanny Ardant who has that Catherine Deneuve quality of growing more beautiful as she gets older a talented actress who always carries herself well.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

This is a very private part of Bernard's life. However Bernard takes a back seat from now on.The film is really about two women the exquisite Marlene Beart and the neurotic Catherine Ardant.  Most of it takes place in Paris at nighttime accompanied by strip clubs prostitutes bars and stuff.  Actually the two women have more in common than you realise.

	schema:reviewBody "I think DH Lawrence would be proud of this film...Pascale Ferran transformed this story we all imagine as an erotic clich in a very sensible and sensitive movie. Because Lady Chatterley is not the story of a more or less sexaddict bourgeoise we have seen in so many rubbish erotic movies inspired by the novel. It is much more about a woman who discovers the materiality of world threw a love story. She discovers also that some people are not naturally made to command others and in a way her love story with Parkin is a truly waking up to other people and life around her. She discovers her body and the world of the first industrial revolution has it used to be unfair and unequal. Lady Chatterlay is not only an erotic story but also a very politic and subversive one. DH Lawrence is well known for being very critical about the British society of 1920's and the human sideeffects of industrial development. Pascal Ferran perfectly understood the deep meaning of the novel. Moreover she transmuted those ideas in a very french movie but in fact the best french author cinema. The way she has filmed the two characters is very intimate but never silly and that's a great achievement! In a way her style is very closed to Piala's one. Harsh and poetic at the same time precise and evocative sensible and sensitive. This film is very precious!".

	schema:headline " A beautiful movie about the awakening of a woman's senses!";
	schema:reviewBody "I have seen the BBC adaptation of the DH Lawrence novel made by Ken Russell with Joely Richardson and Sean Bean and there is no comparison I prefer the French adaptation even if the film is not always faithful to the book on some points for example in the book Sir Clifford is having problems with his miners and his employees because he is very arrogant but in the film Pascale Ferran does not mention these problems. The actors are maybe a little more goodlooking in the BBC version but that's about it sorry Sean Bean. And if you want to see a film about a beautiful but bored aristocratic woman whose sensuality is suddenly reawakened by her meeting with the sullen unsociable but virile ParkinMellors then this film is for you. Pascale Ferran seemed to have focused her film on the lovestory between Lady ConstanceConnie and Parkin the gamekeeper and the discovery or rediscovery of one's senses. That is why you have beautiful shots of nature of magnificent trees in spring and why you have many scenes in which Constance is walking in the forest and just listening to the songs of birds. The forest is also the place where she discovers her own sensuality. The actors are brilliant they magnificently show all sorts of emotions on their faces and the lovemaking scenes are all made with much reserve with subtlety...It is all refined and very beautifullydone. I loved this Connie I could relate to her and I loved the long pauses and the looks between the two leads the big shots on the hands on some legs or other parts of the body and some refined clothes. The costumes are also important. This movie reminds me a little of some scenes of The Piano by Jane Campion and if you enjoyed The Piano I am sure you will like this French adaptation. Definitely a 'mustsee'. It is a little long more than 2 hours and a half I think but if you are used to watching long BBC period dramas like me you will have no fear in watching this!".

	schema:headline " Once more with more feeling and fewer distractions";
	schema:reviewBody "'Lady Chatterley' is based on a version of one of the most famous and controversial English novels of the twentieth century. There have already been many screen variations on D.H.Lawrence's story of the wife of a paralyzed and impotent English aristocrat who finds sexual gratification and a new life with her husband's gamekeeper. One can see why this film won the Cesar last year. As they should be the scenes between Lady C. and the gamekeeper are the unforgettable element and the heart of the film is the actors. Marina Hinds is radiant a cross between Ingrid Bergman and Mariel Hemingway in looks but fresher and more authentic than either. When this Lady C. and the gamekeeper make love it's as real and tender and sexual and quick as you could imagine or dare one say as such things might really be. JeanLouis Coulloc'h as Parkin is a rather burly fellow slightly balding with a sensitive face taciturn but dignified and not inarticulate. He is not simple and peasantlike. He is manly but he's a loner happiest by himself. Hippolyte Girardot as Sir Clifford is not a handsome man but importantly he is neither angry nor excessively dignified. No one overplays his role  they play things straight and that's the overriding virtue of this movie. It lets the elements speak for themselves and the result is a revelation.Surely an essential element of the book Lawrence was trying to write was a realistic sexuality seen directly and tenderly without embarrassment. But Lawrence saw it differently in the three successive versions he wrote of which only the third is widely published and known. They are 'The First Lady Chatterley' 'John Thomas and Lady Jane' and 'Lady Chatterley's Lover'. As Helen Croom explains the second version introduces the sexual healing aspect not in the first but is more tender than the third in which the gamekeeper his name changed from Parkin to Mellers has become hard and bitter and the relationship has been made more purely sexual with the addition of purple passages intermingled with a liberal use of AngloSaxon sexual fourletter words. The second version is simpler and more tender and so is this film. Croom feels the well known third version really isn't the best. Its fetishizing of sexuality takes us away from what Lawrentce does best which is relationships and the wonderful thing about Ferran's Lady Chatterley is how simply and directly the relationships are and how every moment changes them.'Lady Chatterley' takes its time and in the version shown at the San Francisco film festival it's three hours long. The spaces between the scenes are as important and so are the silences. As the story begins Lady Chatterley becomes overwhelmed by lassitude. Her doctor tells her she must get out. This is what leads her to walk around on her husband's estate. She sees Parkin from behind with his shirt off washing up. He's not some aerobicized Natutilus male but a workconditioned man with a solid muscular bulllike torso. She moves away at first and doesn't speak to him but later it's obvious if not now that a desire has been planted to know what it feels like to touch this body. Later she asks for a key to the cabane where Parkin comes to work and to go there herself. The utter quiet of the place awes her. There's a sense in the shots of big expanses of tree and grass of immersion in the outdoors.What's striking is that there's no tension in this story. One day she's there and Parkin asks Lady C. if she wants it. She does and then they begin making love there on the floor of the cabane regularly. She comes to life. This is when Marina Hinds begins to glow with natural happiness. No one is suspicious there's never any danger that they'll be caught. Sir Clifford is stiff and uncomfortable but it isn't overdone but in fact is very subtle. Much of the time it's notable how well he does. At dinner parties he's like anybody else. And Parkin isn't gruff and rough. Nor does he as in the published third version make up little pet names for their private parts.Lady Chatterley is a vibrant young woman who needs sexual experience and comes to life when she begins having it and she's beautiful and the gamekeeper wants her and he isn't ashamed or afraid of having her. Then she goes away on a trip to Europe that's been planned before with a lady friend and a man and that gives her a chance to cover things up. But after the trip things change. Because this is a Thirties period film set in France Lady Chatterley and her husband are formal in addressing each other and she and Parkin don't use the familiar tu till she comes back. Parkin isn't a romanticized Noble Savage some incarnation of the physical. He's physical all right but he dresses in a shirt and tie.The most peculiar thing is that without any apology or explanation all the people and places are English but everyone speaks French. This is as if to say This seems very real but it's a fable and we're not going to fake it about that.There have been many film versions of 'Lady Chatterley'. Ferran's is an elegant production in many ways conventional it was made for television in a longer version and it's without selfconscious stylistic gestures  with the one notable exception of the very measured pace. Nothing gets in the way of the actors and the setting  the big aristocratic house the great lands around the property. There's not much more to say. If you want to experience a revolutionary moment in twentieth century English fiction that's still quite alive today you will have to see this. It's a remarkable film. Some boning up on the writer and the period won't hurt.SFIFF 2007.".

All the support acting is measured and helps provide a solid counterbalance for the central couple who gradually learn to let go their inhibitions and slide blissfully from lust to love. It is all very gradually done from Chatterley's first glimpse of the gamekeeper washing himself outside his hut and her consequent and at the time seemingly over the top need to sit to gather her senses literally to the powerful scene where she asks him to turn and display his erect penis and the wondrous scenes of the naked couple cavorting ecstatically in the pouring rain. All in all a fine mix of the wonders of nature the manliness of the hand made the power of sex and the need for love.

During his lifetime he was even labeled a pornographer but that was then and now is now and under the gifted guidance of directorwriter with Roger Bohbot and Pierre Trividic Pascale Ferran Lawrence's exquisite tale of sexual awakening has found what for this viewer is the finest transition of the novel to the screen.The place is England after WW I and Sir Clifford Chatterley Hippolyte Girardot is the paraplegic wealthy husband of ConstanceLady Chatterley a radiant Marina Hands.

The musical score by Batrice Thiriet finds the right quality of elegance and sensuality. If there is a problem with this nearly threehour film it is in the editing by Yann Dedet and Mathilde Muyard that takes liberties with scene transitions that prove disruptive.But it would be hard to imagine two actors who could match the subtlety and sexual tension that Marina Hands and JeanLouis Coullo'ch to this film.

	schema:reviewBody "As you enter the cinema I think there are several instructions certain viewers must first take heed of as regards this film.Firstly face facts it's French so don't be surprised if there are hardly four lines of dialogue in the first thirty minutes.

It's delightful stuff. JeanLouis Coullo'ch's Parkingamekeeper is a good fit for what really is the less starry role and he handles everything including a touching confessional scene with an admirable strength and gentleness.Underpinning everything is the lavish production sound and photography to make an audience feel as part of the forest setting a tranquillity that intimates so much of what the story is trying to say.This is superb stuff.".

	schema:reviewBody "Considering the giant steps taken by cinema since the sixties it's been a long wait for the real Lady C on her way to the big screen. Prurient or bland have been the previous attempts Japan and Italy have had goes Sylvia Emmanuelle Kristel starred predictably enough in a strictly 'B' version and Ken Russell who had had success with 'Women In Love' directed an outofcharacter watereddown serial for television.As it's a woman's story it makes sense for a woman to direct it and even more to make a success of it. Ferran has taken an unknown or forgotten earlier version of the novel John Thomas and Lady Jane as the basis of her film.It has been described as being less polemical than the final version but it works well in emphasising how active Constance Chatterley was in her striving for a better life and in showing how she came to identify herself with the socialist struggle. In 1959 during the Penguin BooksChatterley obscenity trial it was infamously asked if this was the kind of book one would wish one's wife or servants to read. That has always been good for a laugh if it was only about sex  but it was political. Sex and politics a combination we now take for granted but despite the few years since female emancipation the combination was yet unthinkably hairy for the Fifties.The novel itself was excessively wordy often risibly so with Lawrence's maleoriented phallusworshipping view of the world to the fore. When the gamekeeper Parkin JeanLouis Coilloc'h bearing a remarkable resemblance to Brando in 'Streetcar' reveals to Lady C his worries about being too sensitive and perhaps too womanly we hear the author's voice. By adding capitals to every part of the story the director has made a film that could easily be followed as a silent 'The House' The Forest' The Cabin' The Miners'But replacing words with action especially in the sex scenes allows the intimacy and passion to live on without the anachronistic wordplay and modes of speech which now distance us from the lovers. Plenty of time too is given to watching a girlishly clumsy Constance Marina Hands explore the forests and streams surrounding the House also to the contrast with her bucolic little paradise when she is driven into town and sits in her car her gaze lingering on more 'real men' as they emerge begrimed from the mine. Such a contrast made in such visual terms remains in the air when Sir Clifford Hippolyte Girardot jokes about the miners striking every winter and Connie doesn't laugh. It's important to remember that the airs and graces put on by upperclass married couples were partly to avoid losing face in front of the servants Sir Clifford is not the only stiff and distant husband in his world and the supporting of attitudes and beliefs by corsets and tweeds was aped by the aspiring middle classes as in 'Brief Encounter' until wars jazz rock 'n' roll 'certain books' and the satire boom moved the concentration of gravity to The Whitehouse Saudi Arabia and the Taliban's favourite cave.The problem of getting a whole novel onscreen concurrently with a film in its own right has been solved by the use of intertitles the director doing a voiceover and the Lady's trip to France has been slotted in as a home movie while Parkin's misadventures back home are covered in a letter from Sir Clifford's nurse Anne Benoit who tells it straight to camera. These changes in texture help to keep the pace up in this quite long film just as earlier cuts are often a tranquil oldfashioned 'fade to black' to denote the passing of time.Again the scenes of intimacy are well told they are acted and filmed in a manner which fools us into believing we are flies on the wall. There is no concentration on the 'plumbing' as there is with too much onscreen sex and just a few fullyclothed scenes a few words and minimal choreography are all it needs to put over the spirit of the novel the return to the garden and the grace and honest beauty of making love.".

	schema:reviewBody "First we may talk about the general atmosphere of this remarkable movie. All sceneries are very beautiful accurate and full of meaning the landscapes the interiors and the characters' clothes like we would expect in a reproduction of events which take place in midtwenties of last century. In what concerns the plot and story we must keep always in mind that at the time most Victorian moral values still prevail and we must see the movie against this background so what wouldn't be revolutionary nowadays was revolutionary indeed at the time. This is the well told well acted and well directed story of a woman awakening for the physical side of love life. She is the aristocratic rich wife of a no less aristocratic and rich man who is nevertheless an invalid ridden to a wheelchair for life and sexually impotent of course. This awakening begins when she sees for the first time her husband's gamekeeper naked above his waist and washing himself. She is then overwhelmed by a great psychological trouble and the ensuing uncontrollable need of meeting him again leads her to go to see him once more and finishing by surrender herself to make love with him. The first two love scenes were so quick that she doesn't get to any climax and only during the third scene where she takes a more active part does she reach a full orgasm. It's curious however but quite in accordance with social patterns of that time that during the first love scenes between the two the relation masterservant maintains itself before and after sex and only later does it gain a more personal and intimate nature. After the third love scene she even thanks him for it like if it had been a service rendered by him which offends him a lot. This adaptation of the second version of the literary masterpiece novel by the British writer D. H. Lawrence is a great success indeed. This novel was banned as pornographic when it was published first time and only in the sixties of last century a court declared it not pornographic according to he real difference between pornography and eroticism which exists though many people still don't know it but it's out of the scope of this review to explain. Sex is a force of nature and indeed a part of human relations and the literary or artistic works based on it can be object of aesthetic in the broad sense evaluation notwithstanding any possible moral evaluations which are not within the scope of a literary or a film essay.".

Though I haven't read or seen it previously I knew or thought I did the main thrust  sorry about that  i.e. rough sex between a macho illeducated man and a sexually frustrated aristocrat saddled with an impotent husband How wrong can you be what we get here is a romantic and dare I say it Tender love story which may account why the audience with whom I saw it comprised twelve assorted and unaccompanied females between 20 and 60 and one couple. If you asked me to nominate an actress alive or dead who can do both aristocrat and sensual I'd think in terms of Ava Gardener Sophia Loren Fanny Ardant Ingrid Bergman etc and not say Audrey Hepburn but I'd be wrong because Marina Hands is outstanding in the eponymous role and looks younger than her thirty years. Of course she IS the daughter of Ludmila Mikael which explains a lot the female director has followed convention inasmuch as the first time Constance sees her lover to be she is wearing a skirt that stops just short of her ankles a coat scarf gloves and a hat in other words the only naked flesh on display is her face and true to form her first reaction to a man naked from the waist up is to recoil in embarrassment though she soon gets over it. With two hours forty minutes to play with the director takes her time getting to the nitty gritty so that it's just short of the hour when they first make love. There's lots of detail atmosphere as we get to know Constance who comes across as virginal and we suspect that if the marriage WAS consummated before her husband received the wound that rendered him impotent it was not very satisfactory. Another surprise is the gamekeeper  now given a name other than the Mellors of the novel who far from being a crude macho love em and leave em macho type is actually sensitive and comes to love Constance. There IS sex of course but strange as it may seem it is almost chaste and would almost but not quite be at home in a Doris Day movie from the fifties. As I write Marina Hands has accepted an invitation to join the elite Comedy Francaise an honour she fully deserves.".

The plot development was decidedly leisurely in the first half of the film but this was not a gamebreaker as far as my enjoyment of the movie. However compared to all the other versions on this story that I've seen I found this French effort to bring an element of earthy realism best way I can describe it to the story that the others lacked. The scene where the gamekeeper and Lady Chatterley decorate each other with flowers and subsequently disport themselves outside in the field and woods is a particularly interesting and memorable sequence. One minor quibble the film seemed to both begin and end rather abruptly...you'll know what I mean when you watch it.".

	schema:headline " Winner of 5 major Cesar France's Oscar awards offers a refreshing new look to an old story";
	schema:reviewBody "This latest French version of the well known story starts right away with a distinct flavour of its own  screen captions as those used in the silent era. But that signature is only superficial. The real difference is in the treatment of the subject matter sex.Those who go far back enough will remember the first publishing in the 1970s of The joy of sex which is not unlike the Field Guide in The Spiderwick Chronicles 2008 except for the subject matter. That book which unreservedly hailed sex as a natural joyous experience was rather courageous at the time. This movie follows very much on the same spirit. The plot is simple  the story of Lady Chatterley's affair with the gamekeeper when her husband Lord Clifford is wheelchair bound being a war casualty.Unlike Hollywood movies that take the audience in a split second fast cut from initial encounter to hot steaming sex in bed Lady Chatterley takes its good time. The first 45 minutes looking more like National Geographic or Discovery Channel takes the audience through longrange and closeup shots of flowers plants squirrels chicken rustling leaves  all part of an idyllic setting centered in the gamekeeper Parkin's humble hut far away from his master's mansion. There Lady Chatterley goes daily initially following the doctor's instructions that the serene outdoors is the best prescription for her failing health. What follows is something that is bound to happen as Parkin puts it to which the Lady completely agrees.The remarkable thing about this movie is the innocence that embraces the protagonists. It is not quite like Mrs Robinson and Benjamin Braddock shaking hands in The graduate 1967 if you remember that movie. While it started more as physical attraction than anything else the relationship between Lady C. and Parkin evolves through deepening affection into genuine love. But even at the very beginning there is something quite remarkable. The proliferation of sex scenes in movies today needs no exaggeration but I don't think I've ever seen anything like the look of the quiet pleasure on Lady C's face right after their first lovemaking. She did not reach orgasm this first time that is quite clear that came later in another encounter under a tree in the forest. But there is such a simple grateful satisfaction on her face that she almost glows  and that look of childlike innocence. Marina Hands is perfect for the role.The story of Lady Chatterley became famous or infamous in the hands of D.H. Lawrence as a tale of insatiable lust. In this winner of five Cesars France's Oscar including best film and best actress the French movie makers have rendered it into a gentle tender love story of sheer beauty and joy. Even the unhappy ending elicits only a sigh rather than a sob. This is a delightfully refreshing cinematic experience one least expects from the title.".

The film albeit slow at the beginning keeps growing on you thanks to the performances of JeanLouis Coullo'ch and Marina Hands. Let me tell something about JeanLouis he blew me away. A rustic magnetic Marlon Brando lookalike he gives such a nuanced complex performance that he almost steals every scene he's in and his character comes across as a true force of nature. Forget big stars chewing scenery this guy is an Actor with a capital A and brings one of these truetolife performances that you don't really see on screens for a while regarding movies. Once in a while a true Daredevil comes along and ignites the screens with fire in a performance for ages and JeanLouis is one of these guys like Albert Dupontel you've never seen the guy before but after the picture is over you have true respect for the actor and will also never forget the name of the guy. Nowadays films tend to be a product a project made to earn producers big money and Lady Chatterley is the opposite of the Hollywood crap. The film's major setback is running time. There are moments that the film comes to a sudden halt just to pick up later but that's fine. Marina Hands was a revelation and as the film progresses you really testify the depth and moving changes her character goes through as a lovely woman who really gets to develop a beautiful affection for the troubled and wounded keeper opening him to a new big and bright world. There are two outstanding moments that left me speechless SPOILERS AHEAD the crane shot of the leafs and trees at first wet and gray slowly turning into a bright and full of life sky as a great thrilling piece of music starts to play then a panoramic shot of the fields and a flying bird and all of a sudden it's one of these largerthanlife magic movie moments that will live forever. The other moment was the ending JeanLouis's lines about discovering a new world with her and how he will do everything to be with her forever and then the camera shows Marina's face crying with emotion and happiness men that part really stayed with me and choke me up. Lady Chatterley is a mustsee!".

A young woman unsatisfied by her crippled rich husband begins a sexual relationship with the rough uncivilized gamekeeper. Ooooh... Great stuff. Pass me my Kleenex.Lady Chatterley is not that film. Despite all of the nudity and the brief close up at one point of an erect male organ what Lady Chatterley really is is a beautiful erotic and tender love story with fine photography and great internalised acting. I think that Marina Hands and JeanLouis Coullo'ch give truly wonderful performances as the lovers.For me there was one slightly jarring note in that the film is set in England but being a French film of course everybody is speaking in French. But is that the little Englander in me talking? If the situation were reversed and I were talking about British actors playing French characters in a French setting but speaking English would I even give it a second thought? No. Of course I wouldn't. Not at all.It is a long film nearly 3 hours although there is a television version that runs  eeek!  nearly 4 hours and not exactly plot driven but don't let that put you off.

	schema:reviewBody "Lady Chatterley is one of the few recent films that steps gracefully away from exorbitantly expensive computergenerated images ofsaygiant robots that deal with battling armies or trigger happy pirates on the high seas or for that manner the all around average horror flick. Instead of using bigbudget special effectsFrench director Pascale Ferran does something antiquated and perhaps forgotten by the American audienceshe uses old fashioned cimematopgraphy and relies on the talents of her actors to tell the story. The reason of why this works so very well is because the movie is straightforward in going by the novel by D.H. Lawrence. And the results paid off becoming the highest grossing picture in its native Francewinning five Cesars including Best Picture. And this is far better version then other movies based on the title character.Morina Hands stars as Lady Constance Chatterleythe wife of an affluent noblemanClifford ChatterleyHippolyte Girardotin post World War I England. Togetherthe two portray perfectly the standard stuffy marriage between two members of the English upper class. Girardot conveys the sort of distance and arrogance one might expect for a rich industrialistwhile Hands brings to life the stifled and quiet misery of Lady Chatterley. Things change when Constance embarks on a journey of selfdiscovery by opening both her mindand her bodyto her husband's gamekeeperParkinJeanLouis Coullo'ch.

	onyx:emotionText "Lady Chatterley is one of the few recent films that steps gracefully away from exorbitantly expensive computergenerated images ofsaygiant robots that deal with battling armies or trigger happy pirates on the high seas or for that manner the all around average horror flick. Instead of using bigbudget special effectsFrench director Pascale Ferran does something antiquated and perhaps forgotten by the American audienceshe uses old fashioned cimematopgraphy and relies on the talents of her actors to tell the story. The reason of why this works so very well is because the movie is straightforward in going by the novel by D.H. Lawrence. And the results paid off becoming the highest grossing picture in its native Francewinning five Cesars including Best Picture. And this is far better version then other movies based on the title character.Morina Hands stars as Lady Constance Chatterleythe wife of an affluent noblemanClifford ChatterleyHippolyte Girardotin post World War I England. Togetherthe two portray perfectly the standard stuffy marriage between two members of the English upper class. Girardot conveys the sort of distance and arrogance one might expect for a rich industrialistwhile Hands brings to life the stifled and quiet misery of Lady Chatterley. Things change when Constance embarks on a journey of selfdiscovery by opening both her mindand her bodyto her husband's gamekeeperParkinJeanLouis Coullo'ch.

The rebellion against male dominance or the bourgeois society had gone so long now we do not really see discussing socialism over the dinner table.

The camera take an honest look on human  nature. Too real as the flesh in the movie nothing was altered to exaggerate aesthetically in the movie. All too real. The movie starts slowly as Chatterly's mind and life until it starting to shape A very slow transition. Then finally she starting to live her own life. It is predictable but consumable. the movie has its own charm as the female leader. Openly naive but innocently guilty. The ending was weak but bearable. If you enjoyed Jane Campion's movies which were funk this one is classic more like a piece of Schuman. Warning you that if you are not going to enjoy D.H Lawrence's lengthy book of female liberation don't buy a ticket. You would fall a sleep. It goes nearly 3 hours.

Lawrence is iconoclastic and as such no one gets through his hands unscratched. No luck no hope no future for the son of a miner the wife of a miner or a miner himself because they will only know poverty and repression including the repression of their passions that will have to become illegal and even criminal if necessary to step over social censorship. But no luck either for the boss of the mine or the aristocrat who has nothing to do except counting his bonds and shares because they are unable to feel and experience any emotion passion sentimental adventure. They are British to the core. No sex please. But the film gets rid of all that dark vision and transform one of the tenser and denser tale about social segregation in England into a love affair under the rain in the middle of woods and I can tell you that these woods are not going to move in any other way. No Lady Macbeth in the wings please. I have nothing against the importation of an English masterpiece into the French vision but when the French vision is reduced to sentimentalese mishmash and melonondramatic hogwash I regret to be living where I am living. The film is too long and often close to boring and it is not two or three scrutinizing shots of the man's sex by the voyeuristic camera that will make the drug go down Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious or something like that is obviously unknown from our directress.

The majority of people seeing this will almost certainly be more familiar with the story than I was so I won't go on at length suffice it to say that the aristrocratic Lady's romance with a groundskeeper on her crippled husband's lands I believe he was a stonemason in the novel starts out somewhat plodding wrapped up in a 19thcentury gauze of courtliness and tentative unexpressed feelings but the intensity builds with a smoothness and a sure command of film language that is completely impressive. The principal leads Marina Hands and JeanLouis Coullo'ch are exemplary the photography and camera movements natural capturing the beauty and sensuality of both the couple and landscape without seeming overdecorous or sentimental. The extraordinary use of music is perhaps what I'll remember most the majority of the film does not have background music but on a few brief occasions a yearning early 20thcentury postRomantic score reminiscent to me of Delius or Bax soars outward the judgment of director Ferran in her use of these rare bars of melody by Batrice Thiriet to express the wordless emotions of her heroine might seem almost Spielbergian if you're just reading about them but they show a restraint and perfect timing that far exceeds the sentimental uses that most Hollywood directors would put them to.

Splendidly photographed and composed consumately acted and faithfully scored To Live is a three or four hour film novel lovingly packed into two hours and fifteen minutes. For a long time Ingmar Bergman's Fanny and Alexander stood by itself as the greatest family epic in my moviegoing experience. The Best Years of Our Lives ran a distant second. But since 1995 To Live has moved into a very close second.Most Chinese who lived through Mao's Revolution say this film tells it like it was at the simple townsperson level. Though it can serve as an overview of Chinese history 1944 to 1970 or so unlike Lean's Gandhi or Lawrence of Arabia this is not a hero's biopic. Instead we see a foolish once rich but now fallen heir and his wife blown about by the winds of fortune for three decades and challenged as parents trying to raise two children under increasingly harsh and punitive communist tyranny. What you sense in this film that I've never seen before in any Chinese film is how the ethical and moral principles that have prevailed in Chinese culture for 2500 years  a mix of transcendence and pragmatism humility and grit cosmic harmonic balance and social duty  allows an ordinary couple to accept unbearable tragedy and keep going. It also shows what this survival strategy costs them in their Communist context. The screenplay is full of cosmic irony. It makes us aware without shouting that this is just one family among millions. As Yimou's transitional screen message says ...leaving no family unaffected. It is to that extent a tribute film.Maybe ten hours of Kieslowski's Decalogue might accomplish the same broad survey of of human happenstance and emotion. Maybe Kurosawa in three or four hours. But never in two plus hours have I seen the scope Zhang Yimou achieves here. To Live also contains as wise a moral lesson as any film I've seen and it's a gentle one despite the surrounding violence. I couldn't paraphrase the lesson for you. I wouldn't try. Just watch. It will reach you nonverbally in about 90 minutes. Just know this isn't Shakespeare Hollywood or soap opera. It's something else.Gong Li's work is as powerful as anything Streep or Sarandon have ever done in the west  which is all the more inspiring since the camera doesn't lavish starlevel attention on her. As her husband Ge You turns in an emotionally riveting charming sometimes funny and devastatingly honest performance. The direction is sure handed the shooting unfailingly gorgeous. Zhang Yimou's cinematic canvass has never been so big or his palette so colorful and controlled. Full of spectacle great sweeps of time and onrushing tides of humanity To Live is still in the end a sweet and poignant epic with an intimate  observant heart. Great story telling. Do not miss! Try to view a letterbox version on a big screen.".

Now that director Yimou Zhang 'Hero'  'House of Flying Daggers' has become more popular I'm hoping this will change.'Huozhe' or 'To Live' takes us on a trip in China that will last us from the 40's through the 70's. Through that time we will see life through the eyes of Fugui and Jiazhen a husband and wife with 2 children as well as Fugui's mother.Fugui the husband has a gambling problem which will set off a chain of events that will have them lose the house and eventually separate the family. Jiazhen his wife is forced to take a job which will put a strain on her children. Communist and nationalist armies battle each other and the rise of Chairman Mao will affect them as well. Fugui will go through layers of mishaps that will change him forever. I don't want to detail anything more about the plot it's much more worth viewing it and experiencing it then anything I can ever say here.Not once is this movie boring effectively placing us there with the family. The acting seems so natural that it feels like you are there traveling with them rather then viewing them through a camera. This of course shows the strength of Zhang's directing. You Ge plays Fugui a popular actor in China won the award for the Cannes Film Festival. Li Gong is beautiful and portrays her character with such passion it's no wonder she has been nominated nearly a dozen times winning most.Emotional without being sappy honest  historically accurate the film does have a black shroud covering it. In times of sadness it's lifted a bit to allow us to see happiness indeed life pull this family together. It even has bits of humor in it at times I laughed along with the family as much as I felt their pain. Little details such paintings in the background that chip away as time goes by shows how much care went into making this film. Characters that seem unimportant become part of the story later.What a wonderful film. When I saw it 10 years ago it not only changed the way I saw foreign movies it also changed the way I see life and people. Any movie that can do that is one I highly recommend to anyone.A perfect 10 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I rewatched FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE recently I was surprised that it was much less political than I remembered it being. Turns out that's because I'd somehow merged together that film and TO LIVE together in my poor muddled brain. Both have some similarities beyond the common appearance of Gong Li in front and Zhang Yimou behind the camera but TO LIVE definitely confronts the political I should really say social aspects of the decades they cover much more directly and forcefully.TO LIVE aka LIFETIMES  I dunno what the Chinese name is basically covers 3 or 4 decades of one family's life in China in a period that saw not one but two revolutions and looks at the effect the social upheaval had on ordinary people's lives. The film rarely criticises the political movements instigated by Mao Tse Tung but does an effective job of showing the hellishness of a society that has been turned on its head where the people are forced to change not just the way they live but the way they think and people are forced into social relationships that are new and quite possibly against human nature.I hope I won't jeapordise my visa if I admit that I had strong leanings towards Communism when I was younger having read Marx in philosophy classes. His picture of a society without private possessions or social hierarchy did seem very appealing but Marx acknowledged that the only way for such a society to work was if every member saw the value of it and willingly took part in it and admitted that the only way that was likely to happen was via massive revolution  i.e. killing everyone that didn't agree with the plan. As a teenager that didn't seem like such a big price or problemCertainly I'm not the only person to have considered this price worth paying and a couple of people have actually put the plan into practice  lamentably with less than stellar results. Mao Tse Tung is I guess the undisputed king of Communist revolution having led TWO of them in China and probably disrupting more peoples' lives than anybody else in history in the process. TO LIVE gives those of us that haven't had to live through such conditions some idea of what it might have been like. People used to the cushy capitalist western lifestyle might wonder just how on earth people can live through conditions like that but that's the what the film wants to say... life might deal you some crappy hands but people are remarkably adaptable and resilient and you've just got to try to live the best you can. It sounds remarkably trite put like that but the film does a good job of expressing it.The film is based on a novel with the author cowriting the screenplay as well. Zhang Yimou directs brilliantly as usual which in this case is to recognise the strength of the story and characters and to back off a little giving them space to live their lives. Although the film looks great throughout the cinematography is quite unobtrusive. He once more elicits a great performance from Gong Li and the rest of the cast with leading man Ge You giving the best one of all. The film has occasionally been criticised for throwing piling too much tragedy on but this is never done in an exploitativemanipulative way and Zhang Yimou avoids turning to melodrama to evoke an audience reaction... which makes him all the more likely to get one and without the audience feeling used afterwards.In a career full of magnificent films TO LIVE stands as one of Zhang Yimou's finest moments. The film is epic yet remarkably simple and the execution is as near to flawless as I've seen. I doubt that even Akira Kurosawa could have handled the material better which is to say that Zhang Yimou surely ranks in the world's top echelon of filmmakers. Long may his life and career continueHighest recommendation!".

	schema:reviewBody "Yimou Zhang's To Live begins in the late 1940s and covers several decades in the life of Fugui You Ge his wife Jiazhen Li Gong and their two children. It is an excellent family drama provoking both laughter and tears and distinguishing itself from similar movies because of its commitment to showing how China's changing society affects the family. It takes the huge subject of the first twenty years of Communism in China and brings it down to a human scale.Both leading actors nicely portray the way their characters change over the years. At first Fugui is the stereotypical callow young man and Jiazhen the even more stereotypical long suffering wife but the screenplay and actors eventually deepen the characterizations.The best sequence of the film covers the Chinese Civil War. Wisely Yimou Zhang resists the temptation to make the movie too epic and instead focuses on Fugui's personal experiences. The result is a very moving depiction of the human cost of war. In another striking touch Fugui's hobby is singing with a shadowpuppet troupe. The puppets not only provide an interesting glimpse into traditional Chinese culture they also take on a symbolic meaning. After watching To Live it's easy to see why the Chinese authorities banned it there's a lot of tragedy in the film and in most cases Communism is to blame. Remarkably though Zhang also makes many of the Communist characters sympathetic. For instance Fugui and Jiazhen's daughter marries an officer in the Red Guards who is a little ridiculous in his devotion to Mao Zedong but not a villain. This is in keeping with the overall spirit of To Livehumanistic and subtle instead of bombastic or propagandistic. It's both an important examination of recent Chinese history and a universal story about how individual human beings manage to live in times of hardship. A rare combination and one well worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not.What I think Zhang Yimou's message here is that the will of the people to live as in the title to survive and overcome obstacles is what defines the Chinese people. They ride the ox of communism as a boat rides a wave. They adapt.Consider that tall and thin Fugui played with consummate skill by You Ge says that a chick will become a chicken when it grows up and then a sheep and then an ox and then the Communist Party. But as the film ends he tells his grandson only that the chick will become a chicken and then a sheep and then an ox. He doesn't mention communism. In this way we know that the people have tamed the ox.Zhang's film is an epic parable of life in China in the 20th century. It opens before the communist revolution with protagonist Fugui as a wayward son who is gambling the family fortune away. His wife Jiazhen Gong Li pleads with him to stop but he cannot. He is addicted to vice. Symbolically he represents the old regime. He loses everything wife included and goes to live in the streets. After some time the revolutionary war begins and he and his friends find it convenient to switch sides and join the revolutionary armyhe as an entertainer for the troops a puppeteer. He and wife reunite and become loyal and even enthusiastic communists. He is lucky to have lost his fortune for now he is recognized as a hero of the revolution while the man who won his family's house at dice is declared a counterrevolutionary and meets a bad end.As in every Zhang Yimou film I have seen everything is beautifully and exquisitely done. His work is characterized by an artist's sense of color and form by an engaging simplicity in the telling and by a subtle sense of what is going on politically and especially by a deep and abiding sense of humanity. Here the transformation of Chinese society from feudalism to communism to the capitalistcommunism hybrid that exists today is shown through the eyes and experiences of the people and what is emphasized is the endurance and the will of the people to survive adapt and finally to flourish regardless of who might be in power.I would compare Zhang Yimou to the very greatest directors say to Stanley Kubrick to Francis Ford Coppola to Louis Malle to Krzysztof Kieslowski in sheer artistic talent. Like Malle he is warm and honest about human beings and what they do without being maudlin or sentimental. Like Coppola he has an epicmaker's vision and like the Coppola of the Godfather films a strong sense of family. Like Kubrick he is creative and always aware of the needs of the audience and like Kieslowski he is clever.This is in some respects Zhang Yimou's finest achievement because of the way he tells the story of communism in China. I am reminded of the way Louis Malle tells the truth about human sexuality without inciting the censors. Here Zhang Yimou tells the truth about the communist experience in China subtly demonstrating its cruelties and stupidities without amazing enough incurring the wrath of the authorities. Some of his films have been banned in China but I understand they are readily available nonetheless. Here the kids are smiling and happy as they work in the steel mill. The accident that kills Fugui's son is seen as just that an accident and not the fault of the Great Leap Forward. The members of the educated class who are ridiculed beaten and banished and worse during the Cultural Revolution accept their fate as their just desertsthe doctor who insists that it is better to wear the placard shaming him that is hung from around his neck than it is to take it off. The local official who has preached and practiced the communist line faithfully who finds himself being labeled a capitalist also accepts his fate as though in doing so he is furthering a cause larger than himself.In a way Zhang Yimou's international celebrity and reputation as one of the world's greatest film makers protects him. In another sense his depictions of the sins and excesses of the old regime before communism are so well done and appreciated by all that such an expression also protects him.Nonetheless I do not personally consider this Zhang Yimou's best film. I prefer the startling beauty of Raise the Red Lantern 1991 and Red Sorghum 1987 as well as the charming Not One Less 1999 or the simple but powerful The Story of Qiu Ju. However this is an outstanding film.Notable in a supporting role is Wu Jiang as Wan Erxi the strong young man with the limp who marries the mute daughter. I have seen him in Shower 1999 in which his personal charisma and strength of character are shown more fully. He is the younger brother of Wan Jiang who starred in Zhang Yimou's first film Red Sorghum. Of course Gong Li one of the finest actresses of our time who is often featured in Zhang Yimou's films is outstanding as always.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

The title To Live is very apt as we see the rises and falls of one small family living through the ups and downs of China during the prerevolutionary era the civil war the Great Leap Forward the Proletariat Cultural Revolution and beyond.This movie is at turns dramatic humorous touching chilling heartwrenching and triumphant.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a beautiful story of one family as they cope with the changing times in revolutionary China.  Through their eyes we get a glimpse of what life must have been like for an average person in those days.The story begins with Fugui gambling away his family's home.  Urbane and selfconfident he is quickly broken by the loss of his home and his father who dies from shame.  Having to leave his mother in the care of the new owner he goes off with some puppets that have been loaned to him making a living putting on shows around the countryside.  He gets caught up in the revolution helps the communist army and eventually returns to find the wife and family he left behind.Nearly the entire story takes place in the city where he lives a small side street in particular  no more than an alley by western standards.  Fugui's wife Jiazhen lovingly played by the great actress Gong Li has been given a job by the local committee hauling hot water to local families.  Fugui settles in and begins entertaining the neighborhood with his puppet shows. They have a mute daughter Fengxia and a precocious son Youging. We see the family grow up and undergo changes most of them tragic.  Much of the action is tied to the political climate that evolves from the revolution through the period of the Red Guards 50's 60's early 70's.  The son is killed by accident when a party official backs his jeep into a wall and crushes him.  The father is told that his puppets are now considered counterrevolutionary so he has to give up that pleasure.  The daughter marries a kindly party official from a local factory but dies in childbirth after the nursing students have expelled the doctors from the maternity ward for not being politically pure enough.Through it all the family perseveres not with any great histrionics but with acceptance and love.  The parents are simple people who just want what's best for their children but because of the circumstances set in action by the communists they lose their daughter and son.  This isn't an overly political film.  The communist officials aren't depicted as evil but neither are they particularly heroic.  The local party leader is friendly and helpful to the family as is the soninlaw.  But apparently the depiction of the party in less than glowing terms during this period was offensive enough for the Chinese government to ban this film. Which is too bad because it's a tribute to the strength of the Chinese people and not a slam at communism per se.This is a beautiful film with a haunting musical theme running through it. I highly recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Reasonably well off Fugui loses all his money due to his gambling addiction.  Eventually he loses his house in a game of dice with Long'er. Fugui's pregnant wife Jiazhen leaves him when it is clear he wants his vice over her.  With poverty Fugui comes to his senses and starts work with his own puppet troupe.  On the birth of their son Jiazhen returns to the reformed Fugui but civil war breaks out and Fugui leaves to fight.  With things difficult already the rise of the Maoist regime makes things ever more difficult and the Xu family suffer fortune and misfortune as Communism is formed.I watched this movie because it had won the top award at Cannes.  I hadn't high hopes for some reason but I figured it was worth a look.  I am very glad I did because it is a wonderful little piece that can be enjoyed with little knowledge of the regime against which it is set.  The story follows the family's misfortunes and how they are affected by the rise of Chairman Mao.  Their plight is touching as they suffer wrongs but also show compassion on others  all the while trying to do the right thing by the system that is impacting on them.  Even when tragedy occurs they never blame Communism but heap it on themselves instead.This unfolds over many years with the rise of Mao as the backdrop.  The parrellel between the two things is clear without being forced or rammed down our throats  it's a wonderful bit of handling.  Even better is the infusion of comic touches all the way through the dialogue even in subtitle form is great and is witty and touching  I laughed out loud many times.Not having seen any other films by Zhang I can only hope they are as good as this one.  The cast too do a great job with the film.  You Ge's Fugui is fabulous  he is a draw from the start on and his ageing is so convincing that credit must go not only to the makeup but also to Ge for doing so well with  potentially tragic figure.  Likewise Gong is superb but ages less convincingly.  The support cast are all good from the children through to the figures of Mao like Jiang and Niu.  The only thing that saddened me about the two great leads is to think that Western cinema will never care to have them in any films  I guess that when it comes to Hong Kong cinema Hollywood only are interested if it has slowmotion and guns! and they think they're cutting edge!Overall I find it very hard to fault this film as it has so much going for it on so many levels.  Just as a human story it is excellent and the historical context only serves to make it better.  Comic and touching right to it's perfectly pitched close this should be searched out by anyone who wants a genuinely moving human tale with political comment sown into each frame without intrusion.".

It's her suffering and triumph that complements and completes Ge You's. Two things in particular elevate their performances their complete avoidance of melodrama and their chemistry.

At its core the movie is about living  about how people endure and adapt through the worst of times. To this extent the movie is marvelously effective but because of its focus on the characters it's easy to overturn the objectivity and construe a message from the viewer and not the film. That said the film does subtly criticize Communism but in a matteroffact and objective manner. When tragedy strikes the characters don't turn around and blame Mao Zedong the film leaves it up to us to draw interpretations from the tragedies and joys we see. Perhaps this makes it an all the more potent assault but the important thing is Zhang Yimou didn't make this film to denounce Mao Gong Li and Ge You don't have secret antiCommunism fires burning in their eyes. It's first and foremost a heartfelt sympathetic and beautiful portrayal of the endurance and spirit of common people in the face of seemingly unsurmountable odds.".

	schema:reviewBody "When you come to these you expect beauty and the sweep of society and how it jostles the humans we're touching. You expect that as the advertised values.But I want something more than a good book well illustrated. This crop of Chinese filmmakers looks for the soul of the story in what some might call a gimmick what they call the storyimage. In some cases this can make art that is lifealtering. Zhou Yu's Train with this actress was one of these for me. It was a delicate complex weave among the layers of the story and the storyimage reference of the train. And it explored that train from perspectives that were amazingly new.Chinese Box also with this same actress used a more human device. Karwei's films are the ultimate for me because he has transcended this notion of needing a visual metaphor allegory as an anchor.This director used the notion of space in Hero as the storyimage in that film together with the notion that space itself could be the storyteller and this is compounded by there being many candidate spacetellers.In this film he uses the shadowpuppets as his device. I'm attracted to that because it is a sort of play within the play that is embossed on the play. Sure the movie itself is about humans as puppets of society  and got him in trouble with the puppetmasters.So I will recommend it on that basis a folded film that happens to be lush and beautiful in a way that is enhanced by the folds.But if you want a more cinematic storyimage see Hero. If you want a richer fold with that image and this lovely actress see Zhou Yu's Train. And if you want these ideas in the extremest depth and effectiveness see the pair of In the Mood for Love and 2046.Its a strange recommendation for a film to situate it among others that do elements better. But this is definitely worth your energy investing your soul.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

Karwei's films are the ultimate for me because he has transcended this notion of needing a visual metaphor allegory as an anchor.This director used the notion of space in Hero as the storyimage in that film together with the notion that space itself could be the storyteller and this is compounded by there being many candidate spacetellers.In this film he uses the shadowpuppets as his device. I'm attracted to that because it is a sort of play within the play that is embossed on the play. Sure the movie itself is about humans as puppets of society  and got him in trouble with the puppetmasters.So I will recommend it on that basis a folded film that happens to be lush and beautiful in a way that is enhanced by the folds.But if you want a more cinematic storyimage see Hero. If you want a richer fold with that image and this lovely actress see Zhou Yu's Train. And if you want these ideas in the extremest depth and effectiveness see the pair of In the Mood for Love and 2046.Its a strange recommendation for a film to situate it among others that do elements better. But this is definitely worth your energy investing your soul.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.";

They have few skills because of their background and are initially saved from the communists because of a fluke.As the years roll on and calamities beset them they blame each other for these events however their heartbreaking tragedies are no one's fault because they are engulfed in historical events over which no one is in control.  They are so immersed in it they have no objectivity.I rate it as one of my favorite films a 10 partly because there are no stereotypes.  There are no real heavies.  I thought it was wonderful and really humanizes the Chinese people to those of us who have no concept of who the Chinese are and what their life is like and that includes me.

History is still in making and there have been many come backs of the conservative forces in China. Creators may pay with their careers liberty or even life for such a sincere open approach to the history of China in the last fifty years. The makers of this film deserve all our respect for this is probably the most openly critic film towards the system that I saw made in Communist China.But beyond all this is a very good film. The whole history of China in the second half of the 20th century is retold through the eyes of a couple who live love and somehow survive all the dramatic times their country goes through. And although the price they pay is huge  they are losing dear people they must make terrible compromises give up their dreams  they keep their humanity and the final message is one of hope. It is not only private hope but also the hope of a whole people to survive the tougher of the times of trouble remaining true to its tradition and humanity.The film is very well acted and directed. The story line is a little melodramatic but there are so many memorable scenes and lines that make it for the aparent lack of complexity. This is certainly one of the best Chinese movies I have seen and the Chinese cinema provided in the last ten years or so some of the true great creations of world cinema. 910 on my personal scale.".

That attitude is an important factor that leads him more naturally to be an easy prey for this gambling that has become a fierce influence. And it heats up his mind in a rhythm almost like a trance of forgetfulness. Also it is said that the head of the gambling house is playing with him in a more subtle way that the dices were loaded and that the game is set much more viciously against him that he is on longer run of being manipulated thats it shows on the screen.

Even with the necessity to squeeze out the script many events thus making it possible to turn the initial story into a 2 hour film at least for a challenge such as this one a lot misjudging was avoidable on that part.

This film is like a bad Walt Disney version of it's original form it's too much of a sentimentalist view to hook onto the historical veracity to which junctions the credibility of the tale also the conditions the characters go through by what they confront should show noticeable side effects which a bit light on the screen. Thus the initial dimension of the characters has been sterilized by these severe lacks. If all those components had been more seriously followed then there is no doubt this adaptation could have reached a totally different result on its quality scale and it really is just a shame.".

If i read reviews like this i usually think of overthetop artsy movies with weird acting unrealistic dialogs and long shots at clocks or stones that no person in his right mind who is not a complete movie buff would voluntarily sit through. To all you normal people who are afraid of just this This is not one of those movies. It's no popcorn cinema but it's still highly entertaining in its own way. The story is gripping the acting is nothing short of marvelous Ge You and Gong Li deserve every prize there is for their performances and the dialogs are simply ...real. It makes you laugh out loud and it makes you cry there'll be more crying than laughing going on though To me it's a perfect movie that might just change your perspective on life. However you will be able to enjoy this masterpiece more thoroughly if you get yourself acquainted with Chinese history from the 1930s to the 1970s and while you're at it try to dive into Chinese culture itself real quick as well  Trust me you will be able to enjoy this movie much more if you know more than well the commies took over in '49 and then there was this cultural revolution i guess. If you don't have all that background information you'll probably still think of it as a great movie but you're going to miss some of the subtle social commentary and will not recognize the importance of some of the plot devices. So you might want to check out wikipedia or a history book beforehand or maybe even the novel itself if you can get your hands on it. The novel is very good too. But it does lack the optimistic fundamental note and the humor of the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "As an American viewer with no experience with China outside of a classroom book or film I was unsure how well I would be able to grasp the intensely emotional personal stories of To Live considering their intersection with the political developments which envelop the film's characters and the events which shape their lives. The Chinese Revolution in 1949 and the subsequent regime of Mao Tse Tung including Mao's Cultural Revolution are formative events for modern China. Together with the Great Leap Forward the Cultural Revolution is considered part of the great disaster that was Mao's efforts to consolidate power and spread socialism following the Revolution. In front of this backdrop we witness the lives of Fu Gui and his wife Jia Zhen as well as their family and friends. Although the 1994 film is not an overt criticism of Mao's regime to do so would be politically unwise for the filmmakers the effects of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution have devastating effects on Fu Gui's family. Fu Gui and his family as a whole makes huge sacrifices which the viewer will have to see for himherself. The purges and political upheaval of the Cultural Revolution effect Fu Gui his family and their friends and neighbors and an uprising of young against old medical students against their doctors symbolic of many student rebellions at this time cause huge stirs and risks. The risky paranoid challenging and lifechanging effects of Mao Tse Tung's regime are wellcaptured in this film and Westerners would certainly benefit from this perspective which captures not only the bad but the good or inoffensive qualities of Chinese life at this time. Not only that but the character of Fu Gui might inspire any viewer not to emulate him but to avoid his mistakes.".

I also had the pleasure of watching the 'Making of...' documentary on the DVD. Michel Gondry's subtle genius shines brilliantly in the interviews. The techniques employed to achieve the effects in the film are amazingly unHollywood. I have a new respect for French filmmaking. Added to the wonders of Jeunet are the wonders of Gondry.

Also the film is ostensibly foreign but moves from French to English with equal measure with a little bit of Spanish tossed in too. So maybe the shifts in language also irked some people but I found it enchanting. So don't let those low votes fool you this is a beautiful sublime film and if you let yourself go onto its wavelength you'll most likely find yourself enjoying the perhaps unsolvable visual puzzle Michel Gondry has created here. It is the quintessence of magical realism and yet everything comes across as absolutely effortless unlike the forced whimsy of say last year's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or the toocleverbyhalf Adaptation.

	schema:headline " Pure genius from the director of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind";
	schema:reviewBody "The Science of Sleep is most likely the best and most visionary film playing at Sundance this year I say most likely because I've only seen two but I doubt that anything can top it. Furthermore I believe that The Science of Sleep is one of the best and most visionary films I've ever seen.The Science of Sleep is about Stephane Gael Garcia Bernal a creative and nave dreamer who moves from Mexico to his childhood home in Paris after his father's death. He takes a job at a calendar company assuming that it will allow him to express himself creatively. Living across from Stephane is Stephanie Charlotte Gainsbourg an equally creative woman. They form a relationship and as it grows it becomes threatened by Stephane's overactive dream world which begins creeping into his waking life.The Science of Sleep marks the screen writing debut of director Michel Gondry. This is Gondry's third theatrical feature film after Human Nature and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Much like last year's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang where it was unfiltered Shane Black on the screen The Science of Sleep is pure Gondry from start to finish. This is Gondry's immense visual world unrestrained by a script by Charlie Kaufman and this world of fancy and imagination is where the film flourishes.The title sequence is set to the image of spin art think back to the days of your school carnival as we enter Stephane's active dream world. The paint layers upon itself as the colors stretch further and further outward while we hear Stephane dreaming. This perfectly sets the tone for the rest of the film as we see bright and vibrant imagery and characters layered upon each other and pulled outward into their worlds. The magic of the sequence is broken though when we are immediately brought into the real world.Stephane's real life is as banal and mundane as anyone could imagine. As an artist he feels suffocated in a job where he glues in a basement all day. In his own time he creates inventions such as 3D glasses for real life Isn't real life already in 3D? asks Stephanie or one second time machines. His indomitable creative spirit is what he finds mirrored in the equally creative yet more realistically centered Stephanie.In direct contrast is Stephane's dream world. It is outlandish beautiful and unrestrained. It is in these sequences when Gondry takes flight. The sequences are filled with so much eye candy it is difficult to take in. They range from the absurd a spider typewriter to the grand an entire cardboard city or to the beautiful a cloth horseback ride to a boat on a sea of cellophane. What makes the sequences all the more incredible is that for the most part he relies only on practical effects. Also remarkable is the way that the dream world represents the film's reality. The film is so very aware of itself and its intentions and the dream sequences utilize that knowledge to the full extent. As the dreams begin to invade the real world this knowledge becomes even more vital. Gondry's meticulous attention to detail is a benefit seeing as he does not confound himself and therefore does not confound the audience for the most part.It is also filled with wonderful dialogue and it finds transcendent humor through the characters. By using truth instead of punch lines to provide the humor Gondry adds another layer to his already versatile film. The dialogue is in French English and Spanish each seamlessly interweaving with each other much like the realities of the film interweave. There comes a point in the film where you stop realizing the language of the film is constantly changing. It comes as the three worlds represented by the language the Spanish is who Stephane was the English he who is now and the French is his dream of the future begin to merge into Stephane's one reality.The film truly ascends to its full potential when it arrives at such an incredibly heightened state where we have little idea if we are in reality or in a dream. It is a language of its own and in and of itself it is seamless.The Science of Sleep is not simply a visual wonder of a film either. The performances are touching and heartfelt. Gael Garcia Bernal continues to be one of the most talented actors working. His performance is filled with so much raw emotion giving a strong emotional core to the film. I believe that without his powerful and nuanced performance the spectacle of the film would have been too much however Bernal keeps it grounded in reality with a performance so truthful that the insanity happening around him seems completely believable. The same can be said of Charlotte Gainsbourg as Stephanie as well as the myriad of supporting actors each playing fully developed characters.Few films ever achieve their full potential this exceeds it. The Science of Sleep is a film that will excite you with its visual fancy and touch you with its powerful emotion. Michel Gondry has created a film that even through the unbelievable proceedings has so many deftlycrafted human moments. Deep down this film is a love story. Going back to the title sequence's spin art below all of layers being spun and pushed around run currents of human emotion which Gondry smartly anchors the film with therefore allowing it to soar.".

The movie follows Gael Garcia's character as he moves back to his mothers home in Paris and finds himself falling for the girl across the hall. Gael's character experiences reality through dreams and the present creating all sorts of confusion. The movie has some of the most unique props and eccentric animation pieces I have ever seen but would you expect anything less from Gondry Eternal Sunshine... This movie really can't be described in truth but holds so much potential for multiple viewings as its so full of life and visual wonders for the eyes. Gael Garcia is just perfect in this role and is fascinating in gesture and laugh out loud funny when the script allows. I think you should definitely look forward to seeing this movie when it gets a wide release its funny its art its pleasure for the eyes and a puzzle for the mind.".

In fact I might have had my mouth open from the moment it started  I didn't realize it until about halfway through. The astonishment and pleasure on my end started with the very first shots  the way things got depicted and worked out. A film that is as much a film as a true piece of art.I can do nothing other than rating this one very highly. It is like a dream but also like reality and it explains its title and theme very clearly. Acting is good enough and the music choice is very fitting. All in all very worthwhile material.9 out of 10 fuzzy dreams".

The astonishment and pleasure on my end started with the very first shots  the way things got depicted and worked out. A film that is as much a film as a true piece of art.I can do nothing other than rating this one very highly. It is like a dream but also like reality and it explains its title and theme very clearly. Acting is good enough and the music choice is very fitting. All in all very worthwhile material.9 out of 10 fuzzy dreams";

	schema:reviewBody "I viewed this based on a number of factors Gondry's work on Eternal Sunshine and some of the most inventive music videos ever created Gael Garcia Bernal whom I've yet to see in a dud movie.Until now.Gondry achieves his aim of immersing the viewer into a waking dream. Like the protagonist as the film goes on we lose the ability to tell what is real from what isn't. At times when you think Stephane is lucid and in honest communication with the other characters in the story something will happen that will completely throw you. Is he ever fully awake? Is he asleep? Or is he just daydreaming? The visuals are very dreamlike and reminiscent of Gondrys music videos for The White Stripes Steriogram and Bjork to name a few. Marvellous to watch and remarkably effective.Where the film started to lose effect for me was when frustration began to replace sympathy for Stephanes predicament and character. Some of his actions and statements appeared indicative of a deeply mentally unbalanced individual verging on creepy. He was effectively emotionally hassling the object of his affection with behavior that was becoming plainly offensive. Because of this it is hard to see how he could win Stephanies affection let alone anyone else's. If anything he appears a manic depressive and in need of psychiatric help and if the film had ended with him sitting in the corner of a padded cell drooling from the side of his mouth having completely retreated into his much preferred dream state fulltime it might have been entirely appropriate.What the film does instead is leave you with the possibility tho slim that Stephanie will be attracted to his fragility thereby allowing Stephane to achieve his stated objective however messily he went about it and despite his obvious social dysfunction. To me this was a cop out and unrealistic. Sure it's one of many possibilities most of them unhappy for Stephane but it's those last few scenes that your understanding of the film as a whole hangs on. My reaction was one of annoyance and frustration.".

	schema:reviewBody "Michel Gondry the visually creative giant behind some of MTV's most stylistically innovative music videos and more recently the driving force behind his and script writer extraordinare Charlie Kaufman's brilliant Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind finally makes his solitary debut choosing to write and direct this surrealist tale of dreams reality and the lines some people walk between them. Fans of the visual virtuoso must have been anticipating Gondry's official declaration as auteur for some time having salivated for a decade now as this French director continually pushed the envelope for lucky musicians.I'm sure many saw The Science of Sleep as a proving ground that would help fans see if the eccentric director would be able to parlay all of these visually creative aspects into a more cohesive cinematic experience. By and large the dangerously imaginative movie succeeds on it's own though there are a few discrepancies to note. First it does feel that much of the way the movie is shot in particular the scenes which stay most grounded in reality do mimic a lot of the production values that gave Eternal Sunshine such a realistically detached value to it. Ditto with much of the streamofconsciousness script at times heavily emulating the flow Gondry and Kaufman helped pioneer the first time around. The actual plot is decidedly lowkey and for good reason though at times Gondry does struggle to fill all of his microcosms with relevance. To say these values remain derivative and do not completely complement the whimsically dark storytelling taking place here though would be to forsake the fantastic and singular joy that the Science of Sleep is.Regardless of it's constant French avantgarde noodling and despite the obvious parallels to Gondry's previous film Science remains a nearmasterwork punctuated by the intoxicating rhythm of it's perceptive dream sequences often edited with the most keen of intentions. Whether viewers will stay immersed throughout the fantasy bleedin will be up to ones subjective threshold and ones ability to thrive off of the magically deranged pacing that hints at underlying psychological relevance. Gondry's masterful pacing does not disappoint culminating with the brilliant evolution of the script's supremely playful tone into something much more serious.Of course the sincere material would only be at home when recited by actors of a pure heart and in this Gondry also excels by casting two leads who do everything they can to involve us in the realist fantasy. Gael Garca Bernal always doing well to pick good material finally slips into an English language role with the ease I would expect and the luminous yet subdued Charlotte Gainsbourg radiates the earthly kind of magic that this film is all about. People with strict objective agendas stay clear anyone else who still uses an inkling of their imagination please dive in. It may not be perfect but Science is surely one of the most unique and perceptive fantasies to merge with the mass consciousness in years.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE SCIENCE OF SLEEP Michael Gondry  FranceItaly 2006.There's something magical about this wonderfully sweet romantic fantasy by Michael Gondry. A love story emotionally rich with dazzling dreamlike visuals done the oldfashioned way with simple stopmotion animation techniques. We see Stphane flying above his cardboard imagination of Paris and later we see him sitting in the bathtub full of silver cellophane. It's Gondry's first film as writerdirector after a twofeature partnership with Philip Kaufman. Not surprisingly it feels a bit Kaufmanesque as Gondry's previous Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind but now dreams have replaced memory. Stphane can hardly make the distinction between his own dreamworld and the outside reality and doesn't know a whole lot about love. For no apparent reason he lies to Stphanie that he lives next door to her which results in some comic situations. He also wants to be an inventor and so he gives her his 3D glasses 'but the world is already in 3D' she replies. He is a manchild unable to adjust himself to the everyday realities of the outside world. Ultimately the relationship between Stphane and Stphanie ends in a kind of stalemate and so does the film itself. How do you end a film? With most films I can't wait till it's over but here it seemed like the last twenty minutes got lost in the editing room. A very abrupt ending. The film might have a bit of an unsatisfying resolution but Gondry creates magic here. It's the dreamworld that makes this rise above the level of just another romantic comedy and it's funny very funny. The breathtaking stopmotion animation is a feast for the eye and the sets and creations are wonderful to look at. The film had me in a permanent smile.Camera Obscura  810".

It hits the mind and pulls the heart strings on so many levels  while still managing to make a whole cinema audience laugh loudly frequently and unreservedly. Michel Gondry has created something really wonderful here the kind of film worth seeing again and again.The Science of Sleep is trying to do something quite different to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind but there's definitely something of the same feel. Certainly the level of exquisite artistry is comparable but maybe it's also the amount of care and sincerity that has been invested in the inner lives of the film's characters.This directorwriter never sells anyone short say by using a character or situation just as a plot or artistic device. Instead the characters' growth and flow of ideas are what build the story always treated with a touch that is loyal and genuine. You begin to feel loyal to them yourself to have a sense of them as very real people in whose ultimate wellbeing you have a very involving stake.That's all I really need say about the film though I'd point out that the few negative comments I've seen below really weren't worth reading. Reservations I can understand as everyone's different right? but these naysayers are clearly emotionally intellectually and artistically stunted. Most likely they can't comprehend a work that doesn't fit their prescribed and limited framework for film appreciation  the sort which demands that progression be made through exactly the crude plot and character devisings which this film avoids. In fact I don't think the Science of Sleep even studiously avoids them  it is simply a mile above such considerations. The film works on every level  and if you're even halfway to normal with your own emotional development you'll get what's good about this.".

	schema:reviewBody "The French have a way with films that tinker with reality fantasy illusions and delusions and the result of those traits have produced some of the most exciting and avant garde films ever made. Michel Gondry has inherited the mantle from Cocteau Resnais etc and runs with it in this charming little diversion of a film THE SCIENCE OF SLEEP.Gondry is primarily a visual artist and tells his stories in a visual manner but that is not to say his stories are superficial or trivial he has a preoccupation with the thin line between reality and nonreality between dream and diurnal creativity and it is this space that occupies his mind his pen his camera and his mission in this little tale.Stphane Miroux the enormously gifted dedicated and hunky Gael Garca Bernal is a true 'artist' a young man whose father is Mexican and whose mother is French and he has entered Paris to begin a job his mother Christine MiouMiou assures him is creative it actually is a boring restricting graphic design outfit though populated by some zany confrres including Guy played beautifully by Alain Chabat who allows to run with his idea of publishing a calendar whose months are pictured by world disasters! that at first defeats Stphane's artistic integrity.Stphane dreams and in his dream life he is a TV host who can make the most impossible things happen. His work frustrations push him further into his dream world and he finds it more real than the mundane life of daytime. He lives across the hall from an equally delicate artistic mind named Stphanie the always fine and adroit Charlotte Gainsbourg who is caught up in her own dream world of making little boats of paper and water of cellophane and clouds of cotton. The two begin a touch and run relationship that gradually develops into a mutual appreciation for each other's idiosyncrasies  in the best of all possible ways.Gondry peppers his script with makebelieve constructions testy conversations and some very funny and naughty observations that he tosses off with aplomb. Gael Garca Bernal infuses this strange role with a facile use of three languages English French and Spanish and with a tender sense of comic timing and sensual magnetism that makes him irresistible. He carries the fantasy on his capable shoulders allowing us to love his bizarrely complex character at every quirky turn. He is an actor who takes more risks than most and is destined to be one of our more important actors as he continues to gain attention.For those who need sharp margins of linearity and borders between reality and fantasy this film may confuse and frustrate. But for viewers who love 'taking rides through dream fantasies on felt horses' this film is sure to please. Grady Harp".

It is a nice little film about the inability of today's cinema to cope with the complexity of what's going on around us whether awake or asleep when it is not action holywood nor conversation around the family table the French exception. So it deals with the simple intimate childhoodanchored sweet oh how sweet feelings turning them into an AmeliePoulainesque kind of thing. The little innocent Mexican arrives in Paris and meets his coemployees a trio of Frenchies one of the most pathetic elements in the film  was Gondry trying to demonstrate contemporary French Cinema's bad bad state and taste?. He keeps the job which sucks why??? just so as he can keep having nightmares? and then meets his neighbor Charlotte Gainsbourg only good thing that ever happened to the film  i mean her performance. Only people who do not dream at all on their own or people who have started going to the cinema a fortnight ago and only watch post let's say  2000 films can enjoy this film and find it captivating or convincing or whatever... c'est dommage...

	schema:headline " The Science of Sleek";
	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes I wish that film could be whisked back to the days of growing and learning and experimenting such as it was during the 60s and for the most part 70s. I want to see real directing not this stereotypical alittlebitforeveryone stuff that most filmmakers excel at these days. I want uniqueness I want to see chances taken I want risks. And the only thing worse than not being the opposite of that is to mock it to play with it a little bit and throw it back into the heap consisting of every other misbegotten tactic of cinema.Sometimes I hope and yearn that film could go back to the way it used to be but seeing A Science of Sleep I realize now that that hope can permutate into the dream it really is and die along with all my other fantasies. This is a story about love is it not? At least that's what I got out of it. So then where the hell is it? I never once saw a connection between the main characters Stephane and Stephanie and isn't that ironic their having similar names. Is the average person that ignorant that they can be bought and sold over a few sentimental stopmotion animation scenes? The characters spend an entire hour and a half screwing around doing this and that making some sort of a craft that makes no sense they on cue the third act commences break apart and then complain about it the entire time failing to mention that they never had anything going in the first place. The only one of them actually feeling anything is Stephane and I still have my doubts as to whether that character is sane or not he spends the entire movie in these little capricious dream sequences where he truly is allowed to interact with his artistic abilities. He's like a child forced into a relationship. Anyway Stephanie plays with him toys with his emotions why? How should I know? The screenwriter never bothered to delve into that lake of complication. So man and woman meet have fun argue and then part. Very basic. Someone may say that that is love. Well I think I have a moderate idea of love in real life anyway and I think I remember there having something to do with rational thought and communication not just me waking up with a freezer on my bed.The script lacks that's the obvious problem. But what instigates my anger even more so is how people actually have the audacity to compare this film with Eternal Sunshine. Well that script was a little better than this ones's. Hmmm I wonder why. Could it be because the former was written by Charlie Kaufman one of the greatest contemporary screenwriters out there? Perhaps that's why the characters in E Sunshine have personalities and the conflicts are pursued realistically while still maintaining that sense of surrealism.And yeah the animation was good. But not that good. Slow down on your exultant praising for a moment and allow a quick coherent thought to flash through your mind. First the animation in this film is basic. Don't get me wrong it's perfect. A dream is not better personified than with cutout corrugated cities. But its not remarkable its not a breakthrough to technology.That's why cgi is so prominent because it appears on screen to be more realistic. One movie in a while can get away with old school antics but don't expect awards. They were already handed out in the 60s.OK I've badmouthed the writing the amazing animation now what. Ahh the directing. Michael Gondry could you please pick one a film for art fanatics or a film for the masses because a combination of the two is such an erroneous decision. The only film I've ever seen complete such a task is Napoleon Dynamite. I don't know how it happened apparently neither does Jared Hess check out Nacho Libre or rather don't and we don't have enough time available to delve into that particular subject.The formula is set up everything falls into place it's a serendipitous love film set in France. It's so professional. Finally a comeback of serious artistic filmmakers. Or so I thought. Turns out Gondry was just pulling our chains. Truthfully he has no more creativity. He's a oneidea kind a guy. A onetrick pony. Like so many other modern directors Shyamalan Singer etc. he's out of tricks. He likes to put up facades for his films make them look avant garde or something and then pull the cloth down revealing...another average flick. Almost like a joke. And everyone laughs. But me.Why? Why can't you keep a straight face the entire time Gondry? No. Old cinema isn't a joke. It's magic. It's a different world. It's surreal not corny and tempting surrealism like this weekendcapitalism fostered garbage. Is that it? Is he afraid that if he tries something new attempts nonconformity something actually differing from the last piece he made he'll be ostracized? Cut off from the other bigshots rolling in all that boxoffice sludge ripped out of theatre payer's pockets? The key is to not let the name grow bigger than the work. There's a line to be crossed and I think we the inexorably decreasing few who actually care for film as an art just lost another potential candidate.This film isn't unique it isn't new it's clich. Everything about it is clich. It's all just hidden with indiestyle handheld cameras and cheap french accents to catch your attention for a brief moment just enough to take your nine bucks and kick you back out onto the curb seduce you into that apartment and reveal the man within the closet. And that man wants a drink.".

	schema:headline " Remarkable achievement";
	schema:reviewBody "Gondry's latest quirk is in many ways a furthering of themes he touched in Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind a film i enjoyed immensely. As in 'sunshine' the movies narrative follows a male perspective in a lovestory but the difference is that where the latter traced the breakup of a couple in real life and dreaming 'science' follows the clumsy courtship of Bernal's character. I found the premise of the character intriguing. He suffers from a sleep disorder that makes it difficult for him to separate dream from reality. Thus when we follow his perspective Gondry has to make the flow of the movie natural as he jumps from dream to reality. This is achieved with many of the same techniques he used in sunshine. Breakups in logic dialog established characters showing up in places they don't belong as well as using dreamlike settings as a contrast to the normal real life environs. The pure directorial skill required to make these shifts plausible and natural without losing the viewers connection with the plot is baffling. The story covers a sixmonth period this necessitates of course some jumps in time. Again i find the film close to perfect as the editing is fantastically timed. I found myself accepting everything as the flow of the movie kept me prepared for anything.Add to this that the film is beautiful. Aestetically stunning in some parts. It uses a wide variety of kitsch to keep the images and narrative spiced to perfection. As for the acting Bernal makes his character come to life as the sympathetic but slightly annoying young artist in love. He becomes all the more believable because he in no way tries to seduce the audience like some other leading men but trusts that the script is strong enough to make us identify with and care about the character. He does a splendid job. As for the rest of the cast Gainsbourg in particular they all have to vary their roles for the real life scenes in which they play natural characters and the dreaming scenes in which they play characters orchestrated by Bernals subconscious and not one of them falter in doing this. All in all phenomenal work. All that said i take make hat off as i salute one of the masters of modern cinema.".

I was thinking along the lines of Eternal Sunshine but this is different. The acting is wonderful. I was sucked into the story and wanting everything to go right for the main characters. This film is great and everyone needs to see it. Though it's french with subtitles at different times English is also being spoken by the actors in the film. And if you have a problem reading subtitles train yourself to get better. As a brief summary Stephane has a vivid imagination and is mostly caught up in his alternate world sleep.

	schema:reviewBody "This was quite simply the most painful movie I have ever sat through. I have never taken hallucinogenics but I can imagine that watching this movie is akin to overdosing. The premise sounded interesting on paper but the execution was completely absurd. Within 10 minutes of the movie's opening my fianc and I were looking for knitting needles to stick in our eyes. The ridiculous dream sequences practically took over the entire movie and should have been reduced to total about 10 minutes so that the REAL characters and relationships could have been explored. I could not identify with or care for any of the characters  they were as humane as plastic puppets and as dimensional as a piece of paper. Perhaps if you are one of those people who hates life and wants to escape everything that this world is made of by suspending yourself in a ridiculously executed cartoon fantasy where water is made of cellophane cars are made of corrugate and stuffed animals talk and dance you might enjoy it. But if you are accustomed to smart movies with realistic characters who draw you in and bring out your emotion then do yourself a ginormous favor and run run fast away from this train wreck.".

The dream sequences are supposed to be impressive. The first three sequences are OK although you have to adhere to the sixties hippie low budget super 8 look. Then it becomes incredibly repetitive the same cardboard stopmotion animation over and over again with cotton bowls for clouds and cellophane for water. That's as poetic and imaginative as it ever gets. When the end credits finally roll you're left wondering... was that an ending? Did I miss something? You didn't.

In that sense it's much like Donnie Darko except that it is clearer that the events are really not some weird mystical SFfantasy happenings I always hated that interpretation of Donnie Darko.The accuracy of the portrayals is amazing. My wife occasionally sleeptalks and sleepwalks and I can get her to describe her dreams to me exactly the way Stephane does and the distortions in names reality and personality are eerily similar to what is shown in the film. I've had close friends with paranoid schizophrenia and the unclear divide between reality and delusion depicted is absolutely spot on.However it is the heartwarming and heart wrenching story and strong performances that lift this above a mere documentary. By the end we do understand Stephane and appreciate Stephanie and how she is able to connect with him. By using the unfiltered fanciful POV of Stephane to tell the story we don't see him as some weird creepo but as someone not that much different from ourselves. This is one of the best and most intelligent films I have seen in a very long time and merits repeated viewings.".

Directed and written by the same director Michael Gondry and exploring the same premise of what goes on in the mind SOS I kinda like this is nevertheless simple and familiar. You'll recognize right away a lovable introvert individual with difficulties in expressing his emotions. You'll also likely embrace the familiar theme on reaching out empathizing and connecting.The plot is simplicity itself about a young man who since childhood had difficulties in differentiating dream from reality. We see him returning home after growing up in Mexico to Paris where his mother has arranged a job for him to start a new life. He still sleeps in his old room with his feet protruding form the end of the bed from calves down. In the work front there's the usual group of supporting cast made up of boss and coworkers serving as a diversion. The focus however is on his relationship with a quiet girl who although not as introvert as he needs to do a little reaching out herself. That relationship as recited in my summary line is short and sweet for the most part.Stephane and Stephanie yes! are played by two wonderful actors with equally wonderful chemistry. Gael Garcia Bernal Pedro Almodovar's favourite actor has become even more popular globally since The motorcycle diaries. Charlotte Gainsbourg is essentially French although she has appeared in 21 grams. Not a conventional ravishing beauty she has a very attractive quiet charm that you are unlikely to forget if you have watched any of her movies such as Lemming. Their roles in SOS might have been tailoredmade for the two of them.One interesting thing is that while this is a French movie happening in Paris 90 per cent of the dialogue is in English as Stephane's mother tongue is Spanish and he speaks little French.Although SOS does not have the complexity and soaring imagination of Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind it does have some nice touches of its own. The one I like best is a scene when she throws up to the ceiling some light cottonlike substance imagining them to be clouds. For a puzzling moment he dashes towards the piano and bangs out various chords very purposefully. It's not easy to suppress a smile when he finally hits upon the right chord when you see all the clouds suspending from the ceiling.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the novel by Claire Cook the plot centers around a kindergarten teacher named Sarah Nolan Lane a divorce who swears off men after a devastating divorce. However her closeknit IrishAmerican family decides to 'help' her along by signing her up for a number of online dating programs. She then finds herself caught between two men as she starts seeing the father of one her students Mulroney and a man who she meets through the dating service who seems far too perfect Cusack.Must Love Dogs is a familiar yet enjoyable romantic comedy that should keep you entertained for a while. The plot is nothing new and there are many clichs to be found here yet the film is still funny. The film works well because of its two stars John Cusack and Diane Lane. They both give good funny performances and they have nice chemistry together. If you enjoy watching these actors on screen then you should like the film. The supporting cast is also strong except for Dermot Mulroney. The good thing is that Dermot is not in the film very much so he does not suck out too much from the picture. This is his third film from 2005 and he was horrible in every one of them yet he keeps getting hired. The rest of the supporting cast consists of Elizabeth Perkins Christopher Plummer Stockard Channing and Julie Gonzalo.A few things are keeping me from rating the film higher. One of the reasons is of course Dermot Mulroney. The film also has a few annoying clichs that are hard to ignore. There were also a few bad stereotypes that were not needed and they were not funny at all. Even though the film does have its share of funny moments it becomes dull from time to time. The film for the most part is safe and this movie could have easily been an episode of Friends or something. That does not mean it's a bad film it's just a little sitcomish. If you do give the film a shot don't take it too seriously and try to have a little fun with it. In the end Must Love Dogs is a surprisingly enjoyable romantic comedy. Rating 710".

The movie IS somewhat clichd but the dogs are very cute as are the kids  if slightly precocious at times.

The sisters are more realistric  mine could be just as mean under the guise of honesty and just as meddling. Christopher Plummer as the Dad was a shock  esp with Irish accent  but Stockard Channing plays the girlfriend very well  mature aged vanity and all.I liked this movie  a pleasant way to end a Monday night...";

	schema:reviewBody "John Cusack and Diane Lane two of the most interesting actors working today make this somewhat predictable romantic comedy work. They flesh out characters from a pretty weak script and make you want to know those characters better.This film is not rocket science but if you expect to enjoy a bit of romantic fluff you will not be disappointed. The only frustrating thing is knowing how much more both of these fine actors is capable of. Given a strong script and inventive director can you imagine what a great film they could make together?For this viewer the weakest part of the script was the twodimensional nature of some the supporting characters. For example why would a sensitive romantic boat builder like Jake have a stripclubloving sleazy lawyer friend as his only male pal? And while the long suffering younger brother character is amusing and well acted his wife is nonexistent. Also why would the father become a Lothario upon the death of his wife? If he was really a great guy wouldn't he continue to act that way?Also the script never seems sure whether it wants Diane Lane's character to be comical or touching. The montage showing her entering computer dating with a gusto seemed forced  it aimed for a Bridget Jones type breeziness but missed  and the singalong to the Partridge Family theme song scene was downright embarrassing. Thankfully Cusack was not subjected to that scene!All in all a good one to see if you love the leads but don't expect belly laughs. It might leave you a little wistful for a romantic comedy as fresh as Say Anything.... sigh".

Yes it is much of what the reviewers said but John Cusack and Diane Lane were just great to watch play their parts. Just because they've played these types of characters before doesn't mean that the movie is bad to me it means that the characters they play so easily are enjoyable to watch. It was a people movie no exploding cars etc. although there are times I like that too. I particularly like romantic comedies and I will buy this movie the day it comes out on DVD. I might even take a date to it before then. The heart of the characters not the quirky details are really worth the ticket.".

The steering of his own script adaptation was plodding at best only made passable by the spirited and professional performances from the stars Diane Lane and John Cusack. Less surprising is the fact that much of Goldberg's experience comes from television comedy. The irregular cadence of the dialog almost leads the audience to listen for a canned laugh track ironic given one of the character's penchant for poetry. Additionally Goldberg should return his directing credentials for allowing the flat and unflattering interior lighting especially inflicted on Lane. The technical direction would have been more appropriate on a threecamera TV set. Feature release of this film amplifies the shortcomings of the vision behind this work.The sweetness in the film no doubt comes from Claire Cook's novel of the same name. Justice should have been paid to the book by assigning a true film director. There were many futureclassic oneliners loosely strung together with flat dialog more appropriate to the legend of a map. I doubt this was the result that Lane and Cusack expected from the promising elements at the outset of this project but no one can fault their admirable attempts to deliver a heartwarming film.".

A protracted sequence in which the two go hunting for a condom in the middle of the night is just irritating to watch.Frankly I was shocked to read so many raves here on the board  till I realized most were from firsttime posters who were treated to a sneak preview. How did so many of them find their way here I wonder? As for me I don't even recommend renting the eventual DVD. Must Love Dogs is just a big commercial for a particular online dating service.";

I loved the ditzy blonde girl  she was great and reminded me of Cameron Diaz. Diane Lane was great and very sweet nice looking too! and John Cusack stole his scenes with his usual offbeat charisma. Add into the mix other great performances from a support cast including Stockard Channing Elizabeth Perkins Dermot Mulroney and Christopher Plummer and you have a very interesting and entertaining comedy with a lot to recommend it for. A quality piece of entertainment that will have you laughing for sure.".

This is just another movie about a fretting 40ish DWF desperately seeking romance while moping around the house in her pj's. I lost count of how many times someone told Lane you're so beautiful and you deserve so much more. Give me a break! John Cusak is capable of so much more than this neurotic character had to offer. Also if I had such a meddling family I'd put myself up for adoption! Rather than being cute the family force was simply annoying.

Some very clever banter and very funny segments.Some of the plot seemed not credible and off and the overall premise is fairly corny although with some original touches. The kids and animals are adorable and add good color to the movie although Newfies generally slobber a lot. Setting seems to be in a combination of Boston Boulder LA and San Diego with blue collar folks living in modest houses with lavish interiors. Must be nice to be in grad school living in a trailer and driving a BMW M3 convertible.But Diane Lane is utterly winning classy and stunning when she is not rather convincingly looking a little dowdy and aging.Cusak is really on. The chemistry between Cusak and Lane is palpable. To me but not the other three viewers with me a point of lack of credibility was that Lane's character would have any ambivalence or uncertainty toward the Cusak character. The camera loves them both.All of the supporting acting is great particularly Stockard Channing as the brassy girlfriend of the father. That would have been an easy part to leave two dimensional but Channing is nuanceddeep. Elizabeth Perkins is completely credible and engaging as one of the sisters trying to get Diane Lane back into the game after a divorce. Chris Plummer is perfect as the fatherhandsome loving wise and sad. The Lane character's entire family is sweetly supportive and believable.".

And if you think you missed the climax of the movie you didn't there wasn't one. The literature is the movie's major fault  a fatal fault mind you  but the horror doesn't stop there. Oh no. Did Diane Lane forget how to act? Her character is flat and uninspired. She evokes no feelings in the viewers and is a completely disappointing protagonist. So much of the movie revolves around truthful conversations but I think the characters who saw these moments of honesty saw something the audience didn't...sort of reverse irony if you will. The chemistry between Lane and Cusack who I love and wept for in this movie is nonexistent. They come off as a pair of shy awkward teenagers complete with the raging hormones which I'll touch upon in a moment. So there's the bad. What about the good? Well the raging hormones I spoke of inspire a rather amusing chase sequence. And Christopher Plummer descends from the heavens offering us a single likable character. Other than that there's not much good.One word can sum up this movie Awkward. The only reason it rates a 2 is because John Cusack is a beautiful man the appearance of Rizzo served as a PSA to remind me of how I can never let myself go Why Stockard why? and before this movie I never saw a person throw something at a movie screen. So save yourself. I saw this movie so you wouldn't have to. Don't let my sacrifice go to waste.".

We ran to see this one at a sneak preview because I mean really how could they go wrong? John Cusak Diane Lane Christopher Plummer Stockard Channing and Elizabeth Perkins I mean come on wow what a cast!! It's a nobrainer right? Wrong!! This movie should be shown in all Film 101 classes in every credible university to exhibit just how a director or lack thereof can screw up an otherwise promising picture. With only one movie 1989's Dad to his credit director Gary David Goldberg proves why those individuals who are primarily producers should stay producers. This film also proves that good actors by themselves don't make good film making. It takes a team to make a good film and an exceptional team to make an exceptional film. This effort lacks that necessary teamwork.The idea is great. Make a movie about the necessity for divorced individuals to get on with their life. Make a movie about internet dating and how it has infused itself into our everyday lives. Make a movie about family family values family conflict and family unity. All of these things combined should have made for a great feelgood flick. Unfortunately this movie is a mix and match hodgepodge of all of the above. In order for all of those elements to gel into a complete and satisfying piece there simply must be someone at the helm who will guide the process in an intelligent and compassionate fashion otherwise what we end up with is just a collective mess of acting scenes better left on the cutting room floor. It always astounds and will never cease to amaze me how a movie with so many talented actors can be botched. This one is a disaster and it falls squarely on the shoulders of a director who apparently has no vision no heart no soul and no talent.Initially I thought the leads Cusak and Lane had no chemistry and that is certainly a fair assessment. On further review it seems apparent that it wasn't really a lack of chemistry but a lack of cultivating that chemistry. This is evident believe it or not during the closing credits when the two have a short obviously improvised scene and are totally in sync with each other. This smacks of a director who has no feel for what it takes to help the audience know his characters or what it entails to move the audience emotionally so they will even give a rat's bald tail for the characters. The movie is really about family dynamics. It should have been about family dynamics. At the core of the movie is a traditional nuclear family with grown up kids and a widowed father. The family is concerned that one of the siblings Lane is wallowing in self pity over her divorce and should start dating again. So her two sisters decide to put her on an internet dating site and let her take her chances. This is one of those movies where every single funny moment is shown in the promotional material for the film. I found myself sitting there actually waiting for the moments that I remembered from the trailer and ironically when they did come they proved to have been funnier in the trailer then they were in the movie itself. Now that really stinks. I'd like to say that this movie had great potential and with a little tweaking it could have been great blah blah blah but I can't in good conscience say that. Even little snippets of nice performances by the venerable Christopher Plummer and the always ebullient Stockard Channing can't even begin to salvage this catastrophe. It's kind of like a great Robert Altman film shot entirely through a kaleidoscopic lens  nothing seems to be in the right place. Even the final I'm gonna get my man scene falls flat and has no real significance for the viewer. If I was totally frank guess that's not a problem here the dog stole the show. Movies of this genre must have heart they must have deeply developed characterizations and most of all they absolutely must give the moviegoer a cohesive sense of family. Otherwise we simply don't care.The bottom line is don't waste your time or your money on this flick. Go and rent Parenthood or Cheaper by the Dozen or Tivo an old episode of The Waltons or Family if you want to enjoy and experience a real family flick. What a waste.".

We ran to see this one at a sneak preview because I mean really how could they go wrong? John Cusak Diane Lane Christopher Plummer Stockard Channing and Elizabeth Perkins I mean come on wow what a cast!! It's a nobrainer right? Wrong!! This movie should be shown in all Film 101 classes in every credible university to exhibit just how a director or lack thereof can screw up an otherwise promising picture.

Did they bother reading the script? I realize it is their wont to make any film they wish but surely the likes of Lane Cusack and Mulroney are not wanting for good scripts.I don't mind predictable scripts  and romantic comedies by their very nature are awfully predictable  if they're good offer some laughs a few nice moments a few scenes that ring true. Unfortunately there isn't a single moment in Must Love Dogs that even vaguely resembles anything real. There's not a single genuine character or an honest moment in this entire film.Everything about this film screams movie moment from the family gettogethers to the plot twists from the interfamily conversations to the dialogue between Lane and Cusack. Even the minor characters are moviemade. Doubt me? Take a look at the guy behind the deli at the supermarket. Is there anything even vaguely honest or real about his scenes with Lane?Writerdirector Gary David Goldberg  who should stick to TV where he's good  never bothers to introduce anything that is even slightly unpredictable to his story. He follows all the standard rules of the romanticcomedy genre and seems quite happy hitting the marks without any adding sense of novelty.We have a woman  Diane Lane deserves so much better than this  who has two male interests. Genre rules say one of the men will eventually turn out to be a rotter. Well guess what?A talented cast is wasted is this utter waste of time.".
