He accused the film of being nothing more than propaganda and he justified it by saying that the night time satellite pictures of North Korea which show essentially North Korea being almost entirely black whereas South Korea is full of lights would be doctored and fraudulent. Well this is plainly and demonstrably wrong. North Korea IS almost entirely black as compared to South Korea or any other industrialized country. You can see that on all sorts of satellite photos from space agencies all over the world and even on pictures taken by astronauts from the International Space Station. If you don't believe that just google ISS030E25412.jpg and click on the link to the actual NASA page that shows on the first result page. Scroll down on the NASA page to the ISS night time flight labeled China to Australia. You can see a screenshot showing NK in dark and SK full of lights and you can also watch the movie taken from aboard the ISS as it flies during the night over the Korean peninsula the video is fascinating and worth watching anyway also check out the other videos especially those with the polar lights or thunderstorms. Amazing!. I would normally provide a link but that seems to be not allowed here.And dear Dave Those lights in the sea around SK are also not doctored and can be seen on lots of satellite images. Those are simply oil rigs in the yellow sea which you can see from space the same way you can see the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexiko.It is really ironical that you stopped watching the documentary and wrote your first review because you were convinced that those photos cant be right while it is you who is wrong about that.  As to the documentary itself Well it is perhaps overdramatizing a bit but it is still worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "Firstly I understand how many people will feel after watching this movie. That another liberal agenda is being played up and the end to nuclear armament is just asking for terrorism to advance within our country you couldn't be more wrong. Being in the military for almost ten years it was my experience that most folks get three things wrong when they think about someone using such a device in our country. One they believe that it comes from a country. This kind of terrorism has no country and has no head to govern it merely opportunity. The idea that you can nuke them back gets a little complicated when the bomb may come from a diplomatically friendly country or even from within our own. Two that such a device is complicated and needs teams of people and money to create not so. Such a device can be crudely manufactured with a lead pipe 4gm of enriched plutonium and a shotgun shell. The devices themselves do not need to be complex to kill several thousand people and the people setting them off probably have no qualms about killing themselves in the process. A crudely made machine can be made from almost anything you can find in a hardware store and those items are so everyday that they will not raise any FBI flags. Lastly Three that there is a solution to such a problem. There isn't one. While the film makes a proud gesture at telling us that all we need to do is this... That is a pipe dream and besides we have gone to far down the path of destruction to make it any better. So in all of this what might be the way to make any of these problems go away. Again I'm sorry to say nothing. We now have to live in a world where this might happen any day at any time. The only thing we can do is hope that we find better ways of detecting potential threats than by clandestinely stumbling into them. The movie is a gem in terms of showing that the human part of these weapons is the most dangerous part of them. With respect to our last president he finger that could push the button was also attached to the brain of a recovering alcoholic judgment should be reserved for the viewer and their experience but keep in mind that these things however embellished are real and are waiting right within and outside your door.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I was a youngster I was keenly aware of the eminent threat of nuclear disaster that could wipe us out at any moment. We had drills in school where we would duck under our desks and run away from the window as if that could protect us from a nuclear blast. But once the cold war ended the idea that an Atomic or Hydrogen Bomb could destroy our cities or end our lives was not a concern. Even when the news reported that Iran was trying to become a nuclear power my anxiety was not raised and I never thought that my life the safety of my family or our country's well being was in jeopardy. That is until I saw this documentary film written and directed by Lucy Walker and produced and edited by a crackerjack experienced team. They skillfully build the film around the words of John F. Kennedy who proclaimed in a speech in 1961 Every man woman and child lives under a nuclear sword of Damocles hanging by the slenderest of threads capable of being cut at any moment by accident or miscalculation or by madness. The filmmakers then show us dramatic movie clips of such events as near nuclear accidents where five of six safety devices failed lost atomic weapons both American and Russian governments misinterpreting data and being seconds away from launching a retaliatory nuclear strike against an imagined attack on their country. There are interviews with former CIA agent Valerie Plume Mikhail Gorbachev Jimmie Carter Tony Blair and Robert MacNamara in the last interview before he died which all discuss the serious dangers that nuclear weapons pose today. The film shows how easy it is to make a nuclear bomb how destructive it can be and how terrorists are very hot to make one and use it. The film pulls no punches and certainly can scare the living daylights out of you. The goal of this documentary and the various sponsors of the film are encompassed in the title Countdown to Zero with the subtitle  Demand Zero. It is worth noting that JFK followed up the quote mentioned above with the statement The weapons of war must be abolished before they abolish us. The filmmakers believe that if the people all over the world demand nuclear disarmament it will happen. This documentary certainly makes their point and one of their principle producers Participant Media makes suggestions on their web site httpwww.takepart.comcountdowntozero as to how to get this conversation started. This film will also eventually be shown on the History Channel which is one of the backers of it and I also hope it will end up in many schools to pass on this message to new generations who will have to finish the job of nuclear disarmament.".

But once the cold war ended the idea that an Atomic or Hydrogen Bomb could destroy our cities or end our lives was not a concern.

Since the cold wars of the 1950's '60's and 1980's the concept of nuclear threat has dissipated in the public view. It is no longer a focus of media attention. And yet whilst the material Uranium plutonium necessary to complete a nuclear weapon is difficult to attain it is certainly acknowledged that middleeastern terrorists have absolutely attempted to purchase such raw materials.Lucy Walker's film uses some fantastic archival footage to paint a picture of the threat to our world that still exists. She managed to employ some highly notable talking heads to maintain integrity in her argument Mikhail Gorbachev Tony Blair Robert McNamara. She manages to highlight how easy it is to smuggle such devastating materials into countries. This is a powerful documentary however the threat of such an attack is so limited that the film seems just too late to create such intrinsic paranoia I mean does a scared person or country  i.e. the backwaters of the USA  really need more to worry about? The threat just isn't as urgent as say in the 1980's when such films posing the question what if...? where broadcast on television such as the frightening Threads 1983 made and broadcast by the BBC. It is still a good documentary with some interesting 'facts' and should certainly be watched by anyone interested in modern history.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I do NOT know how reviewing a documentary can contain a spoiler. Having said that Countdown to Zero is a documentary about nuclear war directed by Lucy Walker. It is one worth seeing to remind us exactly what the destructive capacity of a nuclear explosive device means. One has to see it to really understand it and to impress upon us the reality of the effects of nuclear war for those who might either not know of Hiroshima and Nagasaki have never seen pictures of it or if they have seen it have forgotten about it. After viewing this documentary it makes the storm cloud under which mankind sits difficult to forget.The documentary retells the history of the construction of the nuclear bomb during World War II Oppenheimer's horror of what he and others had accomplished through the Manhattan Project the science of it and of course the attempts however minimal at nuclear non proliferation treaties signed by the United States and Russia throughout the decades. The documentarian interviews a host of experts on nuclear proliferation including Valerie Pflame the woman who worked for the CIA exploring the link of terrorism to nuclear weapons whom Rove Cheney and their henchmen in the Bush administration outed as well as Mikhail Gorbachev Tony Blair the late Robert MacNamara and others including profound statements by Ronald Reagan John Kennedy and Barack Obama.The minutiae of the historical facts behind the building of the nuclear bomb although interesting are not what staggers me. What staggers me is the fact that the US Russia and seven other countries have the capacity now as I write this to annihilate life on earth many times over in a matter of seconds and how relatively easy it could be done whether by mistake terrorist attempts at purchasing andor stealing nuclear material smuggling nuclear devices into ports or simply bad policy  VERY bad policy and how close we have come in the past to having that happen.Moreover it is astounding the relative ease of creating a nuclear device IF one has the appropriate materials and how many have already attempted such a thing including A.Q. Kahn the hero of Pakistan's nuclear weapon program. Nuclear weapons in the hands of unstable nation states like Pakistan are a clear and present danger. A destabilized Middle East created by the Iraq War is a threat. A nuclear device either secured on the black market by terrorists or possessed by rogue states like North Korea which does have access to nuclear material or Iran which wants to have access to it is a doomsday scenario. It would take but a single mistake or malfeasance to propel the planet and man on it to extinction.The documentary catapults the viewer into the reality of a nuclear explosion with views of the flash point evaporation of people and miles of destruction to everything near the blast as well as the destruction from the ensuing tornado like wind and radiation poisoning that follows as the blast eradicates everything. It is a mind numbing experience but one which I believe is necessary for all to see. The horror of it is beyond the power of human imagination to truly comprehend. Man in his genius could be the genius behind his own demise. That is the irony and that is the fear.Zero nuclear weaponry world wide is the goal but who do we trust to pursue it? This documentary in my opinion is a must see for all who care about the preservation of life on earth for its own sake and for the sake of the generations which come after us. The earth is a gift the beauty of which we must not squander for any reason. Let us hope everyone else thinks that way as well.".

Former CIA covert operations officer Valerie Plame WilsonCountdown to Zero is as apocalyptic as An Inconvenient Truth Al Gore's documentary on global warming It is fearmongering enough that it hurts the effort to bring a necessary return to Cold War thinking. Countdown to Zero is single minded in its effort to have zero nuclear weapons of which there are more than 23000 in the world. When the documentary arrives at calling for a popular movement by which President Kennedy admitted he was influenced it loses some credibility. No amount of popular demand will for instance change Osama bin Laden's resolve to exact the deaths of millions of Americans should he gain the necessary ingredients. The documentary's point can't be denied Nuclear proliferation is so possible now that it seems almost impossible to stop it. The sloppy Russian storage of enriched uranium and plutonium is scary. Although over a hundred countries have disavowed nuclear weapons hundreds like the US and Russia jealously retain them and some sell the theory if not the ingredients.In a film almost devoid of light moments the sometimes amusing Boris Yeltsin in 1995 inadvertently showed how serendipity can be a force in our favor. He questioned if the US had launched a missile toward Russia even though his advisors said it had. He prevailed Russia did not retaliate and the world discovered that only a scientific rocket had been launched. Whew!Countdown to Zero makes a manipulative point by showing people in the street calling for zero weapons. Where are those opposed to zero? Most of us agree to a total ban except those securityminded who know deterrence is still a trump card impressive to diplomats and terrorists. While this documentary adds a little to the race to disarm it lacks the balance a fair documentary should have. But then Al Gore and Michael Moore haven't been accused of being balanced either and they both live in nice houses. Fox News abandoned its balancing act long ago in the face of soaring ratings. Who said life is fair? or balanced?".

While this documentary adds a little to the race to disarm it lacks the balance a fair documentary should have. But then Al Gore and Michael Moore haven't been accused of being balanced either and they both live in nice houses. Fox News abandoned its balancing act long ago in the face of soaring ratings. Who said life is fair? or balanced?";

	schema:reviewBody "This documentary is based and constructed around one quote by John Fitzgerald Kennedy in his address before the General Assembly of the United Nations on September 25 1961Today every inhabitant of this planet must contemplate the day when this planet may no longer be habitable. Every man woman and child lives under a nuclear sword of Damocles hanging by the slenderest of threads capable of being cut at any moment by accident or miscalculation or by madness. The weapons of war must be abolished before they abolish us.The logic of the film is simple. We have' more than twenty thousand nuclear devices in the world in the hands of a very small number of countries and thus in the hands of machines that control them military personnel that manages the machine and political personnel that controls the military personnel that controls the machines that control the nuclear devices. All along that command line individuals can make the wrong evaluation of a situation take the wrong decision on the basis of that wrong evaluation and within 20 to 30 minutes it will have happened one city or more will have been destroyed and within a few more minutes retaliation will come. And once it is started it cannot be stopped. There is no comeback no turnback nor stepback. In that command line we just need an accident caused by some mechanical failure or some miscalculation brought up by the misinterpretation of some data provided by the machines or some madness or let's say some mental derangement of one actor in that chain of command. The film provides several instances of close to the brink situations that occurred over the years. Evaluation of the damage in the case of one nuclear weapon on one big city in the world is just overdramatic and seems to only play on fear in the audience. If the public is only motivated by fear then there is no hope.Hope can only come if the public the vast wide general public is convinced we have to get rid of nuclear weapons not because they are afraid but because of positive reasons like the fact humanity means life means creative development means continued progress and nuclear weapons both possession and use are none of these not life not creative development not continued progress. We could also develop some positive ethical arguments going the same way provided we clearly see the difference between nuclear energy and nuclear weapons. Just like nuclear power can be used in nuclear submarines or in nuclear ships it may have one day to be used in space travel and not fission but fusion. Not using nuclear energy for weapons is definitely nothing but an ethical decision and the mark of ethical human control of humanity. It is not because the internal combustion engine was used in tanks that we are supposed to ban the internal combustion engine all cars and many other applications. It is not because some planes are military bombers that we are supposed to ban air travel.That's the first shortcoming of this film nuclear energy is not clearly differentiated from nuclear weapons and yet only the French images project the confusion by stating NON AU NUCLAIRE No Nuclear meaning the rejection of both nuclear energy and weapons though in fact in the mind of the French people who put forward this motto the Greens it is nuclear energy they have in mind. The images from all other countries and the interviews always target nuclear weapons. But it would be clear to say that nuclear energy is another can of worms and these worms might be earth worms very useful worms for agriculture gardening and hence surviving hunger. The second shortcoming is the very ambiguous message about terrorism and about proliferation. The film insists with images and long sequences on the Islamic danger of Pakistan who has nuclear weapons  supposedly thanks to the Chinese though we do not know where the Chinese got the technology from the Soviets maybe?  and who sells the blue print as much as the technology to anyone who wants to pay. The Pakistani bomb is called the Islamic Nuclear Bomb and it is at once connected to Al Qaeda and Iran and allusions to more Muslim countries in the Middle East or the Arab world are added. Nothing is said about the proliferation of nuclear weapons to India the Hindu Bomb etc. and where it could have come from  the Soviets I guess? And still along that line there are a few elements about North Korea still under the rule of Kim the Second not yet Kim the Third. This presentation is absolutely biased and debatable. And what about France Great Britain and Israel?Terrorism is a problem but we have other forms of terrorism than Islamic terrorism even today. Terrorism has causes and to only speak of containing and controlling it is a waste of time since it will bring no solution to the real causes. And by the way how did the apartheid South Africa manage to get nuclear fuel to be able to build nuclear weapons at a time when a total embargo was imposed onto this country for anything military? And the film is a little bit short on the fact that there are an unevaluated and definitely uncontrolled amount of Highly Enriched Uranium and Plutonium running loose on the planet's black market enough to produce thousands of nuclear weapons of various categories from a dirty bomb to a real nuclear weapon. And this black market can only exist because of the diamond and other gems black market because of the uncontrolled speculative financial market and the vast international financial laundering machine through and via the various fiscal paradises and tax havens.To be seen widened and discussed as much as possible.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU".

An urgent call crafted in the film genre for reduction and elimination of nuclear weapons around the globe. The threat has fragmented slightly to also encompass global nuclear terrorism another risk dealt with at length in the film. It takes surprising twists following closely upon the history and facts of the issues that have brought us the nuclear age we live in today. The film is neutral candid cold unblinking fair and true to the intensity of the obvious threats it builds continuously from their facts and anecdotes of the past and present conception in Oppenheimers brain the horrendous use of bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki a trail of broken treaties missed opportunities diffused and decentralized agendas near misses persistent threats of terrorism and failed visions of the nuclear age. President's John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan have both left legacies in this territory based in their historic action taken toward reducing and eliminating nuclear weapons. Ronald Reagan personally believed that we could reduce nukes during his presidency eliminate them completely and Russian Pres. Mikhail Gorbachev and Pres. Reagan came very close to realizing the dream. JFK also believed strongly in the need to eliminate nukes before they eliminate us. What struck me in the film was how JFK early on in his campaign recounted the time when he first began talking to people about nuclear disarmament he was surprised by how many people cared deeply about the issue and if he'd known earlier about the deep public interest he would have made it a priority much sooner than he did. I thought it was surprising incite from the film an aside because it showed how public opinion more than anything had influenced JFK's opinion on the problem and his policy. The same is true today. It's a deep perhaps covert lesson of the film. Which perhaps goes beyond it. And its important to keep public interest focused on this issue. Its not about scare tactics or party lines but about keeping this issue at the top because that's what gets work done on the problem not only providing the incentive to our politicians to action but the public support they need to make change. That is why I think it is so important for people to see this film because its gotten a lot of attention in the press and the popularity of the film will no doubt unofficially be looked at by our political leaders as possibly one indicator a gage of how important this issue is to us and not only to the people in the U.S. but also worldwide.".

Countdown to Zero uses facts and expert opinions at the same time to convince us that nuclear weapons are well bad. With gather facts that director Lucy Walker Waste Land deliver so smoothly with great style Zero is another great documentary that Walker had deliver in 2010. It is scary to see that highly enriched uranium is so easy to access and how terrorists can get it just about anywhere.

Countdown to Zero uses facts and expert opinions at the same time to convince us that nuclear weapons are well bad. With gather facts that director Lucy Walker Waste Land deliver so smoothly with great style Zero is another great documentary that Walker had deliver in 2010. It is scary to see that highly enriched uranium is so easy to access and how terrorists can get it just about anywhere.

But my friends and I decided to check it out and I'm actually glad that I saw it. As silly story that it is and a bit predictable it's a good movie. Most romantic comedies tick me off because they are so predictable and the it's the same formula each time Penelope is close to the same formula but instead adds a fairy tale twist. It has the same moral of the story as most films of having to accept yourself but Christina Ricci made it more charming and lovable. The cast was perfect and all did a great job the looked like they had such a good time bringing this story to life.Penelope seems like the girl that should be living the high life a wealthy family part of royalty but her life isn't perfect. Due to a shallow mistake her ancestor made a witch cursed a face of a pig onto the next born daughter that happens to be Penelope who apparently has to marry a man of royal blood to break the curse. But since she's not the prettiest face on the planet every man runs from her but Max a spy sent by a photographer Max learns that Penelope is a beautiful soul. Penelope runs away though to find her freedom and instead finds herself and how wonderful she truly is.Penelope is a very cute film I was very impressed with the story there were some things I was a little disappointed in like how they just abandoned some characters for no reason. But I think it's hard to fit it in a short film still I think it could have been edited better. But Christina Ricci was a great choice for Penelope even though she's still oddly enough not the ugliest woman I've ever seen with the nose she did a good job and held her own well. Reese Witherspoon small role but she was so charming. I would recommend Penelope it's a cute film and was a lot of fun to watch.710".

If any of you have seen Pumpkin this character would be a polar opposite of that role but just as tongue and cheek and just as much fun.James McAvoy looked great as was his performance. Christina and James had sparks that were believable. The supporting cast was also fun and fanciful. Catherine O'Hara played an excellent zany Mom which was more believable and real in a weird way then her role in Beetle Juice a film I adore. Reese Witherspoon was strong as usual even in this odd small supporting role given her filmography. She looked great as a lower east side character. The only disappointment was Richard E. Grant and not by his doing. There was no chance for him to shine given the part. Something tells me he got lost on the cutting room floor. A zero role for him given his talent.In sum I am one for magic and fables so for me this was a very enjoyable film. I forgot the time which is the best test of all. Bravo!".

Although it wasn't very long it was pleasing to see her in a very different role from others that she took.Honestly I just wanted to comment on this and Reese's funny lines.

	schema:reviewBody "It was only very recently I actually found out about Penelope it was also actually yesterday I did a bit of research and realised how long ago Penelope was made in fact it was made in 2006! When I discovered this I began to worry a bit about seeing it despite a reasonably decent trailer the fact it had been delayed so long meant something was probably wrong with it. Well I saw it tonight and while it isn't perfect the film is still a charming and thoroughly entertaining film. In many ways it reminded me slightly of one of my favourite films of all time Edward Scissorhands. Unfortunately its nowhere near as good but it does have its moments. I actually kind of wish that Tim Burton had got his hands on this movie as this really is the type of film he could make perfect. The film is a nice family friendly flick that while a bit cutesy at times has a genuine heart and some decent performances. Unfortunately the movie does have its problems the ending comes on a bit sudden and the movie does start to struggle slightly in the middle section. But the film is guaranteed to give you a big smile and I definitely feel you can do a lot worse than see this film this half term.Okay lets start with the performances which in my eyes was one of the best aspects of Penelope. Most prominent is Christina Ricci as Penelope the girl with the face of a pig. Okay that last statement is very much an over statement despite her prosthetic pig snout she does not look remotely ugly at all. On the contrary I found her better looking than 80 of the average girls you meet so you never truly believe people will jump out of windows just to get away from her. However Ricci's performance is truly brilliant she's so sweet and innocent and the scenes where she speaks to McAvoy via a mirror is just pitch perfect. It truly displays Ricci's talents and makes you realise how she has come a long way since The Addams Family. James McAvoy pops up at the main man in the movie also displaying an American accent that actually never really suits him. Nevertheless despite his ever so slightly distracting accent he delivers a great performance as he always seems to do. He has great chemistry with Ricci and any scene they share together just sees the screen light up. Catherine O'Hara steals the movie as the over the top mother who I suppose does genuinely mean well. She's funny but also brilliant and O'Hara seems to be having a blast. Simon Wood is the only weak link in the movie he plays the villain the one who finds out about Penelope and tries to get a picture taken of her. Unfortunately he just seems irritating and camp he's not a funny characters and he at times seems more an annoyance than a plot point. Oh and Reese Witherspoon is wasted she's in the film I think for a grand total of ten minutes.Penelope also has problems with the middle section the opening is absolutely brilliant and the ending works in some odd way but the middle and second third is just bland and feels like it is treading water. The introduction of Witherspoon's character just seems like a novelty more than anything else and the lead up to the final third just feels like a waste of an opportunity. Also just before the final ten minutes the movie seems to speed over an important event in mere seconds! Thankfully these faults with the film never make the film a bad film the film is always watchable and you do genuinely seem to enjoy the film. Also the film never feels overlong it feels a perfect length which is nice as I believe if the film got boring in the end then the film would eventually collapse. While I did enjoy the film its also something I doubt I'll ever watch again as it just doesn't have that rewatchability factor. Nevertheless this is a good film for kids and in a time when kids will watch rubbish like Underdog it would be a lot better for the kids to be taken to see a well made if slightly underachieving film that has a great moral.Penelope is hardly the disaster I assumed it would be due to its release being pushed back but neither it a masterpiece. Its a sweet entertaining little movie that is worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "So I went to advanced screening of this movie the other day I won the tickets through the radio and was so excited since I've wanted you see this movie since July 2007.This movie is amazing it's like a darker fairytale with humor and wit and moral in all the right places. It's not to fast and it's not to slow it moves at a perfect pace and it does what not a lot of other movies can. It takes the time to make its characters real gives them time to show more then one side of themselves. They are wonderfully 3 dimensional instead of flat boring clichs.Christina Ricci who has been acting for as long as I can remember is still timelessly beautiful with or without the nose and manages to simultaneously break your heart and make you smile. After seeing this move there really isn't anyone else I could picture playing this role.Catherine O'Hara is the funniest craziest part of this movie. She is perfect in every single way and through it all all the insane matchmaking and shrieking you can still find the soul of a mother who only wants her daughter to be happy... and it takes a pretty special actress to be able to pull that off in such a crazy crazy character.Reese Witherspoon smartly decided not to play the main role but more of a sidekickcomic relief role and my god I forgot how funny she could be. She is a breath of fresh air as the first person who really befriends Penelope and she reminds you of your absolutely best girlfriend... or at least the best girlfriend you always wished you had.And of course James McAvoy. Let's start with the obvious why is this man that good looking? But I'm happy to say that he isn't just a pretty face the boy is wonderful in this movie. You can really see a troubled soul in his portrait and at the same time a guy who know right from wrong. He doesn't go about trying to win her money but he genuinely cares for her and it's there in every single line. A lot of actors could have played this role but there aren't many who would have made this character as believable and soulful as James McAvoy did.As for the two lead Christina and James they are magic together. They have incredible chemistry and play off each other flawlessly. SPOILER HERE The one scene when he sees her for the first time and he stands there looking at her is so real. I watched it and it made me nervous you could actually feel what she'd be feeling as he stands in front of her without saying anything. It's heartbreaking and it feels like that one moment is dragging on and if there is anyone out there who knows the feeling of standing in front of a room full of people and feeling like you want to die that is the exact same feeling you get from this scene. It was unbelievable END SPOILERAs you've probably guessed I loved this movie from start to finish save for the fact that James didn't have his accent which made me a little sad. And I suggest that everyone go see this movie. It's a movie for all ages and I think many a young girl would benefit for the moral behind this story.".

Once these men confront Penelope they run.Peter Dinklage plays an oddly appealing dwarf paparazzo. He bribes Max James McAvoy into sneaking a camera into the house and photographing Penelope. Max takes the bribe because he is down on his luck. As he chats with Penelope though some bond is formed.As with a real fairy tale deep truths are dramatized in this movie about fantastic characters. Primarily Penelope is about men's insistence that women be physically perfect to be worthy of love. That a film takes on this insidious aspect of male misogyny is to be commended. Penelope also addresses the perils of a celebrity culture that demands that females reveal all. Like a true folklore heroine  Cinderella say  Penelope experiences love not while splaying herself out for inspection but while modestly disguising herself. The film's ultimate truth can't be revealed here because that would spoil the plot but it is moving enough that it brought tears to my eyes.Christina Ricci is terrific as Penelope.

	schema:reviewBody "You remember that eversoslightly wellknown story called Beauty And The Beast don't you? You know the one where a meanspirited prince is cursed to appear as an ugly beast until he learns to love another and is loved by her in return? In the modern day fable Penelope a similar concept is given a gender reversal and a few plot trimmings of its own. The result is a decent little film engaging enough to be worthy of a look despite its unambitious and fairly predictable narrative.An ancient family curse results in Penelope Wilhern Christina Ricci being born with the face of a pig. Her parents Franklin Richard E.Grant and Jessica Catharine O'Hara are horrified and do everything in their power to hide Penelope away from the world even faking reports of her death and subsequent cremation. Unscrupulous journalist Lemon Peter Dinklage tries to get a photo of the mutant child but is attacked and blinded in one eye by her furious mother. Many years later Penelope is a grownup young woman still living a sheltered life in the confines of her grand house. Her parents believe that the curse can be broken if they find a husband of aristocratic blood for her but every potential suitor seems to run away in horror upon seeing her disfigured face. The latest wouldbe suitor Edward Vanderman Simon Woods is no different. Upon being introduced to Penelope he flees in terror and reports the encounter to the disbelieving police. Vanderman's story is ridiculed and he is locked up for the night. Upon getting out he decides to clear his name and teams up with the eyepatched reporter Lemon to bring shame upon the Wilherns and their grotesque daughter. The dastardly duo hire a broke gambler Max James McAvoy to get close to the girl and get damning photographs of her. But against all odds Max finds himself falling in love with the pigfaced girl..The film is pleasant fare with Ricci holding it together quite well as the titular character. She never appears as disgustingly ugly as the people around her suggest which makes the moments where men literally dive through windows in the family mansion to escape her attention a bit hard to swallow. However Ricci makes the character agreeable and gives us genuine reason to empathise with her. The other memorable performance in the film comes from O'Hara as Penelope's insensitive mother so obsessed with ending the curse that she never gives a moment's thought to her daughter's actual feelings. The rest of the performers do OK though their characters are generally conventional types. The moral of the story  about finding beauty and happiness from within  is as old as time even Dumbo and some less wellknown films that predate it are essentially about the same thing. Nevertheless it's hard not to suppress a smile of satisfaction as Penelope learns to live and be happy with her face ultimately getting her man and living happily ever after. As simple feelgood fables go this one is effortlessly watchable in its minor way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Penelope was in a league entirely of its own. I haven't seen a movie this honest and sweet in such a long time. There were so many lessons to be gained from this movie the most important of which is that it doesn't matter what you look like on the outside but who you are inside that truly counts. And all you have to do is find that one other person who can look past all the flaws and imperfections and see true beauty. Christina Ricci did an outstanding job in her role as Penelope. She really made it her own. She had this innocence about her and such inner strength. James McAvoy was absolutely mesmerizing and continues to please and amaze me in every production that he is a part of. He was so charming as the mysterious care free Max who sets out to win Penelope's heart. In the beginning he agrees to try and get close to her only so he can get a picture of her for the tabloids but in the end he falls in love with her. You can see how much he changes after each conversation. I knew it all along but I was so glad that he did the right thing. And you finally find out later that even though he wanted to marry her he couldn't let himself because he thought that he couldn't give her what she really wanted. So he let her go which makes you fall for him even more because that is the greatest kind of love sacrifice. But everything was made right in the end. And once again he delivered another dreamy weak in the knees kiss! Besides that part I think my favorite scene was where he's sitting playing the piano and she finally comes out and lays her hands on top of his and they play the song together. But I loved the ending too! James McAvoy just makes your heart melt. He has the most gorgeous blue eyes that just seep right into you. All in all it is a lovely story about falling in love for the first time and finding out who you are in the meantime and realizing that that person is truly beautiful. Penelope truly tugs on your heartstrings.".

	schema:reviewBody "A rather childish blend of comedy romance and the unearthing of morals and prejudices Penelope tells the story of a horribly disfigured woman searching for a mythical cure to a monstrous curse. Essentially a reversed Beauty and the Beast the film manages to be delightful occasionally but as revolting as a pigfaced child during much of the character development and progression of romance.When a misguided Wilhern blueblood falls in love with a common woman and then backs out of a marriage to save his noble name the distraught girl commits suicide. Her furious mother who is conveniently a witch places a curse on the first baby girl to be born into the bloodline. After generations of nothing but male heirs to the sizeable estate Penelope Christina Ricci is finally born a girl with the cursed ears and nose of a pig. Penelope is locked away and raised alone  her parents constantly worried about how the cruel outside world might react to her abnormalities. While some believe in the legend and others do not Penelope's only hope of undoing her hideous bovine appendages is to find a fellow blueblood that will love and accept her as she is.As she learns to live with constant rejection her parents struggle to keep her away from the media and from other people first by faking her death and then by holing her away in their luxurious mansion. To preserve the wealth in the family her parents attempt to marry her off with a huge dowry but suitor after suitor runs away in terror. Oneeyed photographer Lemon Peter Dinklage uses sniveling blueblood Edward Vanderman Simon Woods and downonhisluck gambler Max Campion James McAvoy to get a picture of the piggirl for use in his newspaper. When Penelope runs away Max finds himself falling for her when no one else can bear to look in her direction.Is this film really about looking beyond the physical features of a person to discover their inner beauty? Or is it that rich people suck? Whatever the case may be it's difficult to believe the message about inner beauty when Christina Ricci is gorgeous even with the pig makeup. The themes of the film are often lost amongst the bits of comedy that rarely evoke laughter and the shallow character development that causes these paperthin personas to lose steam almost immediately. The blossoming romance between Max and Penelope is amateurishly insincere and the dialogue that accompanies their flirtations is largely farfetched. Regardless of the message the execution in storytelling is notably disorderly. Right from the getgo Penelope feels like a liveaction recreation of a motif from Shrek in which the comical green man decides Fiona is perfect as an ogre.The large amount of cameos in Penelope almost make this film worth watching although some of them are just obscure enough that they might not fall into the category of a cameo. Nick Frost from Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead shows up as does Lenny Henry from the 1990's BBC show Chef!. Supporting roles consist of Richard E. Grant from Withnail and I fame as Penelope's father and Catherine O'Hara For Your Consideration as her mother. Simon Woods does an excellent job as the whiny aristocrat who will do anything to preserve his highclass name and Ricci is unquestionably pleasant to watch.Sadly Penelope works better as a thoughtprovoking concept than a feature length movie and the interesting idea is quickly buried amongst the painfully mediocre dialogue and commonplace plot points.Mike Massie".

When Penelope runs away Max finds himself falling for her when no one else can bear to look in her direction.Is this film really about looking beyond the physical features of a person to discover their inner beauty? Or is it that rich people suck? Whatever the case may be it's difficult to believe the message about inner beauty when Christina Ricci is gorgeous even with the pig makeup. The themes of the film are often lost amongst the bits of comedy that rarely evoke laughter and the shallow character development that causes these paperthin personas to lose steam almost immediately. The blossoming romance between Max and Penelope is amateurishly insincere and the dialogue that accompanies their flirtations is largely farfetched. Regardless of the message the execution in storytelling is notably disorderly. Right from the getgo Penelope feels like a liveaction recreation of a motif from Shrek in which the comical green man decides Fiona is perfect as an ogre.The large amount of cameos in Penelope almost make this film worth watching although some of them are just obscure enough that they might not fall into the category of a cameo. Nick Frost from Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead shows up as does Lenny Henry from the 1990's BBC show Chef!. Supporting roles consist of Richard E. Grant from Withnail and I fame as Penelope's father and Catherine O'Hara For Your Consideration as her mother. Simon Woods does an excellent job as the whiny aristocrat who will do anything to preserve his highclass name and Ricci is unquestionably pleasant to watch.Sadly Penelope works better as a thoughtprovoking concept than a feature length movie and the interesting idea is quickly buried amongst the painfully mediocre dialogue and commonplace plot points.Mike Massie";

	schema:headline " A balloon tied to a lead weight";
	schema:reviewBody "So I was sitting there watching Penelope and the mental image of a balloon with a lead weight tied to the end of it kept on appearing in my mind. Much like that balloon this is a movie that wants to take off and fly but is constantly held to the ground. In this case the lead weight is the script provided by Leslie Caveny TV's Everybody Loves Raymond. For a movie billing itself as a modern day fairy tale and romantic comedy there is a surprising lack of magic in the story and even less romance thanks to two leads that never generate any sparks together. Penelope is a case of a cute idea that should work but it's brought down by its underdeveloped screenplay.The title character Christina Ricci is a young woman who was born to wealthy parents Catherine O'Hara and Richard E. Grant and seemed destined to have it all if it weren't for the fact that her father's side of the family is cursed. It seems that years ago her father's family angered a local witch who placed a curse on them that the next woman born into their family would be born with the face of a pig. Indeed Penelope was born with the snout of a pig and the curse can only be broken if she finds true love. Her parents have sheltered her from the outside world all this time but this hasn't stopped them from trying to find a man for their daughter that can break the curse. Unfortunately every guy who lays eyes upon her nose goes diving out the window in terror. A visual gag that is cute the first time the movie uses it but tiresome the 30th. Penelope eventually decides to run away from home and experience the outside world wrapping a scarf around the bottom part of her face to hide her abnormality. There might be someone out there who can break the curse and that someone just might be Max James McAvoy a penniless piano player and gambler who initially is working for a sleazy tabloid photographer Peter Dinklage to snap a picture of the fabled and often rumored pig girl but starts to fall for her the more time he spends around her.Despite the support of Hollywood star Reese Witherspoon who not only produced the film but also has a small role as a woman who befriends Penelope after she heads out on her own Penelope has been sitting on the studio shelf for a little over two years. My guess is the recent success of Disney's modern day fairy tale Enchanted inspired the studio to try its luck. Penelope is no Enchanted however. This is a surprisingly dull and lifeless film that doesn't even seem interested in its own premise. Here is a movie that cries out for a light funny magical touch but the pace of the final product on display is leaden and uninspired. It takes almost an hour for the story to finally reach the outside world which means we have to sit through a good 50 minutes or so and this is a 90 minute movie of Penelope isolated in her own home and the gag of people throwing themselves out the window or running away over and over for far longer than necessary. Even after the lead character finally sets out and the movie looks like it's finally going to pick up things remain the same. We never get to truly experience Penelope discovering the world as most of this aspect of the story is pushed aside in music montages. The most we get is Penelope sitting in a bar sipping a beer mug from a straw so that no one can see what's beneath her scarf. Here is a movie that could have been spirited and uplifting but its so concerned with the mundane aspects it never takes advantage of its own potential.The love story that is supposed to be at the center of Penelope is also curiously lacking due to the fact that the romantic leads spend so little time together and the few scenes they do spend together are completely dull and lifeless. We never get a sense that a real relationship is building between the two not only because the movie gives them nothing to do together but they come across as complete opposites in terms of performances. Christina Ricci is plucky and likable in her portrayal of Penelope so much so you wish her performance was inhabiting a better movie. James McAvoy on the other hand is a lifeless bore who never comes across as anyone the audience can get behind. Not even the usually reliable Catherine O'Hara can escape from the film's sloppy writing. Her performance as Penelope's mother runs the range of being sympathetic and sweet to being a screaming harpy who is insensitive and shrill. Her character fits whatever the story requires her to be so sometimes she comes across as being sensitive to her daughter and sometimes she is treated as the villain. Her relationship with her husband and the strain the curse must have placed on their relationship all these years is also completely ignored. It's ignored so much Richard E. Grant may as well have not even bothered to show up as her father as he's given little dialogue and even less to do with anything that happens in the movie itself.As is often the case when I'm stuck watching a movie that doesn't grab my attention I found myself asking a lot of questions. Here's a good one to ponder. If Penelope's parents have been keeping her locked away from society all this time how do they explain to the people hired to replace the numerous broken windows in their house about why they need their windows replaced so frequently? That could have been a funny scene but the movie completely skips over this obvious idea.".

It was also very tasteless and predictable and so very unoriginal.This movie should not be seen by anyone to be honest. The story is telling us that you can not live a happy life unless every bit of you is how the society expects you to be. It is sad to see many great actors going to waste.As you all can see there is lots of high rated reviews but I guess they are all written by teens that do not even use their head when they stumble upon a love story.

	schema:headline " Sugary sweet and cute...a modern day fairy tale that might give you cavities";
	schema:reviewBody "Plain and simple Penelope is a fairy tale...period. It has a moral cute character romance adventure and really is meant mostly to speak to kids because the moral doesn't really speak out beyond the level of a young child. That's not to say it's not important just that it doesn't really speak to adults in the same way that it does to kids. As cute and good as the movie is because it is very entertaining...it's fluff at it's finest. Nothing that really digs at your brain or makes you think about for hours after but rather something to occupy your time for an hour and a half and then mostly forgettable. I mean even the romance aspect of it is kind of done half heartedly. It's not really a passionate romance but something that grows slightly and is a way of closing the film in the end. It's something that seemed necessary so it's thrown in there for good measure. I sound as though I'm bad mouthing but I'm really not...I truly did enjoy the film and had some very good performances but all in all it was just very very fluffy and just didn't have a lot of depth no matter how entertaining it seemed. It was cute and funny with plenty of touching moments.Christian Ricci is very versatile. She has really found her way from child actor to an adult actor making your skin crawl in Black Snake Moan to being this adorable pig faced girl in Penelope. She really is adorable and you take to her character immediately and feel all the proper emotions for her and her unfortunate circumstance. The make up job they do on her is phenomenal. She really is perfect for this role and proves her resilience as an actor. James McAvoy is the free spirited gambler who comes to win Penelope's heart to gain fortune but then falls in love with her. McAvoy is terrific as the bad boy with a heart of gold and his character has a decent arc to him hitting bottom with his gambling and then finding true love. McAvoy and Ricci also have very good chemistry but their romance is not the focus of the film. Catherine O'Hara is just awesome as Penelope's overbearing and well meaning mother who never seems to make the right choices. She's not in it a lot but she is terrific for the screen time she gets hilarious and really great. Reese Witherspoon plays a small role as Penelope's first friend Annie. They give Witherspoon's character more personality than what is needed considering the screen time she gets. She's mostly a cameo in the film. Simon Woods is terrific as the silver spoon in mouth guy who will stop at nothing to take advantage of Penelope no matter what to protect his own reputation. He is appropriately slimy and does well at it. One of my favorite performances in the film was by Peter Dinklage as the scorned reporter. One of the reasons I thought his character was so terrific was despite being a small person his role had NOTHING to do with that. He was a reporter and his size was never mentioned once except for one joke that I thought kind of stuck out because of it. On top of that Dinklage did a terrific job as a bit of an anti hero that you thought was a bad guy but turned out pretty cool and his character was just awesome. I'm a fan!! This being Mark Palansky directorial debut and Witherspoon's producer debut they did a terrific job and I think the film might find longer legs on DVD than it did in theaters. It's just truly a cute movie that kids might love and it really might speak to them because it does have a very important if not typical message that might be fairly easy to pin point as you can imagine. The really sweet thing about the movie is the twist to it...it's not quite as cut and dry as you might think and one of my favorite lines in the film is Ricci's character Penelope falling back exclaiming I like the way I am! Also they made sure that the romance that blossoms doesn't develop because of Ricci's change from her original appearance but that he loves her for who she was and will be. Definitely check this one out for something light and cute but still fun and entertaining and pick it up for your kids because it's worthy of a family film. 810".

Definitely check this one out for something light and cute but still fun and entertaining and pick it up for your kids because it's worthy of a family film. 810";

	schema:headline " A bit slow but an interesting culture lesson for Americans";
	schema:reviewBody "Anyone expecting a John WooRingo Lamtype actioner will be sorely disappointed by this Chinese film The Missing Gun. Director Lu Chuan adopts western filmmaking techniques but paces his film deliberately not hurrying through the motions or adopting slambang action to tell his story.You could draw parallels to Walter Hill's 48 HRS. 1982 and Akira Kurosawa's Stray Dog 1949 both of which dealt with similar stories of a police officer losing his handgun which falls into the hands of a criminal.The Missing Gun isn't as actionpacked as Hill's film or as perceptive and intriguing as Kurosawa's. Then again emulating Kurosawa is no easy task.But the film provides an interesting lesson about gun culture. In this country we have a nation obsessed with owning firearms. In The Missing Gun the protagonist is a police officer Ma Shan Jiang Wen facing embarrassment ridicule and shame for having lost his service pistol. Private ownership of guns is banned so the police know exactly how many bullets are left in the weapon.I am not advocating banning gunownership in this country but The Missing Gun provides an intriguing cultural lesson especially when we have an American president and congressional leaders who kowtowed to the gun lobby and recently let lapse the assault weapons ban apparently not seeing the harm in letting the public purchase Uzis and AK47s. Someone has still to explain to me why these weapons are needed to hunt.The Missing Gun does not adopt filmmaking styles seen in the works of Zhang Yimou or Chen Kaige. This film definitely has a western influence. The camera moves quickly there are quick cuts and for a lowbudget film  it was apparently shot for about 250000  the cinematography is spectacularly good. But instead of clichd storytelling techniques Lu Chuan gives us some novelty. There's a delightful chase scene and his characters certainly aren't conventional. Ma Shan spends much of the first act asking various people whether they've stolen his gun. But there's a sense of mystery to all this because we're never sure if they're being truthful. And the director opts for a denouement that's unexpected especially if you've grown up with American films. The Missing Gun is by no means a masterpiece. But it offers more insight into human nature than much of what Hollywood churns out these days. And if you're in the mood for something different a film that takes its time unraveling the mystery this film has much to offer the discriminating moviegoer.".

This movie has great interpretations wonderful locations and a beautiful cinematography. The bicycles chase is surrealistic and unusual and one of the most attractive scenes along this great film.

The first hour this film is dedicated to the cop running around town asking everyone if they have seen his gun to which all reply....Nope!. It's not until later in the film we begin to see a plot develop and realize what has appeared to be a comedy is really a drama when our heroprotagcop finds out his exgirl friend has been murdered...apparently with his missing gun. The balance of the flick is about finding the gun and the killer. Pretty ordinary stuff by Western film standards this flick is uneven and less than engaging with marginal English language subtitle translations. Story aside however it is a moderately enjoyable  blend of contemporary Western filmmaking with the traditional Chinese feel and a small step forward in Chinese actiondrama filmmaking from behind the bamboo curtain. A subtitled watch recommended only for those with a taste for traditional Chinese cinema. C".

It's not until later in the film we begin to see a plot develop and realize what has appeared to be a comedy is really a drama when our heroprotagcop finds out his exgirl friend has been murdered...apparently with his missing gun. The balance of the flick is about finding the gun and the killer. Pretty ordinary stuff by Western film standards this flick is uneven and less than engaging with marginal English language subtitle translations. Story aside however it is a moderately enjoyable  blend of contemporary Western filmmaking with the traditional Chinese feel and a small step forward in Chinese actiondrama filmmaking from behind the bamboo curtain. A subtitled watch recommended only for those with a taste for traditional Chinese cinema. C";

With 3 bullets in it it could mean the death of 3 or even 6 people if a professional got ahold of it. Or so his angry captain points out. Shan can't remember what happened last night as he got falldown drunk at his sister's wedding. He races frantically about town investigating those who were also at the wedding and accusing several of stealing his gun. He has been married for 8 years to a fairly grumpy women when his exgirlfriend moves back to town. The next day she is killed with Shan's gun. This movie was nonsuspenseful thriller. Fairly well done quirky and interesting character decent acting and a moderately intriguing story I found myself watching with more of bemused expression than one of suspense. I was curious to find out who had the gun not worried not nervous not involved. Although the movie was decent nothing stood out nothing will stick with me from this film.I love good Chinese food and for the most part I've found that little local places are the best places to find good Chinese. In Provo UT there is a restaurant called Shoots that is amazing. Since I love Chinese food I've been to P.F. Chang's twice. Everyone I know raves about it but when I went I wasn't impressed. I can hardly remember what I had orange peel chicken and great wall of Chocolate and spring rolls I think. Nothing was bad but nothing stood out as being great. Oh you have to try the lettuce wraps! No I wasn't impressed when I went and I wouldn't miss it if I never went again. There is much better Chinese throughout the world. 510.httpblog.myspace.comlocoformovies".

When I hear the word revival thus used I think of religious shows in tents but here it refers to the revival of China in the 20th Century. The significance of the beginning is of course that China owes its rapid and grand rise economically to the Communist Party whose beginnings the story relates. The early parts of the film begin with the fracturing and collapse of the Qing Dynasty in China then of course the brief time of Yuan Shikai played by Chou Yunfat as we know him in the West. Quickly we see the developing power of the corrupt Nationalist Party and then a good part of the film is devoted to the young Mao Zedong. Mao appears to be a man who had the misfortune of being born with a receding hairline with hair that naturally parts in the middle of his head. Joking aside Mao is portrayed as an earnest and amiable young student who after a very brief stint at Beijing University returns to his home province of Hunan to help found the Chinese Communist Party. We meet his first wife see their budding romance no kissing and see them go off to lead a life that was happy until Mao spotted his next love not shown in film and then the next and the next...If this all sounds like boring history stuff that's because it's what most of this film is. There are no real surprises. We get a communist party view of historic events complete with footage from Sergei Eisenstein's dramatization of the Bolshevik coup d'etat in Russia that was never quite the revolution depicted in Eisenstein's film. Much of the Beginning of the Great Revival seems to be an endless series of speechesmuch loved by communist party leaderssome dramatic some affected mostly dull interspersed with a few dramatic scenes of combat or mass demonstrations. To be honest I forced myself to watch this film to the end and once was more than enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "The reviews for this movie are too much plagiarized by US propaganda rating this as 1 and Chinese propaganda rating it as 10. If you take an unbiased view from a normal Chinese people it's just a rather average movie. Hey let's rate a movie based on its merit the impression it gives people and so on not just by politics!The initial scenes are a bit dull and disconnected with the whole story. The film fails to tell the story of Tao Chengzhang the guy with the bomb later get murdered at all so these scenes should be cutoff completely just a waste of minutes.After that it went quite fine with the story of Yuan Shikai Chow Yun fat and Cai E Andy Lau it's quite touching to see General Cai could barely stand but still directs the victory over Yuan who elected himself as the emperor. And the Mao Zedong Ye Liu line is also OK and quite touching.The May fourth movement part is a performed very well. For a Chinese it reminded of a story the government often fails to tell. The tensions with the Japanese about the invasion of Shandong the government's inability to make diplomatic maneuvers and the fanatic approach of the students. I would say that's a nice historical lesson to take especially in nowadays China where student movement is mostly a banned topic because of the 89' Tiananmen square accident. Some of the speeches of Chen Duxiu Feng Yuanzheng are well carried out indeed that it feels like the audience in the film were really convinced by him and were fully supporting his ideas.However the government side could be strengthened a bit. It talks about Wellington Koo Daoming Chen and his diplomatic efforts but these were cut too heavily so the full story was not told very clearly.Then the final scenes are not so good. The story lacks a climax and it looks to have ended without any major thing happening. OK the CCP formed secretly while being hunted down by the police but so what? That ending can definitely be strengthened quite a bit. A few scenes on the things that happened in the next years or a mere history timeline will make the epic feeling much better.Overall the film is ambitious in trying to condense 10 years of history into a mere 2 hours. But that turns out to be a bit too ambitious so in the end many things are told by just handwaving. It could be made better by cutting off some of the less relevant scenes and making the main plot more concentrated on a few major characters e.g. Yuan Shikai Cai E Mao Zedong Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao. But in general the cast is good most of the time and at least the told historical facts are accurate of course there're a lot of omitted trivia e.g. Chen Duxiu went too often to night clubs and was sacked by the Peking university because he was found fighting for a prostitute. So if somebody is paying e.g. the Chinese government for the tickets it's worthy to see it for free. But I won't pay to watch it so a good strategy for the CCP would be to make it freely available online after they've netted the 8 billion box office gross by the leftpocket rightpocket trick.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before deciding to watch Beginning Of The Great Revival I read some of the comments here on IMDb. Actually I was quite stunt that a motion title released only recently had so many reviews most of them filled with hatred and wrath. Something was out of place and after seeing the movie itself it's quite obvious what's at stake.The first an most mentioned fact is the 90th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party. I guess that was pretty obvious from the first title in the movie itself and all those who found this to be insulting could just switch off the player or leave the cinema. If something is dedicated to the milestone of CCP it's most probable that the content will be affirmative towards it.Next big argument is the lack of story. This is often heard from people who have no knowledge of Chinese history or China what so ever. True this is not a classical shallow saccharine polluted Hollywood style story where everything has to be chewed and re branded so the average redneck Joe with 10 bux in his pocket could get it into his head. Beginning Of The Great Revival is a semi documentary film where the basic idea consisted of connecting certain historical turn points in modern Chinese history. Have the scriptwriters manage to make that connection well is a different question since Chinese history in the first two decades of the 20th century was violent and turbulent as the old empire collapsed and a new republic became to exist together with the Koumintang. That struggle continued in blood for the next 20 years following Japan's invasion and later a civil war between Communists and Chang Kai Shek. The story may not be fluent but it can hardly be when so many historical moments have to be packed in a brief 2 hours. Is it historically partial? It undoubtedly is since the Communist prevailed and history is written by those who win. I guess Lincoln would be depicted as a thug in modern cinematography if South did rise again... Yet another problem with some viewers though I suspect they managed to last the whole movie with attention is Mao. You may like him or not still he remains an important players in modern Chinese history as one of the CCP founders. Actually his figure was not the main character in the movie but I guess his plain appearance and mention is enough to hurt someone's feelings.This movie is widely criticized by those whose hate is more or less directed towards communism in general and modern China without much insight in history or reality. It's been a long time since I've seen so much negative energy directed towards a movie and reading such comments actually entertains me. Funny...Concerning my point of view I think the movie is decent. Not great brilliant or unforgettable but plain decent. Actors did a fair job visual experience was up to the task and the historical moments were brought to life in a depicting manner. Does Beginning Of The Great Revival deserve 10 stars? By all means no. Still I decided to give this rating only in defiance towards haters who hardly see beyond their short noses.BTW even with all Maoist propaganda Beginning Of The Great Revival is more historically accurate and pleasant to watch than for instance that The Kennedys piece of sludge.".

Still I decided to give this rating only in defiance towards haters who hardly see beyond their short noses.BTW even with all Maoist propaganda Beginning Of The Great Revival is more historically accurate and pleasant to watch than for instance that The Kennedys piece of sludge.";

This could have been a much longer film covering more in depth coverage of the personalities of this time and still have my interest because of my study of Chinese history. For a general audience this film may have too many characters they know nothing about and find confusing. Even more so if you are not Chinese or a student of this time in history. How many people know about the Japanese occupation of the Shandong peninsula and its impact on Chinese thinking about the west? If you do have some knowledge of the people and time in China during the years covered in this film you will enjoy this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie I give it a ten for I'd give it a twelve if I could. I don't usually get this irked but when it comes to this...FINE! It friggin' WAS a propaganda. So what? Americans propagates their bullsht mainstream doctrines as well so why can't China? I say China deserved her propagation especially the Communist government for establishing a new China for doing a fantastic job maintaining order for grace under pressure keeping at least half of her 1.6 billion! population fed with healthy food and sheltered with reliable houses  even with herself under siege from all sides  while dealing with corruption at the same time! Seriously which other ONE country can hold off this big a pressure and maintain its integrity?China's central government is a Communism one but China isn't yet achieving Communism yet China is currently a country of Socialism working her way to Communism and the road gets rockier the further she goes. But that road isn't easy and Uncle Sam and his lackeys in Asia alone aren't making it easy either. When are those naval warships gonna leave China's South Sea alone? Probably the Chinese military wouldn't develop so quickly had they just all bug off they forced China's hands!Saw plenty of people are nonstop chatting about freedom or human rights those are the words I personally despite. China was NOT founded on the word Freedom but Order. Why? Because the leaders refuse to turn the country into a pigsty! And order has always been the foundation of a secure stable and lasting society. I don't get it  Do we really want to live in a world where freedom runs wild like forest inferno thugs and pickpockets and rapists and murderers around every corner all in the name of freedom? I'm not even sure why the Constitution of People's Republic of China even declared that the people of China can have the freedom of speech  that is a plague in China I get nausea and angst every time I see those comments made by  probably  those who foolishly speak without thinking them over tactically. Freedom in China is a very bad idea and it won't mean sht if the general society is reduced to literal Hell on Earth! I find it quite ironic that the people who cry and fight for freedom keep their house neat and tidy or driving on the streets with attention paid to the traffic lights. If they want freedom they can totally start with NOT doing all that. Can they? Would they? Dare they?Human rights is a joke. Those who obey order and not cause chaos never bring up the topic of human rights. Why? They got nothing to fear their human rights are impregnable. And those who DID call for human rights are more likely the ones caused significant damage to the order and stability of society and most importantly the law. Western propaganda be damned  human rights stop when lawviolations begin they automatically forfeit their human rights when they decided to break the law and disrupt order.I'm not sure what the media said about this democracy stuff but I know Democracy. Does. Not. Work. In. China. Probably works in small areas like schools or small firms but not countrywide. Having democracy in China at a year like 2016... or even 2049 is like granting AI to Humanity  dangerous beyond imagination. Freedom from democracy is the way to go right now not only for China but for the entire Humanity.The only issue I got with the CCP is that while the other government parties create followers that raise chaos and trash other people's territories the followers CCP manages to create happen to only be ungrateful backstabbers  They managed to give its own people good enough lives to live and what do they get? Bunch of mindless lowIQ idiots who complain about what the country didn't provide them on silver platters. Really China? This the best you can do? And what was that idiot from top review said? ... existed for over 90 years ...dominated China more than 60 years ... great tragedy for our Chinese people... we loathe it very much and we will eventually destroy it? Wow. Idiot kept talking about we our Chinese people but probably it's just he and... was he even Chinese? Sounds to me like this tragically pathetic mashup of a jerk loathes the CCP only because he held a grudge for not receiving enough gift money one Spring Festival. Hey idiot  CCP owns you you backstabber! You want to rebel against your mother? Bring it on! I bet that for every one of you going against the CCP there will be at least 50000 Chinese defending it and ready to tear you sanctimonious arsewipes into shreds myself included! So shut up!It's almost a hundred years since the Treaty of Versailles sparked the historical May Fourth Movement. And now in a few days the International Arbitration Court  complied by several firstworld members under the control of America  is about to decide the sovereignty of China's South Sea with China on one side and the encroaching Philippines with their western master the USA on the other... Deja vu?China is not perfect it never will be perfect. But as long as she exists and the CCP running it China will never stop its conquest to Communism perfection Chairman Xi has already started his battles against corruption and poverty. And the country already managed to create her own CPU and jet engines. It's a work in progress and all of it was owed to the leadership and guidance of the Chinese Central Communist Government Party. And now that it's under siege once again the last thing China needs is some idiotic lowIQ radical brain free sanctimonious pricks!Happy 95th birthday Chinese Communist Party. Here's to the next 95 years!".

However as a historical documentary I consider the film without a storyline but rather a timeline. The timeline went from 1909 I think to before WW2. I in fact do not consider this movie boring and believe that it has its positive sides. Unlike some other government productions this movie is rather subjective with not too much intentions to propagate the govenment. Again it was meant to go over the whole history of the communist govenment in this period of time. But some recommendations about the film if you aren't Chinese don't watch the movie if you hate the govenment I mean by hate don't watch it if you do not know anything and don't want to know about the historical figures of China don't watch the movie. I didn't find the film extremely interesting but it briefly helped me go over the history of China.".

I in fact do not consider this movie boring and believe that it has its positive sides. Unlike some other government productions this movie is rather subjective with not too much intentions to propagate the govenment. Again it was meant to go over the whole history of the communist govenment in this period of time. But some recommendations about the film if you aren't Chinese don't watch the movie if you hate the govenment I mean by hate don't watch it if you do not know anything and don't want to know about the historical figures of China don't watch the movie. I didn't find the film extremely interesting but it briefly helped me go over the history of China.";

The culminating climax of the movie the meeting that establishes the Chinese Communist Party is set in a aesthetically unsurpassed scene on a boat drifting on an idyllic serenely misty lake that might have been lifted directly out of the frame of a traditional Chinese painting. What you'll likely remember from this scene is not the rousing sentiments of the men inside the boat cabin but of beautiful ZHOU Xun who cares what character she plays at the front in elegant period dress holding a parasol a bewitching goddess of love and loveliness.Just like The founding of a republic 2009 this movie is populated with a proliferation of Who's Who in ethnic Chinese movie world today to the extent that to the general audience their names may mean more than the names of the characters they play. The movie is not difficult to follow at least in the sense that events are presented in a linear and chronological manner compared with the stock of temporally scrambled works we have become so used to. How much is recognized depend on how familiar one is what this part of Chinese history. But when the names which appear on the screen at the characters' first appearance are missed or not recognized one probably surmises that in a movie of this sort if they are played by the likes of Andy Lau or Daniel Wu they must be good guys.".

As a movie character development is weak because there are simply too many people parading in two hours distilled from a turbulent 10 years of contemporary China. As an education aid for Chinese history this is very interesting lively and educational thanks to the on screen description. As a mirror to reflect recent China's development my eyes moist to see history not only repeats itself but somehow even moves backwards. Same passion from the students same type of demonstration against the weak and corrupted government. Same demand to open government doors. Even same style of kneeling down to appeal. Didn't we learn anything from history? The students in 1919 even hit some government officials and set fire on their houses. But the Nationalist government did not crash them to death or force them to leave the country. When some students started a hunger strike in jail and asked for newspapers to read as a deal the prison guards gave in. Can't we see the film is trying to tell us a message about the present state through historic events? A party based on the strength of workers farmers and soldiers and the havenot's have developed into a unique style with Chinese characteristics where those at the bottom of the pyramid are still suffering. The movie may seem boring or bland on the surface. We need to contrast that with reality. The message is safely disguised under the name of history. Where else in China can we see large scale demonstrations deemed legitimate in a Chinese movie? I look forward to seeing a movie on the Cultural Revolution and the June 4 incident with equal dedication.".

I didn't know who was who or what was where. The small captions on the bottom of the screen and the subtitles didn't help and the different story lines just made the whole movie hard to follow. Its a shame because the acting is great and the I did feel a sense of intensity throughout the film but it's hard to keep up with the epic political concept which changed China forever. The director over complicated the concept and he even added a love story so there is way too many things going on at once. It reminded me a lot of the Founding Of The Republic which was also extremely hard to follow and I personally gave up watching after a while. They could have easily split this film into 2 movies so the director could have concentrated on different elements of he storyline. Anyway although it looks great the storyline is all over the place and I personally lost the plot. Disappointing!RoundUp After watching a few Oriental movies I did recognise a few faces throughout this movie but I still found it hard to follow. The movie was directed by Sanping Han who also directed the confusing Founding Of The Republic with Jianxin Huang. Sanping Han has produced some top movies like Shaolin Confucius the great Let The Bullets Fly the Karate Kid and Mission Impossible 3 so he's certainly got experience when it comes to big movies but he really did over complicate this one. I have to commend the directors on there efforts and the scale of this film especially in terms the huge cast and the amazing cinematography but from an entertainment perspective there is just too much to concentrate on.I recommend this movie to people who are into their historydramas starring Chow Yun Fat Angelababy Daniel Wu John Woo Andy Lau Simon Yam Chao Deng Xun Zhou and Kun Chen. 310".

I don't mean to set a gap here but if you don't know who's who you may get lost. And then when you finish the movie you tend to draw a conclusion that everything is for the creation of the Communist Party of China. OK you have no clue and thereby think it's all about politics. Indeed the movie is not about a single story but a piece of history as long as 10 years. That may be why the nonChinese audience quickly lose their interest and patience. That's true that the movie is dedicated to the party. However for the Chinese audience who were educated to memorize the big names of historical figures as well as the famous student protest May Fourth Movement it would be very interesting to see how the event is restored on screen. Everything happens for a reason. If you can discard your doubt about the political purpose of the movie during watching you may get to know the history better and then think for a while how it is transited from the beginning to 90 years later. Besides you would hardly understand the metaphor hidden in the seemingly dull plots if you don't know the contemporary Chinese society. I personally guess that the director learned a bit from the very popular Chinese movie Let the Bullet Fly in theaters earlier this year. How? Think about the final words of the movie which was read aloud on the boat ...For its content the censorship organization may worry that it is kinda sensitive for the vivid description of student protest. But considering its purpose it must be in theaters what did the incredibly many movie stars come together for? So I think that's the novelty of this movie.".

If you can discard your doubt about the political purpose of the movie during watching you may get to know the history better and then think for a while how it is transited from the beginning to 90 years later. Besides you would hardly understand the metaphor hidden in the seemingly dull plots if you don't know the contemporary Chinese society. I personally guess that the director learned a bit from the very popular Chinese movie Let the Bullet Fly in theaters earlier this year. How? Think about the final words of the movie which was read aloud on the boat ...For its content the censorship organization may worry that it is kinda sensitive for the vivid description of student protest. But considering its purpose it must be in theaters what did the incredibly many movie stars come together for? So I think that's the novelty of this movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "With an ensemble of fine actors this movie offers a nice historical background of China. This movie also made me understand why the majority of Chinese people during that time had probably some gratitude to the founders of the Chinese Communist Party who  to a certain extent  succeeded to bring unity and political stability which China needed badly during that time. However I have my doubts if Mao Zedong was really such a humble and gentle soul being 100 committed to fidelity and monogamy as depicted in the movie. However if the Chinese Communist Party insists on depicting Mao Zedong as a saint I am prepared to swallow that and whatever other divine virtues the Chinese Communist Party wants to attribute to Mao Zedong. The movie also emphasizes how important the student movement was for the CCP and how important students are in general for the development of China  which is blatantly inconsistent with today's policy of the CCP the Chinese Communist Party having succeeded to virtually ban the topic of student movement in today's China. I can understand that the 89' Tiananmen Square Massacre complicates this topic  especially as hardliners of the Chinese Communist Party are primarily to blame for this atrocity against Chinese students  but all the more reason that this needs to be addressed and resolved in China including an apology by the Chinese Communist Party which is still lacking.".

	schema:headline " Ambitious but halfway failed attempt to let us think about richness and poverty and about crime and punishment";
	schema:reviewBody "The first  of the film shows students attending lectures with a teacher who advocates the principal of survival of the fittest in the economic world hence defending a segregation of rich and poor people this being the only way to eventually provide for the goods that all of us need. These insights are apparently very new to the postSovjet students attending the lecture. They struggle on a philosophic level with the consequences however without much bearing to their daily lives where richness is something on a far distance.When our main character sees that one of his friends is beaten up by the body guards of a rich banker after having spilled coffee over the daughter he wants to bring aforementioned survival principle into practice rather than talking and writing about it. He decides to rob a local supermarket. His misdeed is known to us but he succeeds in remaining undiscovered by killing not only the shopkeeper but also the only witness.The anticommunistic philosophy is only halfway put through however. In spite of having barely enough money to support his own life the robbery is not for his own benefit but he gives it away to help a poor poet and his family. Some time later on the poet is found dead under the proverbial bridge. He attends the death rites and maintains further contacts with the poet's family.In the last  of the film we see a different teacher who is very outspoken about social behavior in the economic sense. He sees it as the main guideline to separate humans from animal life. Our main character shows that he sees a definite dilemma here. Firstly he tries to discuss this with a fellow student but cannot get to the point and leaves before he gets the chance to talk about his crime. Secondly he confesses the robbery and the related double murder to one of the family members of the dead poet.All this happens without obvious consequences. His life continues without any noticeable change. In my opinion several opportunities are wasted here to augment the story. Particularly this is the part where the film fails to exploit the potential that the story certainly has. For instance his own family appears suddenly. They observe his depressed demeanor but think nothing of it they eat and drink while he stays in bed all the time and they leave without even asking about his moody behavior.Still not discovered by the police as the robber who shot the local shopkeeper and a customer who witnessed his crime he wrestles with the dilemma's at hand but finds no redemption in the lack of punishment he experiences. His life drags on and on this is something that definitely shows in this film. I experienced several dull and hollow moments not compensated by convincing casting and acting and I sincerely missed some interesting side roles. Pity since it wastes a good theme for a movie that could let us start pondering over such lifedeath questions.Occasionally we drive through a city that looks very modern from the outside thereby possibly ignoring that Kazachstan was a communist country in the past about which we always learned that building gray apartment blocks for the working class had the highest priority. No doubt such gray and depressing areas still exist but are conveniently not shown in a film that is to be exported and to be shown in much more developed countries. From the exteriors of the buildings in the parts of the city we see in this film we could easily think these to be located in any modern Western country.Near the end of the film we see our main character entering a police station with the obvious intent to report his crime and accept his punishment. A few moments later we see him leave again but we are left in the dark about this sudden change of heart. Finally he gets the punishment he thinks he deserves for spoilers sake I omit details. But again I missed everything we want to know about his feelings and considerations and the reasons for his actions we observe from a safe distance.I wrongly scored a 4 out of 5 for the audience award when leaving the theater but in retrospect I think it would have deserved only a 3 not good not bad. The story line supported a lot of good ingredients illustrating the basic themes and related dilemma's. But the castingacting and the spurious dull moments wasted some good opportunities to let us start thinking about our policies in life. And the absence of logic in the movements of our main character does not help either. Maybe I can wrap up with some defense for the slowness that manifested itself at times since it can be caused by a different passive pace these people live in in other words can be intended to showcase their way of life possibly an inheritance from their Sovjet past??.".

It includes a bit of everything rustling gunfights stampedes crooked sheriffs greedy bad guys heroic good guys.

This was the first film Wayne did after gaining weight and donning an eyepatch for his work on True Grit.

The supporting characters are very well drawn and the villains resourceful enough to keep the action moving. In a way this character though based on an actual rancher is similar to the character of Dunson in the superior Red River. Both characters gambled on a long cattle drive from Texas and although Red River is about the drive itself Chisum is about what happens to a similar character twenty years after the drive succeeds. At the time the film was released at least one critic commented on how improbable it was for John Wayne at the climax of the movie to have done that much riding fighting and falling all within the same sequence. As far as I am concerned that sequence helped prepare me for later action sequences of 1980's action stars like Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger and action directors like James Cameron and John Woo.

	schema:reviewBody "Over the course of his career John Wayne played a few real life characters. Coming immediately to mind are Davy Crockett William T. Sherman Frank Spig Wead Genghis Khan and some others with pseudonyms for William F. Halsey and John Grierson. Playing these people would normally impose certain restrictions on an actor who's as larger than life as John Wayne. But it certainly didn't with playing John Simpson Chisum New Mexico cattle baron and key player in what has become known in history as the Lincoln County War. Of course the politics involved were a bit more complex than what you would see here. And a whole lot of liberties have been taken with the facts. One of the biggest is the fact that both Chisum and his rival L.G. Murphy died in bed and quite soon after the action of this film. But if Maxwell Anderson could take liberties and have Mary Queen of Scots and Elizabeth I of England meet then why can't we have Chisum and Murphy meeting in a final confrontation? After all it's a John Wayne movie and John Wayne movies can only go in a certain way.The Duke plays Chisum as the Duke no more no less. He and other ranchers are being squeezed by a greedy rapacious businessman in L.G. Murphy as played by Forrest Tucker. Others in the cast worthy of note are Patric Knowles as Henry Tunstall Glenn Corbett as Pat Garrett Geoffrey Deuel as Billy the Kid and Christopher George as Dirty Dan Nodeen. Chisum has in its cast a whole host of familiar Hollywood faces from the past like Bruce Cabot Ben Johnson Hank Worden Edward Faulkner all Wayne film regulars. It also has the presence of both Glenn Langan and John Agar. One of the really great things about John Wayne was the way he took care of people not as charity cases but giving them parts in his films when they were down. John Agar and Glenn Langan have small roles in Chisum and both were not doing too good at the time. Agar was Shirley Temple's first husband and made a screen debut in Fort Apache. Langan was a promising contract player with 20th Century Fox in the late forties and is best known for being the Amazing Colossal Man. Both were I'm sure grateful for the work and the paycheck. I remember in McLintock Wayne says to his son Patrick who's looking for a job that he doesn't give jobs he hires men. That was something in real life he lived up to.The Lincoln County War has been told in any number of westerns right up to the two Young Guns movies of the Eighties. Chisum is not the best or the worst retelling of the tale. But it is a good John Wayne western and that takes in a lot of territory pilgrim.".

	schema:headline " Wayne Rides Again";
	schema:reviewBody "For those of us who love him there's something about a John Wayne movie that kind of makes it immune to criticism. You can fault his nofrills acting style the pious patriotism the oftuneven supporting cast the predictable fight scenes But even a lesser Wayne film still has John Wayne and for his fans that's ninetenths of the battle in determining whether it's a good film.Chisum is not going to convert nonDuke fans. On its own merits it's a serviceable western with good action sequences some incredible vistas of the Mexican countryside supposed to be Lincoln County New Mexico by cinematographer William H. Clothier and an interesting if not always coherent storyline that places Wayne's title character John Chisum as more of a remote icon than active player in the proceedings especially in its second half. Much of the film focuses on young William Bonney Geoffrey Deuel a former gunman better known as Billy the Kid now trying to live clean and forward all the way with the help of a fatherly rancher named Tunstall Patric Knowles Will Scarlet to Errol Flynn's Robin Hood some 32 years before.Geoffrey Deuel didn't go on to much of a career after this and it's not hard seeing why. In Chisum his shallow characterization exudes no visible menace even after Bonney wellprovoked though not wellreasoned turns against the law. I'm not sure how much of it was Deuel's fault. The script works against him setting Bonney up as a decent humble guy to the point of boringness and director Andrew V. McLaglen only adds to the emasculation by showcasing Deuel's shy smile and his character's rote romancing of Chisum's niece. One scene freezes on Bonney holding a gun in one hand and a Bible in the other. I don't think Marlon Brando could have acted his way out of Deuel's bind.Other actors come off better especially Forrest Tucker as the chief heavy Lawrence Murphy who showcases an affable menace that makes him a good foil to Wayne's straightforward Chisum Glenn Corbett who plays drifting gambler Pat Garrett hard but decent who joins Chisum and befriends young Bonney until he turns into The Kid again and Christopher George whose Dan Nodeen is a nasty bounty hunter obsessed with killing the Kid. One nice thing about this film is seeing these actors all best known for TV series work stretching out beyond their popular identities of the period. George makes the strongest impression as the coldeyed Nodeen.You just had to kill him asks a sheriff when Nodeen brings in the body of a wanted man.No less trouble that way Nodeen replies.Ben Johnson and Richard Jaeckel also have their moments as companions to Chisum and Murphy respectively as does Andrew Prine as a lawyer who switches sides halfway through. There are many other performances too most good and all detracting somewhat from Wayne at the center though Chisum does assert himself from time to time.Chisum may be too busy a film that way with too rambling a focus even when its on Wayne. There's one scene where Chisum looks after an old Commanche chief which should have been cut while others need trims. But director McLaglen keeps a firm rein on things most of the time and the story does move. His mentor was John Ford but while McLaglen lacked Ford's nuance and depth he was better at delivering action sequences both in terms of frequency and originality. Chisum gives you plenty of action none better than the final battle at the Lincoln general store between Billy and the baddies with Chisum riding to the rescue.The first time I saw Chisum I was stuck at a sleepaway camp and hating life in general. Something about seeing John Wayne on a horse made the world seem right again even if the film was kind of hokey with that silly title music and all. Years later I still relish this film in some ways more than I did then despite its flaws. Chisum is not a showcase for Wayne's greatness like The Searchers or Rio Bravo but it's a nice film to have around for those of us who don't need him justifying our love every time out.".

	onyx:emotionText "For those of us who love him there's something about a John Wayne movie that kind of makes it immune to criticism. You can fault his nofrills acting style the pious patriotism the oftuneven supporting cast the predictable fight scenes But even a lesser Wayne film still has John Wayne and for his fans that's ninetenths of the battle in determining whether it's a good film.Chisum is not going to convert nonDuke fans. On its own merits it's a serviceable western with good action sequences some incredible vistas of the Mexican countryside supposed to be Lincoln County New Mexico by cinematographer William H. Clothier and an interesting if not always coherent storyline that places Wayne's title character John Chisum as more of a remote icon than active player in the proceedings especially in its second half. Much of the film focuses on young William Bonney Geoffrey Deuel a former gunman better known as Billy the Kid now trying to live clean and forward all the way with the help of a fatherly rancher named Tunstall Patric Knowles Will Scarlet to Errol Flynn's Robin Hood some 32 years before.Geoffrey Deuel didn't go on to much of a career after this and it's not hard seeing why. In Chisum his shallow characterization exudes no visible menace even after Bonney wellprovoked though not wellreasoned turns against the law. I'm not sure how much of it was Deuel's fault. The script works against him setting Bonney up as a decent humble guy to the point of boringness and director Andrew V. McLaglen only adds to the emasculation by showcasing Deuel's shy smile and his character's rote romancing of Chisum's niece. One scene freezes on Bonney holding a gun in one hand and a Bible in the other.

This film features John Wayne in the twilight of his remarkable 200 film career. Playing Chisum Wayne's nononsense attitute fits the title character well. This time Wayne is up aganist Forrest Tucker who plays Lawrence Murphy a whealthy land owner who plans to take the town and then take Chisum's land as well. Chisum's neighbor Henry Tunstall Patric Knowels also doesn't like Murphy's plans and hires a young man to work on his ranch his name is Billy the Kid played by Geoffrey Deuel. Chisum who has heard of him doesn't exactly approve of him in town at first especially since Billy the Kid has an eye for his niece Sally Pamela McMyler. Chisum eventually begins to like Billy right when he starts killing several of the town's deputies and Murphy's handymen this is right when the war starts. Chisum has a handful of action and adventure sequences and wonderful cinematography by William H. Clothier and a fine westernadventure music score by Dominic Frontiere. The all star cast also includes John Wayne regulars Ben Johnson as Chisum's sidekick Bruce Cabot playing the sheriff who handles Murphy's dirty work Andrew Prine playing Chisum's lawyer Glenn Corbett turns in a fine job as playing Pat Garrett and Christopher George and Richard Jaeckel turn in their usual cowboy villians as the bounty hunters. George's wife then Lynda Day also makes a small appearance as Andrew Prine's wife. Also look for small roles by John Agar and Christopher Mitchum.".

	schema:reviewBody "6.5100 One of the few films the Duke made that was based on true events. Its nowhere near his top films but the film itself is solid and has enough memorable moments to separate itself from Wayne's later westerns. Although having his character's name in the title the movie actually plays out as an ensemble giving equal time to Pat Garrett and William Bonney better known as Billy the Kid. However Corbett and Deuel were mediocre and unable to pull their own weight in scenes with Wayne. On the flip side Christopher George played a good villainous gunforhire while Ben Johnson gave one of his best supporting performances that I've seen out of him.

	onyx:emotionText "6.5100 One of the few films the Duke made that was based on true events. Its nowhere near his top films but the film itself is solid and has enough memorable moments to separate itself from Wayne's later westerns. Although having his character's name in the title the movie actually plays out as an ensemble giving equal time to Pat Garrett and William Bonney better known as Billy the Kid. However Corbett and Deuel were mediocre and unable to pull their own weight in scenes with Wayne. On the flip side Christopher George played a good villainous gunforhire while Ben Johnson gave one of his best supporting performances that I've seen out of him. Has a pleasant amount of humor with a good final shoot out and a catchy yet borderline annoying theme song. The film is carried down with a strikingly large cast for a sub two hour movie but has a number of memorable moments.";

	schema:reviewBody "By 1970 the western genre had changed massively from the populist genre of years before. The coming of the counterculture and the horrors of the Vietnam war had influenced filmmaking to the extent that the moral certainties of old just wouldn't hold and the western changed dramatically the revisionist western was born and this along with the bastardisation typified by the Spaghetti western from Italy meant that the genre moved into a more complex and morally ambiguous phase. Except no one seems to have told John Wayne about this cultural shift. Evidently he was still making old fashioned westerns in the 1970's. Chisum is a perfect example of this. In fact it shared very similar ground to Sam Peckinpah's Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid but of course that latter movie fitted very much into the revisionist category and both films could not be further apart in approach. Both feature the character John Chisum. In Peckinpah's film he is a murderous individual who represents the death of the old west whereas in Wayne's movie he is precisely the opposite. Overall Chisum feels like a movie from a bygone era out of time in 1970.Its plot follows the landowner John Chisum and details more specifically the Lincoln County War. Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid feature too in the years before the former assassinated the latter.I found Chisum for the most part a fairly tedious movie. It lacked the grit of other westerns of the time and its romanticised presentation of its characters seemed a little trite. I can't say I am the biggest John Wayne fan in the world but he was okay as it goes however the same could not be said for Geoff Deuel who played Billy the Kid I thought he was a charismafree zone and was very hard to care about. This was how I felt about the film in general. A fairly dull picture overall and not ultimately as interesting as the other less morally clear westerns of the time.".

Some of these films told purely fictitious stories there were for example no reallife equivalents of the feuding Terrill and Hannassey clans from The Big Country. Others however were loosely based on actual incidents from the history of the West the Johnson County War which took place in Wyoming in 1892 has inspired a number of films such as Shane Heaven's Gate and the various versions of The Virginian.Chisum likewise takes its inspiration from the Lincoln County War of 1878 in New Mexico. Such conflicts were often named after the counties in which they took place. That war was fought between two opposing factions of cattle farmers and businessmen. The title character John Chisum was a rancher and a leader of one of the two factions. The other faction was led by another rancher named Lawrence Murphy who also owned the only general store in the area. As in a number of these conflicts the division between the two factions was based on religious and ethnic lines. In a curious extension of the Ulster troubles to New Mexico Murphy and most of his followers were Catholic IrishAmericans whereas Chisum and most of his followers were Protestants of British or Northern Irish stock although some were Mexicans.In this version however Chisum is the hero a kindly paternalistic landowner whereas the greedy grasping Murphy is the villain of the piece. He is using his monopoly on trade to push up prices hoping to bankrupt the local farmers and thereby obtain their land cheaply. Chisum and his close friend and neighbour Henry Tunstall try to forestall Murphy's plans by creating their own bank and general store sparking off a conflict between their supporters and Murphy's. In reality Tunstall originally an Englishman from London was a young man of 25 but in the film he is played as another elderly patriarch. His real Christian name was John rather than Henry.Another reallife person involved in the Lincoln County War was William Bonney who under the name Billy the Kid was to become one of the most legendary figures of the Wild West. In the film he is played as a wild young man who under Tunstall's benevolent influence has become a reformed character. When however Tunstall is murdered by corrupt lawmen on Murphy's payroll the griefstricken Billy who regarded Tunstall as his adopted father swears revenge.The sixties and early seventies saw the growth of what has become known as the revisionist Western which sought to challenge the accepted heroic myths of the Old West and to introduce a greater sense of moral ambivalence in place of the old moral certainties. As one might expect from a film starring John Wayne there is little that is morally ambivalent about Chisum the heroes are heroic the villains dastardly and it is the men on the side of right and justice who inevitably come out on top. Yet in two ways the film does show the influence of the revisionist movement. It is much more respectful of Native Americans and their culture than many earlier Westerns Chisum will not allow anyone to insult an old Indian chief who is one of his close friends. And it does question the wisdom of the old law of the gun arguing for the rule of law instead. When Billy goes out to seek personal revenge for the death of his friend Tunstall this only leads to sorrow for himself and others. Chisum by contrast argues that all should be done by due process of law. This emphasis on law made Chisum an example of the sort of revisionism which could appeal to political conservatives as well as liberals the film was praised by President Richard Nixon in a speech about law and order.Although the Western genre was to decline in the latter part of the seventies the first half of the decade saw a number of fine films in the genre and Chisum is in many respects a splendid traditional Western with some great photography of the wideopen western landscapes and some excellent action sequences especially that cattle stampede at the end. John Chisum himself is a good example of the sort of character John Wayne excelled at playing brave decent and honourable. Wayne might occasionally have played flawed heroes as in The Searchers but he never seemed to play an outright villain. Fortunately he didn't need to as there were plenty of actors capable of taking such parts and Forrest Tucker's Murphy makes a good foil for the heroes. I would rank this as one of the finest of Wayne's late Westerns second only to his last great swansong The Shootist. 810".

While times may have been changing for the rest of the world in the 1970s they weren't changing for John Wayne. He continued to grind out entertaining but oldfashioned westerns not until his last film Don Siegel's The Shootist would he venture into the kind of revisionist view of the west found in the films of Sam Peckinpah and Clint Eastwood. Chisum is one of the Duke's better vehicles a corny but immensely enjoyable reworking of the Lincoln County War that is about as accurate as Shakespeare's history plays. Wayne plays cattle baron John Chisum as a more sympathetic figure than he probably was the always excellent Ben Johnson is his sidekick Pepper and if you don't find any homoerotic subtext to their relationship you're a better man than I. Geoffrey Deuel gives a surprisingly authoritative performance as a young Billy the Kid standing up well against the numerous betterknown actors who have played the part. Forrest Tucker is a splendidly crafty villain and Andrew McLaglan directs in his best John Ford fashion. Add a brilliant title sequence a stirring Domenic Frontierre score and a rather mushy song by Merle Haggard and you have a true western classic that should appeal to old and young alike.".

Due to the latter's gunslinging reputation Wayne regrets his initial invitation for the infamous Mr. Duel to meet pretty niece Pamela McMyler as Sallie Chisum. However the young'uns meet and are mutually attracted. Meanwhile wicked capitalist Forrest Tucker as Lawrence L.G. Murphy begins buying up all the businesses in town. He wants to take over the area and drive Wayne out of business. It looks hopeless when Mr. Tucker installs steelyeyed bounty hunter Christopher George as Dan Nodeen in the sheriff's office...Of course Wayne is not going down easily...Chisum seems cluttered at first. The opening shootout appears to be merely attentiongetting and there are a superfluous amount of characters. However the introduction does allow us to see the importance of Deuel's character note for example how the camera zooms in on the young actor's face. Very much Wayne's costar Deuel finally threatens his brother Pete Duel as the biggest star in the family. And while there are many characters to keep track of they do each have a reason to be there. Wayne troupe member John Agar has a meaningful cameo as the grocery store owner leaving town while Ben Johnson as Pepper is part of the chorus it's nice to see them all...Director Andrew V. McLaglen and writer Andrew J. Fenady combine the western legends Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid with the legendary Hollywood actor John Wayne very effectively. John Chisum was a real person too but is less remembered. The specifics and historical inaccuracies aside John Wayne and Billy the Kid coexist quite comfortable in the same story. It's a little unnerving to see Wayne given his health problems smoking. But he swaggers appealingly on screen and looks tough in spite of an added toll in weight and age. Stay tuned because it all builds to an exciting climax with everything and everyone falling into place. Directed with some majesty by Mr. McLaglen Chisum is a bangup western.

Yet he's very much just an ensemble character even on the periphery of things as the multi plot strands weave in and out of the story. But the film survives not over using the big man thanks to McLagen's brisk direction and Clothier's superb capturing of the Durango vistas.

Production values are high characters interesting especially the antagonist imperial noble Kurasumaru who is an equally dedicated and loyal servant just of an opposing side and the plot far more coherent than many Asian offerings. The fight choreography is dynamic yet plausible but this is not just a string of fight scenes. The setting is a civil war between two sons of a justdead shogun and the movie does not slight the importance of politics and maneuvering the powerful nobles into one's camp. On top of this the third side of the imperial nobles is trying to use the shogun wannabes to weaken the power of the shogunate and restore actual power to the Emperor. This rather than the Streetfighter movies made me a Sonny Chiba fan. When can we get this on DVD with English subtitles? Personally I hate most dubbing on films. I can read fast enough for subtitles and I prefer hearing the original actor's delivery.".

Violence and political intrigue are themes throughout both Shogun's Samurai and Battles Without Honor and Humanity and both feature a lead character who finds his loyalties challenged by betrayals. Both films also feature a large number of characters who seem to have little purpose but to die and since so little is done to develop them their deaths have little impact when they do come. This film has other flaws as well. The makeup costumes and sound design are distractingly poor and the battle scenes were substandard as well inferior to other samurai films of earlier years Seven Samurai comes to mind. Sonny Chiba plays the Sonny Chiba character in Shogun's Samurai the nononsense master swordsman who strides through the film scowling menacingly. What a guy he even gets to wear an eye patch. If you were expecting to see the legendary Toshiro Mifune you may be disappointed his appearance amounts to little more than a cameo and just when it appears that his character might do something interesting he disappears for good. Overall the strengths of the film are its story which is infinitely more comprehensible than those gangster films and the challenges posed to traditional concepts of good and evil. Two brothers are challenging for the throne of their recently departed father who may have had some help on his way out. Early on it looks as if we will be faced with a couple of characters who couldn't be more clearly good and evil after all the older brother stammers and has a birthmark the sure sign of a villain. Eventually however it becomes clear that in a winnertakesall struggle for power there are no heroes and villains only winners and losers.".

Sonny Chiba plays the role of Jubei a great swordsmen and samurai and he really gives it his all not just in the fighting but the acting aspect as well.I give this movie a 910 I have to admit they kind of made it hard to follow but it's nothing you can't solve by taking a moment to remember the faces.".

While the story barely features Jubei the entirety of the story is decided by him when the greed of his family becomes too much. Although some of the acting is a bit cheesie on Sonny Chiba's part only when he is sad this is a very good movie. For any of you samurai fans I recommend this with the utmost care.

I find it very important to learn about the countries that produce a genera cinema. Except from the story I find the movie a bit short on action also the battles are too short and photograph from wide angle which makes it a bit hard to understand who are the bad guys and who are the good guys.Sonny Chiba is doing his usually tough guy acting and I love him for that without him this movie would have been another non interesting samurai flick. It is sad that you don't see him as much on this long movie. Unless you are a sonny Chiba fanatic like me don't buy it Rent it!".

	schema:headline " Ahistorical but Rousing Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Kinji Fukusaku's conspiracy thriller is a rousing entertainment but its entire premise is a piece of fiction. The second Tokugawa Shogun Hidetada retired in 1623 in favor of his second son Iemitsu. Hidetada lived 9 more years in peaceful retirement following a precedent set centuries earlier by Emporers back in the days when Emperors not Generals ruled the country. Iemitsu's brother Tadanaga was briefly a rival for the position of Shogun during 1633 but Iemitsu was very far from being a transient inconsequential placeholder. He ruled until 1651 and took three steps which largely defined public policy for the rest of the Tokugawa era. He violently suppressed Catholicism using mass crucifixions in his suppression of the Shimabara Rebelion. He closed the country in 1641 to all foreign influence and trade except for a small Dutch trading station in Nagasaki. Finally he required each of his major vassals the daimyoto spend alternate periods of six months in Edo and six months in their home provinces. Beyond the opportunity for surveillance this system forced the daimyo into ruinous conspicuous consumption and prevented effective challenges to the Shogun for 200 years. This film comes from an age when female warriors had become a commonplace but well before spurting blood was acceptable. From his tame cameo appearance you would hardly guess that Toshiro Mifune had more than 50 films ahead of him. The juicy action roles go to Sonny Chiba and Tetsuro Tamba as rival champions of closely related schools of swordsmanship.".

There are great actors here. Etsushi Takahashi for example. He was amazing in 'Kill!' and 'Akage'. Hiroyuki Sanada is also great. So is Sonny Chiba. I don't mention Toshiro Mifune because his role here is just a cameo.Well... The movie was barely watchable. There were lots of problems with it. First there is the story. It is ridiculously complicated but not compelling enough. Many characters appear but they are not developed at all. Hence I didn't care about their deaths at all. You know it is quite sad actually. You see somebody dying violently. You know you are supposed to feel sorry about him. But you don't feel anything because this character is a total stranger to you. I felt sorry for not feeling sorry about the characters.And here is the second problem with this movie  it is filled with pointless death. Many people die. Men get killed. Women get killed. Kids get killed. Why? Nobody knows. I am not afraid of a little violence but this was just pointless. The story would be absolutely the same without so many killings. And since you don't know the characters at all their deaths have absolutely no emotional impact on you. The character's deaths can only disgust you.The next problem with this movie is the fights. You know that's what many people are watching samurai films for  sword fighting and action. But... Some of the fights are really nicely choreographed there are some incredible moves and so on. But... Most of the fights are actually quite messy due to the bad camera work. The camera is shaking constantly and you can't see anything. It is not like Paul Greengrass directed the movie but still it isn't what one would expect from a samurai movie.The camera work is a bit strange in my opinion. Sometimes you may see amazing landscapes. There are some very nice shots. Yet when it comes to fighting or some dynamic scene you can barely see anything. Yes it is a problem. A big problem.On the other hand there is the acting. It is excellent. Really. A few of the characters are actually well developed and you can care about them. It is mostly because of the actors. They did a really good job with what they are given.But that's not enough because they are not given much. 510. And I really wanted to like the movie.".

Not because it is not a good production but because so many things happen involving lots and lots of characters it becomes a struggle to follow the plot. I mean you can follow it but the wide scope causes the characters to bleed together. Only a few of them really stand out the notable one being Yagyu Jubei  Sonny Chiba's oneeyed ninja character. Although he isn't the focus of the movie he is the protagonist to be identified with and he ties all the social groups together.Still I didn't really like Yagyu Jubei. Sure he's badass and all that but what an unrealistic character! I just didn't care about him at all. He was like an anime character he's some overly idealized manifestation of handsome bravado which borders on homoerotic infatuation. Hahaha! But then again isn't that why we like Michaelangelo's David so much? Hrmm....Don't get me wrong the movie is worth watching. It has some good albeit fictional plot twists and a few memorable characters who are rather unique such as the dainty foppish castle magistrate or the kids from the ninja village. There are some crucial fight scenes with ninjas and we even get to see that legendary Japan Action Club fighting babe Etsuko Shihomi before she dropped off the map! I've never seen the series this was related to also featuring Sonny Chiba playing Jubei but an extended TV format would work much better at developing the characters and plot twists. This movie is already pretty long but it still feels scrunched together. It's like trying to make a crazy Sopranostype show into a fulllength movie. Not gonna work out too smoothly!6.5".

	schema:headline " Subtle approach to be appreciated";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a mildly interesting picture for viewers who like a hint of subtlety to spice their viewing experience.  The problem is that this film also contains quite a lot of uneven action and performances.The action is based upon a book by Graham Greene a morality tale in which Greene shows how a seemingly mild injustice leads to catastrophic consequences for an apparently innocent man. The movie details the relationship between Dr. Plarr and the British Honorary Consul and the consul's wife.  The movie true to the original author's intent makes this relationship central to the plot development.  Greene wants to show how this relationship reveals a tragic flaw in his protagonist.  On this level the movie succeeds but there are too many loose ends in the plot and some lackluster performances.  In the final analysis though it starts nobly the movie does not accomplish what it set out to do  i.e. bring a faithful adap tation of Graham Greene to the big screen.  It does not do justice to the subtle thoughtful perspective of Greene's novel.Dr. Plarr played by Richard Gere certainly is the amoral character Greene intended him to be.  But this role as directed in this movie appears to be a vehicle for Richard Gere.  It is drawn in the mold of movies that Gere had worked on at that time.  These include movies such as American Gigolo and Breathless.  To turn the character of Dr. Plarr into a showcase for Richard Gere represents a totally inappropriate intrusion of the director into the story's subject matter.To make matters worse Gere plays his role mechanically without passion almost as though he were reading his lines directly from the script or sleepwalking through them.  He is emotionally uninvolved in his character.The revolutionaries in the picture are similarly unengaging characters. One has a hard time seeing how anyone could support their cause. This is chiefly because the movie does not do a satisfactory job of explaining who or what the group is fighting against.  As a result it is not clear with any accuracy just what the group is fighting for.  The movie resorts to cliches here.  We are supposed to believe that a Latin American dictator has been committing atrocities but what effective recourse the revolutionaries have against him is never fully explained.  The action that follows becomes muddled and the the motivations of the characters confused.The one character who is neither confused nor mechanical is the honorary consul played by Michael Caine in an outstanding per formance.  Charley Fortnum first comes across as a boozing hasbeen but in the end he is the voice of reason and humanity in the face of an insane inhuman mess.  His is also the voice of mercy in the picture.Beyond the Limit may not be as thoughtfully developed as it should be but it is interesting to see the film's producers try to convey the important moral message of the original novel.  I give it two stars.".

	schema:headline " Consul decent enough movie but no classic";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an average potboiler from the Graham Greene novel and although it was better than I originally remembered when watching it again recently it certainly isn't at all memorable. That said there are some welcome production values and the cast are worth watching. It's essentially a Richard Gere vehicle  at least in terms of the American market and he plays an Englishborn Paraguayan called Dr Eduardo Plarr. Gere is an intriguing actor or at least certainly was in the eighties. Bear in mind this performance came just a year on from his breakthrough role in An Officer And A Gentleman and you can still see the raw almost nervous tension in his execution and he certainly favours the minimalist approach. It's almost as if he's determined to become more than the beefcake Hollywood obviously wants him to be. Despite this assumption however Gere still has the obligatory love making scenes although I'm convinced when he first beds Elpidia Carrillo's character Clara his helpful grunts are way out of sync with his theatrical pelvic thrusts. If Gere does seem to be a little uncomfortable in front of camera then it's probably because in most scenes the bedroom ones aside of course he is either facing Michael Caine or Bob Hoskins. In his position I think I would have stayed as quiet as possible and it must have been a daunting scenario for the then 34 year old just fresh from box office success. His accent as well is all over the place. At times there is a distinct English twang to it but then it slips into Amercian and even flirts with South American when faced with scenes with the locals. Bob Hoskins of course shows everyone how it should be done. Hoskins has never been afraid to take on any accent and here he is the local chief of police with successful results. Some critics have said that Hoskins was miscast in this film but I strongly disagree. His demeanour throughout and the convincing accent I think contribute to an all round excellent pitch although this is probably helped by the comfort of teaming up with director John Mackenzie again just four years on from The Long Good Friday. The reason I think that Hoskins is so convincing here is that as he is in physical terms not the tallest actor on screen he nevertheless carries weight because of his position and the corruptibility it potentially brings with it. And then there is Michael Caine. Yet again Caine is playing a drunk whose only passion in life seems to be the whisky bottle. As already explained earlier Caine's legendary depiction of 'drunks' was peerless in the eighties. As an exercise in this very matter I looked into how many 'drunk' roles he has played and counted postZulu no less than seven I am counting Last Orders as many of the scenes were set at closing time in a pub. The best scene in this entire movie comes when Caine is at the wheel of his car whilst the US Ambassador George Belanger has stopped to take in the local scenic backdrops. He looks up aghast when spotting Caine sipping from a hip flask. Realising he has been rumbled Caine swiftly raises a coke bottle to his lips within seconds expertly switching beverages in the same take and without a blip. Ironically this scene also has great resonance regarding the second part of the movie. I think the film is also pitched right at 102 minutes. Any longer and the plot would have become drawn out and the audience would fidget. Not a classic then but a decent enough attempt by all concerned.".

	schema:headline " Badly miscast Gere but Caine makes amends";
	schema:reviewBody "There's a solid film here lurking about but it never quite surfaces. It's based on a Graham Greene novel that I haven't read and it deals with an EnglishParaguayan doctor Eduardo Plarr Gere who gets involved in a conspiracy to kidnap an American Ambassador in Argentina. However a mixup occurs and the rebels accidentally kidnap a somewhat worthless British Honarary Consul Charley Fortnum Caine who's a friend of the good doctor. Then there's also the fact that Plarr is having an affair with Fortnum's wife.This is probably meant to be a morality tale about loyalty and the price you pay for truly believing in something. At times this looks like quite a fascinating film.

A heavy drinker and an embarrassment to his fellow countrymen it becomes clear how worthless he's truly perceived when no attempt is made to rescue his life when he's accidentally captured by Paraguyan rebels.It's here that Plarr is meant to be given a greater character feature than previously displayed as he seems to be the only one who actually appreciates Fortnum for the good but somewhat flawed person he is. The problem lies in the fact that Gere's performance and his character is beyond redemption by that point and his actions in the final third are wholly unbelievable and uncharacteristic. His ultimate sacrifice in the end doesn't ring true and therefore doesn't have the intended impact as I'm guessing the highly praised novel does.But to be fair to Gere he's miserably miscast here. Fresh from his stint and an impeccable performance in Breathless he maybe wanted to try out more serious material and therefore chose this project. His performance here isn't any good his British accent comes and goes at a whim and he still looks like Julian Kay his character from American Gigolo only posing as a doctor in a foreign country. His presence in the film is it's real downfall. A big indicator of this is how the film was advertised as a sexy Gere feature with pointless graphic sex scenes and stupidly retitled as Beyond the Limit to hide it's true dramatic origins and promote is as a thriller which it really isn't.But still The Honorary Consul does have it's quiet moments. Michael Caine gives a terrific performance in the title role and his character is very human tragic and earnest. He's flawed and who isn't? but he's got a good sense of what really counts and Caine's performance is the reason why this film isn't a failure. The scenes where Fortnum discusses his wife with Plarr his reasons for taking her as his wife and at the end his reasons for wanting the baby which isn't even his are the film's strong points and I don't even think that's what director John McKenzie was going for it just happened with a great performance and a solid core material.In the end The Honorary Consul goes down as a disappointment but a somewhat fascinating one as it could have been really good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Believe this I have watched this so many times but in part. I could spout off lines in Christopher Hampton's script at the click of a finger. I love the settings for this movie in which Gere an English spoken doctor falls for a newly married young woman Clara Elpidia Carrillo who is earlier seen as the whore working at this seedy bar that doubles as a cat house. She's married to the honorary Consul Caine unaware of the affair that has sparked between friend and wife. At the start Gere just arriving in town helps another guy escort a drunk Caine from one bar to infamous cat house one. It's here he sets eyes on Clara. The sex scenes are quite hot as passions run high but Gere has trouble from the other side involving his past where two old friends one a much younger Joquian Almedia approach him with a kidnapping plot to snatch a consul in return for their fellow South American prisoners to be released. Only problem is they snatch Caine instead not a real consul an honorary consul. Gere maddened by the idiocy of the mates remains loyal. Gere's father too is one of those prisoners as Gere is innocently led to believe. Caine's actor mate Bob Hoskins plays a cop trying to help Gere track down his old man. One scene has Gere going off at him when they arrest 250 mentally unsound people under his care and put them temporarily in prison but Hoskins mellows him. Gere's fate at the end of the this where the strong arm of the law closes in was tragic I must say. His not so badly portrayed doctor is a sympathetic goodhearted and likable character. But the heavyweights are Caine who plays drunk so good and being funny too about it where no nonsense Hoskins is solid. Elpidia is just pretty scenery really. But really there's something too brief about whole affair of the story here despite it's good screenplay and really it's just a passable but involving drama  those couple of sex scenes. And near it's end too some of the scenes are quite dark they disjoint the action. But Gere too is a bit of a bastard in the bedroom paying the now married Clara cash for her services as if she was still working. Also when going up to Gere's apartment is her first tome riding in an elevator. I liked the way Gere wore his jealousy well too really at the sheer fact Caine loves her. There's a lot of good scenes to find in the movie and Paul's McCartney's Brazilian intro theme was just beautiful and melodic as it was soothing. For Gere fans do put this different and quite enjoyable one one on your list.".

The late Robert Hoskins was great as the Chief of Police in one of his best performances where a much tamer and pleasant Joaquin Almedia was good as the chief kidnapper. Check out the torture job on his mate Martinez's now deformed hand. Too which is heavily confronting is Gere's father a prisoner forced to talk in some brutal torture methods one involving being held down in a bath tub of rotten poo. Almost for the second half the abduction part I found it sloppy. But seeing Carillo naked counts for something. Beautiful opening theme song which we owe thanks to Wings and Paul McCartney.

	schema:reviewBody "Chloe 2009 is really underrated love tragic drama. It is not that bad of a film I really liked it. I am not a drama love story fan guy but this movie really surprise me. It was not boring over long or over dramatic like some movies are! It has a love drama and it ends with a twist and with a tragedy on the end of the film. Amanda Seyfried took my heart away with her acting her beauty and I feel remorse for her character. I understood her character. I know now is based on the earlier French film Nathalie... 2003 I know that film is praised since Chloe come out but who cares! I hated Dear John and Notebook I hated those films. The only films I liked in drama were American Beauty Great Expectations that was a based on a novel and The Vow I like those movies.Chloe this movie also has an erotic thriller about seducing and manipulating other peoples and it has a message. Don't belive anything and anyone you hear from people. Julianne Moore is fantastic and the women can act. She is awesome actress she is one the actresses I like and that's rarely by me. Liam Neeson is excellent as always I love this guy. I love Taken NonStop in which Julianne Moore and Liam Neeson reunite again. A Walk Among the Tombstones Unknown and Run All Night. I love the actor even in this drama he is so good. The thriller that was in this movie reminds me in other movies like are Fatal Attraction. The Game Disclosure and The Boy Next Door. 810 this is a tragic love story and that a good one It worked by me I understand the character the movie worked better then in other movies. In my opinion I like it! Atom Egoyan did a good job directing this movie. Response to a nutcase below me the movie is not bland it is at least much better than your stupid dumb movie Batman Vs Superman Dawn Justice. FK Off!".

	schema:headline " Something A LOT different for Amanda Seyfried....6.510";
	schema:reviewBody "This film reminded me of the 90's wave of erotic thrillers. It's got all the elements including a healthy dose of softcore sex scenes which surprised me because Amanda Seyfried has such an endearing innocent look about her. But she's such a good actress though that this doesn't prevent her from convincingly playing the role of seductive call girl Chloe. Julianne Moore plays Catherine a gynecologist who suspects her flirtatious husband Liam Neeson is having an affair with one of his students. While at work Catherine observes Chloe entering and exiting hotels with several men so she can make a pretty good guess at Chloe's profession. Catherine decides to use Chloe as bait to see if her husband would submit to the temptation of an affair with Chloe.And even though that is the basic storyline there is so much more that is left unsaid things Catherine thinks she knows but doesn't know about her husband things Chloe knows about Catherine that Catherine herself doesn't even know and in the middle of it all the viewer who finds out we didn't know much at all about it all. The audience is pretty much kept in the dark as to what is really going on with Chloe until one small scene that immediately switches the direction of the movie. It's not one of those hokey melodramatic twists but will definitely have you playing back the entire movie in your mind because it sheds everything in a new light. Chloe brags at the beginning of the film in a voiceover narration that she has the gift of intuiting what people want and need without it being said. She can be all things to all people. And unfortunately for Julianne Moore's character Chloe is exactly right....just not in the way that you might initially think she is.What makes this movie good is that it has layers. Just as in real life people are inevitably much different than what they appear to be on the surface. In a lesser film the characters and plot would be onedimensional and by far less interesting.".

Hence the rather brilliant Chloe whose prime accomplishment lies in its being less showy and pretentious than the director's previous foray into erotic secrets the ambitious Where the Truth Lies.Set in Egoyan's home town of Toronto Chloe tells the story of the eponymous call girl Amanda Seyfried who is hired by gynecologist Catherine Stewart Julianne Moore when the latter starts to suspect her husband Liam Neeson is having an affair. Chloe's job is to casually approach him and see if he falls for her charm thus indicating his propensity for adultery. However as the girl's reports get more and more graphic Catherine realizes she has put herself in an awkward position one that it will be difficult to get out of.A fascinating hybrid between psychological drama and erotic thriller there's a vague hint of Fatal Attraction throughout the movie Chloe is a rarity due to its attempt to analyze sex and its consequences without necessarily resorting to openly titillating imagery a characteristic Egoyan shares with another Canadian maestro David Cronenberg. The only downside of this approach is the same flaw that was much more evident in Where the Truth Lies namely a deliberately slow pace that affects the thriller aspects but enhances the emotional poignancy something that comes off as a paradox given the seemingly cold subject matter.Furthermore there is no coldness to be found in the carefully crafted performances Neeson and Moore play the troubled couple with conviction especially when things start getting more complicated Moore's suspicious wife is a tour de force turn that should have received some award recognition but the heart of the film lies quite predictably in Seyfried's hands and she rises to the challenge by proving that she can do Big Lovestyle quality work on the big screen embodying a complex intriguing character light years away from her roles in Mamma Mia! and Mean Girls.Overall Chloe is a very good movie sexy without being gratuitous psychological without getting pompous and like its title character delightfully surprising.".

Toward the end I was afraid we were heading for another Fatal Attraction but fortunately did not go that way. This was Julianne Moore's movie no doubt and I am rather surprised at the amount of nudity she showed. And Amanda Seyfried was HOT! Liam Neeson is almost a footnote in this film but he shows what a professional he is to do a film of this type after his family tragedy.

A situation isn't always conducive to storytelling telling a story vs. a situation but in the case of Chloe it's the way to go. The situation here is this a doctor Julianne Moore is suspicious perhaps even certain in some way that her husband an opera teacher Liam Neeson is cheating on her. As a way to find out or just out of curiosity as to what he'll do he approaches a callgirl Amanda Seyfried who has a knack for fulfilling any client's desire. When Chloe asks this woman about her husband being the client she says he isn't. Her job will be to approach him simply in a cafe and see what he does. But according to Chloe an innocent conversation him being friendly as he is with a lot of women turns into something else entirely... or is it? This situation unfolds in a manner that is less about the conventional 'what will happen to their marriage' than what will happen to Moore's character and Seyfried's Chloe in relation to one another. It's one thing to have a character having sex with one spouse but then having it with the other is something else. But that's not even what Atom Egoyan the director is fully interested in although the sex scenes when they do come up usually from Moore's gynecologist imagining what her husband has been doing  and then herself actually with Chloe are the most seriously erotically charged ones seen in a while. His concern as a storyteller with this 'situation' is what is in the mind what perception does to a married couple over time.Catherine can imagine David doing these things and we as the audience accept this as what really happened because Chloe as the incharge girl of the fantasy makes it so. What do we perceive as who's wrong or right here or is there even that issue? Eventually the movie Chloe turns into an obsession kind of story where Chloe becomes enraptured with Catherine and their tryst together. A thirdact revelation I hesitate to call it a twist makes things a lot more clearer but does it matter if one sees it coming I didn't but I can see how suspicions can be had right from the beginning. It's Egoyan's way of seeing these people in these situations how serious everything is taken but how it doesn't become too trashy only the music by Mychael Danna sees to make it more of a sleek erotic drama when it doesn't need it the best music cue has nothing to do with him but rather the cutaway from one crucial scene to the next where CatherineDavid's son is playing a perfectly somber piece of piano at a recital.One part of it is the camera sliding along and pairing up the imagery in certain scenes watch as Catherine is excited in the shower of the image of David in the botanical garden their juxtaposition is interesting. But another crucial thing is the performances. Moore and Neeson deliver the goods and we hope they always do Neeson especially has a very hard part despite the supporting role as the husband since he has to reveal what is necessary for Catherine to perceive not so much what is fully realistic and the actor playing the son fares less well though that may be due to him being underwritten or just not well written enough. But it's Seyfried who comes away here the real winner she's naturally sexy and appealing and can convey Chloe's ability to play Catherine so well because it's what she does. She's younger but wiser when it comes to intimacy and the power of suggestion and the details in her descriptions in the writing and the acting is totally solid. We've seen Seyfried try and sometimes succeed more or less with material i.e. Mean Girls and Jennifer's Body and here is where she really fully gets to shine in a threedimensional character.We know the players and we know how it might turn out but you can't be sure. Egoyan eschews a Fatal Attraction third act turn for something a little more dangerous and exciting. I wasn't sure if Chloe was nuts or just got off on her own superior way of playing this family of bourgeois Torontoites. It's about knowing what we know and what we choose to do with that information as a sexual partner a lover a person a friend whatever and that intimate fantasy element. It comes close to trash but it really isn't. Taking its flaws aside it's one of the smartest adult though not pornographic thrillers in recent memory.".

A situation isn't always conducive to storytelling telling a story vs. a situation but in the case of Chloe it's the way to go. The situation here is this a doctor Julianne Moore is suspicious perhaps even certain in some way that her husband an opera teacher Liam Neeson is cheating on her. As a way to find out or just out of curiosity as to what he'll do he approaches a callgirl Amanda Seyfried who has a knack for fulfilling any client's desire. When Chloe asks this woman about her husband being the client she says he isn't. Her job will be to approach him simply in a cafe and see what he does.

	schema:reviewBody "A great cast are wasted on a pretty dire script. I suppose they thought they were making something insightful about the nature of trust or something but it's a pretty average thriller which retreads the same path so many other thrillers have. I must admit I found it rather annoying that we are shown scenes that didn't happen yes I know none of it actually happened!. It would have been more acceptable to me if the scenes of Chloe's imagined relationship with the David the husband Liam Neeson had been given a voiceover by her. That would have indicated that the action could have been taking place in her head. It was very Hollywood in spite of its pretensions to being meaningful. For example Julianne Moore's character Catherine is worried that she's getting old but this being Hollywood she's not allowed to look anything other than stunning for the majority of the time. Plus she indulges in a bit of lesbianism at the drop of a hat because we all know that every woman has an inner lesbian dying to get out. Honestly you could have cast Shannon Tweed in the role! Chloe's motivation seemed very vague. She's a prostitute so I suppose we are meant to take that as shorthand for her being a DAMAGED PERSON. I came to the conclusion that she was after Catherine's wardrobe. Chloe wears endless pretty outfits she seems to have a limitless number of coats and has a shoegasm whilst being diddled by Catherine's son. She won't look at him but fixes her gaze on Moore's shoes and clothes she's being diddled in Catherine's bedroom btw. It had a typical Hollywood ending the outside influence who is trying to break up the family unit is killed. The only surprising thing about it was that she wasn't stabbed with the antique hair slide that we'd been shown several times. It reminded me of those yuppieinperil films of the late 80searly 90s like Consenting Adults and Pacific Heights.".

The story is totally whacked and one wonders who in their right mind thought this story made any sense a spoiled rich gynecologist believes her husband is cheating on her. She suddenly feels invisible her husband is having sex with one of his young students. Friends are dating young chicks. Her son his sleeping with a hot chick in his bedroom. People all around are boinking chicks. The wife suddenly realizes Heck I'm missing on all of the hot action so she decides to hire a hooker with the idea of seducing her husband to see if he'll sleep with her but it's all a ruse really because she's the one who ends up having sex with Chloe the Hooker. Chloe invents all these hot stories of her sleeping with the husband to dupe the silly wife these stories are so hot the wife decides to have sex with the hooker because the wife feels she's invisible and by having sex with Chloe it's like some transference thingy going on and part of the passion the husband is sharing with the hooker the wife thinks she'll feel it too.Got that? The logic in the story is so whacked it had me rolling on the floor.First of all I can't sympathizeempathize with the wife's paingrief. She's a wealthy spoiled woman who hires a young woman to trap her husband. Nice character.Second the couple is a corny couple. Who cares if they don't make it or anything about their happiness.Third the two women the silly wife and the hooker are shown as being total nut jobs the wife is gullible and accepts every little detail the hooker tells her without any proof of what she's claiming is real and the hooker is shown as being mentally unstable in the SINGLE WHITE FEMALE kind of way.So basically the degrading screenplay portrays these two neurotic women as crazy conniving manipulating narcissistic and out of control with their emotions. They both endup coning each other while object of the initial target the boring husband doesn't even figure in the story. The two scheming women end up looking like two monkeys fellating each other at the zoo. I wanted to throw peanuts at them to make them stop. The ending elevates the level of degradation when Chloe the Hooker sleeps with the son in the parents' bedroom and when they're found out Chloe the Hooker then tries to seduce the wife again which is seen by her son. The wife embarrassed literally pushes Chloe away to her death. Nice.Though the story hints at Pasolini's brilliant TEOREMA the storyline is straight out of the 1970s Black Emanuelle trash epics. Well I would rather watch any Laura Gemser flick than this risible piece of serious filmmaking. The sex scenes in CHLOE were not hot for one second. Just unconvincing.When the wife suddenly realizes the truth with those fake encounters Chloe has been telling her she tells the clueless husband what she did that she hired a hooker to entrap him and that she also ended up having sex with her and in turn became the cheater here the husband shrugs it off as if it was normal and OK. Again this is me on the floor laughing my butt off. If I was the husband I'd ask the wife to seek professional psychiatric help. I mean the money she spent on the hooker could have been spent on something more important ya know like a brand new flat screen TV for that ridiculously overly designed house of theirs. Even though it's a remake of a French film CHLOE reminded me more of the trashy Italian film called DELERIUM starring Mickey Hargitay. Same insane logic in the storyline with the women being completely crazy and degraded. The excellent Julianne Moore needs to get better projects than this laughable  embarrassing stuff.".

With wild twists and turns. I saw this at the Toronto film festival and couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised by the result. Also keep an eye out for the up and coming actor Max Theriot. He's going to be someone to look out for. Julianne Moore also rings in a great acting performance with her great control of a woman who's life begins to spiral out of control.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was great to see the crowd for this film at my local cinema. Yes the reviews for this look like they are all over the map. But let it be said that without this fantastic casting Julianne Moore Liam Neeson and Amanda Seyfrieda powerful erotic trio the glorious cinematography and the wildly gorgeous sound track it might be all of what these arm chair critics are saying. We live only a few miles from Canada by air but it might as well be Istanbul in the hands of this director. Magically the city of Toronto in winter is like another world with a sleek modern feel that is alluring and cold at the same time. This is the perfect setting for a movie rich in the cloaked emotion of the upper class lost in a deep freeze. Watching the film in spring in California makes it seem even more unreal and foreign. In this landscape of ice we see the characters emerge as modern people lost alienated hungary for love and even just human touch. This is a movie of antithesis and startling allusions of the duality between trust and fear openness and truth and the hard fact of emotional allusion and mirror like dreams. This film has nothing to do with Hitchcock and everything to do with Bunuel and the deep wave of surrealist magic still washing on the shore of French thought and culture. Yes the ending is dubious but it can't crush your response. For those of you wide awake enough to enjoy this you will be rewarded in ways that American directors rarely seem to reach. What I say is bravo!I believe that for these moments such dreams are very real.".

She looks like a grotesque blueprint for a new Goldie Hawn. I thought her was one of the worst performances I've seen in a long long time. I suspect Egoyan's intentions were mostly commercial.

It's such a clichnarrative it has been done so many times in similar ways that you would have to make quite an effort for it to be believable. Its like watching a 6th Sense remake. Who would want to watch it if the whole final effect of 'oh my god he is a ghost' is gone?As the viewers are we supposed to be surprised that it all was just made up? Because I wasn't surprised at all. I was just extremely annoyed because it all was so painfully obvious.The director is trying to unfold a story which is already unfolded in my mind before the first half is even over because it is predictable and lame.But this is just one aspect which I did not like. There is so much more wrong with this movie that I could go on forever.I could accept the flaw I just tried to point out if the rest of the movie was watchable but it's not.It's a movie about a hooker or escort girl or what ever you want to call her who turns out to have emotional problems so while in the beginning she is acting all cool and telling us so intelligently and poetically about her job about the dos and don'ts and how to behave with men in the end she turns out to not be professional at all she is just a crazy bitch. Julianne has some emotional problems because she is getting old and feels unwanted. Her son is just some teenage kid who is not really relevant for the movie except for the conflict with Chloe in the end. Liam Neeson is just chilling throughout the movie not really harming anyone he seems to be more interested in his work than in his wife...wtfhonestly who cares?I suppose there is supposed to be some underlying deeper meaning...But I think its a load of ...just a pretentious attempt to be smart and intellectual. All the director does is coming up with some random dramaconflict ideas and mixing them together. in the end you have nothing of value...I usually don't write reviews on IMDb this is the first one. The movie just created so many negative emotions within me that I had to post my opinion. Especially after seeing how many people liked it. I mean that's fine. We all have different tastes but I just thought I post one for the people who disliked the movie as much as i did.".

What we know instinctually and right away is that prostitute is crazy and makes it all up but without any discernible motive stalks family and ultimately does the wife the son and then kills herself by falling thru an extremely flimsy window.Chloe manages at first to convince Dr Stewart in graphic detail the sexual escapades her adulterating husband enjoyed which leads the lovely Dr to retain the psycho for yet another job never approaching her husband with what she apparently already knew he's a cheater but he isn't really after all it's Liam Neeson who's never been a bad guy in any of his films part of his contract I guess.OK we're not totally unentertained we get to see Amanda Seyfried and Julianne Moore in the buff getting it on.

The holes here in logic exercised by an educated overpaid professional are too much to swallow. The lack of motive by Chloe and the interference with her presumed income is also confusing but in the end we get to see the hair clip given to the Dr by the hooker pinned to her smiling head as the movie fades into oblivion where it needs to stay. I suppose the hair pin could be to blame for the evil that was done as it's apparently a center piece of film but they just don't clue us into that. Maybe the soft porn scenes consumed all the resources? Don't waste your time on this trash.

Unless you're into girl on girl in which case look to Moore she's got a much better body than Amanda Seyfried";

Comparing it to Fatal Attraction it comes off badly as never really gets that gritty and tense but in its own right it's a good movie with plenty to offer... like Amanda Seyfried's chest.Whilst it was predictable and formulaic I certainly can't say I was ever bored. I'm probably being far too generous with my rating due to loving the lezzing up and Amanda Seyfried's rather excellent rack but it's worth watching just for the scene where the Chloe character has an orgasm over a rack of shoes had me pissing myself. So for those who have an appreciation for Amanda Seyfried and her awesome rack and lesbian sex then this is a 7 if not then a 5.".

After watching it I get the feeling that some Hollywood studio would be buying the rights for a remake just like it had been done with The Departed Martin Scorsese's 2006 remake of Infernal Affairs.After Beast Stalker 2008 Sniper 2009 and Fire of Conscience Stool Pigeon looks set to cap Lam's career as filmmaker. It grips its viewers from start to end  and never lets go! Police Inspector Don Lee Nick Cheung relies very much on his 'stool pigeons' to provide information for his drugs and criminal cases. However an act of betrayal involving his last informant played by Liu Kai Chi leaves him wrecked with guilt. Don resolves to be more careful with his next 'stoolie' an exconvict nicknamed Ghost Nicholas Tse whom Don plans to plant as getaway driver for a gold heist gang led by Barbarian Lu Yi. Ghost a streetracer who is determined to save his sister from loan sharks looks like the man for the job. Problem is can they trust each other enough to see the job through? Movies about snitches moles and informers are nothing new. However Lam gives the genre a new dimension by delving deeper into the intricate relationship between police handler and informant. One sequence has Don telling his rookie officers to be friendly with their informers to win their trust but not to be too close or they would lose their objectivity. This of course is easier said than done when lives and limbs are at stake.Lam also takes great care with character development. The backgrounds of Don Lee and Ghost are nicely fleshed out with even a twist or two  and there is an emotional connection between Ghost and Barbarian's girlfriend Dee Kwai LunMei. This romantic touch not only lends narrative power and depth to the movie but also sets up the groundwork for the explosive and breathtaking ending.Of course for any movie to be compelling it has to have a great cast. Nick Cheung has won Best Actor awards for his role in Beast Stalker and now it looks like Tse's turn. Nicholas gives Ghost such a powerful portrayal that it reminds me of a young Robert De Niro. His character is so full of anger and angst that it threatens to explode at any time. Cheung as expected has the audience rooting for him all the time while Kwai steals the show every time she appears as the scheming gang moll.There are some awkward and overthetop scenes here and there but they do not mar the overall flow of the movie.

Similarly the latest venture from Dante Lam in Stool Pigeon is a lot like the aforementioned film. The good news is the tension is there the acting is good and the film is well directed. The bad news is that Stool Pigeon does not reach the heights of Beast Stalker. Nick Cheung reverses role with Nicholas Tse this time around. Cheung is the cop and Nicholas Tse is the stool pigeon. Cheung is now an established actor and earns his paycheck here with a gritty and emotionally complex character. Tse on the other hand is excellent and almost carries the film on his shoulders. The best thing of the lot is once again veteran Liu Kai Chi. Liu steals the show and the effect is seen in the opening scene when he screams for help.Stool Pigeon is a good film but not a great film. The reason is simple it lacks the same amount of intensive tension of its predecessor and relies much on the acting of Tse and Cheung to take the film to the end. In say that this is by a far a much superior effort to Fire of Conscience. Dante Lam is a capable director and he is at his best when the characters in his films are allowed to express their truest potential or perhaps when they go crazy. Think Anthony Wong in Beast Cop and Nick Cheung in Beast Stalker. While both Tse and Cheung does fine turns but neither are memorable. The film itself is not too memorable either. Instead what we got delivered to us is a film that entertains some interesting chases fine acting and positive direction. Easily a good film but not greatNeo 2010 I rate it 710www.thehkneo.com".

	schema:headline " One of Dante Lam's best this tightlyplotted thriller boasts excellent characterdriven drama and brilliant acting from Nick Cheung and Nicholas Tse";
	schema:reviewBody "Dante Lam has found something of a creative muse in writer Jack Ng of late and their latest The Stool Pigeon marks their fourth straight collaboration together. It is also crafted out of the same mould as their earlier Beast Stalker Sniper and Fire of Conscience and audiences who have enjoyed the morally ambiguous characters and their dilemmas in these maledriven films will certainly enjoy this latest.Reuniting the duo of Nick Cheung and Nicolas Tse from Beast Stalker Lam reverses the good guybad guy roles played by Cheung and Tse earlier. In this film Cheung is on the right side of the law he plays Detective Don Lee a cop with his conscience wracked by guilt from the fate of his last stool pigeon or slang for 'informant'. Jabber played by Lam regular Liu KaiChi was almost slashed to death after his cover was blown and Don counts himself responsible for making the executive decision that blew Jabber's cover.Tse is the exconvict Ghost whom Don seeks out to be his new informant after police receive word that a wanted robber Barbarian Lu Yi is back in town for another heist. Ghost needs money to pay off his father's debt to a loanshark and reluctantly agrees despite being fully aware of the risks. For a good first hour Lam meticulously sketches out the relationship between Don and Ghost opposites in the eye of the law but forced by circumstance to befriend and even trust each other.A scene where Don teaches his fellow officers how to manage their informants illustrates this conflict beautifully he tells them they have to win the trust of their stool pigeons so they can get as much intel as possible but not to get too friendly at the same time for they may have to make difficult decisions in the line of duty. It is an unenviable position that Don himself knows personally and many of the film's most poignant scenes come from Don's regular visits to Jabber who has since become a vagabond.Besides delineating the complex relationship between police and informant Lam also takes care to develop his characters. Don's frequent visits to a dance studio hint of a personal tragedy that is only revealed later and Ghost's feelings for Barbarian's girlfriend Dee Kwai Lunmei only make it more difficult for him to extricate himself later on. The characters in Lam's films have always been flawed in one way or another but the attention that Lam pays this time round to his two central characters Don and Ghost ranks among one of his best.Amply deserving of praise too are Cheung and Tse. Having won Best Actor at both the Hong Kong Film Awards and Golden Horse Awards for his role in Beast Stalker Cheung turns in a wonderfully subtle performance here that conveys his character's anguish both in his line of work and his personal life. Because Cheung's acting is more restrained here Tse gets the chance to be in the spotlight and he more than delivers in a nuanced portrayal that fleshes out Ghost's struggles tiptoeing on the fine line of the law.Lam brings the intricately and impeccably plotted first half to a head in the next hour of the film and audiences familiar with Lam's films may naturally be expecting bigscale action sequences like those in Sniperor even Fire of Conscience. But perhaps surprisingly he doesn't give his audience the kind of visceral gratification this time round and some may find his unusual restraint a little frustrating.Not to say that he has lost his flair an exciting foot chase down the tight cramped aisles of Hong Kong's street markets culminating in a midday car chase will set to rest any such doubts nor that this isn't a taut thriller. It is both but Lam often ratchets up the tension before an impending action scene and then defuses it without his usual signature gunsandbullets extravanganza.It is still no reason why you should miss this thriller. While it doesn't feature as much by way of action as one would expect from a usual Dante Lam film its strong characterdriven drama still packs a solid punch. At a time when the Hong Kong film industry seems inundated by bigbudget China coproductions Dante has stuck to his guns to deliver a gritty trueblue Hong Kong cop thriller set entirely in the iconic streets of Kowloon. In a year of lean offerings from Hong Kong this will probably go down as one of the year's best.".

It is an unenviable position that Don himself knows personally and many of the film's most poignant scenes come from Don's regular visits to Jabber who has since become a vagabond.Besides delineating the complex relationship between police and informant Lam also takes care to develop his characters. Don's frequent visits to a dance studio hint of a personal tragedy that is only revealed later and Ghost's feelings for Barbarian's girlfriend Dee Kwai Lunmei only make it more difficult for him to extricate himself later on. The characters in Lam's films have always been flawed in one way or another but the attention that Lam pays this time round to his two central characters Don and Ghost ranks among one of his best.Amply deserving of praise too are Cheung and Tse. Having won Best Actor at both the Hong Kong Film Awards and Golden Horse Awards for his role in Beast Stalker Cheung turns in a wonderfully subtle performance here that conveys his character's anguish both in his line of work and his personal life. Because Cheung's acting is more restrained here Tse gets the chance to be in the spotlight and he more than delivers in a nuanced portrayal that fleshes out Ghost's struggles tiptoeing on the fine line of the law.Lam brings the intricately and impeccably plotted first half to a head in the next hour of the film and audiences familiar with Lam's films may naturally be expecting bigscale action sequences like those in Sniperor even Fire of Conscience. But perhaps surprisingly he doesn't give his audience the kind of visceral gratification this time round and some may find his unusual restraint a little frustrating.Not to say that he has lost his flair an exciting foot chase down the tight cramped aisles of Hong Kong's street markets culminating in a midday car chase will set to rest any such doubts nor that this isn't a taut thriller. It is both but Lam often ratchets up the tension before an impending action scene and then defuses it without his usual signature gunsandbullets extravanganza.It is still no reason why you should miss this thriller. While it doesn't feature as much by way of action as one would expect from a usual Dante Lam film its strong characterdriven drama still packs a solid punch. At a time when the Hong Kong film industry seems inundated by bigbudget China coproductions Dante has stuck to his guns to deliver a gritty trueblue Hong Kong cop thriller set entirely in the iconic streets of Kowloon. In a year of lean offerings from Hong Kong this will probably go down as one of the year's best.";

	schema:headline " Fate worse than undercover";
	schema:reviewBody "Hong Kong's crime thrillers are renowned for their portrayal of police undercover. The informant is almost an education  we the audience soon learn that informant has a more tragic fate. The undercover agent is a police officer servicing with pride and emerges a hero if he is successful in his assignment. An informant works under a business contract filed with the government attorney office for money alone. Both are of course dangerous and if they die the undercover agent dies a hero while the informant dies a nobody. I suspect that even the criminals have certain respect for the undercover agent but despise the informant.This movie takes some pain in portraying the tragic lives of an informant through story lines which are familiar to followers of Hong Kong crime movies. Some may fault it for having too many characters and stories but director Dante Lam's skillful and effective delivery of the stories renders the movie easy to follow. The action sequences will satisfy the most demanding action and violence junkies. The poignant blend in well. There is little humour in this generally gloomy affair but the farcical first encounter of the central pair of protagonist is rather ingenious.Nicholas Tse like Leonardo DiCaprio working hard on shedding the pretty boy image has achieved a measure of success in the movie as a recently discharged inmate recruited to be an informant. Nick Cheung often explosive on screen has also tried his own outofcharacter thing as the police officer who recruited Tse. He has done well in deliberate underplaying portraying an almost stoic softspoken man who caught between the authorities that often sells the informant short and the informant that he comes to care about. KWAI Lunmei is yet another case of casting against type doing quite an impressive job as a tough criminal from the mainland playing a brief interlude of Bonnie and Clyde with Tse. Acclaimed character actor LIU Kai Chi showcases his acting in a minor but impressive role as one of Cheung's informant driven to a mental breakdown.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is what Hong Kong action crime thrillers are made of with the sets being the real streets of the city upon which a high intense cop and robbers drama unfolds and engaging characters that you actually care about. Already having given us Fire of Conscience earlier this year it seems that there is nothing stopping hot property of the moment Dante Lam who had helmed hard hitting same genre movies such as Sniper and Beast Stalker which starred Liu Kai Chi Nicholas Tse and Nick Cheung in leading roles reuniting for Stool Pigeon looking set to have been improving film by film and frankly is fast becoming a firm favourite storyteller of mine for Asian crime thrillers after Johnnie To with his consistency for gripping edge of your seat material.Thanks to the success of Infernal Affairs we've seen in recent years a fair share of police dramas that deal with that of an undercover cop either battling his loyalty and allegiance his return to a life of normalcy or even have his persona spill over to real life through immense popularity in the cult character like Laughing Gor. We know that the police have as part of their investigative arsenal the infiltration of undercover cops but what's often overlooked is the role of the police informant in a leading role until now.Dante Lam's story is extremely engaging in its examination of this peculiar outsourced role where one is backed by the formalities of contract to define a relationship of transactional nature  material wealth in exchange for critical information with bonuses to come with milestones achieved too! But such dangerous work close to where the action is with risks involved doesn't impact a police personnel and this is clearly a win situation for the cops because this risk of being caught and maimedkilled in the course of an accidental discovery is transferred to a nonuniformed person often someone desperate enough and comfortable to be living on the fringes of society such as an excriminal. But being human the cops have to learn to not become closer than necessary to their informants so as to minimize guilty pangs should there be a need to no longer support them and literally to throw them to the sharks for the greater good  the tragic irony of it all.Nicholas Tse and Nick Cheung swap sides now from Beast Stalker and Tse plays the role of Ghost Jr an exconvict released only to find his sister being pimped by the underworld to pay off their dead father's gambling debt. After some deliberation he takes on the offer by Cheung's inspector Don and officially in the eyes of the law Ghost becomes Don's informant with a direct line to his handler and if necessary being able to waiver any arrest if made during the course of his work as an informant. His role is to infiltrate and report back on the gang activities of Barbarian Chinese actor Lu Yi and his wife played by Kwai LunMei who are planning a jewellery shop heist and are in need of a driver where Ghost's skills will come into handy.Just like how Donnie Yen is discovering a new lease of life in his career as an action hero Nick Cheung once overlooked as leading man material now finds new ground in crime thrillers and being equally adept at both positive and negative roles just brings out the wide spectrum of his acting abilities. Dante Lam's cop character so far have always been flawed and pained and being dedicated time meant a subplot involving his wife and relatives which serve to deepen the character's backstory. In fact the many human drama that Lam injects into his characters all provide them a lot of depth rather than to be just that onedimensional role most cops and robbers story tend to trap themselves into .For instance Kwai LunMei's gangster moll role is something that's totally different from her usual sweetie pie ones and she has enough of what it takes to pack a punch in this genre which is surprising to say the least in both delivery and providing to be the wildcard in Stool Pigeon. Boldly casting her against type is what I felt showed the courage of Lam and team to explore new ground including Stool Pigeon's premise and having seasoned actors each of whom have won acting awards in recent years also serves as an indicator that you're getting powerful performances all round.Actionwise Stool Pigeon is no sitting duck. While time is devoted to the human drama action is not just left to plain boring gunfights as there are a lot more moments here involving chases from vehicles to foot and hide and seek that provides most of the thrills with its superb editing and execution either in a crowded market evading a swarm of cops or between apartment units to avoid detection. Like most Dante Lam films the finale provides that bang for the buck and Stool Pigeon has one of the most intense sequences he had come up with thus far set in an abandoned school where the set design provides a visually arresting feast for the eyes while your heart feels and roots for characters going all out for each other's throats.I'd prefer this over Fire of Conscience and easily is a contender for one of the best films this year! Highly recommended and I'll be more than keen to watch this in its original Cantonese language track.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stool Pigeon marks Hong Kong director Dante Lam's latest production as a unofficial sequel to the 2008 hit Beast Stalker. Pairing up with Nicholas Tse and Nick Cheung the two leading actors from Beast Stalker Stool Pigeon has no doubt become one of the few worthy Hong Kong productions of the year.Beast Stalker features Tse as a detective and Cheung a halfblind hitman crosses path with each other and teaming up together to stop a crime. In Stool Pigeon both Tse and Cheung swapped their roles. Tse is now an exconvict nicknamed Ghost who unwillingly work as a informant for Don Lee Cheung in order to clear debts left by his late father and to rescue his only sister out of prostitution.Don plants Ghost into a group of robbers lead by wanted criminal Barbarian Lu Yi. Don wants Ghost to provide the information about Barbarian's plot to rob a jewelry shop so as to make an arrest. Ghost came across Barbarian's girlfriend Dee Kwei Lun Mei whom both is in love with each other after meeting each other years ago. When Don found out Ghost has been forced to join the robbery he find all ways to pull Ghost out of the situation.Lam have two productions released in theaters this year Fire of Conscience and Stool Pigeon. While critics finds Fire of Conscience seems to be a disappointment Stool Pigeon makes it better. Both movies discuss morality with the leading characters seems to share a similar background. Lam creates a role of male police detective losing his loved ones with two different outcomes Leon Lai uses violence to solve crimes in Fire of Conscience Nick Cheung redeems his sins quietly by helping the people around him quietly in Stool Pigeon.While Fire of Conscience seems to lack details in certain scenes Stool Pigeon makes it up by detailing every aspects of the characters involved specifically. Here we are able to see why Don is trying to pull Ghost out of the robbery his hesitance in using his former informant leads to his informant being taken on revenge thus losing the informant's sanity.Lam also displays how people standing on both sides of the law can appear in different scenarios. Fire of Conscience portrays two detectives standing on both sides of the law with Leon Lai tracking down and stopping his new partner Richie Jen from leaning on the wrong side of the law. In Stool Pigeon audience can tell directly that Nicholas Tse and Nick Cheung portrays two characters on different sides of the law easily with one as a gangster another a detective. However both ends up in a path where both do not wish to take which is to stand on the wrong side of the law and using unethical methods to save themselves. Ultimately both Tse and Cheung's role fits in the tag line of Stool Pigeon Good and bad are both sinners.Taiwanese actress Kwei Lun Mei sheds her image of the girl next door with her role of Dee who is a woman with a past. Kwei does not have much appearance in Stool Pigeon but her role makes it important as anybody else especially her role is more than just explaining about the relationships between Ghost and Barbarian. Both Tse and Cheung has appeared in taking a more matured role with more refined skills to portray them. Tse continues with his bad boy image but much older and tougher than the similar roles he taken years ago. Cheung appears more refined throughout his acting careers which he did not disappoints the audience.Overall Stool Pigeon is not your usual crime thriller that does not require thinking. A through analysis on the plot and characters are required to understand Stool Pigeon which definitely helps in one understanding the movie.".

	schema:headline " Great film by a great Director proof positive that its Asian Cinema thats the future";
	schema:reviewBody "The Stool Pigeon is a tense Hong Kong crime thriller from one of Asia's most prolific crime thriller directors Dante Lam. While the film follows many familiar tropes of detective films such as the good natured criminal and the detective determined to succeed at all costs there is a persistent visual style and a well developed set up for the excellent action sequences. It is quite gratifying to see a film that isn't just about a bank robbery but real character growth especially in Hong Kong cinema which as of late has been clearly out shined by South Korea. The story follows Police Detective Don Lee Nick Cheung and his work with a recently paroled gang informant who is out to save his sister from a life of prostitution because of a debt owed by their father. Lee is the experienced detective who throughout his career has needed to investigate track and convince informants to help with a case but the problem is that he's had trouble protecting these informants and has conflicts with senior management. Ghost Junior Nicholas Tse proves his skills early on in a cool sprint race through the streets of HK and is soon recruited to work with a major Robbery suspect known as Barbarian. The racing scenes are handled with a lot of flair and sufficiently loud sound design. The soundtrack works well as the jazz mixes with the suspense soundtrack to bring heightened tension to the deceptive game these cops and criminals play. In a lot of ways it reminded me of Michael Mann's Heat 1995 though Stool Pigeon had a faster pace and it's attention to detail was not nearly as well developed. Hiccups such as Don Lee's forgetful wife subplot were a little silly. With much less emphasis on CGI effects the action is visceral and shocking. It is certainly not the type of 'PG' American experience we've become accustomed to whereby explosions and slow motion action has overblown any subtlety of realism. There are machete wielding gang members and they do take revenge. While this is not a film about happy endings it finishes with an effective and satisfying conclusion. The Stool Pigeon is a rewarding experience with cinematography capturing the streets of Hong Kong in an often beautiful and slow boiling state but the action choreography and character clashes keep it tight and exciting through to the end. Nominated for best film at last year's Hong Kong Film Awards The Stool Pigeon proves that the Asian resurgence will continue. It's not just China and South Korea who are raising expectations.".

While the film follows many familiar tropes of detective films such as the good natured criminal and the detective determined to succeed at all costs there is a persistent visual style and a well developed set up for the excellent action sequences. It is quite gratifying to see a film that isn't just about a bank robbery but real character growth especially in Hong Kong cinema which as of late has been clearly out shined by South Korea. The story follows Police Detective Don Lee Nick Cheung and his work with a recently paroled gang informant who is out to save his sister from a life of prostitution because of a debt owed by their father. Lee is the experienced detective who throughout his career has needed to investigate track and convince informants to help with a case but the problem is that he's had trouble protecting these informants and has conflicts with senior management. Ghost Junior Nicholas Tse proves his skills early on in a cool sprint race through the streets of HK and is soon recruited to work with a major Robbery suspect known as Barbarian. The racing scenes are handled with a lot of flair and sufficiently loud sound design. The soundtrack works well as the jazz mixes with the suspense soundtrack to bring heightened tension to the deceptive game these cops and criminals play. In a lot of ways it reminded me of Michael Mann's Heat 1995 though Stool Pigeon had a faster pace and it's attention to detail was not nearly as well developed. Hiccups such as Don Lee's forgetful wife subplot were a little silly. With much less emphasis on CGI effects the action is visceral and shocking. It is certainly not the type of 'PG' American experience we've become accustomed to whereby explosions and slow motion action has overblown any subtlety of realism. There are machete wielding gang members and they do take revenge. While this is not a film about happy endings it finishes with an effective and satisfying conclusion. The Stool Pigeon is a rewarding experience with cinematography capturing the streets of Hong Kong in an often beautiful and slow boiling state but the action choreography and character clashes keep it tight and exciting through to the end. Nominated for best film at last year's Hong Kong Film Awards The Stool Pigeon proves that the Asian resurgence will continue. It's not just China and South Korea who are raising expectations.";

I have been reviewing the films they distribute for a while now and they have been consistently good. Stool Pigeon is no exception adding the genre of police action to the martial arts stories they have delivered us in the past. I assume not all Asian films are this good in fact I know they are not so whoever does acquisitions for Well Go needs a raise.What is this film? A bit of mystery a lot of action a crime thriller. It really should appeal to a wide audience. If you like films like French Connection or Snatch I think this will be your film. While not quite a masterpiece it really does tell a strong interesting and emotional story. It is a film I am eager to watch a second time.The DVDBD it comes as a combo pack has some nice features on most notably the variety of languages and subtitles. You might prefer Cantonese with English subtitles. Perhaps you prefer English dubbing. Then again maybe you speak Cantonese and would rather watch it without dubbing or subs... you are able to do any of these.".

A top Taiwanese gangster is in town though looking for a big score in a HK jewelry shop so our cop recruits a new informer  a street racer just out of jail who needs money to pay off his father's debt which has led to his sister becoming a hooker  and infiltrates him into the gang as their wheelman. Throw in a tragic gangsters moll and you've got a corking Bmovie plot that moves fast and hits hard. The machete attacks are savage although thankfully more is suggested than shown and the final fight in an abandoned school is nerve wracking in its intensity. The emotional side is less sure though especially the hero's ludicrous back story after his last informant got hurt he got drunk slept with a floozy contracted syphilis gave it to his pregnant wife who chucked herself out of a window after learning the disease would make their child handicapped and now she has amnesia the cop is trying to reromance her. It's insanely melodramatic especially compared to the authentic and matterof fact depiction of how the cops and robbers work. Still this is a great film with excellent scenes of action and tension.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Brutally honest' would be the term I'd use to best describe this particular feature. Although the term 'brutal' is often associated with the violent content exhibited in a film the level of blood in The Stool Pigeon never takes away from the storyline.Don Lee Nick Cheung is an officer still suffering the ramifications of past decisions that led to his former informant Jabber Kai Chi Liu been discovered by the men he was snitching on. Although Lee is attempting to atone for his mistakes this is made increasingly more difficult by his boss Li Shengcheong who adamantly believes the ends justify the means. If ever he had a white whale it would be Barbarian Lu Yi a brilliant and psychotically violent thief who has recently returned to promulgate another job.Advised to insert an informant into his crew Lee discovers Ghost Jr Nicholas Tse a young man on the verge of being released from prison whose adept driving skills would make him an asset to Barbarian. Immediately turning Lee's offer down Ghost Jr instead opts to spend time with his sister Sherman Chung who has been thrust into a life of prostitution to pay off their late father's debts. Though their father is largely unexplored his actions have inevitably shaped their lives which forces Ghost Jr to make a life changing decision.Under Lee's directive he initiates contact with TaiPing Philip Keung the leader of a gang whose cronies have assisted Barbarian on previous jobs. Descending into a world where every move could potentially be his last the impact of danger betrayal and paranoia continuously gnawing at the viewers Ghost Jr quickly finds solace in Barbarian's unappreciated girlfriend Dee Gwei Lunmei their immediate mutual attraction based upon a history that is explored over the course of the story. But events begin to spiral out of control and one question that later emerges is this will Ghost Jr live to see his dream of saving his sister fulfilled? Although Lee advises officers who will later have informants of their own not to become emotionally attached he hypocritically is unable to separate his personal feelings from the scenario. The use of scenes detailing previous events that have recently occurred over the course of his career demonstrates that it is not only the informants who have a grueling existence the police having an equally unpleasant role. Having made a number of decisions and mistakes that he is not proud of Lee is able to admit his faults making him a sympathetic and respectable character to have headlining this feature. The relationship he has with his wife Cher Miao Pu provides the audience with not only another source of emotional depth but a source of hope for the future.Due to his screen time though Mr Tse's portrayal of Ghost Jr is just as proficient it is overshadowed by the focus that seems to continuously drift towards Mr. Cheung. Despite been a criminal and persistently asking for money Ghost Jr is a likable character not only for his gentlemanly qualities but his unflinching devotion to family wanting desperately to be his sister's hero. Ms. Mei also deserved additional screen time her portrayal of Dee effectively developing a character who although compassionately emotional is capable of blunt ferocity her life choices based upon what is happening right now rather than on what is right.As aforementioned Lee's past is explored over the course of several scenes while Ghost Jr and Dee's is often articulated verbally. It would have been beneficial for more depth to have been provided to their backstories though the decision to focus more on Lee may have been so audiences had the opportunity to acknowledge the sacrifices officers are forced to make the shared pain of Ghost Jr and Dee needing no further attention for their lives effectively represent the grueling nature of their existences.A moment during the film involving a car race is quite possibly the film's most unenthusiastic moment the scene despite been well choreographed lacking any real entertainment. Unable to live up to the outstanding visuals audiences have been awed by in the Fast and the Furious franchise the scene appears to be comprised of clich crashes and sounds that fail to cement the viewer in the moment. This aside The Stool Pigeon is not an action movie and for the most part it's a plot driven police drama with substantial depth provided to its characters.Although firearms make an appearance more often than not machetes and other serrated weapons are used by villainous characters as they pursue their hapless victims. The sound of flesh been sliced alongside the screams of agony really impacts the viewer with not only the horror articulated during these torturous moments but the ever mounting tension.Unlike other films dedicated to portraying the lives of police officers The Stool Pigeon does not rely upon exaggerated footage instead capturing the brutal realism of the lives officers and informants alike struggle to cope with. Emotionally indepth and thought provoking the audience are also inclined to work as detectives to piece the storyline that isn't always set in chronological order together which makes for a continuously interesting feature. By the end of the film viewers may feel the need to question who the real antagonists are in the film and who really are the victims.".

It has a few highlights such as the car chase with White Christmas playing in the background or the jewlery store robbery or even the fight in the abandoned room filled with chairs and tables but other than those memorable moments the rest seems like filler.

It's emotional and you get to see from both sides and their unspoken rationales and they're both right in their own respect and sometimes there's nothing more they can do. I was drawn into the dilemma the unsettling conscience the consequences of one's action the fear the adrenaline rush the pressure the guilt etc. The action sequence is not nice and pretty like that of Jackie Chan's.

	schema:reviewBody "The only Chuck P. book I own. It's a very funny book about lust and salvation and here it is on screen in...pretty good form. That is to say I was a little disappointed with the ending in particular which strikes a very different tone not terrible just different....but that's neither here nor there.Choke is the story of Victor medschool dropout who takes care of his 70's radical mom now suffering from dementia and dying after years of drug use and mental instability. In order to pay for her upkeep Victor pulls double duty at his two jobs one as an employee at a Colonial American theme park and two choking on food in restaurant so that those who save his life will feel obligated to help him out with cash from time to time. Who would save someone's life only to let them die once you know their sad penniless over exaggerated story? Victor targets the wealthy and affluent You don't wanna get saved by some waiter he says in one of many direct addresses to the audience. The broken 4th wall reminiscent of Fight Club is taken directly from the book and one of the films stronger techniques.In the hospital he meets a young doctor who assists him in translating his mother's diary which leads to shocking questions about Victor's origins and his father or lack there of.Victor goes to sex addict meetings usually just to have sex in the bathroom with fellow addicts. While his best friend Denny a chronic masturbator begins taking his first shaky steps to recover which involves romancing a Stripper and collecting rocks for each day his sobriety idle hands are the devils playground. The sex addiction and the need to save his mom are the twin turbines that propel this film and by the end they are both so clearly intertwined it escapes being exploitative.I enjoyed this version of Choke which was kinda of like ChokeLight but still very funny if only slightly missing the aim of the novel the heady and vulgar mix of the sacred and the profane. That is to say important subplots and mainplot points get muted we know why Victor chokes there are more reasons than I stated above but we don't get to see the people who fund his faints here as we do in the book and so that aspect of the story seems a little disconnected. As do Denny and the rocks another vital story element for me got put on the backburner here. Denny replaces one fetish with another and most of the rooms of his house are filled with rocks.Actually they shot this ending you can see pictures online but decided against it before release. Okay but everyone always says the book is better than the movie I know I know I just had to get that out.What's left of Choke though is commanded by Sam Rockwell who is only improving as an actor and Angelica Houston who needs no intro. While it's not as conceptually taught as I would have liked its still really really funny and at a few moments a bit moving Ive got a personal soft spot for movies with visits to the demented in hospitals The Savages is especially hard to watch at least for me.It's an allegorical sex comedy but it's also a very accessible one considering the weirdness of the material. It's a more personal story than Fight Club and almost an opposite ideology building anything versus tearing down everything but told in the same sardonic writerly tone weave come to expect from Palahniuk.In the end I just wanted more but it was fun and the story was brought to life mostly just as I had imagined it when reading.Also it's got the funniest and perhaps the only funny rape scene ever filmed it is and it's not what it sounds like.".

	schema:headline " Not sure how to feel about it";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie left me in a strangely ambivalent state after I watched it because I'm not sure if I'm judging it on its actual merits or my expectations. Having been a fan of Chuck Palahniuk's novel I was expecting something brash frenetic and perfectly offensive but in a good way. The problem is that while the novel was blunt and vulgar spelling out every bit of Victor Mancini's sexual exploits in almost academic detail the movie stops a bit short of pushing the edge and instead leaves a lot of it up to suggestion. Another reason that I'm not sure how I felt about it is because the director took a unique approach to the work that I'm still trying to decide if I liked or not. You see Chuck Palahniuk's novels have a very distinctive narrative style to them and in Fight Club also based on one of Chuck's books director David Fincher emulated it perfectly. I'm talking mostly about Chuck's usage of repetition with lines such as I am Jack's colon Choke's director Clark Gregg chose not to emulate this and instead brought the text of the book to life without mimicking it's distinctive narrative. So if you're a fan of Chuck's work this may bother you. On the other hand it does help Choke stand out on its own merits and not feel like it's trying to build off of the success of Fight Club.So for those of you who haven't read the book how does it stand? Well as I said before considering how much more graphic and indecent this movie's source material was I think the movie missed out on a lot of its potential. I almost feel like Clark Gregg went too easy on all of the characters making them come off as sympathetic when they worked better as being completely hopeless. It's also not as funny as it could have been since a lot of Victor's the protagonist's interactions with everybody from the sex addicts to the people in the historic reenactment village to the people he pretends to choke for were all summarized too much and had much more potential for comedy. Overall i'd say this movie is alright but could have been done better.".

	schema:headline " Consistently amusing lowbudget treat";
	schema:reviewBody "As of writing Choke has not yet been given official distribution and will not get it for about another month and a half at least depending on your location. However I managed to see it at the annual local film festival. I'll bring this review up when the film gets a wider release but for now here is my initial opinion.Choke is the story of sexaddicted loser Victor Mancini Sam Rockwell. Victor's main concern in life is to keep his demented mother Anjelica Huston alive and in hospital. He does this in the hope of finding out the truth about his strangely absent father. To pay the bills he pretends to choke on his dinner in fancy restaurants and plays off his saviour's heroism for financial gain.I think the majority of readers here are at the very least aware of the existence of Fight Club the only other major movie aside from Choke to be based off a Chuck Palahniuk novel. Most of the people who will seek out Choke will do it mainly because of the connection to either Fight Club or the Choke novel or both as the case may be. Of course I'll have to play the comparison game here but it has to be said  Choke is a very different beast to both its source novel and its spiritual predecessor Fight Club.Anyone who's read Palahniuk's writing will know that his books are frequently dark very twisted and somewhat humorous. Words like diseased and cancerous come to mind. It's this same feeling that infected both the Fight Club and Choke novels and made them perverse joys to read. Palahniuk's touch even translated perfectly in David Fincher's adaptation. With Clark Gregg's adaptation of Choke the stylish darkness is traded for a far more conventional quasiindependent comic approach. Strangely enough this seems to suit Choke even better.After all Choke is first and foremost a comedy. At a guess I'd say it's roughly 80 per cent faithful to the original novel more on that later with a large number of jokes lifted from the novel. The laugh factor was a strange thing. On one hand the laughs managed to stay more or less consistent with none of the jokes falling flat. On the other hand I personally didn't feel like anything was too funny. Everything raised a genuine chuckle but as for anything approaching strugglingtobreathe humour there wasn't much there. It makes me wonder what's better a comedy with consistent chuckling or sporadic bursts of hilarious moments. Not too sure.Regardless the film manages to be an enjoyable experience. Firsttimer Gregg manages to handle his duties which include writing directing and even one very amusing bit part with confidence balancing comedy with drama effectively. The acting is impressive to say the least. Rockwell manages to nail Victor perfectly yet it's Brad William Henke that manages to steal several scenes as Victor's friend Denny. Another treat is the score which is an interesting blend of different styles.Choke not only manages to be an entertaining comedy it also becomes a very good example of how to streamline a 300page novel into a movie that's just shy of the 90minute mark. The only problem with it depends on whether or not your sense of humour agrees with the film's but if this film was already on your tosee list that shouldn't be too much of a problem.".

I felt that there was so much more to delve into psychologically that Choke the novel did with sex addiction and the story and idea will not spoil here of who the character Victor Mancini was or thinks he is. Rockwell's great acting did a lot to pick up this slag I do have to mention.One thing I did like which was also done with the ending of Fight Club another Palahniuk novel is that again will not spoil here the finish to the Choke film was more satisfying then the deus ex machina endings that Palahniuk sometimes well many times does with his stories.Kelly Macdonald who is wonderful in anything that she is in as well as the other supporting actors and actresses kept the story alive and in a wonderful way.The pacing of the film as well as the narrative was very much Palahniuk and this is a pace and narrative that is one of a kind and most interesting to view which is aside from the usually predictable flow of the other films of today. I did give this movie a 710 but I still believe that it is a movie that should be seen by anyone who likes to laugh especially at things they don't think they would laugh at. Also because the overall story is hilarious and is satisfyingly unique and the acting makes the film whole too.And did I mention Sam Rockwell was great?".

I haven't read Palahniuk's novel but the humour and world in Gregg's 'Choke' feels very much like one that Palahniuk would create. 'Choke' is a dark comedy. It's hilarious but underneath the surface there are layers of darkness. The film also touches plenty of complex themes such as trauma dementia sexual addiction emotional numbness desire love and redemption which are smoothly included within the story. Yet it is above all a comedy and while the characters appear as hideous losers on the surface we gradually get to like them. Sam Rockwell is terrific as the messedup troubled Victor. Only Rockwell could play such a character so naturally. In addition he is supported by a fantastic Angelica Huston a quirky Kelly MacDonald and a chronically horny turned romantic Brad William Henke. There's a hilarious 'rape' sequence with Heather Burns. I never thought I would describe that word to describe rape but one just has to watch that scene to get what I mean. The film is packed in a tight 90 minutes but I wish it was longer as I found myself wanting more. 'Choke' is clearly not for everybody but it is certainly worthwhile for those interested in adult humour and psychology.".

I understand that it would have been difficult to capture it on film but even if it was hinted by the film that all the times that Ida was driving around young Victor it was when she had escaped from the institution it would have made the scenes more powerful.

It is a dumbed down powerless version of the source material and can only be classified as a missed opportunity. I mean one can't be expected to chug on a warm fizzedout Coke in the same way as a chilled freshly opened one! There is just a right way to treat certain stuff and in case of Choke...well you get the point!

	schema:headline " Not perfect but Rockwell shines in this fairly well adapted raunchy tale";
	schema:reviewBody "Choke tells the story of Victor Mancini Sam Rockwell a sex addict working in a colonial times reproduction. His mother Ida Anjelica Huston suffers from dementia and spends most of her time thinking Victor is someone else mainly long dead lawyers during his frequent visits to the hospital. To pay the bills Mancini has a bit of a unique talent he chokes on food in swanky restaurants and practically forces innocent bystanders into saving him from death.I read the book Choke a few years ago thinking it would be same in vain to writer Chuck Palahniuk's near flawless Fight Club and of course David Fincher's incredible film. But Choke was nothing like it and anyone going to see the film thinking it will be is in for a disappointment.But like Fight Club before it Choke is adapted quite well from its raunchy source material. The story is quite liberally changed in some instances but in others it is an almost literal recreation. Mancini is a wellrounded character with bizarrely comic traits that are pure Palahniuk. I found myself almost crying from laughing so hard at the comic mishappenings he got himself into frequently calling back to the events in the book. It was strange however that so little an amount of time is spent on the choking that Mancini has down practically to an art form but then its offtherails frank portrayal of sex was always much stronger. Firsttime director Clark Gregg does an excellent job making this character so true to Palahniuk's work that you can forgive him for glossing off something so integral to the plot but at least it makes for a whole lot less convoluted confusing and downright silly third act. Gregg's addition of the little idiosyncrasies of Mancini's lifestyle small cuts to previous sexual encounters frequent breastfilled day dreams only further strengthens how close the film cuts to its source material.But despite being 92 minutes long I think Gregg could have done with a touch more editing. The film is not lengthy at all many sequences practically zip by in the hyperkinetic sense of Fight Club before it but the film feels quite long in some instances. Despite their importance to the story the flashback sequences involving a much younger looking Huston and young Victor playing by Jonah Bobo drag on endlessly nearly losing their train of thought midscene. Some of the scenes between Mancini and Ida's doctor Paige Marshall Kelly Macdonald also have a habit of dragging their heels. Some cuts here and there in these scenes could have only benefited the film. As well Gregg's doing away with the third act leaves some subplots hanging in the balance never to fully integrate themselves with the film as a whole. Nonreaders may not even notice some of them including one glaring omission but it may strike those who have read it as quite odd.The supporting cast is pretty well rounded. Macdonald does a great job in her scenes as do Bijou Phillips in a small role as one of Mancini's coworkers and Gregg himself as the lead character in the colonial times reproduction. I had failed to realize it was him when watching the film but he brings a special greatness to every one of his character's lines.I was a little disappointed however in Brad William Henke's portrayal of Mancini's friend Denny however. Not because Henke does a bad job in the role but because he does not get nearly enough time on screen. He steals many of his scenes and seems to know just how to frame Denny frequently shifting from the downtrodden weakling of a sidekick to the strong willed individual Mancini wishes he could be. Henke is having fun in the goofy role and it is obvious that he is very comfortable doing it. He does not have a whole lot of credits on his filmography but I can only help this role makes him a lot more accessible in Hollywood. More scenes could have only reinforced the notion.Huston looking much older than usual for the majority of the film is excellent in her portrayal of Ida. She does not look to be doing much but the emotions she conveys simply through her facial movements and expressions is enough to suggest that she is doing more than simply phoning in her performance. The role may not seem too tough but she pulls it off without breaking a sweat. Despite disliking the flashback scenes they only further developed her character into the closet psycho she is so great at playing.But the movie rests on Rockwell's shoulders and he is clearly up to the task. The breath of life he gives Victor Mancini is almost poetic in how personal it looks and sounds. No he does not give the same energy that Brad Pitt does as Tyler Durdan but this does not seem to bother Rockwell in the least. He plays Mancini just the way he needs to in order to make him a believable regular guy suffering from addiction problems and his need to please his overbearing mother even as she is slowly withering away. You can see the pain in his face right from minute one and never once does he let us take this idealism for granted. He uses it and characterizes Mancini with a great breadth of thought not regularly seen in contemporary American cinema.While it is not perfect at all Choke is a wonderfully valiant attempt at recapturing the nearly demented nature of a Palahniuk book. His unique voice is captured quite fluidly within the film and writerdirector Gregg can be quite proud of his work here. With the help of a great supporting cast Rockwell practically lights up the screen in a way that only further proves his greatness as an actor.710.".

Perhaps for this reason with the exception of his enormous cult hit Fight Club Palahniuk's work has seldom been adapted for the big screen with movie executives likely preferring to work with plots which they can be sure their viewers will understand and not result in heart attacks from either repulsion or outrage. As such writerdirector Clark Gregg's adaptation of Palahniuk's Choke is a daring move  after all how often does one see the tale of a sardonic sexaddict playing on the sympathies of those who save him from choking to death in restaurants to pay for his mother's hospital bills gracing the marquees? And yet as surprising as it may seem for all of the caustically humorous overtones at the heart of Choke lies a surprisingly tender and fascinatingly complex character study brimming with humanity and pathos... and yes loads of gratuitous sex on the side. Those expecting more along the lines of Fight Club's nihilistic social commentary and brutal violence may find themselves disappointed as Choke's sordid portrait of a man so used to mindlessly numbing his pain coming to terms with his flaws and potential for good almost by accident proves a far more sympathetic look albeit one with graphic and perverse sexual content. That being said writerdirector Gregg's screenplay is a razor sharp medley of slashing Palahniuk wit and biting oneliners as well as surprisingly poignant character revelations blending an increasingly eclectic myriad of events into an impressively concise the film runs only 89 minutes yet still cohesive storyline. If a flaw is to be found it lies in the film's ending which flirts which but mercifully avoids succumbing to convention and provides what may be one plot twist too many making the finale somewhat unnecessarily cluttered and yet strangely fitting but in such an impressively unique work such minute concerns are easily forgiven. One of the film's many blessings is the casting of the supremely talented Sam Rockwell as Victor Mancini the sort of lead role he is far too often deprived of. It is a testament to Rockwell's immense skill and charisma that he manages not only to sympathize a character who ultimately sets out to make himself dislikeable but also evokes both hilarity and pathos in the least likely places delivering one of the most remarkable performances in recent memory. Similarly Angelica Huston is incendiary as Mancini's mother in flashbacks shown to be an even less stable parent before her dementia and her interactions with her son prove surprisingly poignant and emotionally wrenching. The tremendously likable Brad William Henke raises many a laugh as Mancini's similarly sexaddicted best friend and Kelly Macdonald gives a quirky but charming performance as the doctor who may despite Mancini's best efforts end up being a love interest. Director Gregg has a hilarious supporting role as the earnest head of Victor's collonial historical interpreter site and Jonah Bobo proves a rising talent to watch as Victor's childhood self.Darkly hilarious sublimely subversive and yet hiding surprising pathos and heart Choke proves one of the most offbeat films of the year and is all the more entertaining for it. While the film is without question not for everyone those willing to stomach the acerbic and often disturbing humour and hefty sexual content may discover one of the most darkly enjoyable movie experiences of quite some time. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "It took almost a decade for a second movie to come out from the literary source that is Chuck Palahniuk. David Fincher owned Fight Club making it a cinematic wonder enhancing the novel and becoming a wonderful companion to it. Rumors swirled afterwards about all his other stories being optioned for film translation but after 911 halted Survivor's chances and Invisible Monsters' progress ended it didn't seem good. But here comes 2008 with an unlikely savior in Clark Gregg and all of a sudden we have Choke in cinematic glory to bring the author back into the spotlight. I love his books and all of them have a pop culture postmodern feel showing sensibilities that can succeed on the big screen. Is Gregg the optimum choice to help the cause? Possibly not but this is a very narrative driven story without the flash and flair of other novels so his inexperience helming a film isn't overtly noticeable. While it is not as good as the bookhow many actually arethis film keeps the tone and essence intact bringing to life the words on the page. It's subtle and subversive and kept me entertained throughout.Gregg has been in Hollywood for a while now a familiar face to David Mamet fans and for all you kiddies an actor in Ironman. The role he gives himself here is a good one the stickler boss of the colonial theme park that our leads are employed at. It's a thankless role and definitely the straightman of the ensemble however it is his directing that is really put on display. He doesn't try to go beyond his limits and I commend him for it. Singlehandedly saving the world from possibly going Palahniuk adaptationless forever I have nothing but praise for the man. There are some camera tricks utilized most obviously the quick cuts between our lead Victor Mancini's sexaddicted visions of every woman being naked to their fully clothed reality but it's more or less a strict linear narrative. I do have to mention the final shot which carries on as the credits play a long take of two leads making out. In extreme closeup the highly personal nature of what is displayed leaves you somewhat uncomfortable due to the length but also happy at the idea of these two partaking in the action. It's the boldest stroke Gregg makes and being the last thing we see the strongest most memorable moment for me.It's all a comedy from start to finish but one laced in good writing and subtlety. There are no real laughoutloud moments except perhaps the revelation of a man being blind just a consistent journey of sarcasm heartfelt humor and genuine witty banter. Victor played perfectly by Sam Rockwell really breathing life into the character as I envisioned him when reading the book is a man that goes to restaurants and deliberately chokes so that some unsuspecting Good Samaritan can save him. These people now have a bond with him feeling responsible for his life and in effect send him gifts and money whenever asked or on the anniversary of their fateful encounter. As one eyewitness's account says her son was about to be divorced until his sense of bravery at saving Victor made his wife fall in love all over again. This kind of thing is a common trend with our lead his uncanny ability to be devious and evil yet always have the outcome end up being generous and profound to those he is wronging. No wonder the guy becomes glued to the possibility he may be the second coming of Christbelieve me it's actually a plot thread and one that holds the film together.Rockwell's manic overabundance of life becomes a whirlwind sleeping with random women at every turn hanging out with his masturbationobsessed best friend Brad William Henke who hopefully will start getting more work after this angering his boss by using 20th century objects in a colonial environment and visiting his mother who is suffering from dementia that believes he is her old deceased lawyers. Only Palahniuk's warped mind could come up with this stuff let alone tie it all together into a coherent plot that is interesting to follow through to its conclusion. A burgeoning relationship with a young nurse at the home Kelly Macdonald trying to hide her Scottish accent for who knows what reason adds some conflict and space for Victor to finally seek help for himself and begin step four of the sexaddict program. Having a lifetime of pain brought on by the one person he loved Anjelica Huston as his mother keeps him closed off to the world making it strange for him when he finally finds someone he can open himself to.There is so much going on it'd be tough to talk about without either ruining the story or ruining the joke's setup. Choke is definitely not for everyone the humor is probably too risqu for some and the subject matter too eccentric and modern for others. Palahniuk who has a nice background cameo at the end uses thinly veiled satire to bring us into his surreal interpretations of reality and be able to find ourselves living there. It is definitely one of his smallest scale novels as far as craziness goes but also one of his most accessible. For that reason and because Gregg deftly adapted it with a respect to the source material we have a resounding success. Hopefully allowing us to be brought back into his world of miscreants and fiends with a piece such as this will mean the more outthere stories will finally find their way to Hollywood. Scratch that. How about to a nice indie company that will do it right?".

	onyx:emotionText "It took almost a decade for a second movie to come out from the literary source that is Chuck Palahniuk. David Fincher owned Fight Club making it a cinematic wonder enhancing the novel and becoming a wonderful companion to it. Rumors swirled afterwards about all his other stories being optioned for film translation but after 911 halted Survivor's chances and Invisible Monsters' progress ended it didn't seem good. But here comes 2008 with an unlikely savior in Clark Gregg and all of a sudden we have Choke in cinematic glory to bring the author back into the spotlight. I love his books and all of them have a pop culture postmodern feel showing sensibilities that can succeed on the big screen. Is Gregg the optimum choice to help the cause? Possibly not but this is a very narrative driven story without the flash and flair of other novels so his inexperience helming a film isn't overtly noticeable. While it is not as good as the bookhow many actually arethis film keeps the tone and essence intact bringing to life the words on the page. It's subtle and subversive and kept me entertained throughout.Gregg has been in Hollywood for a while now a familiar face to David Mamet fans and for all you kiddies an actor in Ironman. The role he gives himself here is a good one the stickler boss of the colonial theme park that our leads are employed at.

	schema:reviewBody "This is actually a review from someone who read the novel before watching and since I'm sure anyone interested in this movie have had watched or read Choke novel or Fight Club I won't make a synopsis of the film.I'm going to start with the cons I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 mainly because of its cinematography there was zero creativity involved in it. From start to finish you never get to see and let alone appreciate the surroundings in which the characters are. With this lack of creativeness it seemed like the environment from every scene was a cheap set and not actual places. There's no introduction to the city in which Victor the protagonist lives his work the mental facility etc.This leaves the movie with full of dullness and no life to it switching from one scene to the next with just the actors interacting with one another with no pleasant detail to it. Some scenes could have been better OR longer for example the first choke scene in the restaurant although nice it seemed pretty rushed. And talking about longer scenes comes my third con its length. This movie is almost 1hr and half and I'm sure if they made it at least 2hrs long it could have been better but that's just my opinion.The jokes are pretty faithful to the novel and most of them will at least manage to get a chuckle out of you. The protagonist sometimes narrate some scenes a la Fight Club which is a nice touch. The acting is very good and Sam Rockwell perfectly portrayed Victor Mancini as the reckless sex addict. Brad William Henke Denny seemed out of place in this movie since his true character should have been skinny instead of tall and bulked. Same thing with Victor's mom Ida Mancini Anjelica Huston which they portrayed her kind of healthy instead of a sick skinny woman.Finally the movie is very good and entertaining with its dark humor but it seriously lack in the cinematography and length department.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've never watched a movie and been left with an overwhelming impulse to hunt down the director and flog them repeatedly with a strand of anal beads.....until now! Clark Gregg took a brilliant book ready to stand side by side on the silver screen next to Fight Club and instead threw up a hollow shell that really just amounted to a retelling of the plot points from the book. He left out the most important element which is of course Palahniuk's sharp witted deadpan narration.As other people have touched on Fincher and Ed Norton nailed it in Fight Club but in this film Clark Gregg absolutely ruined it. Palahniuk is a brilliant satirist a modern day Kurt Vonnegut but without his narrative voice reacting to all of the ridiculous things going on in the story it feels more like an episode of My Name is Earl than a Palahniuk story.Watching the movie you get the sense that even the actors know it's not working and are just going through the motions the best they can. Clark basically wrote an outline of all the plot points from the book and tried to mimic them leaving out most of palahniuk's narration and not adding any imagination style or wit. The voice over narration he does include leaves out 95 of Palahniuk's best material. The book had me belly laughing time and again. Palahniuk's writes in simple language but he has a brilliant dry wit and cynicism that's unmistakable.It's like Clark Greg was afraid to copy finchers fight club style so he went in a completely opposite mind numbingly generic direction. Director Clark Greg also the screenwriter had the nerve to cast himself in the role as the magistrate of colonial dunsboro. A character that was present perhaps one scene in the book Clark writes himself in multiple new scenes for the character none of which are funny. Go figure.Why is it not surprising Clark Gregg's directing credits only include this movie. Thank God I'm not the only one that believes he should never be behind a camera again.If anyone has yet to read the book please please don't let this atrocity scare you away. The book is absolutely brilliant!".

With its cheapcomedystyle staging  camerawork storyspoiling often nonsensical narration and emotionally blunted tone which sacrifices feeling for laughs until it is too late to care Choke plays out as a most ordinary movie  and that despite the soul searching psycho sexual trip promised by Chuck Palahniuk's eponymous novel upon which the script is based. Sam Rockwell plays Victor a sex addict with a heart of gold whose goal is to cajole the secret of his father's identity from his loony hospitalbound mom Ira Angelica Huston reprising another nebulous variation of 'the deserter mother' see The Darjeeling Limited. At the hospital Victor meets Paige Kelly Macdonald playing a mousy uptight Midwestern girl the one nurse with whom he hasn't slept. In his attempt to do just that he discovers A Paige has befriended his mother and can help him discover his family history B thanks to the marvels of modern experimental medicine and perhaps mystical good luck he may be able to save his mother from her deathspiral of mental deterioration by screwing Paige C unfortunately he can't get it up when he gets the chance to screw her and D this sudden and virgin impotence must paradoxically mean that he cares deeply for Paige. I suppose it figures that in our emotionally disconnected day the hero's journey is over just when the hero begins to care so insurmountable do we find our own apathy. Would that this theme was true of the film itself ironically the viewer isn't given an effective reason to care about any one of these characters. In the end the drama plays out as an elaborate practical joke and the beguiling Nurse Paige simply provides a foil for revealing Victor's pent up mommy issues. Suffice to say Ida is the woman Victor really wants  all the others are just desperate stabs at the thought that truly sours his sexdrive. With the titillating darkness of its underlying story it certainly seems like this could have been a quite interesting picture had it been directed with a modicum of mood and some real storytelling chops by someone like David Cronenberg who might have honed in more clearly on the main motherson conflict and dispensed of the surfacelevel comic frivolities that burden and distract in Clark Greggs' direction. Brad William Henke play's Victor's slaphappy sidekick Denny who falls in love with a ditsy erotic dancer and turns from his excessively masturbatory ways to a life of piling rocks  literally. I'm not exactly sure what Denny's story is supposed to tell us shrouded as it is in puerile sex jokes brospeak philosophy and inscrutable stacked stones. I guess it just must be true immature dudes and hot dumb strippers really can fall in love. One last thought bothers me with all the crazy episodes of affection and abandonment to which Ida subjects young Victor told in flashback I can't help suspecting Victor of being something much more sinister than just a sex addict. A more sensitive storyteller might have sensed the serial rapist lurking behind Victor's jokey mental flashes of flesh every time he meets a woman. Check with an oldschool Feminist before showing Choke to your college postmodern lit class  there is definitely some unresolved misogyny down deep in this one that you may not want to let loose lightly.".

'Choke' has its absolute fill of messed up characters in fact not one that appears on screen doesn't have numerous and obvious problems. Unfortunately the movie gives us very little characters to root for or care about. One for instance does change hisher ways and even then it was ho hum. I will say this about the movie they did get addiction down fairly well though I can only relate to the addicted personality not necessarily the sexual addiction. Throughout the film we follow Victor to his mother's side in a mental hospital to numerous sexual encounters past and present his fight or comfort with the sexual problem his need to fund his mother's medical bills by well choking it out of strangers and make sure his best friend and anyone else around him continues on the downward spiral his life has become. Normally I love Anjelica Huston but unfortunately here she was completely unconvincing as the mother with Alzheimer's as if just reading and not acting out her lines. And what was with all the women dying to sleep with Sam Rockwell? I guess it goes along with the women love jerks or guys that treat them like dirt theory although doesn't that usually apply to handsome men? Similarly it also puzzled me how Adam Sandler became a calendar modelplayboy in 'I Now Pronounce You Chuck  Larry.'".

I personally had trouble sticking with this one.I have no idea how closely it matches the tone or plot of the Chuck Palahniuk novel but I have a feeling based on other films that have been made from Palahniuk novels that the vague nastiness present in Choke comes from the source material. Sam Rockwell an actor I usually like quite a lot plays a misanthropic sex addict caring for his mother Anjelica Huston who's living out her last days in a mental institution. Before his mother dies it becomes important to him to know who his father was and this miniodyssey comprises the bulk of the film. Meanwhile numerous flashbacks to his childhood show us just how screwed up his mother was and how much she contributed to his antisocial tendencies as an adult.Choke is the kind of movie where we're not supposed to necessarily like the main character but we are still supposed to find his antics rather amusing. Well I didn't like him or find him all that amusing. The character is written as a basically good guy who spends much of his time refusing to acknowledge the good other people see in him but the problem is that Rockwell's performance doesn't let US see the good side of his character without that he's just some unpleasant schmuck who we're asked to care about.Anjelica Huston doesn't really get a character to play she instead is used as a plot mechanism to explain the main character. And she's asked to do some embarrassing things like play a death scene with chocolate pudding smeared all over her mouth. The pretty lovely actress Kelly Macdonald is a welcome presence as a love interest for Rockwell and the movie at least redeems itself somewhat by making her storyline at first utterly implausible make some sense after a plot twist is revealed. But I felt like all the actors were at the mercy of a director who couldn't settle on the proper tone. The film isn't outrageous enough to work as satire but it's too implausible to be accepted literally. What world does Clark Gregg or Chuck Palahniuk for that matter live in where a man who looks like Sam Rockwell can find women literally around every corner who are willing to have casual sex with him?And by the way the title of the film refers to a scam Rockwell's character repeatedly pulls off in restaurants. He forces himself to choke and then befriends the person who ends up saving his life forming such a bond that that total stranger continues to send him money for things like fake dental procedures and other such needs that Rockwell makes up. Again....huh?Grade C".

Having invented a brother whom they claim to have ostracized for his disobedience the bercontrolling parents terrorize their offspring into submission. The father is the only family member who can leave the manicured lawns of their selfinflicted exile earning their keep by managing a nearby factory while the only outsider allowed on the premises is his colleague Christina who is paid to relieve the son of his male urges.

	schema:headline " The human condition reduced to an absurdity";
	schema:reviewBody "Dogtooth is not a comedy. The absurd situations in this film became humorous several times but I always choked on my laughter as the subject matter was too serious to be funny. The film is about three young adults who live with their parents in a large but isolated walled compound the two young women and the young man have no knowledge of the world outside of this place and not much of the world inside of it. In fact the parents deliberately mislead them with nonsense on nearly every topic for instance they claim that men are commonly killed by cats. Additionally the siblings are taught the wrong words for certain objects and concepts thus a salt shaker becomes a telephone. These young people have been given a mostly carefree extended childhood at the cost of ever having any autonomy or knowledge. The parents' theory seems to be that the world is a terrible place and contact with it is more damaging than an isolated life. This Edenlike setting is a blessing and a curse the characters are free of most problems that face normal people they have no real responsibility and thus no worry. Still like any human they yearn for answers and they have a certain half formed desire to be the masters of their own destinies. Further in what seems to be a recent development the children are seeking an outlet for their sexual needs while the parents can prevent them from being exposed to any stimulus they cannot stop biological urges from surfacing. Any solution to this problem is bound to upset the already fragile artificial world in which they live.The implications of this film can be applied to any number of societal relationships. The connection these siblings have with their parents is quite similar to the affiliation between a citizen and his government or a believer and his religious institution. The film implies that for any of these relationships to work the individual must forego intelligence and blindly follow the institution although this sort of obedience is contrary to human nature. At the same time the few people in charge must play their part perfectly in order to keep the trust they've been given this proves just as difficult for the leaders as the followers here for example when the parents allow themselves things forbidden to the children and inevitably draw unwanted attention.Dogtooth is a film that raises all sorts of questions about the individual and the society he is forced to play a part in and it encapsulates these questions into a deceptively simple plot. Wisely rather than answer these questions the film leaves these questions to be pondered by the viewer even as it neatly reduces the entire question to the absurd.".

	onyx:emotionText "Dogtooth is not a comedy. The absurd situations in this film became humorous several times but I always choked on my laughter as the subject matter was too serious to be funny. The film is about three young adults who live with their parents in a large but isolated walled compound the two young women and the young man have no knowledge of the world outside of this place and not much of the world inside of it. In fact the parents deliberately mislead them with nonsense on nearly every topic for instance they claim that men are commonly killed by cats. Additionally the siblings are taught the wrong words for certain objects and concepts thus a salt shaker becomes a telephone. These young people have been given a mostly carefree extended childhood at the cost of ever having any autonomy or knowledge. The parents' theory seems to be that the world is a terrible place and contact with it is more damaging than an isolated life. This Edenlike setting is a blessing and a curse the characters are free of most problems that face normal people they have no real responsibility and thus no worry. Still like any human they yearn for answers and they have a certain half formed desire to be the masters of their own destinies.

It is definitely not an easy movie to watch as it can be really intense and deals with one or two traditionally taboo issues but it is definitely worth giving it a chance. For me it has been a completely surreal experience best described as stepping into a world as peaceful as heaven and as confining as hell where things seem to work in their own whimsical way leaving me with a constant bafflement as to what is to come next. I honestly did not realize how time went by and when it all came to an end I found myself asking for more. This is a movie that disturbed moved and fascinated me while I was watching it and made me think after having watched it. It is surreal it is symbolic it could definitely be seen from a political point of view it is ironic and at times it can be unexpectedly funny in a dark twisted way. Directing it in a dry strict manner as if just trying to capture the events that take place was definitely a perfect choice as was the complete absence of music. The actors did a great job at acting in the emotionally detached manner that was required plus I have to say it probably took lots of guts for them to do some of their most awkward scenes. All in all I would say I admired the artistic integrity of the director and actors and their dedication to getting across the main idea and the atmosphere of this movie.I don't really know how I could classify Dogtooth. Is it a drama? Well for a drama it is kind of underplotted. Is it a comedy? It is definitely not a comedy even when you laugh you are still disturbed by the absurdity of it all. Is it horror? It is not horror it's just a horrific situation but everything the horror the violence etc is mostly implied. Is it fantasy? Well it is an alternate reality but mind you this is a family that kind of looks normal on the outside! So really I give up. It's just a really strange really intriguing movie one that in my opinion is definitely worth your time.Oh and one more thing it is also one of these movies that it is best to know the least things possible before you see them. Quite a few things particularly the funny ones are based on shock value  not that the whole movie is based on shock value of course. If you ask me even the theatrical trailers show too much.".

The 20somethings I talked to on the way out were very enthusiastic. The woman sitting next to me said What did it mean? I don't understand but to me there were enough deep meanings and points to ponder on a 30minute drive home and I can't wait to tell friends about it. Everything from the dangers of creating a perfect family to the mechanization of capitalism and upper middle class life to metaphors for the dangers of repressive families and governments.

I've read negative comments about this movie. I get it. It's not the most easy movie to watch but I haven't been this pleasantly surprised in a long time. Saw this in Sitges with a packed audience and I believe most of the people there were glued to the screen and didn't want to see the film end. Surreal emotional cruel realistic and beautiful would be the words I would use to describe this picture. At first you don't really understand what's going on or where you're at but soon find yourself submerged in the sad and pathetic life of a disturbed family. This is definitely one of the most important indie films of the year aside from the original and highly meaningful story the film if impeccably made with astounding performances. Shame on the Sitges film festival! This movie deserved the best actress and the special critics award. And I say that on behalf of most of the other people who were at the festival.".

After a couple of years i found that it is an updated copy of a Mexican movie named Castle of purity 1973 directed by Arturo Ripstein. The story was also based in a real event that happened in Mexico during 1950's. For my surprise the original story of Ripstein has also one brother and two sisters the two older ones were going through adolescence... i am not against remades but in certain way i feel me bad because i am a writer and i think it is important look about the violation of author rights and the effort of having a work done and somebody stealing and having credits for it.

	schema:headline " Dogtooth  close to a masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "Not a lot of movies shock me. So I was quite surprised the unsettling impact Dogtooth had on me. A father locks up his 3 children who are in their late teens  early twenties in a large house and they have stayed there all their lives.The three children are told lies of various degrees. Living totally isolated from the world and in a manufactured universe they do not react like normal people would. The lack of awareness and exposure makes for very interesting scenarios and reactions.The film can be pondered upon on several levels. For instance governments never really tell their people any thing close to the whole truth. Thoughts on these lines  the harms caused by leaving people in the dark are the obvious things one can take back from the movie.I am very interested in the alternate viewpoint of the parents though. They genuinely thought exposing the children to the world would be harmful for them. While that is not some thing one can possibly agree with there are some positives which do come out of it in my opinion. For instance when one of the girls who has never having been exposed to popular culture dances she creates some thing unique. As she has not seen any thing before she is not influences by any thing and creates her own style. That is a positive in my mind.This is film which is close to a masterpiece. When the film had released it was panned in The New York Times and received an average review from Roger Ebert. I am quite pleased then that it is slowly getting appreciation and is ending up in a few best of the year lists as well. This is a must watch according to me. 8.510.".

Even when there is no story no humor or no action a film can still have some value if it has one essential element  truth. This film has absolutely nothing. The characters portrayed are noshows. There are no reasons for their actions  they have no reality. That's okay for a comedy but this film isn't the least bit funny.The film is sometimes visually appealing  but so what? Some images are nicely composed but even completely random use of a camera will eventually yield something. As an alternative to watching this I'd recommend simply walking around or sitting on a park bench for 90 minutes.

This should never have been allowed to waste my time. Who is rating this with 810 stars? Are you guys blind deaf or stupid? There was no redeeming value in this movie besides the premise. I was lured in by promises of an awesomely dysfunctional family insanity and depth. The premise held true but where was the plot? Where was the story? Where was the character development? This could have been a great 20 minute short but for some reason they decided to stretch it into an hour and a half of torture and not the good kind.By the end I was also ready to knock out my own teeth in order to escape. That part probably wasn't even written into the movie. I could totally see the actress permanently disfiguring herself to get out of her contract and the director keeping the footage because it was the only optimistic scene in the entire movie. Think about it you never saw Bruce after that scene. Did you? No because she took her newfound freedom and split! I actually envy her because she got out of the movie early. I was stuck there for like an hour after that...oh wait it just felt like an hour more like three minutes.I want the ten hours that I felt like I spent watching this movie back.".

Yes it serves no function unless your idea of entertainment is to get bored. Towards the end of the film I ask myself what is the purpose or message? There are those who see in this film a social  family allegory because we are largely the product of our education and of the lies we're told taken as truth but even that perspective does not save the film from my negative evaluation it was very badly thin and NO it does not have a deeper meaning. It is what it is.On the same topic Plato already did it almost 2500 years ago. Just read his Allegory of the Cave it's a very short text you can find it easily on the net and you'll be 1000x better served in less time.".

There are those who see in this film a social  family allegory because we are largely the product of our education and of the lies we're told taken as truth but even that perspective does not save the film from my negative evaluation it was very badly thin and NO it does not have a deeper meaning. It is what it is.On the same topic Plato already did it almost 2500 years ago. Just read his Allegory of the Cave it's a very short text you can find it easily on the net and you'll be 1000x better served in less time.";

It reminded me of Lars Von Triers The Idiots. This movie has been firmly planted onto my psyche and I await its general release so I can go see it again. Of course there will be people who won't like the movie due to its sometimes extreme scenes if this is the case and you're a little bit squeamish then stay away. The urge for me to keep associating this film with those of Lars Von Trier's is hard for me to abate and another connection could be made with Antichrist if you liked Antichrist I think you will immensely love this if you found Antichrist hard to stomach then it's probably best not to view this I doubt you'll appreciate its beauty through its intense harshness.".

This is a peculiar symbiosis between theatrical colossal and Peplum . The dialog  cinematography  and direction combine to cast a potent and enjoyable movie . Imposing sets  lavish costumes  good stars  massive scope  opulent interiors  including great spectacle of crowd scenes well staged by Joe Canutt who was Heston's stunt standin for BenHur most notably during the famous chariot race . Runtime is overlong  it's a little bit boring but the history aficionados will appeal too much . This is a special version of the Egyptian temptress's lust for Marco Antonio after Julius Caesar's death and results to be an intermittently extravaganza by Charlton Heston who is a tower of strength  as always . Charlton Chuck seem to be enjoying herself in the lead character in this hokey  spectacular as well as theatrical adaptation based on Shakespeare's play .This marked the third and final time Charlton Heston would play Mark Antony  he did so previously in Julius Caesar and also in Julius Caesar . For a middle budget of three million dollars  Heston asked Metro Goldwyn Mayer footage from Ben Hur  as was added stockshots of the famous sea battle. Superb BritishSpanish support cast such as Eric Porter  Peter Arne  Julian Glover  Douglas Wilmer  Warren Clarke  Freddie Jones as Pompey and Juan Luis Galiardo  Sancho Gracia  Aldo Sambrell and Fernando Rey who was wounded by an armour dressed by Heston . Evocative and sensitive musical score composed by John Scott and performed by London Symphony Orchestra  and musical additional by Augusto Alguero . Colorful and glamorous photography in stunning Technicolor by one of the best Spanish cameraman  Rafael Pacheco . Sumptuous sets and impressive production design by Jose Maria Alarcon and Jose Alguero  and breathtaking battles especially aboard ships and rousing final fight among two armies . It was completely shot in Spain  at Moro  Sevilla Films  Madrid studios  and on location in Aranjuez  Tabernas  Cabo De Gata and Roquetas De Mar Almeria . In Cabo De Gata was filmed a naval battle in which took part two ships .Other films dealing with the infamous Egyptian Queen and her Roman lovers saga are the following  Silent version Cleopatra with Theda Bara  Caesar and Cleopatra by Gabriel Pascal with Claude Rains  Vivien Leigh and Flora Robson  Cleopatra by Cecil B De Mille with Claudette Colbert  Warren William and Henry Wilconson  Cleopatra by Joseph L . Mankiewicz with Elizabeth Taylor  Rex Harrison and Richard Burton and TV adaptation Marcus Antonius and Cleopatra with Richard Johnson and Janet Suzman and Cleopatra TV series by Frank Roddan with Leonor Varela  Timothy Dalton and Billy Zane .".

Runtime is overlong  it's a little bit boring but the history aficionados will appeal too much . This is a special version of the Egyptian temptress's lust for Marco Antonio after Julius Caesar's death and results to be an intermittently extravaganza by Charlton Heston who is a tower of strength  as always . Charlton Chuck seem to be enjoying herself in the lead character in this hokey  spectacular as well as theatrical adaptation based on Shakespeare's play .This marked the third and final time Charlton Heston would play Mark Antony  he did so previously in Julius Caesar and also in Julius Caesar . For a middle budget of three million dollars  Heston asked Metro Goldwyn Mayer footage from Ben Hur  as was added stockshots of the famous sea battle. Superb BritishSpanish support cast such as Eric Porter  Peter Arne  Julian Glover  Douglas Wilmer  Warren Clarke  Freddie Jones as Pompey and Juan Luis Galiardo  Sancho Gracia  Aldo Sambrell and Fernando Rey who was wounded by an armour dressed by Heston . Evocative and sensitive musical score composed by John Scott and performed by London Symphony Orchestra  and musical additional by Augusto Alguero . Colorful and glamorous photography in stunning Technicolor by one of the best Spanish cameraman  Rafael Pacheco . Sumptuous sets and impressive production design by Jose Maria Alarcon and Jose Alguero  and breathtaking battles especially aboard ships and rousing final fight among two armies . It was completely shot in Spain  at Moro  Sevilla Films  Madrid studios  and on location in Aranjuez  Tabernas  Cabo De Gata and Roquetas De Mar Almeria . In Cabo De Gata was filmed a naval battle in which took part two ships .Other films dealing with the infamous Egyptian Queen and her Roman lovers saga are the following  Silent version Cleopatra with Theda Bara  Caesar and Cleopatra by Gabriel Pascal with Claude Rains  Vivien Leigh and Flora Robson  Cleopatra by Cecil B De Mille with Claudette Colbert  Warren William and Henry Wilconson  Cleopatra by Joseph L . Mankiewicz with Elizabeth Taylor  Rex Harrison and Richard Burton and TV adaptation Marcus Antonius and Cleopatra with Richard Johnson and Janet Suzman and Cleopatra TV series by Frank Roddan with Leonor Varela  Timothy Dalton and Billy Zane .";

He wanted to do something different and in that I felt that Charlton Heston failed. Not that this is not a good production it most certainly is but it did not break any new ground in that regard in the way that Laurence Olivier's Shakespeare films had done. Heston is a stalwart and resolute Mark Antony who for the first time in his pantheon of classical heroes on the screen is really quite the fool but a fool for love as history has brought Antony down to us. He terribly underestimates Octavian played by John Castle who is best known as Prince Geoffrey of Anjou in The Lion In Winter. Heston marries Carmen Sevilla as Octavia and Castle thinks him and his following tied to the Caesar family. But Heston has a yen for Hildegarde Neil who is every bit as beguiling and seductive as Elizabeth Taylor or Claudette Colbert ever were as Cleopatra. The sea battle of Actium is always mentioned by historians as one of the twenty or so decisive battles in world history. What is shown here is that it need not be fought but Heston spoiling for a fight and eager to dust off this young punk Octavian commits to a sea battle with inexperienced Egyptian sailors. That was his downfall or the beginning thereof.Speaking of which Actium is a nicely staged sequence and done for less money than you would think. Fraser Heston's narrative tells us how.Antony And Cleopatra is a fine production not the best Shakespeare adaption but still quite good.

Not that I intend to use all my Shakespeare film reviews to bash Kenneth Branagh but compared to Heston he's awful unpalatable in all three capacities. He is that anyway but even Heston's justdecent acting is well balanced by his expert direction of others. The exception to that is Hildegard Neil an awful Cleopatra. She has zero dignity in the role and manages to bear a creepy resemblance to Rock 'n' Roll High School's Principal Togar every now and then. John Castle's performance as Caesar is obviously the best in the film but still doesn't touch Roddy McDowall's bold furious intense Octavian in the Liz Taylor megafilm. Comparisons with that other movie are inevitable and the winner is handsdown the earlier epic. This version is not very well paced and let's face it it wasn't exactly Will's best dialogue. And Hildegard Neil really drags the movie down a bit although she's not as bad as everyone says. Visually it's majestic and that John ScottAugusto Algero score is certainly pleasing to the ears though it can't rival Alex North's Cleopatra. It's okay but I can't say I recommend it unless you're on a really serious Shakespeare kick and the only other movies available are Branagh's.".

I hear you saying that's exactly the way he did prove it but no as limited as this film proved with Heston using Shakespeare and other famous plays to get his own production company going in anticipation of the fast approaching days when real roles wouldn't be forthcoming it isn't the disaster it might have been how frustrating though that a genuinely great American Shakespearean like Orson Welles had to struggle for years to finance his Shakespeare while financiers lined up for Moses with relative alacrity. If one had not seen better versions of the story even the 20th Century Fox fiscal fiasco with Rex Harrison and Richard Burton it might have seemed more respectable. In this case don't blame Shakespeare 'though it's not one of the best in his canon but Heston's adaptation and the limited budget he had to work with.One could almost forgive the obvious miniatures for the sea battles and the toy pyramid Cleopatra's tomb  whose doll house proportions are emphasized by an idiotic pull back shot from the air at the end! for the generally solid performances of the noname cast SOME of whom went on to solid stage careers. Best of the lot John Castle as Octavian Caesar is very good indeed. Heston himself adapter director and star is certainly no worse an Antony than Marlon Brando's miscast attempt in 1953's JULIUS CAESAR or might not have been if he had had a decent director to reign him in but we realize we're in Hestonegosilliness before the credits are even over and the overblown score is all but trumpeting french horning? WE'RE SERIOUS as a herald's horse barges through market sellers' tables and immediately after when Heston does the first of several literal bodice ripping scenes chewing scenery and scattering the pearls he's wearing just because news has arrived from Rome. Scarcely 12 minutes in our star is stripping down to a mini gstring to show his still adequate body on the pretext of changing clothes to go to work. Shakespeare didn't need the help.Still Shakespeare IS there at the core and even self centered direction and poverty row costumes can't ultimately undercut the excellent story. It plays out with all the political intrigue and personal passion the original author loaded it with. Even in an amateur or at least underfunded film production values from people  cinematographers and editors  who have made big professional films can disguise many a self indulgent actor's flaws and give an overall production look larger than it is the Making of documentary narration from Heston's son on the DVD  bending over backwards to honor his father  is both illustrative and amusing in this regard.When not overacting Heston has skills which better directors had been able to make the most of and are occasionally allowed to glow here with a far more effective quiet fire. If Heston the director can't quite make sense of The Battle of Actium sequence he comes closer than many directors and serious historians have before him. The Cleopatra Heston found he could afford Hildegarde Neil is more hampered by a passing resemblance halfway between Elizabeth Taylor and Sally Kellerman than any actual failings of her own or her director.If the viewer is willing to indulge the excesses of a star just starting to show serious age and unaware how silly the film mannerisms picked up in a career as star could look as he tried to segue into a seniority as a serious actor this ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA can be worth its two and a half hours screen time. Heston only played on Broadway four times in his career  appearances ranging from 1947 to 1960  but the only time the show he graced managed to run longer than a single week a fate which must have wounded was his first appearance in a Katherine Cornell production of ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA in which Heston played the tiny role of Proculeius one of Caesar's Octavian's soldiers who has two fine brief scenes with Cleopatra near the end of the play for a very respectable 126 performances under Guthrie McClintic's direction. It was an experience which clearly stayed with him for the rest of his life and he did well by the actor in his role in this film. It's his and our loss that McClintic wasn't around to direct the star for this film as well.Certainly worth having but don't expect Olivier.".

If Heston the director can't quite make sense of The Battle of Actium sequence he comes closer than many directors and serious historians have before him. The Cleopatra Heston found he could afford Hildegarde Neil is more hampered by a passing resemblance halfway between Elizabeth Taylor and Sally Kellerman than any actual failings of her own or her director.If the viewer is willing to indulge the excesses of a star just starting to show serious age and unaware how silly the film mannerisms picked up in a career as star could look as he tried to segue into a seniority as a serious actor this ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA can be worth its two and a half hours screen time. Heston only played on Broadway four times in his career  appearances ranging from 1947 to 1960  but the only time the show he graced managed to run longer than a single week a fate which must have wounded was his first appearance in a Katherine Cornell production of ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA in which Heston played the tiny role of Proculeius one of Caesar's Octavian's soldiers who has two fine brief scenes with Cleopatra near the end of the play for a very respectable 126 performances under Guthrie McClintic's direction. It was an experience which clearly stayed with him for the rest of his life and he did well by the actor in his role in this film. It's his and our loss that McClintic wasn't around to direct the star for this film as well.Certainly worth having but don't expect Olivier.";

	schema:reviewBody "Charlton Heston is my hero and always will be. But this version of ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA does not belong in his highlights reel even if he directed and saw it as the highpoint of his career.There are some bright touches. Jane Lapotaire as Charmian is absolutely irresistible  with her energy wit and sense of fun she steal the picture right out from under the vacant beauty posing as Cleopatra. It's no accident that Jane got to play Cleopatra herself a few years later and she was sensational! Colin Blakely was a better Antony too much more passionate and emotional than Chuck Heston. Freddie Jones is funny and poignant as the broken down hasbeen Pompey. Historically Sextus Pompey's father was the supreme ruler in Rome long before Caesar Octavian or Antony. But by now the last of the Pompey dynasty has been reduced to scavenging on the fringes of the empire running a navy that is really a ragtag fleet of pirate ships. Decaying drunken and falling to pieces before your eyes Pompey is the saddest character in the play. Freddie Jones gets that but still makes the man funny and even noble when it really counts. Great job!Warren Dim Clarke will forever be remembered as Malcolm MacDowell's right hand droog in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. It's a singular pleasure to see him shine in a brief appearance as Scarus the bravest and most loyal of Antony's soldiers. Watch him emerge from the surf bawling curses at the cowardly Cleopatra after her illtimed flight has cost the forces of Antony everything. He projects all the energy masculinity and military valor that is missing from the rest of the film. Go Dim Go!Now I love Charlton Heston. When he plays cold aloof cynical authority figures he's the best in the world. But Antony is so many things that Charlton Heston doesn't understand and can't project on the screen. You never see the drunken Antony the goodtime guy who loves getting down and dirty with the soldiers with the slaves with whoever is around. You never see the vast appetites of the man for food or drink or sex or laughter or anything else. You just see this dignified guy who suddenly loses everything in a murky battle scene. And when says the lines you knew Egypt you knew too well my heart was tied to your rudder you think yeah but we didn't know. You didn't show us that Chuck. Antony is a brave soldier but he's also warm impulsive sensual and charming and those are things you just don't do well on screen.Even the death scene suffers from Chuck's determination to stay in control. Shakespeare chose to show Antony bungle his suicide so that in his final agony he could be helpless in Cleopatra's arms. But Chuck downgrades the agony to an absurd degree. Antony has been stabbed in the stomach but he just trots over to the monument to say hello! The death scene in THE OMEGA MAN was a lot closer to the mark.".

Shakespeare was first and foremost an entertainer. He didn't write to please scholars he wrote to amuse and tell a story to the masses. To do this he tried to use action sequences and clever plot devices but most of all he tried to be a clever wordsmith. The problem with those that stay too faithful to the play is today's audiences don't speak as Elizabethans and the power of the words are lost.

It is said that the remake of Psycho in 1998 was done shot for shot for example yet that effort garners barely 4.5 here at IMDb a losing score for me to watch.Beast Stalker is not a remake of anything yet it takes a key ingredient from Amores Perros 2000  an horrific car crash  that sets the scene for the subsequent action and reaction amongst and between the players. As with Amores Perros without the crash  a visceral metaphor for the ways in which people interact and impact upon each other in daily life  there would be no plot and no movie called Beast Stalker.That plot circles around four players essentially Sergeant Tong Fe Nicholas Tse a tough gogetter cop who rules his team with an iron will Ann Gao Jingchu Zhang a government prosecutor determined to bring a top criminal to justice for murder during an armed robbery her daughter Ling Suetyin Wong who is kidnapped to force Ann to falsify crucial evidence against the top criminal and Hung King Nick Cheung presumably the 'beast' of the story and kidnapper of cute little Ling.The story really begins when Tong Fe three months after the car crash is at the school from which Ling is kidnapped and as Ann arrives to pick her up. Hung King gets away with the girl and Tong Fe promises Ann that he will find Ling. The hunt is on...but time is of the essence the trial of the bank robbermurderer is in 24 hours.For reasons that are best explained in the movie Tong Fe decides to act alone. A lucky break allows him to narrow his search to a specific set of cramped apartments which he begins to scrutinize and search in a variety of ways and during which he is eventually assisted by a couple of his police colleagues and a plucky Ling who is able to get location information out by cell phone to Tong Fe and her mother. As night falls Tong Fe zeros in on an apartment brilliantly lit by a giant red neon advertising light and when he spots Ling through a window he knows he'll be able to keep his promise to Ann. Or so he thinks.The final act that brings closure for the players I'll leave you to enjoy without spoiling it. Suffice to say the suspense action and excitement are well worth your time and are as good as it gets. Better yet the epilogue is absolutely emotional dynamite so don't miss it.Technically the production is brilliant well paced and well photographed although it suffers from too many repetitive zoom shots but the editing is stunning in parts particularly the slomo action in the crash. If you've seen some of the slomo explosions in The Hurt Locker 2008 you know what I mean. Coupled with appropriate flashbacks to fill in various backstories the entire filmic experience is wellstructured and easy to follow.Finally though a word about the title considering the overall thematic thrust  personal redemption  the title is I think misleading at best. Hung King as the main antagonist has unselfish and even laudable motivations that drive him to commit a terrible criminal act. And likewise none of the protagonists  Tong Fe and Ann Gao particularly  are squeaky clean either. Moreover as we all know given appropriate stimulus and context anybody can perform a heinous crime offensively or defensively. All of which raises an ageold question does the end always justify the means? Think on that when you see this one and especially when you get to the epilogue.Give this offering a good eight out of ten.Recommended for all except young kiddies too much violence.January 3 2013".

The story may be hackneyed and predictable and the plot twists might be anything but but in the end this film is a triumph because it gets to the real darkness and emotion behind the subject matter. Police procedurals and crime thrillers have long been popular in Hong Kong but many of them are inevitably slick and soulless providing entertainment but without real depth to back it up. Not so BEAST STALKER.The overall story is one of kidnapping but there's much more going on with the film than that. Both heroes and villains are painted with the same level of painstaking care so that in the end the film becomes all about character rather than clich and the latest effort to make the hero look cool in front of a slowmotion explosion. The acting is a triumph Nicholas Tse bags the fairly predictable role of the tortured cop and does a good job with it but it's Nick Cheung as the wouldbe kidnapper who really shines. Cheung could easily have been over the top or theatrical in his turn as the film's villain but instead he comes across as an alltoo real person. He's one of the most interesting bad guys I've seen in a film and he ignites every scene he takes part in with his dynamic performance.Of course at the end of the day this is still a thriller and director Dante Lam makes sure we don't forget it. There are car crashes fist fights shootouts and foot chases and all of them are portrayed with the maximum excitement. This is the first time I've seen a film of Lam's and I love his cinematography he sets the scene in long shots before moving in close and staying in close whether dialogue or action is playing out. It adds a level of realism and catapults the viewer into the film in an effective engaging way. On the strength of BEAST STALKER I'm already eager to track down more of the director's work.".

To start the actual chase was very badly done with evidence of speeded up film and very close camera shots to hide how few cars and real situations were involved. But then we have one of the most spectacular crashes I have ever seen on film just in terms of the angles and details which you normally miss in high speed crashes. It really was an object lesson in how to film a crash. The crash also becomes central in that it is seen through different people's eyes as the film progresses rather in the manner of Pulp Fiction and the construction of the film around this event is handled very cleverly.The film also suffered excessively from Shaky Cam often used for no discernible point and to bad effect. There's nothing wrong with Shaky Cam per se  it was used to great effect in the Bourne films for instance but don't do it for the sake of it or because everyone else does it.However despite these faults this is a well acted well written and beautifully designed piece of cinema which is well worth your time seeing. I am always happy to see a film in which actions have consequences and this shows it very well indeed.".

	schema:headline " HK Neo Reviews The Beast Stalker";
	schema:reviewBody "Tagline Dante Lam is back in form Review by Neo Ever since directing Beast Cop Dante Lam seems to have gone brainless but with exactly a decade onwards Lam is finally delivering in Beast Stalker. Although the material does not bombard anything about freshness there is no reason to be negative as there are plenty of moments of reasonable excitement to make it one of the better lights of 2008 HK Cinema. While Beast Stalker is by all means dark it is also lighter than Beast Cops especially when taken into account of the somewhat redeeming finale. A good film by all means but on the scale of Lam's best efforts Neo mentioning Beast Cop for X number of times it pales. Luckily the above is more of a positive comment than negative as any film worthy of comparison with the aforementioned flick cannot be too bad.Even the current reviewer is annoyed by how many times Neo have somewhat mentioned the word Beast Cop. For god sake this is not a promotional fest of former great movies but rather looking at the future of HK cinema with a view of the past. Years ago back in Tiramisu Nicholas Tse portrayed himself as a somewhat capable actor and from there he has gone from worst to bad. Luckily Tse has finally come of age and the result is showing in a somewhat pleasing display of serious acting chops. Still there are a lot of cons that would require mentioning like moments of Tse being angry or frustrated comes of more laughable than convincing. Without being a pessimist there is a lot to cheer about Tse's latest display and Neo can safely claim it as one of his best display since Goddess of Mercy.There is no question that Nick Cheung is one heck of an actor and his steer away from comedy is certainly one of the best career moves for Cheung. It has been noted that Neo first realise his potential as a serious actor way back in 1998 when he was actively involved in TVB. His role as a good guy turned villain was menacing and in recent years Cheung has shown that Neo was right about him. Here his villainous turn is by no means the typical carbon copy but rather multidimensional and the result is menacing interesting and absolutely captivating. Cheung has come a long way and perhaps award recognition is just around the corner.There is a saying when all actors are in their best form the film usually works. Well to be honest there is no such saying but it does rings quite true. Luckily good things usually come in three and surely one of the better actresses in recent years Zhang Jing Chu The Protg can do no wrong. After Neo acclaiming her as Best Actress for her immensely scene stealing role as a junkie mother in Protg Zhang does not disappoint and she handles her role with ease While by no means on the same class as her performance in Protg it is still more than adequate enough to allow the audience to relate to her character. An actress to watch in years to come and the scene when she realise she has indirectly caused the death of her own child is just captivating to endure.Director Dante Lam loves brutal straight forward fist to fist fights and he makes good use of this to further enhance the realism of the work. Beast Stalker works because Dante Lam tries hard to focus on the characters and allows them to flourish. All in all Beast Stalker is suitably dark filled with three capable performances and a redeeming finale to round it out. While it is true that the film falls short of reaching the dazzling heights in Beast Cop it is great news to announce that director Lam is back to what he does best and finally approaching the sort of form that seem to have eluded from his wane for the last decade. Basically cutting all the above crap it really just requires the following line a film that Neo recommends viewing  Neo 2009 I rate it 810www.thehkneo.com".

Unfortunately Cheung manages to escape Tong and his colleague Sun give chase but it ends in tragedy there is a car crash after which Cheung and his men steal a woman's car Tong opens fire and the car crashes. When he gets to the car he finds Cheung seriously injured and blood dripping from the boot he opens it and sees that there is a young girl inside mortally wounded by the shots he fired into the car.A few months later Cheung wakes from his coma and the chief prosecutor wants him to be tried as soon as possible. There is a complication though the woman's whose daughter was killed is the lawyer who will be leading the prosecution and Cheung has ordered the kidnap of her other daughter to force her to destroy the one piece of conclusive evidence against him. She is told not to tell the police but Tong was present when the girl was snatched so determines to save her before she is seriously harmed.When I picked up this film I knew almost nothing about it just the blurb on the back of the DVD box so assumed it might be exciting overthetop action like many of the Hong Kong cop films I'd seen before it does have plenty of moments of excitement and is very tense for most of its runtime but if you are expecting to see our hero dealing with hordes of bad guys you might be disappointed if however you like the idea of a hero who is mostly acting alone searching for a single foe interesting then this might be the film for you. Nicholas Tse does a fine job as Tong and Nick Cheung impresses as his target the killer hired by Cheung to kidnap the girl. This character could easily have been a pantomime villain but his back story which we don't fully learn about till the end makes him more human. The action scenes are pretty good especially the car crash which is top notch. If this was a Hollywood film I'd have been sure that the kidnapped girl would be rescued but here I wasn't so sure and more than once thought something really bad could happen to her this concern made things incredibly tense at times. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting a good tense copthriller.These comments are based on watching the film in Cantonese with English subtitles.".

Tight plot editing and story telling  but the balancing act of reasonable plot to the 'human story' is a bit over reaching for me.

One of the most memorable scenes in Chori Chori is that where the two central characters are watching a country puppetshow and Kammo Nargis imagines herself and Sagar Raj as the puppets. The duet that follows with the two actually playing out this fantasy is one of the best things in the film and owes nothing to the Capra original. Although Kapoor is not himself the director of Chori Chori the pair responsible for the music Shankar and Jaikishan had also worked on Awaara and were for that matter a Kapoor discovery. It seems likely that the Russian puppetshow on the postAwaara tour provided the inspiration for this scene.".

I was wrong no amount of writing can convey the richness and impact of the images and the overall flow of the film which is why this commentary will be brief. Suffice it to say that I recommend this film wholeheartedly to anyone looking for cinematic poetry though not probably to those who misled by its being set during the Japanese Civil Wars expect an action film.Perhaps the most striking thing about the film is the camerawork on a first viewing one is scarcely aware of it much of the time but the camera is in constant motion emblematic of the restlessness which pervades not only the era and the central characters but by implication all of human life in this regard it's a very Buddhist film. This movement is never gratuitous when the scene demands little or no movement the camera stays still. Notice though how often the camera's movement enhances the emotional impact of the scene especially in the famous panning shot not as occasionally described a 360 degree shot of the reunion near the end. Along with this is Mizoguchi's penchant for long takes which seduce the viewer into the rhythm of the film without calling attention to themselves or to his cleverness as a director.But these are technical comments which may or may not be helpful in focussing a viewer's attention what really matters is the film itself as a whole. It is truly beautiful and powerful in the unexpected way of great poetry. Technique and emotion simplicity of means and complexity of effects walk handinhand here and the result is remarkable in a way which film rarely attains.".

	schema:headline " Spectral Morality Play Told with Finesse by a Japanese Master";
	schema:reviewBody "This is yet another superb addition to the Criterion Collection of the masterworks of Japanese cinema during the country's fruitful artistic period after WWII. Director Kenji Mizoguchi is not as well known as Akira Kurosawa nor is he yet enjoying a renaissance like Yasujiro Ozu is now. However he had a long impressive career that stretched over four decades culminating in the 1950's with a handful of classic movies the most famous being 1953's Ugetsu monogatori Tales of Moonlight and Rain. Set in 16thsentury Japan it's a ghostly morality tale of two brothers poor farmers who are both anxious to make their fortunes from the wartime activities surrounding them but via different means. The more focused Genjur seeks his fortune through his homemade pottery which he sells in the bustling nearby town and the younger Tobei's pipe dream is to become a samurai warrior.After their village is pillaged the brothers set off on a boat to the same town on a fogladen lake leaving their suffering wives behind. There Genjur meets a noblewoman named Lady Wakasa who appreciates his artistry and falls in love with him. However she turns out to be the ghost of a woman who never experienced love and this realization puts Genjur into a desperate situation since he decided to leave his devoted wife Miyagi to marry her a decision that will turn on him with supreme irony at the end. On the other hand Tobei achieves his desire to become a samurai warrior but through dubious means at which point he discovers his wife Ohama has become a prostitute after being raped by warriors in his absence.What Mizoguchi does remarkably well is interweave the two stories so that they reinforce and reflect upon each other seamlessly. He also avoids the pitfall of having the story pontificate upon the obvious morals of the story by not using archetypes but instead showing the realistic flaws in all the main characters. Without the use of special effects the fantasy elements are not remotely contrived but rather emphasize the often nebulous difference between dreams versus reality ambition versus happiness and gratification versus fulfillment. The final spectral twist is a worthy precursor to The Sixth Sense. Even more impressively with the expert work of cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa Mizoguchi provides meticulous often stunning tableaux to set his scenes and his narrative is suffused with deep humanity even when the characters perform deplorable acts.The legendary Machiko Ky plays Lady Wakasa with an appropriately otherworldly manner at first remote but then romantically infatuated and gradually desperate to redefine her destiny. However it's the quartet of actors who play the two couples that make the deepest impressions. Masayuki Mori portrays Genjur with passionate fury and Sakae Ozawa makes the foolhardy Tobei at once deceitful and sympathetic. Kinuyo Tanaka Japan's first female director provides the right amount of stoic gentility as Miyagi and Mitsuko Mito makes Ohama's degradation hauntingly memorable. For anyone interested in Japanese cinema or simply a great ghost story beautifully told this is a must.".

He also avoids the pitfall of having the story pontificate upon the obvious morals of the story by not using archetypes but instead showing the realistic flaws in all the main characters. Without the use of special effects the fantasy elements are not remotely contrived but rather emphasize the often nebulous difference between dreams versus reality ambition versus happiness and gratification versus fulfillment. The final spectral twist is a worthy precursor to The Sixth Sense. Even more impressively with the expert work of cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa Mizoguchi provides meticulous often stunning tableaux to set his scenes and his narrative is suffused with deep humanity even when the characters perform deplorable acts.The legendary Machiko Ky plays Lady Wakasa with an appropriately otherworldly manner at first remote but then romantically infatuated and gradually desperate to redefine her destiny. However it's the quartet of actors who play the two couples that make the deepest impressions. Masayuki Mori portrays Genjur with passionate fury and Sakae Ozawa makes the foolhardy Tobei at once deceitful and sympathetic. Kinuyo Tanaka Japan's first female director provides the right amount of stoic gentility as Miyagi and Mitsuko Mito makes Ohama's degradation hauntingly memorable. For anyone interested in Japanese cinema or simply a great ghost story beautifully told this is a must.";

His compositions are beautiful not a frame of film is wasted in depicting the characters and their surroundings with astonishing vividity.

His friend finds success as a samurai not through any prowess or skill but by luck but he too finds his actions carry a duplicitous edge to them as the fortunes of his wife are unfavourable to say the least.While much of the imagery is harsh implicit rapes murders mass looting and deprivation of hard working peasants the overall tone is far from defeatist.  That was Mizoguchi's power as evidenced in Sansho Dayu.  He was not only one of cinema's greatest directors of women in the case of Ugetsu Monogatari he also captures the essence of the endurance of human love transcending even death.See it and be amazed.".

His neighbor Tobei Sakae Ozawa that is a fool man dreams on becoming a samurai but he can not afford to buy the necessary outfit. The greedy Genjur and Tobei work together manufacturing clay potteries expecting to sell the pieces and enrich however their wives Miyage Kinuyo Tanaka and Ohama Mitsuko Mito are worried about the army of the cruel Shibata that is coming to their village and they warn their ambitious husbands. Their village is looted but the families flee and survive Genjur and Tobei decide to travel by boat with their wives and baby to sell the wares in a bigger town. When they meet another boat that was attacked by pirates Genjur decides to leave his wife and son on the bank of the river promising to return in ten days. Genjur Tobei and Ohama raise a large amount but Tobei leaves his wife to buy the samurai outfit and seek fame and fortune. Meanwhile the female aristocratic Lady Wakasa Machiko Ky and her servant ask Genjur to bring her shopping to her fancy Kutsuki House. Sooner Genjur and Tobei discover the price they have to pay for their ambition. Ugetsu Monogatari is the first movie that I have watched of Kenji Mizoguchi and I am impressed with this masterpiece. This supernatural story is very well constructed in a historic context of the Japanese Civil Wars of the Sengoku period with two family dramas caused by the blindness of greed. This feature is supported by a magnificent cinematography in black and white and the scene in the foggy lake is a piece of art. The performances are awesome and the cast really seems to be living in the Sixteenth Century in Japan. My vote is nine.Title Brazil Contos da Lua Vaga Tales of the Vague Moon".

	schema:headline " A beautiful exercise of eastern filmmaking";
	schema:reviewBody "Ugetsu is a film that separates itself from both period pieces of its time and from Japanese film of any era. It neither has the ferocious exiting energy that Kurosawa successfully utilized nor the slow mundane nature that Ozu became known for. Rather it attempts successfully to give a drawn out slightly surrealistic atmosphere that exhibits images of lingering beauty throughout its short length. What drew me into the film deepest was the usage of not style or substance if that makes sense but rather these images that remained on your mind long after the film was finished. A sabotaged boat drifting away in the fog with nothing but a dead man aboard an enchantress' seduction of a naive peasant and a landscape dotted with danger and war all make up some of the most beautiful images that would not be out of place in a painting. They alone say more then most films do in their entire message.The film nonetheless has some very impressive subject matter to its credit dealing with war greed and the line between reality and the spiritual world. Throughout the film we see two peasants progressively grow to lust for the riches of the world Genjur desires to sell his wares and become wealthy while Tobei desires to be a samurai and have power. In time they both get to a point where this is a reality where one of them fulfills what he desires the other is led into a surrealistic haze by a demonic seductress. In the end the loss of what was important all along becomes apparent and a message of humility becomes the films point.Though it is not nearly as accessible a film as Kurosawa's period pieces of the same time Ugetsu succeeds on a level that they do not. It brings an element of sheer beauty I have not been acquainted with by any Japanese director.

In doing this Mizoguchi distances some viewers while at the same time bringing many to a level impossible with any other director Eastern or Western.

	onyx:emotionText "Ugetsu is a film that separates itself from both period pieces of its time and from Japanese film of any era. It neither has the ferocious exiting energy that Kurosawa successfully utilized nor the slow mundane nature that Ozu became known for. Rather it attempts successfully to give a drawn out slightly surrealistic atmosphere that exhibits images of lingering beauty throughout its short length. What drew me into the film deepest was the usage of not style or substance if that makes sense but rather these images that remained on your mind long after the film was finished. A sabotaged boat drifting away in the fog with nothing but a dead man aboard an enchantress' seduction of a naive peasant and a landscape dotted with danger and war all make up some of the most beautiful images that would not be out of place in a painting. They alone say more then most films do in their entire message.The film nonetheless has some very impressive subject matter to its credit dealing with war greed and the line between reality and the spiritual world. Throughout the film we see two peasants progressively grow to lust for the riches of the world Genjur desires to sell his wares and become wealthy while Tobei desires to be a samurai and have power. In time they both get to a point where this is a reality where one of them fulfills what he desires the other is led into a surrealistic haze by a demonic seductress. In the end the loss of what was important all along becomes apparent and a message of humility becomes the films point.Though it is not nearly as accessible a film as Kurosawa's period pieces of the same time Ugetsu succeeds on a level that they do not. It brings an element of sheer beauty I have not been acquainted with by any Japanese director. The camera moves much slower as to give you a sense of your surroundings to allow the film to become part of you. In doing this Mizoguchi distances some viewers while at the same time bringing many to a level impossible with any other director Eastern or Western. He successfully does what all great artists do he makes his art truly great and therefore truly subjective.There is not a lot I can further say about this beautiful film except that it is best taken on an image by image base with the real plot as a second consideration.

But a film handled with the elegance and competence of someone who knows about more than filmmaking who just happens to be able to express himself in film and so can posit us inside the film in richer ways than simply cinematic.What I mean is this on the surface this is one of the narratives on bad karma the Japanese were so fond of sharing with themselves an older story from the late 18th century dressed up in film material. It is about two men who sow the seeds of their own undoing by pursuing status and wealth. Civil war tears the land they exploit this to their advantage. One of them is merely a pompous buffoon and through cowardice he gets to be a samurai  its own comment on the privileged caste. His punishment is ordinary a simple irony. But the other the sadder loss of the two is a skilled artisan a potter who could enrich lives by giving but instead devotes himself to accumulating. It is he who is granted a supernatural extraordinary vision to remind him how far he has strayed. Ghosts appear to redress the balance signifiers of a troubled soul.That's all unexceptionally fine but for me the film's power rests elsewhere. The Japanese have given us since much better treatises on karma Straits of Hunger and Sword of Doom from the following decade are two of them.We may be inclined to rest our interpretation here with a passing comment on great camerawork because all of this is more or less readily available to us it makes some immediate sense. The closest type of film we have to this here in the West is film noir and we have seen plenty of that already that this may even seem outdated but noir was generally a semiconscious product made by artists who could feel nagging them inside the anxieties of a new life in the city but not quite put to words. So we got feverish dreams intuited from a restless sleep.This is different. It comes from a long rich tradition of landscape painting where the words or images are the expression of what has already been embodied. The painter impregnated with the outer images of everyday nature reconstitutes reality on his scroll as the landscape of that interior heartmind where the universe of myriad images dwells.In other words Hokusai did not paint Mt. Fuji because he thought it would look good rather it looked good because he was meditating with his brush on the source of his lifeworld. Being able to see from inside the result flowed out effortlessly it floated on paper. So even though the landscapes are shown to be cascading up and down in forceful motions our gaze is directed to the center of a profound repose that is immanent in all. The image itself is both the act of meditational devotion and for us on the other end the space of contemplation.So if we put Ugetsu to words it may seem pedantic laborious. Yes the pursuit of status and wealth is shown to be disastrous but didn't we know already? Yes eventually the soul is left with a lesson in humility the acceptance of suffering and hard work  a work that unconditionally gives back one of extraordinary humanity now. But if instead we contemplate on these notions using images the filmmaker has used to contemplate himself in painting them?Look for the scene on a boat we lose our characters from sight as they lose sight of themselves. Or later near the end how the emptiness resonates when one of them sees for the first time the ruins of the illusionary world he has inhabited. It's a stunning accomplishment by a skilled artisan we are always the Outer self ignorant desiring our gaze deceived by folly like theirs but eventually awakened when they are.Ignore the voiceover that closes the film it's a misstep and not a cinematic device. Allow this to sink deeper. When our potter is confronted with supernatural malice temple bells chime in the soundtrack their reminder of Buddhist stillness in the face of mishap.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ugetsu Ugetsu monogatari a 1953 film by Kenji Mizoguchi which won the Venice Film Festival's top prize the Silver Lion Award for Best Direction that year is one of the best films to ever deal with the subject of human desire and not only the obvious sexual aspects of the emotion. While ostensibly it is labeled a ghost story since its Japanese title means Tales Of The Pale And Silvery Moon After The Rain the story is a complex one that hides behind its astonishingly simple narrative and revelation and is based upon two tales from a 1776 book of tales by Ueda Akinari and a third story from French writer Guy de Maupassant. Mizoguchi and screenwriter Yoshikata Yoda adapted elements from all three tales to create something new and relevant.It follows the lives and desires of two couple who inhabit a small Japanese village during the 16th Century when civil wars and ravaging bands of Samurai soldiered plundered the countryside near Lake Biwa in Omi province. The two male characters who may be friends or relatives are Genjur Masayuki Mori a farmer and master potter and Tobei Sakae Ozawa aka Eitar Ozawa. Tobei is a dimwit and the assistant potter to Genjur and he dreams of military glory as a samurai but cannot even handle a sword properly. Genjur has a wife Miyagi Kinuyo Tanaka and young son Genichi Ikio Sawamura and Tobei has a wife as well. Her name is Ohama Mitsuko Mito and they bicker in a very Ralph and Alice Kramden sort of way while Genjur and Miyagi seem to have a more overtly stable and loving relationship.Technically this film is not as overtly sophisticated as Rashomon yet it does not suffer from the great dramatic letdown that film does. Kazuo Miyagawa's black and white cinematography is outstanding especially in the studio shots of the river and the ghostly lady's mansion. The seduction scene where Lady Wakasa is dancing and singing is oddly hypnotic and one of the most surreal moments in the film. Much of the night scenes in the film remind me of Carl Theodor Dreyer's great Vampyr a film with darker similarities to this one. Also the camera is almost always moving in this film. Very few things are static and long takes dominate the film with very few cuts and then only when needed to jar the viewer for a reason. Thus when the film ends showing us that little has changed in the valley beyond the village we are left with a disjunct feeling between the apparent stasis of life in that time and place and the great changes we've seen take place. That we never see the Lady nor her retinue nor Miyagi at film's close portrayed in a Hollywood ghostly fashion can confuse a bit upon a first viewing but on a second viewing all becomes clear in this simple but never simplistic tale.The actors are also uniformly good. Sakae as Tobei and Mitsuko as Ohama are a delight comically and in rare dramatic moments. Machiko as Lady Wakasa shows dramatic improvement in just two years as an actor from her debut in Rashomon. Yet the film really belongs to Kinuyo as Miyagi and the sublime Masayuki as Genjur. Masayuki was outstanding as the murdered husband in Rashomon acting with his face alone. But this role gives him drama and comedy horror and befuddlement and were it not for his name and the commentary of the film I'd have had no idea the same actor played both roles for he looks totally different as a peasant farmer than a samurai nobleman. One scene before he is to go to the Lady's mansion we see him looking at a fancy kimono and he imagines Miyagi looking at it even though we know she cares little for such things. The look in Genjur's eyes contrasted with the reality we know says more of the insecurities males feel in sexual relationships than many whole films devoted to the subject have.While the film is in no way a modern psychological portrait of the sort Ingmar Bergman would later specialize in a viewer is left with a firm idea of who all these characters were simply by how their behavior is the same yet parallaxed by the contrast between the early scenes and later ones that are recapitulative. Mizoguchi also made a bit of a career specialty in focusing on the lives of women and even though the two male characters are the ostensible leads the female characters shoulder much of the narrative and dramatic load and do so consummately well. Ugetsu is a great film made by an artist at his peak and even with the misgivings its creator had it stands the test of time immaculately.".

After finding some success exploiting the war to make a grand profit their greed brings them away from their wives one into realizing his samurai ambitions the other to the home of a pale beauty.Much has been said of the film's visual splendor. One can see here the beginnings of the sort of imagery that dominates your typical studio ghibli film only much more bombastic. For my part I prefer Mizoguchi's in comparison understated approach. Maybe not as impressive initially but it lingers in the mind for much longer. There's really not any still shorts that do justice to the film's imagery one must see the movements of the camera to appreciate what's on the screen. Even the most simple of moments seem more potent under Mizoguchi's proverbial eye. Adding to that is the music which is almost surreal in how it conveys both sorrow and the fantastic.If the emphasis on visual and sounds is making it seem like Ugetsu is just a pretty but vacuous spectacle it absolutely is not. The technical prowess only underlies the beauty of the story. On paper the story and characters are very simple. What makes the characters realized are the incredible performances. The most powerful moments in the movie are expressed through the face. Despite the short running time giving little time to establish the character's relations there is such a genuine chemistry among them that the significance of these bonds isn't taken for granted as it may often be in these sorts of films. Make no mistake Genjuro loves his family even if he isn't always appreciative. One small but wonderful moment is when he's shopping for a yukata for her and sees an image of her holding one over herself. Genjuro's journey is the main one and the heart of the movie with Tobei's darkly comical journey as much more of a side story.and one can't talk about Ugetsu without mention of it's ending. I won't spoil but I will say it ranks alongside another Mizoguchi masterpierce Sansho the Baliff as one of the greatest most powerful endings to a film. and it is this ending wherein one perhaps like Genjuro himself takes more notice of the little moments that suddenly take much more significance.This is the only film where upon first viewing I watched it again within 24 hours. The first time I was sad but overwhelmed like I wasn't sure I liked it except for the ending.

	schema:reviewBody "'Ugetsu' is a Japanese film directed by Kenji Mizoguchi based on stories in Ueda Akinari's book titled Ugetsu Monogatari. At the basic level this is a story about survival during the Japanese Civil Wars in the late 16th century. The film follows two married couples namely Genjur and Miyagi Tbei and Ohama of the mi Province. They get uprooted along with a lot of other families when their village gets attacked by Shibata Katsuie's army. Genjur being a potter decides to go to mizo to sell his wares to earn money. He goes to mizo with Tbei and Ohama while Miyagi decides to stay back and take care of GenichiMiyagi and Genjur's son. While in mizo Genjur gets attracted to the mysterious and enigmatic Lady Wakasa and becomes overwhelmed by his interest in her and Tbei who was always a bit of a delusional dimwit gets more and more inclined towards living the life of a samurai and showoff his bravery and strength. Tbei ends up seeking out Samurai soldiers leaving his wife Ohama alone and helpless during chaotic wartime.Along with 'Rashomon' 'Ugetsu' is considered by many critics to be the film that opened doors for Japanese cinema in the western world and gave the cinema in Japan a global exposure. Like 'Rashomon' this film was also based on Japanese folk tales but Mizoguchi's humanist filmmaking made it relevant for the 1950s and its relevance hasn't waned at all in the last 50 years. 'Ugetsu' belonged to a whole line of films that got released after WWII along with 'Rashomon' 'The Bicycle Thief' 'The Planes are Flying' 'Ivan's Childhood' etc. which looked at war in a critical way instead of glorifying. They critiqued the very purpose of war by brutally depicting its devastating consequences. Although 'Ugetsu' is set in 16th century Japan during the Japanese Civil War for me it clearly is an allegory for Japanese society during WWII and the allegory here is a lit bit more overt and obvious than the same in 'Rashomon'.This can surely be seen as a feminist film. We see the men fall prey to puerile ambitions and greed while the women are left helpless and asked to fend for themselves during a time of war when they are more prone to danger and harm with ravenous and wild warriors running around everywhere. But the women in the film do what they have to do without showing any fear and without accepting defeat. After watching this film I don't think it is possible for anyone to not fall completely in love with the character of Miyagi. She has unconditional love for her husband Genjur and their son Genichi. She does whatever she has to to make sure her son survives under difficult harsh conditions when Genjur was spending time with Lady Wasaka. This film shows the hopeless nature of gender inequality that existed in medieval Japan and how women were extremely vulnerable.The film as I mentioned before is an allegory for the Japanese society and the Japanese political system in the WWII era. Like Tbei some men are too drawn to the idea of power and will go to any lengths to prove to others that they are powerful by engaging in pointless fights. Genjur represents those people who being led by unrestricted greed want to utilise war in their own way by making use of people's troubles to fill up their pockets. Lady Wasaka is very mysterious and interesting character. She is a very Mephistopheles like character who lures Genjur into her world by promising him eternal happiness wealth and love. The Faustesque Genjur falls for her and abandons his own family. If the people sitting on thrones are led by the greed for power and the greed for lust and wealth it can sometimes lead to irreparable damage to their country and its people. This might sound preachy but the film presents this through the screenplay instead of blatant sermons. The film is also a commentary on the disappearance of Buddhist ideals and principals in modern Japanese society.Along with Mizoguchi's style of storytelling one can't help but admire the skill of his camera work. The film has many beautiful wide shots which serve both purposes  beauty as well as thematic relevance. There are some seamless transitions from one scene to another. Mizoguchi also beautifully builds tension and sets a Gothic creepy atmosphere in certain scenes which lends the film a genuine horror element. However 'Ugetsu' like 'Rashomon' ends in a very optimistic and emotional note.'Ugetsu' is a film whose importance and significance in film history can never be questioned. It is an artistic allegory of life during wartime. As long as the concept of war exists in human society this film will continue to have significant relevance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ugetsu or Ugetsu monogatari took the world by storm when it was released in the 50s helping to popularize Japanese cinema in the West. Even nowadays it is hailed as one of the best to come out of Japan. It tells the story of two families that try to seek their fortunes while a war rages near their lands. Its messages are those of knowing your place not extending your reach avoiding the temptations of glory and flesh the safety of home and most importantly the fact that sometimes the past and the afterlife are not yet ready to leave this world.It's a multilayered story focusing mostly on the husbands of the two families as they travel to a distant marketplace in the midst of war in order to sell their pottery. Along the way they both face struggles and temptations that delay their return home. The contrast rises from the fact that whereas one of them is lead astray by his own need for glory the other is seduced by a source he had no way of anticipating. Likewise the two wives deal with the missing of their husbands in very different manners creating contrast.The reason why I haven't ranked this movie any higher is because I have slight problems with Japanese live action cinema in general. More accurately with its pacing. Ugetsu is a slow film. Its tone is also surprisingly flat which is another thing I've often noticed in Japanese films. It's a cultural thing I have no doubt about it but the fact still remains that I have problems identifying with any of the characters or the events because they're all performed with minimal emotions. Horrible things happen but the expressions on the people's faces hardly change. Or when the characters finally show any emotions they overact. Most of the emotions have to be read from the context or from the dialogue. This stems from the heavy traditions of Japanese theatre and while I respect it I simply don't like it.Ugetsu is an artistic film. It has heavy deeply layered themes archetypical plot and characters struggling against their fates. Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a deeper movie experience. Personally I don't like it all that much but I have a lot of respect for it.".

In Kenji Mizoguchi's Ugestu I was moved and tossed through a loop but in the end it was definitely worth it.I am fascinated by the Japanese culture especially the different erasperiods that they went though. The title of the film is based on a book two in fact called Tales of the Moon and Rain I am trying my best not to add any spoilers to this entry.The film takes place in the 16th century CivilWar period. These were desperate times of survival mostly for men who would have the main duty of protecting the family. The protagonist in this story Genjr has a wife and a child. They are in need of money and his pottery is beginning to sell very well on ACCOUNT of the war going on. It is when a group of bandits come into their small village and demand strict labor upon any man they can find. Luckily Genjr's family gets away just in time. They set sail to a bigger town so he can sell more of his crafts. To accompany him is a man named Tobei and his wife. Tobei is sort of the dimwitted character that needs a purpose. Though everything he needs is right in from of him a wife friends food a decent job etc. he has a dream to one day be a samurai. This you can tell is not a good idea since he is gullible and really bad with his savings. But at least he is helping Genjr and his family get by.It is when Genjr's wife has to stay back with the child so that they can travel more cautiously. There have been pirates lurking around and it was not necessary to risk it. In the town that Genjr Tobei and his wife sell the pottery Genjr comes across a mysterious maiden with hikimayu eyebrows Lady Wakasa who invites him up to her secluded manor with her and her servant lady. This is probably where I should stop.The film definitely took me by surprise. I actually thought it was a horror flick at first. Either way I was not disappointed to find out that is was a fantasydramamystery. It kept me interested the whole way through. I would have to say my favorite character that goes through the change is simply Tobei. His aspiring hope for becoming a true man and brave warrior take a turn.. for whatever you want to look at it. I found him and his wife's story which sort of breaks off from Genjr's in the middle very touching and heartfelt.".

	schema:reviewBody "Truly one of the greatest and most stunning films of all time Ugetsu 1953 is a Japanese masterpiece a ghost story and so much more. Masterfully combining two stories from its source Tales of Moonlight and Rain Ugetsu is set during the Japanese Civil Wars and follows a farmer whose pottery takes off sales booming in wartime. His ambition and greed inflamed he leaves his wife and young son for business ultimately seduced by a strange young lady who poses a sinister threat to him.Ugetsu is a tale of ambition desire and greed consuming men and leading to grief. This is tied in with the civil wars in 1953 a lesson about the follies of war would have resonated with Japanese audiences. As a ghost story the subplot of the potterer Genjr's buffoonish sidekick Tbee pursuing a career as a samurai might ordinarily be an odd fit but in this film the two stories don't seem to conflict. Like Genjr Tbee is chasing an unrealistic dream and abandoning his wife destroys her. Seeing her raped and becoming a disgraced prostitute is dark but in the end they get off easier than our hero and his wife.It's Genjr's story that's truly the outstandingly mesmerizing part of the film at once surreal but very real and frightening. Our seductress Lady Wakasa presents herself as the survivor of a wiped out clan.

Seeing him reunited and then losing the apparition of his lost wife is reminiscent of the later Soviet film Solaris 1972. It's nearly as frightening and devastating. The two ghosts of the film tie the story together as a motif with the atmosphere helped along with spooky music and other supernatural allusions. Ugetsu emerges as a fantastic tale universal in its themes and message and brilliantly executed. Like its ghost characters it may live forever.".

	onyx:emotionText "Truly one of the greatest and most stunning films of all time Ugetsu 1953 is a Japanese masterpiece a ghost story and so much more. Masterfully combining two stories from its source Tales of Moonlight and Rain Ugetsu is set during the Japanese Civil Wars and follows a farmer whose pottery takes off sales booming in wartime. His ambition and greed inflamed he leaves his wife and young son for business ultimately seduced by a strange young lady who poses a sinister threat to him.Ugetsu is a tale of ambition desire and greed consuming men and leading to grief. This is tied in with the civil wars in 1953 a lesson about the follies of war would have resonated with Japanese audiences. As a ghost story the subplot of the potterer Genjr's buffoonish sidekick Tbee pursuing a career as a samurai might ordinarily be an odd fit but in this film the two stories don't seem to conflict. Like Genjr Tbee is chasing an unrealistic dream and abandoning his wife destroys her. Seeing her raped and becoming a disgraced prostitute is dark but in the end they get off easier than our hero and his wife.It's Genjr's story that's truly the outstandingly mesmerizing part of the film at once surreal but very real and frightening. Our seductress Lady Wakasa presents herself as the survivor of a wiped out clan. She hints she may be an enchantress she acknowledges spirits in the castle but she entraps Genjr with a life of pleasures and makes him forget about his family. A holy man warns him his life is in danger and Lady Wakasa is a spirit he finally sees it when Lady Wakasa is repelled by prayers to Buddha the holy man has painted on Genjr's skin. Lady Wakasa is revealed as an unholy abomination but somewhat sympathetic a girl killed before ever knowing love.Genjr returns to his home village as the family man his wife always wanted him to be but now his wife is a spirit herself a casualty of war.

Here he brushes a psychological portrait of two women through their 'ghosts' 'even the most beautiful silks fade' which reveal diametrically opposite comportments an obsessed seductress and a faithful wife.Based on two stories of Akinari's 'Tales of Moonlight and Rain' 'The Serpent's Lust' and 'The ReedChoked House' a ghost of a young lady seeks to live 'the ardent love on earth' while a faithful wife became a ghost in order to be able to await faithfully the return of her husband. In other words the main theme is the dichotomy between sex and love. The overall background of the stories is a Japan ravaged by clan wars. As for the men they are stupid but full of ambition to profit from the 'God of War' one as a warrior and the other as a pottertrader.This magnificent movie nevertheless doesn't reach the same superb level as 'Street of Shame'. In addition Akinari's book with its meditations on religious and artistic themes is richer and more profound than the movie.".

The debilitating effects of male greed and ambition and the interlinked thwarting of women's dreams are related prosaically enough through the plot development. What elevates Ugetsu to greatness is the haunting fearful imagery employed in the ghost sequences and the mundane banal rendering of rape and murder. Mizoguchi employs the full frame to great effect as one character dies in the foreground her murderers weakened by hunger quarrel over scraps of food far in the distance. Sound is employed skillfully too the cries of the child on the back of his dying mother are heartwrenching. The ending is surprisingly upbeat both couples reunited after a fashion their love tested but undiminished  strengthened if anything. Modern Japanese cinema driven by TV cash and a TV mindset often seems unable to reach out and deliver human stories that can be universally understood. It seems ironic to think that over fifty years ago a mere eight years after the end of WWII Mizoguchi could so skillfully debunk the Japanese male psyche and 'Yamato spirit' yet in 2007 we have the Governor of Tokyo scripting films about the glory of the kamikaze and Japan's crusade of Asian liberation. Nostalgia for the heyday of Japanese cinema is as much a product of modern failure as the genius of Mizoguchi and his peers.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been lurking on this section for some time now with a few raised eyebrows at some of the comments that have been passed here. I think some are just wholly unjustified and inaccurate.I have seen Krrish twice now. It is an unabashed popcorn entertainer. You're typical Hollywood special effects summer blockbuster only that it has a unique Indian soul and the quintessential Bollywood elements. It is an accomplished blend of Indian popular storytelling  western technology and Asian action and it's historic success in India proves how successful this fusion is.Surprisingly unlike most Hollywood film where technology and action takes precedence here special effects are minimally and virtuouslyoften seamlessly used and most of the emphasis is on the emotional journey of the protagonist who is reborn as the superhero only towards the end shifting to scifi action and concluding in a mesmerising groundairsea helicopter chase sequence supported by an awesome and adrenalinepumping background score. Now I am going to deal with the common issues made against Krissh 1. Action and special effects do not compare to Hollywood standards.You really do need to define what Hollywood standards are. I have seen many big budget Hollywood special effects extravaganzas and the quality of special effects are variable they range from good to bad from shot to shot and from film to film.Krrish is nothing below Hollywood standards It has effects work that is on par or better than some Hollywood films and less than some. What matters most is do they work on their own terms and given that masses of people including international critics have appreciated them means an emphatic yes.2. The techniques effects and stunts are borrowed andor plagiarised from Hollywood and Asian films such as Crouching Tiger House of flying daggersPaycheck Matrix.First of all it would make sense that special effects techniques have been repeated from Hollywood because the special effects supervisors  are from Hollywood.It would make sense that the stunts and martial arts have been repeated from Asian films because the stunt choreographer  is from Hong Kong.Secondly techniques are invented to be reused. There is no need to reinvent the wheel.A filmmaker has at his utility an entire toolkit of established techniques. It is how he uses them to actualise his vision that creates originality. In that respect Rakesh Roshan is not a hack because while he borrows techniques he tailors them to his unique vision and lends them an originality of their own.The stunts and action scenes have been designed according to Krrish's character and his own quirks abilities and idiosyncrasies.In particular the final groundairsea helicopter chase sequence and the shot where Krrish uses the fountain jet to catapult himawesome shot into the air has never been done before. The animeinspired fight sequence on the island is another spark of creativity. The initial sequence of him running to catch the glider is another very original sequence. Ditto for the Circus fire scene.3. Krrish is a mundane love story comedy and drama for most of the film. Not enough superhero elements.When I watched Krrish the first time I too echoed the same sentiments. I wanted to see more action scenes and superhero elements not the usual run of the mill romantic comedy. I was disappointed. Then when I watched it the second time this time without expecting a superhero film I realised it's not suppose to be a superhero film it is the beginning of a superhero 4. Krrish is a hybrid of other superheros films and copies plot elements.Superhero films are quite a predictable genre and share many similarities. They are the classic tale of good vs evil where the hero is supergood and the villain is supereviloften a megalomaniac with designs to take over the world and the film builds to the final faceoff where good will invariably triumph. Superman follows the exactly the same story arc so does Batman so does Spiderman and yes so does Krrish.Another similarity is that the superheroego will often be incognito and not reveal their true identity except to a select few. You see this in Superman Spiderman and Batman so you also see it in Krrish. Again because the superhero is mysterious they become the talk of the world and the the press become obsessed with them and in unveiling their identity. You see this in Superman Spiderman and Batman so you see it in Krrish.Krrish is as original and unoriginal as any superhero film. If you can accept that Superman is not a copy of Spiderman and Spiderman is not a copy of Batman. Then you should be able to accept that Krrish is not a copy of either of them and stands as an original work. 5. Krrish is just the usual Bollywood potboiler with songs and dances comedy melodrama and colours.So are 99.9 of Bollywood films. This is the unique Bollywood identity and filmmaking heritage and make no mistake about it Krrish is an allout Bollywood film made for mass consumption by Bollywood fans.Krrish is a very commendable and wellmade film an all outentertainer with plenty of cool action and special effects but with it's heart in it's story of Krishna becoming Krrishplayed admirably by Hrithik Roshan It's also a historic milestone in Indian filmmaking and will be to Indian cinema what Superman was to American cinema. Expect the sequel to even bigger.An impressive and worldclass entry by Bollywood to the fantastic world of scifi and fantasy. I look forward to more such films from Bollywood. In fact as I write  another Bollywood director is in the preproduction phase of a big budget futuristic scifi romance set in 2050 India and not an ordinary love story it's the love story between a robot and a human!".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Krrish";
	schema:reviewBody "The very first Indian movie I saw in its entirety as a kid was Annamalai starring Superstar Rajnikanth. Since then I was intrigued by Indian cinema but never found the patience nor the time to sit through the standard fare of at least 2.53hrs of pure spectacle. On and off I caught bits and pieces of movies shown on TV and the last Bollywood movie I saw midway was Shah Rukh Khan's Asoka and that's it.Krrish is a sequel to the blockbuster Koi... Mil Gaya also directed by Rakesh Roshan but no worries if you haven't seen the first movie  you'll be brought up to speed in no time and Krrish will also work if it stood alone. First off it's a superhero movie combined with science fiction so that was a plus point to have this movie reintroduce me to Bollywood once again. And it worked. With romance action and some comedy thrown into the mix what can one ask for more for pure entertainment?Those not familiar with Bollywood movies might balk at the length of Krrish  almost 5 minutes shy of 3 hours which is quite standard runtime fare there is a clearly marked interval in the movie but it was not utilized here. But I tell you that you won't feel its length and will actually secretly hope that it continues some more. The first hour dwelled on the introduction of our hero Krishna Hrithik Roshan a man born with extraordinary powers whose grandmother Sonia took upon herself to shield him from a world awaiting to exploit his talent if discovered. It's like a visit to the Kent farm except that the whole grandmother son relationship looked more at home visavis Spiderman's Aunt May and Peter Parker.When Krishna meets Priya the gorgeous Priyanka Chopra Miss World 2000 by chance during her adventure holiday camp and he becomes smitten with her moving the movie towards a romance. She's the quintessential Singapore modern career girl who puts career or trying to salvage it before love and therein complicates matters of the heart when we get to the boymomentarilylosesgirl bit. Plenty of drama in this area though it doesn't dwell too long on it increasing the pace for the action bits.Those eager to see Krrish the superhero will have to wait almost 2 hours before he makes an appearance in full costume. He's like Jet Li's cousin Black Mask with the black outfit and abilities but with a better looking facial piece to disguise his identity. But with or without costume we see Krishna's prowess through various stunt and fight choreography enhanced by wirework from one of Hong Kong's stunt masters Chen SiuTung especially in his qing gong abilities to glide effortlessly through the air like Chinese martial artists. There's also a showpiece for Hrithik to demonstrate the kungfu skills picked up and the fights if compared with other Bollywood movies have toned down its cheesy sound effects and credibility issues because of its premise if a superhero punches you you'll definitely fly what.And what's a Bollywood flick without song and dance? Yes our hero sings and dances when romancing his love from the mountains in India to the skyscrapers in Singapore but he doesn't do so as his alterego Krrish yup just let the superhero stick to kicking serious rear. There are 5 beautiful songs in Krrish and save for the one in the circus the rest did not involve mass dancing by extras which kept the focus purely on the leads. And the dance choreography was pretty amazing too though I was surprised that Hrithik Roshan given his muscular bulk could dance so gracefully. Oh did I mention Priyanka Chopra is gorgeous?While the romance and action bit were interesting the science fiction bit was unfortunately found wanting. Not that it was bad but because it was too familiar. Adapting the same plot as Philip K Dick's Paycheck the sets premise and plot device looked exactly the same as John Woo's Paycheck movie  we have the evil Dr Arya Naseeruddin Shah building a supercomputer which can look into the future and therefore becoming God himself. The evil lair too looked like Woo's underground lair in MI2 complete with pigeons no doves in Singapore.For those who want to know more about the local landmarks used  Singapore Expo was used quite a bit since it's large enough to be filmed at different areas passing off as different venues even doubling up as Changi Airport's arrival hall entrance with smart editing. The Esplanade was another choice location as the HQ of a conglomerate run by Dr Arya with National Library's Pod doubling as the penthouse office. There are many scenes with glass windows which will clue you in on the location of the current setting. Other notable locations are the condos at Kallang Shenton Way  Raffles Place Lau Pa Sat widely publicized during the shoot here the Singapore River and our offshore islands.Krrish reminded me that cinema is about the big spectacle and I encourage anyone who's into song dance and especially those interested in seeing local landmarks make their way into movies to give Krrish a shot. It made Singapore look sexy and probably showed us a different angle in making an action movie here. While awaiting the arrival of Singer's Man of Steel watch Krrish!".

The story was amazing the best thing about it is the computer that can see the future and Krishna never intended to be a superhero he wanted to save the kids from a circus fire but made a promise to his grandmother not to show his powers to anyone so he changed his overcoat inside out  wore a mask and that is how Krishna became Krrish Hrithik's body language for a superhero was terrific. Mostly in other superhero movies they intend to be a hero which is not very amazing. In the end I was almost going to cry when Krishna was trying to save his father it was extremely emotional. The ending was awesome when Dr Arya was about to die  Krishna took off his mask and showed who he really is and there were sparks everywhere it means that Dr Arya would have known who he is if he looked ahead into the future when he seen his death but he looked before his death to try and avoid it. Definitely Hrithik Roshan's best film and it is 1000 times better than the crappy SpiderMan 3 I just recently seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Krrish is a unique movie that combines many elements and genres. Reviewing this film is no easy task reviewing it objectively is even harder. This is because Krrish breaks many of the expectations of a western moviegoer. It's action is unusual its acting is often exaggerated not to mention that its in a foreign language! Getting a good perspective on the film is hard when it doesn't look anything like the movie one was looking for. So let me just get my bias out on the table early on in this review. I loved it! I haven't laughed that hard in any action movie ever. I haven't seen fights that good in any comedy ever. Nor have I ever seen music videos like those in any scifi super hero flick. I love the crazy place this movie has found in terms of genre. This film moves easily from pop music video to mangastyle action to touching drama to thought provoking scifi. It's just great.However the bizarre amount of slapstick comedy product placementgeneral commercialism and constant switching of genre may very well put some western viewers off. This movie is not your usual super hero flick. Batman this is not.It is however an excellent movie that combines the core elements of the super hero genre with romance comedy and scifi and does this quite effectively thanks to the good dialogue great choreography and effects and great acting and dancing by Hrithik Roshan and Priyanka Chopra.I was thoroughly entertained and would recommend this film to just about anyone who is willing to suspend disbelief sit back and enjoy the show.".

In the first halfI mistook Krishh to be a kid moviemeant for kids below 10 years of age.In the second half i realized its not even a kids movie..its just a bizarre dumb movie that has more holes in its script than most adults can count.Plus points1.The graphicsPretty good for an Indian movie though flawed in their execution.everyone knows u have to push down to move up..but newtons third law of equal and opposite forces don't matter for Krishh.2.Hrithik RoshanThe hard work is evidentbut he cant salvage a horrible script.Negative points 1.ScriptHoleridden and immature.

	schema:headline " Left a lot to be desired";
	schema:reviewBody "Hrithik as Krrish and as Rohit put in a good effort but for me it wasn't enough to make up for the shortcomings of the film. First of all the film's first mistake was calling itself a sequel. The moment a movie is called a sequel people will already have a notion of what they want to see and what they expect. The fact that this movie is the sequel to Koi Mil Gaya I expected it to surpass the first movie. Krrish only surpassed Koi Mil Gaya in terms of the special effects. I'll talk about the songs first. In Koi Mil Gaya the songs with the exception of perhaps one did much to further the plot. More than that they were catchy and truly showcased the brilliance of Rakesh Roshan. In Krrish every time I saw a song number I just felt the movie dragged on even more. The songs weren't at all catchy with perhaps the exception of the circus number. In my opinion the songs just served to drag the film longer.OK now on to the leads. I liked the character of Krrish a lot. He had a lot of that Clark Kent innocence and Superman values that truly makes him a hero. What I didn't like though was the character of Priya who was so utterly selfish that from the moment Krrish followed her to Singapore she did nothing but lie to him. She was too easily influenced by her best friend that you wonder if this girl even has a spine. Not to mention there were so many instances where she showed a total lack of common sense. This is such a step back from the character of Nisha from the first movie who was a strong female character and guided Rohit and did her best to protect his innocence from the harshness of the world. In Koi Mil Gaya I totally understood why Rohit fell in love with Nisha. In Krrish on the other hand you get a feeling that Krrish only fell in love with Priya because she's the first woman his age that he's seen all his life until that point! SPOILERS ahead As for the plot I felt that they didn't need to connect Krrish to Koi Mil Gaya. All it did was ruin the sweet memory of Rohit and Nisha from that movie their fate in the sequel is just so horrible. Krrish would have worked much better as a stand alone. I mean you can't have E.T. and then have Spiderman as the sequel. The Roshans argued that they needed an original reason for Krrish to have his powers. I'm thinking nothing about Krrish is original! The Roshans have already borrowed so much from Hollywood that it wouldn't hurt to borrow a plot point from a Hollywood movie for the origin of his powers. Sacrificing some originality would have been worth it to keep the happy ending that Rohit and Nisha had in the last film.Also the twist at the end where Rohit turned up alive was just so ridiculous. By the way another thing that really bothered me was that in Krrish Rohit in the flashbacks while he was still young looked too much like the mentally handicapped Rohit from the first film. The first film already established that Rohit was completely normal and he even looked that way after Jadoo gave him powers. I didn't understand why the movie felt like it had to change that. Perhaps they just wanted the characters of Rohit and Krishna to be really different.Preity Zinta was good in the 3 seconds that she was in the movie. I felt quite ripped off that that was all she got. The writers got rid of her character without much thought if you asked me. They didn't do much justice to a well established and well loved character. The scene when an old Rohit returns home to find Nisha dead will bring tears to your eyes and you wonder what the point is for the tragic fate of these two.Rekha was the gem of the film. It was only in the scenes that had her in it did I feel like I was not watching a parody of a superhero movie.Roshan couldn't find a nice balance between the superhero aspect of Krrish and the romance aspect of it plus having to establish the background of the film. Perhaps he could've gotten a lesson or two from the Spiderman. This is another reason why I felt that a standalone film would have been better. As a standalone Krrish wouldn't have to waste valuable time telling what happened to Rohit and then trying to bring closure to that in the same film where they are trying to establish a new character entirely. But the biggest shortcoming of this film was that it didn't make us empathize with Krrish and Priya the way we did for Rohit and Nisha in the first film. In the first film I rooted for Rohit and Nisha to overcome all odds to be together. Since Krrish was advertised as a love story before a superhero movie I expected the same. Unfortunately the chemistry between Hrithik and Priyanka was colder than an iceberg. Not to mention that the character of Priya was just so weak that you wonder how the hero could fall in love with her. At the end of the film I still cared more about the characters from the previous film than i did for this one. All in all the movie left a lot to be desired and I hope if they make any other sequels that they will be respectful of the legacy that their prequels established.".

	onyx:emotionText "Hrithik as Krrish and as Rohit put in a good effort but for me it wasn't enough to make up for the shortcomings of the film. First of all the film's first mistake was calling itself a sequel. The moment a movie is called a sequel people will already have a notion of what they want to see and what they expect. The fact that this movie is the sequel to Koi Mil Gaya I expected it to surpass the first movie. Krrish only surpassed Koi Mil Gaya in terms of the special effects. I'll talk about the songs first. In Koi Mil Gaya the songs with the exception of perhaps one did much to further the plot. More than that they were catchy and truly showcased the brilliance of Rakesh Roshan. In Krrish every time I saw a song number I just felt the movie dragged on even more. The songs weren't at all catchy with perhaps the exception of the circus number. In my opinion the songs just served to drag the film longer.OK now on to the leads. I liked the character of Krrish a lot. He had a lot of that Clark Kent innocence and Superman values that truly makes him a hero. What I didn't like though was the character of Priya who was so utterly selfish that from the moment Krrish followed her to Singapore she did nothing but lie to him. She was too easily influenced by her best friend that you wonder if this girl even has a spine. Not to mention there were so many instances where she showed a total lack of common sense. This is such a step back from the character of Nisha from the first movie who was a strong female character and guided Rohit and did her best to protect his innocence from the harshness of the world. In Koi Mil Gaya I totally understood why Rohit fell in love with Nisha. In Krrish on the other hand you get a feeling that Krrish only fell in love with Priya because she's the first woman his age that he's seen all his life until that point! SPOILERS ahead As for the plot I felt that they didn't need to connect Krrish to Koi Mil Gaya. All it did was ruin the sweet memory of Rohit and Nisha from that movie their fate in the sequel is just so horrible. Krrish would have worked much better as a stand alone. I mean you can't have E.T. and then have Spiderman as the sequel. The Roshans argued that they needed an original reason for Krrish to have his powers. I'm thinking nothing about Krrish is original! The Roshans have already borrowed so much from Hollywood that it wouldn't hurt to borrow a plot point from a Hollywood movie for the origin of his powers. Sacrificing some originality would have been worth it to keep the happy ending that Rohit and Nisha had in the last film.Also the twist at the end where Rohit turned up alive was just so ridiculous. By the way another thing that really bothered me was that in Krrish Rohit in the flashbacks while he was still young looked too much like the mentally handicapped Rohit from the first film.

But on the acting point of view it definitely disappoints. the film solely relies on Hrithik Roshan's shoulders and he delivers but this is certainly not his best as an actor though as krrish i cannot think of anybody else but him playing the role  all the other characters are just passable which include the highly talented Rekha who looks uncomfortable in the role of a grand mother.Priyanka Chopra looks good and is camera friendly though not much of the histrionics on her part. The story is quite predictable with hardly any twists.The first half of the film is a mediocre boy meet girl romance with tracing the origins of krishna aka krrish. the music is alright though not as good as rajesh roshan's previous attempts. its only in the second half that film picks up and the special effects come into play.These special effects are good according to bollywood standards. Like any other superhero movie it does have a villain in Naseeruddin Shah.he has played roles as a villain like in Mohra before but this time hes strictly okay. The film has high production values the director has handled the product well.But overall he's confused whether to churn out an out and out sci fi flick or a mix of all genres.The film was Promoted as a Super hero movie though its more of a romanticsuper hero type. That thing could be due to the budget constraints it was not made as solely as a science fictionsuper hero movie. The special effects look a mix of matrix crouching tiger hidden dragon and other action flicks . On the whole krrish traces the origins of our very own desi super hero. it could be the first in the series with more to come. I hope the sequel will be more of a super hero type with more CGI and special effects romped in.

We should appreciate him because he is making a movie from scratch which is not based upon any comic book. Another way its also a blessing to him because he can be true to his imagination. Rakesh on the other hand gone in reference with some Hollywood films. Rakesh has done a wonderful job with Krrish. The story well its neither concentrated on the superpowers nor on good vs evil but full and fully on his son Hrithik Roshan and he lives up to to his dads expectation. The viewer should have a knowledge on Koi Mil Gaya KMG its prequel oh oh don't worry if you have not seen it Rekha takes that responsibility in the movie to explain you whats happened so far quite quickly of course. So how Krrish realizes his powers and uses it to save the worl.. wait a min no more saving the world Rakesh gives a break to saving a world formula rather he adds family drama to it and pulls off a convincing entertainer out of it. The most app laudable aspect of the movie is the stunt sequence Hrithik gets 55 for the stunts that he has performed on his own with out any dummies. The stunt choreographer has done an excellent job with the movie. Unlike any Indian movie so far this by far the best stunts that you can see which involves ropes pulling and flying. Hardly you see any rope or even a hint of it in the movie at least i didn't see it. The next aspect is the cinematography music and above all the visual effects team. The music is good if not the greatest background score SalimSuleiman has done a decent job. The visual effects team along with the cinematographer has pulled of some exotic locations and some beautiful stunt sequence. Hrithik looks cool with his new hair style and Priyanka Chopra does her doll role pretty well. If you loved KMG the for sure you will love this even more than that if don't like the first one better keep away then complaining. In fact i felt this was even more technically advanced than KMG. SpiderMan Superman Batman etc... because the list of movies which you have seen over and over the years you will be forced to compare this movie with all those movies. I think is not fair to compare it with them. Even though you could see some shots similar to the movies mentioned you have to give Rakesh Roshan that much extra amount of space because of the budget constraint and the lack of the comic book hero that India has. Yes its technically the best Indian SuperHero film I have ever seen and A SuperHero is Born.".

Producing a good quality product and probably the first megahit SEQUEL with a steady increasing pace that goes from 0500mph by the time the movie is over requires planning control and execution. RR delivers big time. Hrithik takes RR's vision and makes it even better by performing at the highest level. If we are talking about a SuperStar phenomenon after the Big B with a combination of Personality Built Charisma and Consistency IMHO Hrithik will be IT in the years to come. The improvements needed would be a little more aggressiveness in angry roles. KRRISH does begin where Koi Mil Gaya ended...and as the movie progresses does seal itself as a true sequel. When you walk out in the end you feel justice is served to KMG. The humor in the first half the sequence of events the songs which are part of the movie rather than being stuffed into the movie Chori chori... Aao Suanoon Pyar ki.. and Dil Na Diya.. what an amazing dance number by HK in the 2nd half are refreshing. Action scenes do have the signature of HongKong Martial arts master SiuTung Ching a little less in the 1st half and it takes quite a bit to introduce the character Krrish which comes into existence only 1520mins after the interval. The action is increasingly more than you can imagine in the 2nd half. The special effects are first rate. N.Shah is just amazing as Dr. Arya and it would have been nice to see more of him but would have made it unnecessary. If Rekha and Hrithik deliver the most emotional performances throughout the film Hemant Pandey Puneet Issar Priyanka  friends provide the comic relief in the first half. Sharat Saxena is menacing with his looks. APSingh is the perfect ByBoss and the Chinese guy Gin Xia for his brief stuntsOverall  Great Entertainer and yes I'd like a sequel to Krrish  Some Dings at KRRISH  The first child actor who plays Krishna is quite irritating thanks to only a 5 min role Introduciton of the character Krrish could've been a bit sooner in the film The films length the last song could've been cut even if it gets under your skin over time due to its softness and awesome picturization.".

The action is increasingly more than you can imagine in the 2nd half. The special effects are first rate. N.Shah is just amazing as Dr. Arya and it would have been nice to see more of him but would have made it unnecessary. If Rekha and Hrithik deliver the most emotional performances throughout the film Hemant Pandey Puneet Issar Priyanka  friends provide the comic relief in the first half. Sharat Saxena is menacing with his looks. APSingh is the perfect ByBoss and the Chinese guy Gin Xia for his brief stuntsOverall  Great Entertainer and yes I'd like a sequel to Krrish  Some Dings at KRRISH  The first child actor who plays Krishna is quite irritating thanks to only a 5 min role Introduciton of the character Krrish could've been a bit sooner in the film The films length the last song could've been cut even if it gets under your skin over time due to its softness and awesome picturization.";

	schema:reviewBody "I can't help it but I simply love this movie. When I first heard about an Indian superhero my curiosity awoke immediately even though I hadn't the faintest idea about Bollywood at the time. Since then I've seen it many times and always with pleasure. The entire movie is carried mostly by the Krrish character a crossover between Tarzan Batman and Neo I'd say. What I particularly like in him is that in spite of his supernatural powers he always remains a naive boy from the countryside. He cannot fly doesn't use any gadgets is not bulletproof and unable to turn a person into ice with his touch... Krrish is simply a bit stronger and faster than others and he can jump a little higher. That's about it. Yet the credits for this charming character should definitely go to the actor playing it. Frankly I can't imagine anybody else playing Krrish as well as Hrithik Roshan does.Of course the movie has a few weak points too especially when it comes to the storyline. But then superhero movies rarely have story lines that are particularly clever. Still it is odd that Nisha managed to give birth to a son while Rohit had been working nonstop in Singapore for two years Krishna and Rohit are similar enough to each other to exclude the possibility of someone else doing the job for him. But okay let's assume Rohit took a short vacation and met his wife. It is also odd that Krishna at the beginning of the movie meets a girl who shortly after convinces him to travel thousands of miles to visit her in the very same city that by pure coincidence turns out to be the place where his father is still being kept alive artificially by the evil genius Dr. Arya. I mean he didn't go there to save his dad did he? Obviously one of those typical coincidences that Bollywood seems to be fond of. How often have we seen situations like a fellow seeing the girl of his dreams in one place and then completely accidentally meeting her again in a completely different part of the world just a few days later? However improbable all these things are still theoretically possible. But how about this after Dr. Arya witnesses his own tragic death caused by Krrish in the near future he doesn't hesitate goes to town shoots poor Chris Lee whom he believes is Krrish and returns home satisfied. But now he finds out he hasn't changed the future at all in a few minutes he is going to be killed by Krrish anyway. And indeed Krrish appears. But Dr. Arya is wellprepared because on this very moment he has a surprise for Krrish Priya the only weakness of the real Krrish. Could someone please explain to me why Dr. Arya would have abducted Priya and when?Apart from several holes in the script I still think Krrish is a great movie. Hrithik Roshan is a fantastic Krrish and I very much like Dr. Arya subtly played by Naseeruddin Shah. Rekha does an excellent job as the sexiest grandmother ever. Also it's hard to dislike Chris Lee Krishna's Chinese friend. I'm not so convinced about Priyanka Chopra playing Priya but several of her later roles prove at least that she is growing as an actress. Absolutely worth mentioning is also the wonderful background score by SalimSulaiman. The songs written by Rajesh Roshan aren't bad either.All in all heartily recommended. Eagerly waiting for Krrish 2.".

Mil Gaya. Steven Spielberg shamelessly made E.T Extra Terrestrial and not only that even the end credits were stolen by the Star Wars team.Now the Roshans are very creative people and creativity runs in the family. Be it the theme of Karan Arjun which was copied by James Cameron for Terminator or his Tumne Joh Kaha from Laawaris Akshaye Khanna Manisha Koirala which was copied by the music band Aqua who took all the credit for Barbie Girl not mentioning even once that it was Mr. Rajesh Roshan's original tune that inspired them. This time too Rajesh Roshan is cheated upon by the Turkish Military that make Dil Na Diya from Krrish The Indian Kukuboy their theme and deny any role of Rajesh Roshan towards its creation.But no worries Indian Cinema should be proud at the way its progressing with movies like Krrish. The only problem is... the progress is negative. Taran Adarsh of course was very amused by what Stealkraft.... I mean Filmkraft had done with Krrish but I believe other people would differ... I am referring to the thinking class of India.There is no doubt that Krrish The Indian Kukuboy will be nominated for Best Film Best Director Best Actor Best Story... Best Gay Movie and Best performance in a supporting role Archana Puran Singh. She was brilliant. So back to the story there was none to start off with but if you're asking me what the 3 hourlong Kukuboy consisted of well. Krrish is a very intelligent boy since childhood and it seems that he has inherited Supernatural powers from his father who is supposed to be dead but brings in his sorry wrinkled autistic ass in the climax oops I spoilt the climax for you film lovers.The beauty of Krrish The Indian Kukuboy lies at a place you cannot see and hence you tend to get misled into believing that there is no beauty at all but there is. When was it the last time that you saw an Indian Superhero? Agreed Sunny Deol is a very innovative man and he makes well for a poor man's Hulk  Rambo  Pakistani Terrorists  An Obese Indian Patriot. Puneet Issar did break new grounds for Indian Cinema with his Desi version of Superman but Krrish is better.There is no man braver on the scum of the Universe than Mr. Rakesh Roshan who is the true superhero of Indian Cinema and puts his life on the edge every time he's making a movie not bothering that his bald ass could get sued any moment by Hollywood directors who get his work registered as theirs but he carries on... like a true superhero! Don't be surprised if I tell you that a sequel to Krrish is already on its way to create new grounds for Indian Cinema and take it to new heightsirrespective of what the direction of the heights be... Laymen are stupid people that they choose to prefer Catwoman over Krrish The Indian Kukuboy... coz Krrish is way better and we know it Catwoman never got nominated for Best Film in Filmfare Awards Krrish Will.410 from muviegeek.blogspot.com".

I wanted to wipe the perpetual smile off of his face and the almost infantile portrayal of the super hero was as flat as a day old chappati. The songs and dances will be forgotten as soon as you exit the theatre. And Priyanka Chopra is not someone who lights up the screen with her acting abilities. Nasiruddin Shah was having fun with his over the top villain role and not much else. The dialogue was so bland and cheesy and the stunts were from Matrix 101. That was the biggest disappoint. Hrithik just does not come off as a super hero and more's the pity. If there is a sequel to this please Rakesh Roshan hire a qualified script writer and give a better grip to the story with more shades of grey to the characters. I hope to see Hrithik soon in a better written film. He is a good actor wasted in substandard films. Maybe he should do a couple of films with Ram Gopal Verma to wipe out his goodtwoshoes image.".

	schema:headline " Utterly disappointed despite Hrithik's honest performance.";
	schema:reviewBody "I went to see Krrish wanting the same impact that Koi Mil Gaya had on me. Unfortunately I expected too much. Krrish did not have the heart that Koi Mil Gaya had.Let's talk about the two leads Hrithik and Priyanka. They didn't click in my opinion. I would've much rather seen Preity play a different character and come back in the movie. She and Hrithik really worked in the first film. It was because of them that the first movie really worked. Not to mention that Priya Priyanka Chopra's character wasn't very likable in the latter half of the movie. She came across as very selfish.I also wanted to mention Preity Zinta. I had the impression that she was going to have a role in the film. I knew it wasn't a long role but I expected more than 2 seconds. Which was what we got literally. I even read somewhere that we would be seeing her in a new look with a sari and everything. Nope. Didn't get that.SPOILERS In fact in the end of the movie after finding out Rohit didn't die after all and they all go back to their village Nisha's the only one missing. If Nisha had to die the least the writers could have done was not have Rohit turn up alive. To have those two separated just destroys the memory of the first movie. Such a tragic ending for them.The movie also dragged on! So much! The movie doesn't really pick up until the last 30 minutes. And this is out of a 3 hour movie!!! There were too many things that Roshan tried to incorporate in the movie and overall it just didn't work. The romance came out flat which didn't help since the character of Priyanka wasn't very likable you begin to think why would I want the hero to end up with her?. It's not like the RohitNisha pairing in the first movie. In the first movie I really really wished that Rohit and Nisha would end up together.Also another thing working against this movie is the fact that unless you've been living under a rock you've seen a Hollywood superhero movie in the past decade. As a result you can't help but see all the elements that Krrish ripped off from those movies. From Batman's mask to Neo's trench coat look to Superman's secret identity to Spiderman's powers etc. There's not an ounce of originality to it. This may not have been so bad. After all Koi Mil Gaya wasn't exactly original. We've all heard of the E.T. comments. But what saved that movie was that at the end of it it wasn't about the special effects but it was how much heart the film had. It had it in spades! The music also didn't live up to expectations. Rakesh Roshan unfortunately didn't deliver this time. Except for the number at the circus the rest of the songs just made the film drag even more! There's a saying that the ending can make or break a movie. In my opinion it broke this one. I won't explain but you'll understand if you go see it.As for the good things that didn't outweigh the bad in my opinion Rekha was very good in this movie and if the movie had any heart at all it came from her. The martial arts scenes were the only action scenes that really impressed me. Good work by Hrithik Roshan to make it look so impressive as if he'd been doing it all his life. Other than that the movie showed flashes of brilliance but unfortunately that's all there was. A big disappointment. I should have just waited until it was out for rent.But really my biggest grievance about this movie on top of all its little flaws that added up was that it just ruined the first movie. It discarded the Nisha character so easily she may as well have not existed. I thought that the Roshans tainted the memory of Koi Mil Gaya for the sake of trying to rake in the audience from that movie as well to go and see Krrish. Krrish could have very well worked with some tweaks here and there as a completely separate movie. It was an underhanded marketing scheme.".

Had rakesh roshan Used some CG computer generated Elements.. this movie would have been worth all they Hype it created!Those who have seen the movie must agree with me that when u compare these movies to Lord Of The Rings  The Fellowship Of The Rinf or even a superhero movie like spiderman both made in 2001.. or at least the effectsi Think they could have done a much better job! No doubt Hrithik looks amazing in the movie he would even make a perfect superman given a look at his physique .. But then i wouldn't recommend this movie to Hard Core Cinematics!In the End .. a Good Attempt but not quite marvel as its Hollywood counter parts!P.S .. Hrithik again has acted really well.. if ur a fan of his work.. Definitely go for the movie!but if ur a spidermanxmensuperman fan.. Ahem.. be ready to laugh ur butt off at the weirdfakefunny Action!".

Many people on this site have questioned the accuracy and validity of the film especially mentioning the lack of consideration of the treatment of the Jews.

Maybe it isn't a Schindler's List but it does have its merits.Watch it and you'll find them!BTW  could I just point out many people on here have referred to the Holocaust as though it is interchangeable with the Nazi regime and have used the phrase in their reviews. Just to clear up this the holocaust specifically refers to the gassing of Jews at extermination camps from 1942 onwards essentially the Final Solution.

	schema:reviewBody "The central characters in this movie are unpolitical teenagers who have no concern with the larger political issues of Naziism and simply want to enjoy themselves. Their only perspective is that Nazis are stuffy conformist jerks and no fun at all. For this reason a number of mainstream critics among them Ebert and Berardinelli trashed the picture for trivializing the crimes and horrors of the Third Reich. These critics I think miss the point.The value of the movie is precisely that it is trivial. There is no hindsight. The audience like the characters is caught up in the everydayness of everyday life in a totalitarian state. The Nazis are the government and as far as anyone can see in 193839 they are going to go on being the government forever. The war hasn't happened yet. The Swastika flag flying over every post office and courthouse doesn't give them a little shudder of horror it's as normal as the Stars and Stripes is to us. All sensible respectable people who aren't Nazis themselves go along with the Nazis because they have no reason not to.Auschwitz hasn't happened yet either. Sure there are concentration camps out there somewhere but that has nothing to do with normal ordinary people who behave themselves. Unless you happen to know a Jew or a political dissident yourself what the government is doing to people like that isn't your problem. The teenaged lead characters find themselves in opposition and in trouble not because they have any principled objections to the government but simply because they find respectable culture boring and want to amuse themselves. The first reaction of authority in the person of Kenneth Branagh's kindly Gestapo man is that all they need is a good talking to a second chance and a little constructive guidance in the Hitler Youth and they'll grow up to be good citizens. He's fifty percent right Thomas does respond positively to the comradeship and healthy outdoor activity he finds there.The ultimate choices made by the two boys are governed not by principle but by their personal situations. Thomas has been rebelling against his cold pompous wealthy father whom he loathes and he ultimately decides that being a dutiful Nazi and denouncing the old man to the Gestapo offers him much better revenge than dancing to illegal jazz records. Peter recoils from the Hitler Youth and from his former friend because his own father had disappeared perhaps into the camps after the Nazis took power several years earlier.There's's no hindsight in the movie's perspective and no heroism. Instead it gives us ordinary everyday people dealing with ordinary everyday life as they find it from the viewpoint of a high school student. The movie leads the adolescents who are its target audience to ask themselves an unpleasant question  would they be any different any more politically aware if they were in the same situation? Indeed would they even realize it if they were actually in the same situation now? The implicit answer is that they probably wouldn't be all that different from ordinary nonpolitical German teenagers in 1938 minding their own business going about their own lives and at most trying to carve a little more personal space than the government wants to give them. That's disconcerting and not at all flattering which is why Swing Kids is worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really don't understand a lot of these reviewers. The movie far from trivializes anything about the Nazis it simply tries to portray a moment before the bloodiest war in history on a smallish scale.Would it be better to just have a movie that says Nazis are bad and they killed six million Jews.? No because that wouldn't be a movie.It's like when people complained that a miniseries about Hitler's life that was supposed to be shown on TV would humanize Hitler. Well news flash he WAS a human. That's the worst part a human could do that sort of thing. What good is it to call evildoers monsters and then leave it at that? When Swing Kids succeeds is when it's portraying the conflicts of youth as their country goes mad. Can anyone honestly say they feel NO sympathy for those who were forced to join the Hitler youth? It's easy to say you would have done different.And the idea that the music being key somehow trivializes the events of WWII um it's based on an ACTUAL subculture swing kids. There were lots of them and at first they were fairly lacking in politics but later in the 40s when they were cracked down on more so by the Nazis some were more active.It's not like the movie makers pulled the concept of kids Nazis and swing out of their asses which is what people seem to think.And at least it was something at least it wasn't giving in totally. Remember these were young kids highschool age nobody can expect them all to be Sophie Scholl.Where Swing Kids lacks is its occasional excessive heavyhandedness. The ending is a bit excessive something more subtle would have been better.But as I say the conflicts between the three main leads are fantastic and bring up questions of what you would do in such circumstances. I think the boys's indifference in respect to the Jew being beat up in the beginning of the movie is a good touch. This is NOT about the holocaust because it was just starting and was largely unknown at the time. I hate when people can't lose what they know to watch a movie.I recommend everyone to read some swing kids history just look them up it makes the movie much better and more interesting to know the facts.This is a fairly good movie with very good acting great great music and costumes a great story that was influenced by deeply interesting history and too much heavy handedness.But seriously who can resist a movie put out by Disney that includes the line of dialog You're turning into a fcking Nazi!?".

	schema:reviewBody "Anyone who has stepped on to the dance floor with a live swing band playing knows just how well Swing Kids captures the electricity of a night of swing. Anyone who has strapped on their best duds an hour earlier knows knows the romance and anticipation captured perfectly as Peter Muller Robert Sean Leonard dresses for his last night of swing. This movie was in no small measure part of the impetus for the swing revival in the mid 90's and I personally get in the mood for a night of cuttin' rug with Janis Siegel's incredible rendition of Bei Mir Bist Du Schon from the film. But what makes this film truly superlative is its honest dealings with ordinary Germans' motivations for complacency towards or participation in Nazism. In Nazi Germany it was in everybody's best interest save the Jews to play along. From Peter's mother who just wants her to children live happily and avoid the terrible fate of their father to Thomas Berger Christian Bale who finds acceptance and encouragement for the first time they do so for the reasons that would tempt each of us sorely. The horrible truth of the Holocaust is that like the Germans very few of us possess the selflessness and moral courage it would have required to oppose the evil tide of Nazism. Swing Kids is almost alone in its portrayal of this chilling truth among Holocaust and World War II films. Robert Sean Leonard's portrayal of this moral struggle for understanding and courage is very moving. Of course there's noone better at playing angstridden. c.f. Dead Poet's Society. As he dances his last dance with the weight of the world on his shoulders the world spinning around him he finds a rare kind of release that is perhaps found only on the dance floor. And yes his brother's cries Swing Heil! Swing Heil! in the final scene give me a lump in the throat every time. For all these reasons and more Swing Kids is an excellent film.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the basic reasons I like this movie is because it was one of the first movies I watched with my older brother that we both enjoyed. I don't have a lot in common with him but this one movie opened up lots of opportunities for other movies.Other than that I love this movie for its unique point of view. We always get the movies like Saving Private Ryan or Pearl Harbor which are very important stories in themselves and good movies of course but how often do we get a movie about people who were part of the war from the beginning. people that didn't necessarily have a direct threat but were still greatly affected. The story of Peter and Thomas and Arvid are wonderfully done. Peter is the kind of person any girl would like. Thomas the rich brat that speaks his mind too much helps put internal conflict in the group. Arvid seems to be the voice of reason seeing what the Nazis are doing and doesn't want to be a part of it.The acting is great of course. Peter played by Robert Sean Leonard is portrayed as soft spoken confused and even a little bitter. Thomas played by the beautiful Christian Bale is the kind of people that drive me nuts  just go along with it. We can have it both ways. It is virtually impossible to have it both ways. The guy who plays Arvid is a lovely actor obviously talented and shows emotion so well you'd think he went through this himself. The history of the movie might be a little tweaked to make a few interesting scenes but to see what the Nazis were doing to the youth of their country brainwashing them and telling them to spy on people is appalling. No wonder a few former Nazi soldiers still think they were right.The music is like a whole nother character. This movie is what really got me to enjoy listening to swing music. Even though I can do very few steps I realize now the feeling they got when they heard it and I get the same feeling just not quite as strong probably.All around this movie is wonderful. I love showing it to my friends and it is very interesting and jerks at your emotions.".

We all read or hear about what the Nazis did to the Jews  other minorities and think that the Germans must have been horrible people to have even gone along with this. But this shows how the propaganda they were constantly fedas well as the activities  sense of belonging the HJ Hitler Jungen experiencedcould slowly twist their minds to the Nazi way of thinking. One of the excellent things about this movie is how it shows how the main characters change. The changes in Peter  Thomas come very slow and natural and only when you get to the end and maybe rewatch it do you realize how drastically they have changed their views. Thomas especiallyThere were some notsogreat things about the movie like some characters or scenes which when you think back seem to have been included for an unknown reason. But the good points of the movie outweigh the minor nitpicks. The swing music and dancing in the movie was awesome and I thought all the characters were acted very well by the actors.

Their relationships and the outcomes are the study of this film which is both uneven and ultimately very powerful.Roger Ebert detested this film for the fact that to him is unclear in it's message.

So how do they rebell? Through the music that they cherish.Along the way two of the boys Leonard and Bale are forced to join the Gestapo. Leonard doesn't embrace the teachings but Bale is slowly brainwashed into conforming. Whaley is a cripple and he therefore observes the Nazis from a different position. He soon begins to despise his two friends for their uniforms. While his character might be an arrogant jerk it is clear that he's got a better idea about the evil that's going on than anyone else. Bartok is just sort of along for the ride just wanting to hang out with his friends and play in his music...oblivious to what happens with the Jews or Nazis.So here we have four chief characters that pretty much represent probably the most basic attitudes of German citizens during the war Brainwashed aware torn in between and indifferent.

The message at the end is very clear and VERY powerful....I am often reminded of its subtle excellence though I haven't seen it in a good while.Unfortunately the film itself is uneven. Almost too much time is spent on the swing music itself. So much that it takes away from the message of the film.

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING THIS COMMENT CONTAINS SPOILERS CLEARLY MARKED IN THE TEXT.I can honestly say that no movie has ever moved me in the same way that this one has. We watched it in history class and at the beginning my friends and I who didn't know what swing kids were thought that the title sounded somewhat jazzy and lighthearted.How wrong we were. As the movie changed from the story of three teenage friends to the story of the choices every person in the nation had to make we were all utterly captivated. True I go to an allgirls school and so the presence of Christian Bale probably didn't hurt our liking of the movie. But it wasn't just that.The story set in the late 1930's is about the Swing Kids movement in the youth at the time that Hitler was gaining power and Germany was becoming more and more fascist. Fascism was all about conformity being the same everyone else and putting the state in front of yourself. Swing dancing was and still is clearly about being an individual and as a result the swing clubs were slowly being banned. The swing kids remained defiant even making up their own mockery of the Nazi salute Swing Heil! SPOILER ALERT Each progressive scene at the Cafe Bismarck gets worse. The first shows a happy evening the second a close call the third the official closing of the club and the last is the end of the movie.SPOILER ENDED The movie focuses on three teenage guys Peter Thomas and Arvid. As the movie progresses it's clear that the three are all searching for something. Thomas who has a cold relationship with his father is looking for acceptance. Peter whose father mysteriously disappeared returned home and died is looking for answers. And Arvid a cripple who plays the guitar is looking for a way out of a society that is beginning to sicken him.The rest of the movie is about the choices that each one makes as the fascist society progresses around them and forces them to decide what stance they want to take.SPOILER ALERT When Peter attempts to steal a radio for his friend Arvid he is given an unofficial ultimatumjoin the HJ Hitler Youth or your mother and younger brother will be in danger. When Peter joins Thomas joins too saying that he did it because of his friendship with Peter and says that they can be HJ by day and swing kids by night.SPOILER ENDED Throughout the movie it is clear that the three friends are drawing apart and in the end each makes a different choice finding in that choice what they were looking for in the beginning.The entire movie while maybe not entirely historically accurate is still an amazing film. The swing music played in it is not just an element of the background it sends its own message. The acting is mostly flawlessmy only minor point is that Emil the HJ leader is not very convincing. But what makes the movie really work is the powerful emotions drawn out of the viewerhappiness despair horror hope betrayal. It's the only movie that has ever made me cry.As my history teacher said In many ways the movie is somewhat cushioned. It only shows a small part of the time period and in some ways isn't incredibly historically accurate. But it's incredibly personal and that's what gets you. An excellent movie 10 out of 10. Words simply fail me.".

	schema:reviewBody "I do love swing music and love the music and artists from the era. So did my parents who were contemporary with it. But they had the good fortune to love it in the USA. It was a dangerous thing to like Benny Goodman Count Basie Duke Ellington and most of all Arthur Shawronsky who the authorities did know was Artie Shaw. But these squares were the Gestapo and Swing Kids is about the youth who loved American swing music at considerable cost.Robert Sean Leonard Christian Bale Frank Whaley are three friends who are into American swing at a time in their country when such jungle music was Verboten. Swing Kids is the story about how all three were dealing with the growing strangulation of culture. One of the opening scenes takes place at a forbidden swing club where the kids are cutting a rug to Benny Goodman when word comes the authorities are near. Without a beat the band turns into a typical German Oompah band the kind of music Herr Schicklgruber deemed acceptable to German youth.Which was being swallowed up by the Hitler Youth and the social pressures to join are enormous. Something that we in this country cannot fathom. I'm not a big fan of the current Pope but about the only thing I'll give Benedict XVI a pass on was joining the Hitler Youth. At a certain point the wiggle room got less and less. Barbara Hershey as Leonard's mother gives a good performance as a woman keeping company with a Gestapo official for a little more comfort. Her husband and Leonard and David Tom's father had been arrested by the Gestapo a few years back and died as a result of their custody. The Gestapo official is played by an unbilled Kenneth Branagh who took no billing for his part deliberately.Swing Kids has a timely lesson for today if some in federal authority will care to learn it. The fundamentalist Moslems just as the Nazis hate our decadent culture. The answer is keep importing it into places like Iran by the cargo ship load. Don't bomb them to death just send them our music and films.By the way our own fundamentalist Christians hated that music as they hate the music of today. Something about authoritarianism of whatever stripe just hates contemporary culture whatever it is at the time.Swing Kids is a valuable lesson about freedom of expression wrapped up in a good entertaining package.".

Throughout the movie you could see the consciences of the main characters being pushed and pulled about what was happening. Over here in Western culture everything is portrayed in black and white  all the Germans were completely evil and we were the good ones. No one is denying that the Germans committed some horrific atrocities but there were some who resisted doing those crimes and others who actually believed that they were morally in the right because of centuries of ingrained antisemitism. Geez North America was antisemitic then too! Swing Kids looks at Germany from the inside and the different forces that were at work. Everyone knows what happened during the Holocaust....this movie wasn't about that.

	schema:headline " A Subset of a Much Bigger Subject That Made a Good Story";
	schema:reviewBody "Swing Kids underperformed at the box office received bad reviews but today maintains a cult following. Reading the reviews from the film's 1993 release critics seemed to be ticked off mostly by the fact that the film depicted a seemingly trivial demographic in a horrific time and place. Their argument was understandable if such mass genocide and political corruption was taking place why would we want to know about German teenagers who were obsessed with American swing music? My question is why would we NOT want to know about them?Had Swing Kids been released some time after Steven Spielberg's epic Schindler's List critics may not have been quick to bring up that point. However Cabaret 1972 was also about Berlin counterculture amidst the rise of the Nazi party and no one seemed to have a problem with that film.Swing Kids is by no means a perfect film but it also shouldn't be dismissed specifically because it doesn't take place in a concentration camp and no one can be seen being tortured or killed. It's a small footnote but by no means an uninteresting story.The movie centers around Peter Muller Robert Sean Leonard who I couldn't help but think bore a striking resemblance to Jim Carrey in this movie a German student barely out of his teens who along with his friends Thomas Christian Bale and Arvid Frank Whaley love to stay out late and dance to big band swing music. They wear their hair long own zoot suits and are rebellious against the Nazis at first for rebellion's sake. They don't seem to be phased by the Nazi's propaganda against the Jews and other ethnicities until later in the film although that point is not clarified well in the beginning.Peter reluctantly joins the Nazis when his mother's significant other Herr Major Knopp Kenneth Branagh pulls some strings after Peter's arrest involving a stolen radio. His other option is to be sent to jail or perhaps even a concentration camp. Thomas enlists as well just to join Peter but they ultimately don't give up their night life of Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller. However the more Peter learns about the Nazis the more he hates them. Thomas on the other hand falls into the Nazi propaganda over time.The overall story is told pretty well here. Robert Sean Leonard is good as the moral compass of the story. Nowadays I'm used to seeing Christian Bale in either villainous roles American Psycho 2000 The Prestige 2006 or as heroes with a noticeable dark side The Dark Knight 2008 Terminator Salvation 2009. However here Bale plays a guy who is a genuinely good friend at first and his good acting made me forget about his later roles. At the same time when his character becomes entrenched in the Nazi life Bale somehow made this dramatic transition smoothly without seeming contrived.Frank Whaley is also effective as the crippled friend Arvid who can't join the Nazi army even if he wanted to because of his condition. Arvid plays jazz guitar and knows a lot about American jazz. He is frequently bullied and beaten by Nazi soldiers his age but still has energy to rebel. Whereas Leonard is the moral compass here Whaley is the heart. I can't give away what happens to Arvid in this movie but you really do feel for him as the movie progresses.Swing Kids has a very good story and characters good and bad that you really care about. Among the major weaknesses in this movie is the fact that it takes place entirely in Germany yet none of the characters actually speak German. Normally that fact would not be a problem but my issue was that the good guys here spoke with either American or British accents whereas the villains such as Branaugh spoke with a heavy German accent. It's as if Hollywood hasn't gotten over the idea that German or Russian accents sound evil even long after World War II and the Cold War ended. In this story it goes without saying that accents shouldn't matter.This is why I think the movie would have worked better as a foreign film made by Germans rather than an American film made by the Disney company. If everyone was speaking German allegedly evil accents wouldn't be an issue. On the other hand Cabaret had good guys in it that had German accents. Why couldn't this film?Also perhaps I'm asking too much here but the written epilogue at the end wasn't enough for me. Of course as I mentioned earlier not every film that takes place during World War II has to be dark and depressing but it would have been nice to have received a glimpse of what these swing kids went through in concentration camps how they coped and whether they got out alive or not. Maybe such a broad subject could still be the basis for another movie but just two written sentences before the credits broke the Golden Rule of Storytelling Show Don't Tell.This film would have benefited from being shelved for at least a year and perhaps being released a little while after Schindler's List made its run. Compared to concentration camps young men in Germany who loved American music seems insignificant in comparison but by no means does it discredit the alternative history lesson from being told. Critics could have been more openminded to the movie but the good thing is that the film now has a cult following. It still nags me that the film wasn't in German though. At least it has historical accuracy on its side.".

Most importantly not letting anyone tell you not to dance and listen to the music you like. i recommend this movie!!!".

As well intentioned as it might have been showing a different aspect of conditions in Nazi Germany this production lacked so much as a wisp of authenticity. Acting was unconvincing especially by the usually reliable Barbara Hershey and the nolips Kenneth Branagh. It didn't help that some actors tried to adopt a German accent while others didn't bother to stray from San Fernando Valley English. The subject matter should generate empathy rather than stifled giggles but blame that on the script and direction. This movie does not belong in the same category as films such as The Pawnbroker The Diary of Anne Frank The Shop on Main Street Schindler's List Sophie's Choice which cover a wide swath of proximate territory with far more verisimilitude and profundity.".

Rival school plots were not overused yet so the storyline seemed fresh. Every great kung fu film had wonderful dastardly villains you wanted to see get their comeuppance and FFoD had them too. The star Lieh Lo was a known actor in Chinese theaters. The mostly Chinese audience enjoyed this film immensely. The audience buzz while leaving this film gives the final satisfaction to me.On Times Square this film was an action comedy...probably unintentionally. I enjoyed it here too but for different reasons. The crowd was ethnic and quite energetic. From the start the movie made you laugh. As soon as the audience heard those strange British accents come from those Chinese actors the movie turned into a violent and gory cartoon. Most American audiences saw this kind of gore in a horror film not in an action film. The action sequences blew the audience away. Unfortunately the movie studios saw that they enjoyed it so much that bad dubbing and unnecessary violence became a kung fu flick formula.I had fun seeing this movie with an American audience but enjoyed it much more in Chinatown. Some films can pass the test of time but the dubbed version of FFoD can't. The original King Boxer is still enjoyable...a CLASSIC!".

Most American audiences saw this kind of gore in a horror film not in an action film. The action sequences blew the audience away. Unfortunately the movie studios saw that they enjoyed it so much that bad dubbing and unnecessary violence became a kung fu flick formula.I had fun seeing this movie with an American audience but enjoyed it much more in Chinatown. Some films can pass the test of time but the dubbed version of FFoD can't. The original King Boxer is still enjoyable...a CLASSIC!";

The Spanish guitar background music the competing schools the impossibly high leaps onto the edges of rooftops catching thrown spears cheating in tournaments the secret training for an exotic karate technique themes of patience and perseverance and more were copied by many later films such as The Karate Kid 1984 Hero 2002 Kill Bill Volume 2 2004 and Kung Fu Hustle 2004.I feel lucky to have first seen this film in 1972 shortly after it was released just before kung fu films became mainstream and before Bruce Lee became a household name. I saw it with two buddies of mine in a downtown San Diego theater frequented by sailors and although the scenes of the glowing red hands and gouged eyeballs got some laughs clearly the audience was getting into it as was our little group. It was a very memorable movie for me. Decades later I could still recall several specific scenes even after I had forgotten the film title. This film is extra special to me now because one of those two buddies with whom I first saw it sailor Kenneth Lee Hines of the Kitty Hawk has since passed away so this film serves as a memento of that day together before we took judo and karate lessons in subsequent years.Relative to kung fu films I'd rate this film as 1010. But since I have to keep the larger film audience in mind I'll more objectively rate it as 810 due to obvious technical flaws. I just recommend that neophyte viewers consider those technical flaws to be proof of its vintage nature and of its authenticity and then merrily proceed to enjoy its testosteronecharged mayhem.".

	schema:reviewBody "The martial arts movies got huge in the 60's in parts of Asia but with the growing popularity of the infamous Shaw Brothers films America was bound to catch on. This movie was the first to be presented in America under the Warner Bros. label and it did in fact start a craze here that flooded the 70's with martial arts films. Many of the films to follow would pale in comparison but some were great and many like Enter The Dragon which came out shortly after this one became huge success stories and made superstars out of these fighters.Fast forward almost 40 years later and this movie still holds up. Most Shaw brothers films are as good today as they were back then and truth be told no films have been made in this genre to compete with those made by The Shaw Bros back in the day.I like to think Martial arts are like porn and nobody watches porn for the plot just the action well same goes with M.A. films and most of them are just a bunch of great fights with little story this one is an exception. It doesn't have an amazing story but there is one there.The main guy played by Lo Lieh actually stands out amongst karate film heroes. He never brags and he never fights just because he can he is often seen as weak and less of a fighter than most but when he must fight he is damn well the greatest alive. I really loved this character. Many of the bad guys were memorable and the fight scenes were just presented so amazingly. Even a small role with Bolo Yeung can be seen as the huge Mongolian and Bolo is in my top 5 as greatest martial artist film stars ever he was also in the above mentioned Enter The Dragon.The production as I've said over and over is wonderful you can't beat the Shaws the direction was something unlike I have seen much in films of the 70's the use of color was well placed and made this movie stand alone and rise above the others. When the light shines on Chi Hao's hands as he does the Iron Fist its pure beauty.The music was superb as well. Martial arts films were to Asia what westerns were to Italy two separate art forms with so much in common. The countries making these films had all genres but the Japanese films were what was making waves there as the spaghetti westerns were in Italy. With their many differences the styles of these two genres were neck and neck. As seen in movies like 5 Fingers Of Death the fights were easily compared to Sergia Leoni cowboy stand offs and the music tied the genres together so well. The music here borrowed a little from Ironside but it was still very original.Many films were inspired by this one and when I watch it I can see everything from The Master Killer to Bloodsport having been influenced. The most obvious movie to have been influenced was Kill Bill which to me is the greatest of all time. Many of the sets Quentin used are complete replicas of ones seen here and he used the music from this film even though the music he used was the music borrowed from Ironside. And the fight scene at the end of Kill Bill vol. 1 with The Bride and ORen is at times exact in comparison to the fight with Chi Hao and the Japanese thug at the end of this movie.I have seen many martial arts films a few even better but this is a MUSTSEE for fans of the genre. You can't go wrong here. The movie starts off slow but 1520 minutes into it it picks up and doesn't slow down.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hong Kong filmmaker Chang Chang Ho's 1972 martial arts movie epic Five Fingers of Death is widely considered by a great many film experts and kungfu movie fanatics to be the martial arts movie that started it all.Being released in 1972 it was phasetwo of the threestep process that would lead to the explosion of martial arts movies in the West  Billy Jack 1971 with its famous Hapkido showdown in the park was released the year before and Bruce Lee starred in Enter the Dragon 1973 two years later thereby solidifying martial arts movies' place in Western cinema.But what is all the hoopla about regarding Five Fingers of Death? The movie with its terrible dubbing explosive if not highly improbable action sequences and technical flaws and all has a plot albeit a very thin one. ChihHao the late Lo Lieh is a young and dedicated student of Chinese gongfu who is selected to represent his school in an upcoming martial arts tournament. His teacher offers to allow him to selftrain in the Iron Fist style of fighting a style so deadly that it could very easily kill a man with only one blow.Additionally ChihHao's arrival at the school coincides with a violent conflict with a rival school its students and a trio of murderous heavy hitters from Japan. Before you know it a major setback threatens ChihHao's training and his ability to represent his beloved school in the upcoming tournament.Let me just say that Five Fingers of Death is in fact the movie that started it all. As another viewer mentioned Five Fingers of Death helped to set a lot of standards in martial arts movies over the next three decades  Asian European and North American martial arts movies. Such standards include the dedicated student the learning of patience and endurance conflicts between rival schools the intense ethnic animosity between the Chinese and Japanese and learning a system of fighting for that good oldfashioned action movie motive revenge. Five Fingers of Death would also serve as a major influence on American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill movies Tarantino borrows quite liberally from this project among many others just so you know.The acting is pretty good considering the fact that this is a martial arts movie from the early 1970s the best of which is Lo Lieh. As the atypical student of the martial arts his performance is quite groundbreaking though upon first glance at this movie you wouldn't really know it because of how that particular character arc has been done to death so many times over the years. He's quite humble in his acting doing anything he can to persevere over his enemies and not fight them in anger or stoop to their level of stupidity or arrogance. Also when he suffers his major setback it does make your heart sink a little bit because it's so brutal and you wonder if he's going to recover enough to realize his lifelong ambition.Five Fingers of Death is a classic in every sense. It's by no means perfect and viewers would be crazy to expect something on the caliber of the Godfather of martial arts movies. What it does offer you is the ultimate example of Eastern handtohand combat from the time before Eastern cinema was a major fixture in the West.710P.S. Enter the Dragon Bolo Yeung also appears as the Mongolian street fighter near the beginning of the film.".

It has a very authentic flavour seasoned by an eerie music score of tradition chinese instruments I think and some wonderfully overacted melodramatic moments contrasted by heavily affected comedy. Indeed while attempting to create their own Western i.e. Cowboy film genre the Chinese concocted a whole new animal marked by kung fu fighting and its associated sound effects.The story of Five Fingers of death is simple a story of revenge for killing a loved one and the pursuit of the main character to master the ironfisttechnique that will enable him to wreak holy vengeance on his enemies.  There is even a love interest though the awkward polite kind found in most Chinese films of the period.  The end result however is great and much more authentic than any Bruce Lee movie.".

Although this made no impression on the American critics at the time who universally trashed the picture it wasn't lost on American audiences especially among African Americans whose culture had always been  by necessity  an eclectic patchwork of borrowed elements and innovation. In 'Five Fingers' they were given the opportunity to discover the core of the story in the earnest young man forced to make the extra effort to overcome social barriers and betrayal in order to have his merit recognized. This seems to be an issue universal to Modernity but each culture has its own way of expressing and resolving it 'Five Fingers' presented it in a way many Americans could relate to as well as Chinese.So is the film now only of historical value? Certainly not. For one thing this issue hasn't gone away. Secondly some of the innovations leave much of the film looking as fresh today as it did on first release. Also the action is wellstaged and the performances though a little too earnest are crisp. The film is a might overlong but the story does cover a lot of ground. And there are marvelous setpieces throughout such as the saloon confrontation the fight on the road to the contest the odd double finale.definitely looks better on a theater screen but still impressive for home viewing recommended.".

The characters are well rounded and have real depth to them as the motivations for their actions and personality are revealed in a much greater detail than most kung fu films. There is some really great camerawork in the film with my favorite shot starting as a close up on our hero's face showing his reaction then pulls back quickly to reveal the scene before him that is the cause of his look.

There are rival schools of course which are hoping to have their champion win the regional martial arts competition and there are a bunch of evil Masters and students who aren't above using dirty tricks to kill their rivals including ChihHao.... The fun thing with this film is that it's quite straightforward with little of the crazy supernatural tweaks that some films in this genre include and there are of course staged fights every 2 or 3 minutes so exposition and character development etc. never get in the way of a good choreographed scene.

Naturally he won't achieve this without first being subjected to various experiences. These include having his hands tied to a tree and having them beaten black and blue. There is the usual rivalry between various schools and this paves the way for some exciting fight sequences including those involving about two dozen or more martial artists. There is a very good scene involving a martial arts tournament. It is probably better to watch the Cantonese version but the English dubbed one is quite good. A minor masterpiece to be sure!".

There is a very good scene involving a martial arts tournament. It is probably better to watch the Cantonese version but the English dubbed one is quite good. A minor masterpiece to be sure!";

Wang Yu was also by no means a kung fu expert. he had some limited training in karate but his film was basically an experiment by the Shaw brothers to see if films other than colorful Swordplay epics direct copies of Japanese Cinema could make a buck. truth be told Lo Lieh also had little in the way of Kung Fu training he simply had more experience in martial arts films and a more creative choreographer and director in charge by the time he shot King Boxer. The appellation of first kung fu film should be amended in that it was the considered as first successful kung fu film of the world wide kung fu boom of the 70's.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been browsing through a few Shaw Brothers films from the 70's of late and decided it was time to watch the one that is credited with bringing these films to the American attention. King Boxer as the version I saw was called sees promising young student ChiHao sent away to train under a new master in order that he may be able to win a martial arts tournament and thus prevent the local thugs from getting the power and prestige that would come were they to win it. Within this very basic frame there are lots of characters coming and going and lots of complications. While I wanted to like this aspect for doing more than the norm the truth was that the film gives too much time to too many characters and tries to do too much with them in terms of their actions and changes of heart within the main plot.The impact this has is to make the film longer and slower than it can bare which is a real shame because when it has pace it moves well. It could easily have lost 1 or maybe 2 characters to make the plot a bit leaner and lose 20 minutes or more from the running time and it would have been a better film for it. It doesn't help that the performances often err on the side of being too earnest and come over a little stiff. I liked Lo Lieh as a presence but he was guilty of this. By contrast I liked the minor turn by Shen Chan as he was smirking in his villainy. The rest of the cast tend to be a bit too sluggish and earnest which is a shame but doesn't extend to the action. On this front the film has a lot to recommend and the action looks and moves well. I would have liked a bit more of an impacting final few fights but it was good stuff even if the longer running time tended to rob the film of energy between fights.Another good Shaw Brothers film then but it runs too long and is given too heavy a tone and as a result the film feels a bit too sluggish for its own good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Louis Malle made a total of four films with Jeanne Moreau that couldn't be more different. He established critical acclaim for both of them with Lift to the Scaffold then a ban for the amorous Les Amants. A dark meditation came five years later with The Fire Within followed almost immediately by this highly commercial enjoyable lightweight romp.Viva Maria! is a joyous celebration of female bonding across early twentieth century Mexico as the two Marias  played by Jeanne Moreau and Bridget Bardot  right wrongs take their fill of life and love lead a revolution blow things up invent striptease and help men to shoot round corners.We meet the first Maria while she is still a child. Before the opening credits have finished she has gaily helped Dad blow up the English many times. Ireland 1891. London 1894. Gibraltar 1901. Finally in Central America she has to blow up Dad while the baddies are still shooting him on the bridge. Undeterred she continues alone now a young woman in the form of tomboy Bridget Bardot catching a train on the run as we catch the last of the opening titles. It was a hectic race. As she finally sits down on the tail of the train we enjoy her sigh of exertion and relief.Before long Bardot Maria has teamed up with travelling singer Moreau Maria  who she holds at knifepoint before becoming bosom buddies. The next visual gasp comes as Bardot takes off her cap  a moment Malle milks for all it is worth. Somehow concealed under the boyish hat long golden locks fall down. Bardot sheds her androgynous Calamity Jane look for fullon pout and the camera lingers knowingly. This pistoltotin' gal will bed whoever takes her fancy and chalk their names up on the inside wall of the wagon. It is the classic Bardot imagery  that inspired both 'bardoltrie' and comments of noted feminist Simone de Beauvoir defending her as a manifestation of a new artificefree type of femininity as much a hunter as she is a prey.During the tours of the musical theatre circus the pair perform a number where an accidentally ripped dress leads them to accidentally invent striptease. Although they only bare down to their knickerbockers the show is a smash hit considerably raising the troupe's profile and income.By this point silly but hilariously executed gags have become wellentrenched. Men pay to see the show with chickens if they have no money. English colonials speak with frightfully proper accents and discuss tea. The two girls join the revolution after Bardot who has a common sense objection to injustice takes a pot shot at a local bad guy chief.

	onyx:emotionText "Louis Malle made a total of four films with Jeanne Moreau that couldn't be more different. He established critical acclaim for both of them with Lift to the Scaffold then a ban for the amorous Les Amants. A dark meditation came five years later with The Fire Within followed almost immediately by this highly commercial enjoyable lightweight romp.Viva Maria! is a joyous celebration of female bonding across early twentieth century Mexico as the two Marias  played by Jeanne Moreau and Bridget Bardot  right wrongs take their fill of life and love lead a revolution blow things up invent striptease and help men to shoot round corners.We meet the first Maria while she is still a child. Before the opening credits have finished she has gaily helped Dad blow up the English many times. Ireland 1891. London 1894. Gibraltar 1901. Finally in Central America she has to blow up Dad while the baddies are still shooting him on the bridge. Undeterred she continues alone now a young woman in the form of tomboy Bridget Bardot catching a train on the run as we catch the last of the opening titles. It was a hectic race. As she finally sits down on the tail of the train we enjoy her sigh of exertion and relief.Before long Bardot Maria has teamed up with travelling singer Moreau Maria  who she holds at knifepoint before becoming bosom buddies. The next visual gasp comes as Bardot takes off her cap  a moment Malle milks for all it is worth. Somehow concealed under the boyish hat long golden locks fall down. Bardot sheds her androgynous Calamity Jane look for fullon pout and the camera lingers knowingly. This pistoltotin' gal will bed whoever takes her fancy and chalk their names up on the inside wall of the wagon. It is the classic Bardot imagery  that inspired both 'bardoltrie' and comments of noted feminist Simone de Beauvoir defending her as a manifestation of a new artificefree type of femininity as much a hunter as she is a prey.During the tours of the musical theatre circus the pair perform a number where an accidentally ripped dress leads them to accidentally invent striptease. Although they only bare down to their knickerbockers the show is a smash hit considerably raising the troupe's profile and income.By this point silly but hilariously executed gags have become wellentrenched. Men pay to see the show with chickens if they have no money. English colonials speak with frightfully proper accents and discuss tea. The two girls join the revolution after Bardot who has a common sense objection to injustice takes a pot shot at a local bad guy chief. St Miguel is owned by four families  details are hazy  presumably the English stay in the background drinking tea and the Catholic Church stays with whoever's winning. The Marias are being worshipped by the populace due to another hilarious accident and put to the Rack  the Catholic Inquisition having apparently stayed over a few centuries in Mexico rather than returning to Spain.

	schema:headline " What that Revolution really needed were two good female revolutionaries";
	schema:reviewBody "This was an amusing film which was the first movie that I saw starring either Bridget Bardot or Jeanne Moreau. I actually saw it on a double bill back in 1965. It is of interest because it brings up a matter that American films about Mexico's Revolution or that of the other Latin American Countries rarely touch upon. This is the position of the Roman Catholic Church in these matters.The only time the issue of the Church and the Revolutionaries came up in American films was in the John Ford  Henry Fonda movie The Fugitive. That based on Graham Greene's novel The Power And The Glorydealt with the antiClericalism of the PRI regimes that ruled the country after 1920. In it Fonda is a fugitive priest who is trying to continue his religious role despite the anticlericalism of the regime. Greene and Ford were good Catholics and stressed the negative actions of the revolutionary regime in Mexico similar to the antireligious viewpoint of the Communist regime in Russia. But the view barely notes why the antiClericalism developed.One of the largest land owning groups in Mexico and in most of Latin America's countries was the Church. And due to the holdings the Church tended to be rather conservative politically. In the 19th Century the greatest figure of reform in Mexico was Benito Juarez who was from a poor native Indian background. But most of his career was in trying to strengthen Mexican democratic government and to drive the French invasion that briefly set up Archduke Maximillian of Austria as Emperor. But after the French were driven out Juarez spent the remainder of his years in office 1867  1872 trying to get through some kind of fair land reform. This did not sit well with the Church. It supported the regime of his successor Porfirio Diaz who was opposed to land reform  he invited foreign investors many Americans into Mexico. Diaz's policies were good in giving Mexico a stable economy and political peace for three decades the longest growth period until the later 20th Century.The key character to watch in Viva Maria is Francisco Regueira who plays the sinister Father Superior. It is he who is constantly in communication with the dictator the landowner and their minions. The role as is the film is played for laughs but it is his behavior conspiring against the two Marias and their friends which is telling.The plot is interesting in bringing in the universality of revolution. Bardot is shown growing up the daughter of an Irish revolutionary constantly destroying British forts and other sites with his daughter assisting. When she joins forces with Moreau the latter's sister has committed suicide so that she needs Bardot to replace the sister. It is a circus group but Bardot and Moreau do a singing and striptease act. They are brought into the Mexican Revolution by the brutality of the local landowner who rules like he has a minikingdom.The film was pure escapism the circus group's resident marksman finds one of his special rifles is badly bent after an explosion  he doesn't throw it out but attaches a mirror to the barrel and uses the bent gun to shoot people around the corner. George Hamilton plays a local Zapata type hero who is wounded and in hiding. When Bardot speaks in his honor the members of the circus group listen to her words comments critically on her use of language and on his theatricality  as though she is acting on stage.It is not a major film even for director Louis Malle don't compare it with Atlantic City for example. But as an enjoyable romp it's worth watching.".

You want a sexy musical romantic comedy here it is you want a slapstidk spoof here it is you want an actionfilled spaghetti western you got it. It is probably closest altogether in tone to Cat Ballou. Altogether its an inventive sexy farce that captures the light and cheerfulness of the mid 1960's.Louis Malle seems to be channeling Richard Lester the movie was made around the time of Help and A Hard Day's Night throwing gags right and left. He has the good sense to keep the camera on both Jeanne Moreau and Bridget Bardot for long stretches. Unfortunately there is little chemistry between them but they are both so sexy the viewer isn't sure who to focus on. The viewers' eyes dart from Bardot on the left to Moreau on the right and back again.If one sees it as a competition between Bardot and Moreau I would have to say that Bardot wins hands down. She seems to genuinely to love her role while Moreau seems a little nervous about having to compete with Bardot on the screen. Still both are at the top of their game as actresses and are a treat.The movie is unabashedly prorevolutionary with classic Marxist ideology something quite refreshing. The peasants are oppressed and noble and the landowners army and Catholic priests are powerful and savage. The movie is pleasure on every level. If you enjoyed Bandidas with Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek you'll enjoy this film.".

The dialogue is faux clever and works now and then but there isn't enough of it to occupy the mind the way the costuming and landscape occasionally catch the eye. True the colors are lovely and vibrant and the film has that big movie look of some of the great Technicolor romps of its period but like the strip shows it lampoons the film is all come on and no payoff. It doesn't help that leading man chores are handled by George Hamilton who is actually quite capable of rising to good material but is here symbolic of the weak and shallow nature of the film itself.

But Louis Malle is definitely not up to it. He's actually one of my favorite directors of all time but he has little idea what he's doing making this film. It must have been the most expensive French film at the time. Malle's previous film The Fire Within was a study on suicide and had about I don't know ten characters at the most. Viva Maria! has a billion extras and a ton of speaking parts. It also has elaborate action sequences. The whole picture comes off sloppy. The comedy is especially poor. Almost nothing hits nearly everything misses. The jokes are very poorly timed. I think I laughed at one of them.Viva Maria! is worth watching though as a curio. Except for the comic moments Malle's direction isn't bad. And Bardot and Moreau are always fun to watch. If for nothing else watch it for the many strip teases they do near the beginning of the film. There are also a couple of very bizarre but wonderful scenes like the almost Personaesque Lady in White scene where Moreau and Bardot with a little magical help from the editing machine dazzle dizzy and confound a Mexican baron. The color cinematography is also quite beautiful. It's worth a watch if you have nothing better to watch. 610.".

It's a play on the Irish hatred of the British.They just blow some troops up and melt into the surroundings much as our modern terrorists do.......and with a child like innocence about them. Malle makes fun of a lot of oldtime westerns with the hero Hamilton dramatically dying for his love. Jeanne Moreau is quite a dancer which I never realized before as she and Brigitte 'invent' the striptease.This was in glorious technicolor and the naivete and innocence of the time when this movie was made can't help but sadden you as you realize how low we have sunk in this oilcrazy world where the mad dictator Bush not Hitler this time invades any oilrich countries he wants to under the guise of 'bringing democracy' to the people althouth we have to kill them to do it. If our time wasn't such a Keystone Cop melodrama in itself I'd make more fun of this movie. But it's fairly realistic if you judge by what goes for reality these days. You can see why 'Murphy Brown' was so in love with Lewis Malle the director.".

	schema:reviewBody "In her native France Brigitte Bardot enjoyed at the height of her career a similar reputation to that enjoyed by say Audrey Hepburn or Elizabeth Taylor in Britain a great screen actress who also happened to be a great beauty. In the Englishspeaking world however Bardot's reputation was rather different more that of a great beauty who also happened to be well she's obviously an actress of some sort but I can't actually think of anything she's ever been in. She was idolised by millions of men who had never seen any of her films possibly the only actress to become an international sex symbol without any help from Hollywood.Although Viva Maria! was a French film it was also released in an Englishlanguage version which gave some of those men a chance to see their idol on the screen without worrying about subtitles. The film is based around a similar concept to that in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes that of teaming a famous blonde sex symbol with a brunette equivalent. Like Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell in the original Bardot and Jeanne Moreau differed not only in colouring but also in their screen persona. The blondes Monroe and Bardot both retained a sort of girlish innocence throughout their careers whereas the brunettes Russell and Moreau both several years older than their blonde counterparts had more of a sexy older woman air about them. Although Bardot was 31 when she made this film she was still often referred to as a sex kitten and great play was made of the fact that in French her initials BB were pronounced like the word for baby. I doubt if anyone ever called Jeanne Moreau a kitten.The film is set in Central America in 1907. Bardot plays Maria an Irish revolutionary on the run after blowing up a bridge in a British colony presumably British Honduras. Exactly why the interests of Irish nationalism required the destruction of a bridge in a remote part of that territory is never explained. She is befriended by a Parisian actress also named Maria who is performing with a travelling circus touring the area and they cross the border into a neighbouring banana republic where after inadvertently inventing striptease they become caught up in a popular uprising against the country's dictator.Louis Malle although not part of the Nouvelle Vague movement is today best remembered as the auteur director of serious films like Le Souffl au Coeur and Au Revoir Les Enfants so I was surprised to learn that he was also responsible for a frivolous comedy like this one. There is some satirical content to the film mostly reflecting France's own revolutionary anticlerical traditions but nothing too serious. The Catholic Church is shown as a reactionary force on the side of the dictator who relies heavily on the Holy Inquisition portrayed as having survived into the first decade of the twentieth century. In reality the Inquisition was abolished everywhere in Latin America upon independence from Spain. This satire however is so overthetop that it is unlikely to be taken seriously. Malle was later to make Au Revoir Les Enfants which can be seen as a deeply proCatholic film.Contrary to what some on this board have assumed this is not a film about the Mexican Revolution indeed one reviewer devotes most of his review to a lengthy analysis of what he considers to have been the causes of that revolution which is rather missing the point for two reasons. Firstly the film although shot in Mexico is not actually set there but in the fictitious Republic of San Miguel. Secondly despite a certain amount of satire this is not a serious film about politics but a lighthearted slightly bawdy comedy the sort of film the Carry On team might have made had they turned their attention to Latin American politics. Although if the Carry On team had made it the two Marias would have been played by Barbara Windsor and Hattie Jacques who might have lacked that certain je ne sais quoi of Jeanne and Brigitte. The film owes a lot in fact to the charm and sex appeal of its two heroines it may be a light frothy romp but it is a very enjoyable one nevertheless. 610".

The special quality of this is that the viewer gets to know these two protagonists very well and their humble lives in Australiawhich makes the tragic ending all the more devastating.  The last 20 or 30 minutes of the film is spent at the Gallipoli peninsula inside the war trenches.  The generals vainly send men running toward the enemy and they are swiftly slaughtered.  These scenes demonstrate the horrible truth of war that healthy young men with lives ahead of them are destroyed forever in a single pointless instance.The final minute of the film is truly heartbreaking as a tragedy occurs between the two young friends.  The very last shot of the film is stunning as a horrible image is frozen on screen.  Director Weir could have fallen into the sentimentality trap but he was smart the tragedy occurs and the moment it does the movie ends RIGHT THERE leaving you with a haunting final image.A landmark war film highly recommended.".

The ending is in retrospect quite ridiculous. But Weir has a strange ability to make anything seem realistic.Gallipoli is one of his older films from 1981 and it stars a huge cast of names  most famous today of course Mel Gibson...whose name is now splattered across the front of the DVD case.The story is a true one and follows a group of young Australian men who join the ANZACs in World War I. They are sent to Gallipoli and amidst personal and emotional turmoil they must learn to band together and fight the Turkish Army.The movie is long as another reviewer on the site points out. But all of Weir's films are. What I didn't like about his most recent  Master  Commander  is that it used special effects exteriors of ships etc. and action sequences raging storms to compensate for the slow bits... and came across to me anyway as quite dull and downtrodden.Gallipoli is a great film  slow subtle lowkey. It's a bit like an Australian version of All Quiet on the Western Front. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys slower films and can appreciate characterdriven dramas. Don't go near it if your attention span was dimming during xXx2.".

It is an excellent study the way the two personalities react to the war.Gallipoli will rarely be mentioned in the same breath as most of the most famous war movies but it is certainly one of the best at revealing the humanity that exists at the front lines.

	schema:reviewBody "Gallipoli is one of a select few of films that let's the war come to us. A film of awesome power intelligence and design Gallipoli proves to be one of the best films on the human spirit during war time. With a cast of no names and a story focusing around a battle nearly forgotten to history it looked as if Gallipoli would either be a major flop or a film that would inspire those who saw it to remember the Great War and also to realize the futility of war. Gallipoli is the focal point of the film. The landing at Gallipoli by joint BritishAustralian forces is announced early in the film. We then meet the two main characters Archy and Frank two young Australians both trying to reach Perth to enlist in the AIF Australian Imperial Force. The film is split into pretty much three sections 1. Traveling to Perth 2. Army Training and 3. The Battle of Gallipoli. All three acts as you may call them are smart well written and well acted.The Battle of Gallipoli is hauntingly realistic and unsettling. Peter Weir held nothing back in filming his battle sequences. The battles are filled blood gore and violence. What makes the battle scenes work is not the realistic action but the acting and the musical score playing during the whole sequence. The last 10 minutes is some of the most intense battle scenes I've ever seen and it actually brought a tear to my eye watching the charges.Mel Gibson is quite young in this one. He was barely 25 in this and along with Mad Max this helped propel him into the public spotlight and made him the star he is today. The first half of the film he seems like a dry character but we are all misunderstanding him. He never wanted to be on the front he never wanted to go to war and that is all revealed during the battle as the characters lose their innocence about the reality of war. Mark Lee is the other lead actor playing Archy. I hadn't seen him before this film and haven't seen him since but his performance is tremendous. He is the character who thinks war is just one big game and until the last sequence he still believes this to be true. His happygolucky personality is quite likable and makes him a character enjoyable to watch on screen. I wish he would have been in more well known films after this though I assume the other works he has been in are also good.What made this film for me was the last battle in the film. The battle presented is the Assualt at the Nek. It is entirely based on fact when Australian Troops were ordered to charge against the Ottoman Turkish forces in the opposite trench. Just before the last charge emotions overcome you as you see the results of the previous charges and just how terrible world war one was. You see the futility of it. How so many young men go off to war believing it to be a game and never return home. Gallipoli is a terrific film. Its power and awe is unmatched by any other war film. Peter Weir created a masterpiece when he made the film Gallipoli. This film is a triumph and one of the greatest war films I have ever seen. We need more war films like this.55 Stars".

	schema:headline " Atypical movie from Weir on war.";
	schema:reviewBody "A lot male bonding goes on in Australia although men don't talk about it as such.  The word mate can mean anything from casual acquaintance to close friend and is slung about freely.  That word  and the shared interest in friendly competition sports and beer  are about the only ways this bonding is expressed.  And it's all done in a lighthearted way joking and grabass not the deadly serious way it shows up in some male groups  Women have no place in this business that sort of thing.  How male solidarity develops nobody knows but in the case of Australia it may have something to do with the founder effect.  The continent was after all settled by outcasts who had nothing in common except their marginal status. And aboriginal Australia was always a bastion of male solidarity with lots of secret societies from whose rituals women and kids were excluded.That male bonding is basically what this movie is about not war.  We get to know two mates  Mark Lee and Mel Gibson  and through them a number of others.  There's hardly a woman in the picture even before the men join the army.  If it's a war picture it's a mighty odd one.  It's an odd movie for Peter Weir too.  His specialty is the projection of a mood of ominous languor and this is his most raucous work.  Not that he's lost his taste for portents of doom.  The men play a rough game of football and then Weir gives us a long look at the broken face of the Sphynx and has one of the men say that the Egyptians were the first people to try to beat death.Gibson and Lee are speedy runners and Gibson is given the job of beating death by human effort and he fails.  The Australians launch wave after wave of bayonet attacks against a wellfortified Turkish position and are mowed down uselessly.  Their attack was supposed to be a diversion and turns out to have been unnecessary.  What a waste.  Winston Churchill was partly responsible and the failure of his plan may have influenced the caution he showed during World War II.  His attitude towards the Americans' eagerness to attack quickly and directly could be summed up as You don't know what it's like.  The acting is good.  When I first saw this I thought Mark Lee might become a bankable star because he seemed the more handsome of the two.  On an additional viewing he comes across as not effeminate but pretty and his voice is high which seems to sap him of strength.  Gibson is darker and more of a wisecracking opportunist and the better actor of the two. Everything leads up to the climactic charge.  There isn't really very much action.  What there is is violent and quick.  The most gripping scene in the film is the final one just before the third useless wave goes over the top to its death the wave that Lee is part of.  And we see soldiers stripping themselves of their wedding rings and other sentimental objects writing final notes to loved ones hanging their pitiful effects from bayonets stuck into the sandbags.  The scene isn't wrung for artificial tears.  It doesn't have to be.  Of all the wars of the last century World War I which used to be called The Great War was probably the most mismanaged.  The aristocratic officer corps was out of touch with its men and often treated them as expendable material.  Sometimes it was okay to lose 10000 of your troops if it meant the enemy would lose 11000 of his.  It ought to be mentioned that the use of Albinoni and other composers is apt but there is an underscore of electronic pops and ricochets that doesn't fit at all.  This is an atypical movie one well worth watching.".

	onyx:emotionText "A lot male bonding goes on in Australia although men don't talk about it as such.  The word mate can mean anything from casual acquaintance to close friend and is slung about freely.  That word  and the shared interest in friendly competition sports and beer  are about the only ways this bonding is expressed.  And it's all done in a lighthearted way joking and grabass not the deadly serious way it shows up in some male groups  Women have no place in this business that sort of thing.  How male solidarity develops nobody knows but in the case of Australia it may have something to do with the founder effect.  The continent was after all settled by outcasts who had nothing in common except their marginal status. And aboriginal Australia was always a bastion of male solidarity with lots of secret societies from whose rituals women and kids were excluded.That male bonding is basically what this movie is about not war.  We get to know two mates  Mark Lee and Mel Gibson  and through them a number of others.  There's hardly a woman in the picture even before the men join the army.  If it's a war picture it's a mighty odd one.  It's an odd movie for Peter Weir too.  His specialty is the projection of a mood of ominous languor and this is his most raucous work.  Not that he's lost his taste for portents of doom.  The men play a rough game of football and then Weir gives us a long look at the broken face of the Sphynx and has one of the men say that the Egyptians were the first people to try to beat death.Gibson and Lee are speedy runners and Gibson is given the job of beating death by human effort and he fails.

	schema:headline " Where Australia Became A Nation";
	schema:reviewBody "A stranger seeing the title Gallipoli might think one was going to view a kind of docudrama along the lines of The Longest Day. That's certainly a film waiting to be made. Instead one's going to see the friendship of two sprinters Mark Lee and Mel Gibson and how they join the Australian Army which sent a lot of its best and brightest to fight in a faraway war in Europe which really Australia had nothing to do with.Australia was a nation at that point for only 14 years in 1915. The various colonies and the great unsettled middle united and achieved independence from Great Britain in 1901. It had developed no real traditions as a nation up to that point. The USA had some similar growth pangs many historians hold that we didn't become a nation really until the end of the Civil War.The Aussie fascination with sports is shown here. Part of the recent frontier tradition is the explanation usually given. Mark Lee is a sprinter training to represent Australia in the Olympics to come. Mel Gibson is also a sprinter but takes a rather more casual attitude towards it. Reference is made to Harry Lascelles who was an Australian track star of the period. In fact Lee when he enlists adopts that as a last name and lies about his age. In Australia sports stars aren't just athletes with inflated egos and paychecks like they are in America. From Harry Lascelles to Rod Laver to Murray Rose right down to Ian Thorpe these people are national icons.Gibson and Lee's army service and the Gallipoli campaign only occupy a third of the film. In the next World War Winston Churchill who had a big hand in conceiving this operation called the landings at Anzio a beached whale. The difference there though was that eventually the Allied Armies did hook up with the Anzio beachhead in a few months. You had a similar beached whale at ANZAC cove on the Gallipoli peninsula with Aussie and Kiwi troops from the ANZAC countries with these troops established on a beachhead but unable to move in any direction.The idea behind Gallipoli was to seize it and march forward and seize control of the straights of the Dardenelles and Bosporus so supplies to Russia would get through and knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war. To rescue this operation which was in trouble the Allied commander Sir Ian Hamilton landed another army at Suvla Bay on the other side of the peninsula. Those two armies never hooked up and now there were two beached whales on Gallipoli and no other Allied Army looking to hook up with them. It's this particular action and what happens to Gibson and Lee as two of the thousands still stuck at ANZAC cove that is the heart of the story.Mel Gibson of course became an international star shortly. I'm surprised Mark Lee didn't though he's had a successful career in Australia. In fact I was most impressed by the touching performance he delivers here.All the young men who died in that operation who bonded together on those beachheads and those who survived took back a national identity with them. No one was from Victoria New South Wales Western Territory etc. they were all Aussies now but it was a terrible price. And in a war that really had nothing to do with Australia. That fact entered into the thinking in Australia and New Zealand come the second war when there was very much a threat to the continentisland nation's very existence. Bitter lessons from Gallipoli impressed on that generation of Australia's best and brightest.Though a Longest Day type film about Gallipoli should be made this one will do quite nicely. I recommend it highly especially for us Yanks who want to know what makes a great nation tick.".

	schema:reviewBody "Peter Weir's Gallipoli is a breathtaking story of friendship that culminates with the ANZACS illfated offensive against the turks in the Dardinelles in 1915 and has an ending that makes All Quiet On The Western Front look like a Nuremberg Rally.Archie Hamilton Mark Lee is a young idealistic farm boy from Western Australia. Archie dreams of adventure and has no intention of remaining a cattle herder on his fathers farm.Frank Dunne Mel Gibson is an unskilled labourer on the railways. unlike Archie he doesn't exactly dream of adventure but he too has no intention of remaining in his current vocation.Both these men are accomplished sprinters and the two first meet at a race meeting in which they both compete. Archie wins Frank comes a close second. Archie has already made his mind up not to return home and instead enlist in The Light Horse and get into the so called 'Great' War that the newspapers have been glorifying. Archie's hopes are dashed when he is rejected for service as he is under the minimum age requirement of 21. Alone and miles from home Archie strikes up a friendship with Dunne who looking for a travelling partner convinces Archie to travel to Perth and try to enlist again using a false name and a false birth certificate.During their long journey the relationship between the two is defined Archie is the brave if not childish dreamer and can't wait to get the big 'adventure' while Dunne in contrast is the more worldywise of the two who sees the war for what it really is and at first intends to stay as far away from it as possible. It is only when he sees the respect Archie's bravery earns him that he relents and agrees to join up too.One problem Dunne faces is that he doesn't know one end of a horse from the other and is promptly rejected. Archie passes his horse trial with flying colours and the two are destined to part company. Dunne then meets up with three of his mates from his railroad days and they agree to join the infantry.What must be a few months later we are now at the Australian Military Camp in Egypt and the only battle Dunne and his fellow ANZACS have to face is how to fill in the time when awaiting combat orders.During one particular war game The infantry are to face Light Horse on a combat exercise and during the mle Archie and Dunne are reunited.As the intended destination for all the troops is the Gallipoli peninsula the Light Horse have as much need for a horse as they have snow boots and Dunne successfully gains a transfer from the Infantry to his friends regiment.Once at Gallipoli the realities of war are right before their eyes the bodies the gunfire and the claustrophobic atmosphere of a 100 degree trench. The image of War that Frank had is embodied yet you get the impression that Archie still doesn't really comprehend the enormity of what he has committed himself to.Frank is no hurry to go over the top convinced of his impending doom and on the morning of the fateful day he is called as a 'runner' in case the communications fail. Wave upon wave of Australian soldiers go over the top of the trench and barely get two paces before falling like wheat to the sythe in a rain of Turkish gatling fire. Frank manages to convince his superiors of the pointless slaughter enfolding and the officers agree to halt the attack. As Frank frantically rushes back to the trench with the news that will save many lives the Light Horse including Archie are preparing to go into the frey. and time is not on Dunne's side.The final scene of this fantastic movie is as emotionally agonising as any other I could name and doesn't soften with repeated watchings either. All right men! We're going With this the men sombrely write final hurried letters to their wives and look at crumpled pictures of the children they will never see again. Archie at this point has finally realised that war is only a glorious adventure to those who are lucky enough never to have experienced it first hand. and this is a war to which he is about to become a statistic. If you then add the haunting Adagio by Tomaso Albinoni as background music then you have enough to reduce even the hardest of men to tears.To Australians everywhere Gallipoli is a scar that will never heal. We British too must share that sorrow but thanks to Peter Weir however it is tragedy that the world now shares and a lesser director could not have created such a spectacle. Credit too to Mel Gibson and Mark Lee for making the world forget that they were Mel Gibson and Mark Lee as the performances are so electrifying that for 107 minutes they WERE Archie Hamilton and Frank Dunne of the Tenth Light Horse Men from Western Australia.Advance Australia Fair.".

	schema:reviewBody "A lush retelling of the parallel chronicles of two athletics racers who competed in Aussie competitions . It's a remake of a lesser 1931 effort titled 'Battle of Gallipoli' in which history blends with the destiny of two friends in the legendary confrontation between the Germanallied Turks and Australia . An idealist sprinter named Archy Mark Lee wishes enlist the army  while Frank Dune Mel Gibson is a pragmatic Bon Vivant  both of whom meet at an Australian race . They draft Outback army until Egypt and after that  Gallipoli  and they don't know where find the Turk peninsula . One was compelled by honor the other by friendship each other and both become part of the bloody battle . Two Australian sprinters face the brutal realities of war when they are sent to fight in the Gallipoli campaign in Turkey during World War I .Much acclaimed story about the doomed Anzac WWI campaign  it's turns out to be a touching and powerful film  nonetheless includes a predictable but riveting final . This exciting picture contains epic friendship  mythic races  a wonderful relationship and a gripping commentary on the wastes of WWI . Some of the movie's best moments come its humorous lines and being fashionable made . It shows much of the conditions and events that soldiers endured in the Gallipoli theater of war  Archy Hamilton's athlete character was inspired by a line from C.E.W. Bean's Official History of Australia in the War of 19141918 describing Private Wilfred Harper of the 10th Light Horse . The flick has its touching moments found primarily in the superb supporting performances by Mark Lee and thenunknown Mel Gibson as two champion runners who join forces on a countrywide trek and enlist the Australian Light Horse and battle in Gallipoli . With a budget of 2.6 million dollars Gallipoli received heavy international promotion and distribution and helped to elevate the worldwide reputation of the Australian film industry and of later Australian New Wave films . The film also helped to launch the international career of actor Mel Gibson . Moving and intimate musical score though composed by synthesizer by Brian Tyler  nevertheless  the most striking feature of the soundtrack was the use of excerpts from Oxygne by French electronic music pioneer Jean Michel Jarre  Maurice Jarre's son  during running scenes . And of course  including the classic Adagio by Albinoni . Atmospheric and haunting cinematography that adequate as a moodpiece by Russell Boyd supported by John Seale . It was filmed primarily in South Australia  the cattle station scenes were shot in Beltana the salt lake at Lake Torrens the station at Adelaide Railway Station and the coastline near Port Lincoln was transformed into the Gallipoli Peninsula  the pyramid and bazaar scenes were filmed on location in Egypt.The motion picture is stunningly directed by Australian director Peter Weir who resulted to be the passport to Hollywood for this magnificent filmmaker . He realized numerous interesting stories superbly filmed  with brooding and thoughtprovoking issues and in his prestigious career deserves special attention this excellent film titled Gallipoli . Weir achieved several hits as The way back Master and Commnader Witness The Truman show  Dead poets society  Gallipoli The last wave and some flop as Mosquito coast  The plumber . Rating  Better than average  Well worth seeing .".

Bean's Official History of Australia in the War of 19141918 describing Private Wilfred Harper of the 10th Light Horse . The flick has its touching moments found primarily in the superb supporting performances by Mark Lee and thenunknown Mel Gibson as two champion runners who join forces on a countrywide trek and enlist the Australian Light Horse and battle in Gallipoli . With a budget of 2.6 million dollars Gallipoli received heavy international promotion and distribution and helped to elevate the worldwide reputation of the Australian film industry and of later Australian New Wave films . The film also helped to launch the international career of actor Mel Gibson . Moving and intimate musical score though composed by synthesizer by Brian Tyler  nevertheless  the most striking feature of the soundtrack was the use of excerpts from Oxygne by French electronic music pioneer Jean Michel Jarre  Maurice Jarre's son  during running scenes . And of course  including the classic Adagio by Albinoni . Atmospheric and haunting cinematography that adequate as a moodpiece by Russell Boyd supported by John Seale . It was filmed primarily in South Australia  the cattle station scenes were shot in Beltana the salt lake at Lake Torrens the station at Adelaide Railway Station and the coastline near Port Lincoln was transformed into the Gallipoli Peninsula  the pyramid and bazaar scenes were filmed on location in Egypt.The motion picture is stunningly directed by Australian director Peter Weir who resulted to be the passport to Hollywood for this magnificent filmmaker . He realized numerous interesting stories superbly filmed  with brooding and thoughtprovoking issues and in his prestigious career deserves special attention this excellent film titled Gallipoli . Weir achieved several hits as The way back Master and Commnader Witness The Truman show  Dead poets society  Gallipoli The last wave and some flop as Mosquito coast  The plumber . Rating  Better than average  Well worth seeing .";

	schema:reviewBody "I've long been a fan of Peter Weir a director who I find is able to bring a sincerity and honesty to even the most emotionally manipulative stories. Whether it's a man whose entire world has been fabricated as a television show or a good old teacher inspiring his students yarn I think Weir is able to do what most directors are not in that he can make these potentially absurd stories feel true and grounded. So when a director like him takes on a true event that is grounded in some of the most sincere themes in history as he did with Gallipoli it's no surprise that the outcome is going to be one of his best films if not his best.The title Gallipoli is taken from the Gallipoli Campagin where Weir focuses his attention on Battle of the Nek a famous attack by the Australians in Turkey during the First World War. It would have been easy to focus on the attack itself or the entire Campaign but Weir is more introduced on the human aspect and he uses this event in the history of his homeland as a way of exploring the loss of innocence that comes with war and seeing battle. Gallipoli centers around two Australian sprinters Archy Hamilton Mark Lee and Frank Dunne Mel Gibson who start out as competitors but become friends as they sign up and fight alongside one another.A lot of war films begin in the midst of war and study it's characters through the war itself but Gallipoli takes a unique approach by establishing these characters first and developing them before they are sent off. Archy wants to sign up from the moment we meet him but he is too young and keeps getting denied whereas Frank at first has absolutely no interest in going to fight even though all of his friends are doing it. The two meet bond and influence one another until finally they are both off to war and it's this emotional investment that Weir is able to achieve in these characters before they enter the battle that really makes the film soar.Weir has always been able to stage cinematic sequences with breathtaking skill and precision so it's no surprise that the war scenes are stunningly created but the thing that truly sets Gallipoli apart is it's clarity of characters. The themes of innocence camaraderie and what it takes to be a man are able to resonate so deeply because the characters themselves are rich and vivid beings. Mark Lee is wideeyed grace and enthusiasm eager to get on the battlefield and defend his country but it's Gibson who really shines as a performer here practically stealing the entire film.Dunne at first appears to be a classic character type the nonchalant drifter who only cares for himself and that's why he doesn't sign up to fight. As the film develops though we realize there's much more to him a fear of having to face battle that is what really makes him so hesitant. Gibson recalls a young Paul Newman in his portrayal opening with endlessly compelling charm and slowly peeling back the layers to reveal a fragile deeply vulnerable person underneath. It's devastating work made all the more so by the rawness of Weir's direction. There are some magnificently realized sequences that speak to Weir's talent as a director but it would all be for nothing if he hadn't been able to bring the genuine emotion to it that he is able to. It's also got one of my favorite final shots in the history of cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "The title of Peter Weir's 1981 war film Gallipoli scrawls onto the screen in a blood red hue sitting on top of a blank black background leaving it to stand out even more a Hellish writing itself looking like it's been inscribed in blood as it stands  if we listen carefully we can hear the feint sounds of some organ keys suggesting some kind of Gothic horror sensibility about these early proceedings. Where the film will end up might as well be Hell the worst place in the world anybody could be let alone the clusters of those aged below twentyor so whom ended up on the frontlines of Europe fighting World War One. Weir's film wonderfully captures that madness of war and centres on a handful of people still early on in their lives put out to face the chorus' of death blending in a blackly amusing tract as they attempt to make sense of their surroundings and get by through the absurdest nature of this closeknit warfare that they face.It is Australia and the year is 1915 in amongst a barren sandy stretch of Western Australian turf. We begin with young Archy Lee a wouldbe champion sprinter going through the routine with an elderly family member that he does so prior to each session of one hundred meter running Archy's rigorous process and success story at the end of it all in going on to beat past times an early indication of how he'll do rather well in accepting this relationship of power play from someone else fizz through a system of physical movements and then come out the other end rather welloff at the thanks of a certain 'superior'  army life couldn't be that different could it? Archy's life whilst in possession of a family whom care for him is fraught with antagonism and marginalisation out of the house. His masculinity is challenged by others of his ilk when it is made obvious he opts for the sport of running over that of a manlier pastime of boxing and chooses to be good friends with another boy of black skin variety. Few appear to get out of the locale in which Archy is situated his uncle that aforementioned coach to his sprinting got out once but nary wishes to speak too much about it later on Archy will meet an elderly recluse whom speaks of never even having seen a city.It seems this proverbial lead wants to get out of where he is alluded toward through somewhat of a longing gaze over a newspaper article detailing World War One and the Gallipoli zone. Young Archy it seems is nary afraid of a challenge nor indeed put proverbial assets at risk his challenging of some of the bullies to a race which might damage his feet noend is a task he's all too happy in indulge in  the potential of a wrath from his uncle on this mere days before a big race not enough of an item to dissuade him from standing up to a group and instigating a challenge against seemingly unbreakable odds. It's at this track meeting a few days later that he meets Mel Gibson's Frank Dunne a fellow sprinter and a wily young man drifting from employment to employment and scrimping on his chores on said jobs anyway. Dunne is fed up of Australia but isn't willing to join the army to go abroad for the said undergoing war a falling out with his chums over such a thing occurring and opening the door for Archy's bond.His meeting with Archy and consequent friendship eventually see them both sign up thus the beginnings of the reforming of Dunne's attitude to life that he can't take on any job and scrimp past whilst earning whatever comes his way are put into action epitomised in his attempt to lie his way into a horse brigade at the expense of hard frontline infantry graft. It is around about this point that Weir remarkably shifts the emphasis onto Gibson's Dunne a streetsmart Australian doing well in amidst the Cairo based marketplaces upon being shipped out closer to that titular region the blackly comic exchanges and scenarios a clinically gloomy horderve to the later war set chaos which we morbidly anticipate. Yes the film is a film about war and yes its politics in regards to what warfare is are all in the right places but it arrives certainly with this relationship at the core of it a relationship between two young men one seemingly always on the margins back home and the other just discovering the beginnings of such a thing. Out of a Hellish surrounding situation we watch and come to be rather moved by a film about those learning some tough lessons about responsibility and life outside of a proverbial bubble  weeping only for the fact most of them won't ever be able to take them away from the battlefield.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unfortunately my comments ended up being 4500 words or so 3500 words over IMDB's word limit  if anyone's interested I'm putting the rest up on one of my Web pages IMDB does not allow URLs in reviews so just search for my name and Gallipoli and you should find it.  Possible oblique 'spoilers' ahead... This past ANZAC Day April 25 2002 marked the passage of 87 years since the illfated Allied landings at Gallipoli.  To honor the occasion I felt compelled to watch Gallipoli.   It's an excellent movie.  I won't go on any more about that because other reviewers here have done such a stellar job.  What I'd like to do is attest to the piece's fundamental authenticity and place it in a reallife context.  I'm aided in this by access to a portion of my grandfather's memoirs a relatively brief and interesting set of typewritten notes that I reread after watching the film.  The portion dedicated to his time at Gallipoli and  generally  the entire length of his WWI service reads somewhat like an early treatment for the Peter Weir film.  I haven't yet read any indepth histories of that campaign including the ones used as the film's basis but his account and what I've dug up on the Internet over the past couple of days suggest that the film is remarkably accurate save for a few minor details and inevitable renaming of characters.  That's amazing actually given that almost all 'true story' movies are invariably far from the actual truth that they purport to depict. And yes I'd call this an antiwar movie.  Isn't any realistic war movie by necessity an antiwar movie though?  Like many from Down Under who watch this film I'm a New Zealander I have a personal connection with the events depicted in the film.

His entire experience from Egypt to Gallipoli in many ways parallels that of the film's fictional characters perhaps not surprising given that thousands of men shared similar experience and that the film was obviously closely based upon accounts of the campaign's survivors.First there's the idealistic 'bloke' keen to do his bit and 'be in it'...we were mostly civilians with only one ambition  to fight the Hun bring honor and glory to ourselves and Australia then come home and carry on where we had left off.For nearly three months the Army tried to make soldiers of us by taking us on long boring marches and teaching us how to parade but we felt it was a waste of time and many found the military discipline hard to take.  We were anxious to 'do our bit' and worried that the war would be over before we left Australian soil.And then they landed facing withering fire on that Sunday morning in the spring of 1915The dreams and romance of battle before we hit the beaches soon subsided once we experienced the grim reality of war.Here's another piece that you'll recognize in the filmWhen not on the front line we'd be put to burial parties or given duties such as making bombs out of nails screws and explosives and jamming them into old tin cans.  These went off like shrapnel and were very lethal.And then there's the film's swimming scene not merely included so that audiences could get an early gratuitous look at Mel Gibson's bottom...between lulls in the fighting we would dash to the beach nicknamed Brighton Beach and take a swim.  Johnny Turk rained bullets down upon us and some would be killed or wounded but the risk was worth it just to feel clean and refreshed and it was the only place to get away from the dreadful flies.Other aspects of the 'domestic' side of the Gallipoli experience were recognizable in the filmIt became almost impossible to eat our bully beef and hard biscuit our staple diet without swallowing some flies.

No shortage of bully beef either judging by the stacked boxed of the stuff shown near the film's end.He wrote about how he and his fellows soon gained a great admiration for their Turkish opponents particularly after their determined assaults on the ANZAC trenches during May.

	onyx:emotionText "Unfortunately my comments ended up being 4500 words or so 3500 words over IMDB's word limit  if anyone's interested I'm putting the rest up on one of my Web pages IMDB does not allow URLs in reviews so just search for my name and Gallipoli and you should find it.  Possible oblique 'spoilers' ahead... This past ANZAC Day April 25 2002 marked the passage of 87 years since the illfated Allied landings at Gallipoli.  To honor the occasion I felt compelled to watch Gallipoli.   It's an excellent movie.  I won't go on any more about that because other reviewers here have done such a stellar job.  What I'd like to do is attest to the piece's fundamental authenticity and place it in a reallife context.  I'm aided in this by access to a portion of my grandfather's memoirs a relatively brief and interesting set of typewritten notes that I reread after watching the film.  The portion dedicated to his time at Gallipoli and  generally  the entire length of his WWI service reads somewhat like an early treatment for the Peter Weir film.  I haven't yet read any indepth histories of that campaign including the ones used as the film's basis but his account and what I've dug up on the Internet over the past couple of days suggest that the film is remarkably accurate save for a few minor details and inevitable renaming of characters.  That's amazing actually given that almost all 'true story' movies are invariably far from the actual truth that they purport to depict. And yes I'd call this an antiwar movie.  Isn't any realistic war movie by necessity an antiwar movie though?  Like many from Down Under who watch this film I'm a New Zealander I have a personal connection with the events depicted in the film.

The film is a tribute to the Australian spirit of courage and comradeship further borne out in a survey last autumn of its top 100 prominent citizens by being voted their favourite from a local director.  It is a tale of the misuse or even abuse of colonial affiliations and the Anzacs with a classic landing at the wrong place at the wrong time piece of military planning.  However the British also incurred heavy losses 120000 casualties compared to Australia's 26111 with 8141 killed far from sitting on the beach drinking cups of tea' as Peter Weir and David Williamson's script indignantly has it.  The compelling poetry of Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon together with Lewis Milestone's searing masterpiece All Quiet on the Western Front' based on Erich Maria Remarque's novel of The Great War had convinced me as a teenager that there was no glory in war.  This view had been reinforced by TV images from Vietnam and I found myself at odds with the jingoistic mood in the UK for the 1982 skirmish with Argentina over the Falklands.  At times throughout history a call to arms has been necessary to oppose despotism but the tragic loss of young life is even more abhorrent given the nature of the slaughter of World War I in the countless illconceived and poorly executed campaigns in a cause unknown to most of its participants.  Viewing Weir's pertinent film in the mid 1980's concerning the assault on the Dardanelles which resulted in the massacre at Gallipoli only furthered my opinion. This perspective on life's lack of compassion was recently strengthened by the TV drama Shackleton' which told of most of the survivors of an illfated south polar expedition of 1914 having barely survived the awesomeness of the planet being swiftly packed off to the front line to face man's own version of Hell.The storyline rather than being an indepth study of the military campaign at Gallipoli develops the friendship between Archy Hamilton Mark Lee an idealistic and romantic under aged 18yearold and the older and more cynical Frank Dunne Mel Gibson involving you in their lives to give greater pathos to their fates.  The two meet as competitors on the racetrack with a Chariots of Fire' also released in the same year style of rivalry and friendship and decide to join up together which involves a trek in the spirit of Burke and Wills across a vast dry lake in Western Australia to reach Perth.  In one of life's bitter ironies the sprinters try to join the 3rd Light Horse Brigade and end up in a battle where horses have no part to play.  The men are used as infantry for the charge of 7 August 1915 against the Turk position of the Nek where 375 of 600 Australians were cut down in three waves of a criminally futile attack leaving 234 dead. Archy's memorable training patter How fast can you run? As fast as a leopard' with his uncle Jack Bill Kerr is also his last utterance before going over the top to meet his certain destiny.  The finale is cleverly calculated to leave us with the feeling of the tragedy of the Gallipoli campaign as well as the sense of loss of youth a similar technique used by Weir in his earlier Picnic at Hanging Rock'.  I wonder if the makers of Blackadder Goes Forth' in 1989 were also inspired by this film as its similar freezeframe ending would seem to serve as a tribute.  It is as powerful an image though not as viscerally assaulting on your senses as the opening halfhour of carnage in Spielberg's version of the landing on Omaha beach in Saving Private Ryan'.Though criticised for the use of Jean Michel Jarre's synthesizer pop that anchors the moviemaking in 1981 I find it serves as a constant reminder along with the more fitting soulful Albinoni's adagio in G minor. Similarly Bruce Smeaton's organ strains though highly in keeping for the time have been knocked for their inclusion in Weir's seminal Picnic at Hanging Rock' which yet again combined the stunning photography of Russell Boyd with the haunting mix of Mozart Beethoven and contemporary pan pipes from Zamfir.  As I doubt either ground breaking feature could be made as innocently today using coetaneous music seems foresighted to set the period mood and mindset the films should be viewed with.  It is an interesting comment on TV advertising which has done so much to popularize classical music that recently a car advert used the same theme from Oxygene part II and though I can't recall the make it still conjures up the desperate image of a young Mel Gibson dashing frantically along the trenches in a doomed race to prevent the slaughter of his mates.  In a parallel vein Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries' will always remind me of the helicopter attack formation playing this at full volume as it sweeps on a Viet Cong village in Francis Ford Coppola's darkly satirical Apocalypse Now'.It is a shame that a few months ago with such rare chances to see Australia's finest movies in the UK Gallipoli' was only screened on the minority access Channel 5 precluding many potential viewers.  This film furthered Weir's path of greatness along which he has proven his creative flexibility not only in Australia as one of its most talented directors but also in Hollywood with the successes of his engrossing Witness' the inspiring Dead Poet's Society' and his surreally brilliant latest The Truman Show'.   In November of last year in recognition of his contribution Australia's film and television directors nominated Weir as winner of their first lifetime achievement award.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you don't mind watching a Bmovie from the late 70's shot on Super 8 film with an artstudent edge and poor sound then you might dig it. One of the reasons why you might particularly if you are a Madonna fan is the fact that this is practically the only MOVING FOOTAGE rather than the many still photosthat captured her before she was a star at that very interesting period when she was twenty in New York had only been there for a year or two and at certain periods was nearly starving. This is a very sexual movie but not in a conventional sense it is chock full of simple impulse and flirts with the satanic. In short it's just plain weird. It probably would best be described as a few steps up from a homemade film. An interesting piece of TRIVIA is that at the time this movie was being made right before the rape scene in the coffee shop restroom the director did something to try to up the authenticity of Madonna's acting. Director Stephen Lewicki took the actor who played her rapist aside and instructed him to rip her blouse off during the scene a detail Madonna had no idea about. If you look closely there is an undeniably real sense of shock on her face during the scene and I remember reading in some biography of hers that they used that take that the director was pleased with the result. Madonna wasn't harmed just a little surprised. Another bit of interesting TRIVIA is that among her on screen family of lovers were a few people she actually hung out with at the time including Angie Smit a dutch girl who had studied dancing with Madonna before she dropped out and later had a brief stint in a band Madonna spent a great deal of time with The Breakfast Club.This movie has some parts to it that are hilariously retarted and are actually amusing. I was and still am a diehard Madonna fan when I first saw this movie and even I was a tad disappointed. For all you folks who aren't a real big fan of hers I wouldn't recommend it but on the whole as I said it was somewhat amusing.

	schema:reviewBody "What can one say to defend a movie like A Certain Sacrifice? Even I as much as I LOVED yes LOVED this movie must ask myself. As you may know from other reviews and such Madonna has a very early role as a deathrocker who gets together with a very angry philosopher who left the suburbs for New York's underbelly. I related to this on a lot of levels so I know it's possible to say that there are some fascinating characters events and ideas in this ugly little film! Then there's that Raymond Hall guy who is quite the successful attempt at the creation of a character who is so repulsive you just wanna get sick every time he's on screen until he's about to be killed then it's funny! Anyway Raymond is a horny dirty IL' dude who ends up raping Madonna in the bathroom while loving boyfriend Dashiel the philosopher... heh heh waits for her to fix her makeup. The gory revenge that ensues with the help of Madonna's Gothic sex cult or her family of lovers gets cheezier and cheezier but thankfully the filmmakers are well aware they just don't give a fck. So... is the sound bad? YES! Is the dialogue sometimes hurtfully cheezy? YES! Is the acting terrible? Not nearly all of it. In fact most of it was pretty damn good even though Madonna's better acting moments were when she started to come off as a Goth castaway from a John Waters movie toward the end. And yes I know John Waters doesn't have a lot of Goths in his movies but it's the best comparison I can think of! Anyway is the gore very minimal and fakelooking? YES but still it's a lovely touch! Is Madonna shown fully nude? NO but she's shown topless several times once even covered in the blood of her slaughtered rapist. Also This movie MUST be seen when you're VERY intoxicated. Then it can sink right in. I've done it three times I think I turned out alright but my wife's head needs to stop calling me from the 'fridge. Time to listen to some more Pattnosh.... mwahahahaha! FIVE STARS and I HATE to rate things with stars!".

The only reason I'm giving this movie more than 1 star is because of the business sense of the filmmakers to put this together and make money off of the Madonna name. Other than that the film itself is pretty much about a lowlife who becomes lower and lower up into the very end of the movie.

The only reason I'm giving this movie more than 1 star is because of the business sense of the filmmakers to put this together and make money off of the Madonna name. Other than that the film itself is pretty much about a lowlife who becomes lower and lower up into the very end of the movie. This lowlife meets the Madonna character who runs around with a gang of lovers and basically gets involved in satanic rituals murder and whatever else turns them on.

Los Olvidados has the dream Nazarin has the fantasy where the wife bites off her husband's lower lip and El has well El's surrealist moment comes near the end and is too good to give away. If you've seen the film I'm sure you know to what I refer. El can be divided up into three easily identifiable sections each about a halfhour each. The first is told from the point of view of an aristocrat who catches sight of a beautiful woman in church. It's love at first sight but he soon finds out that she is the wife of a friend of his. At this point I was fully expecting a cheapy adulterous romance picture a soap opera. That was the genre that was dominating Mexican cinemas at the time. Luckily the film doesn't follow a predictable route. There is at this point an elipsis of time as that first man runs into the woman. He innocently offers her a ride home. Grudgingly she accepts. On the ride home she tells him of how her husband's jealously is destroying her. He's an extremely paranoid man and he has actually threatened to murder her on two separate occasions. She finds opposition everywhere as she is looking for help. The third section of the film is told from the point of view of the husband. His jealousy is starting to lead him off a cliff.

After watching them in their entirety I cannot believe that I who consider Bunuel my alltime favorite director and one of the true masters of the medium have waited this long to acquire these DVDs. Actually while Alapage listed these DVDs at EUR25.73 on their site they only cost me EUR21.51 each excluding EUR12 shipping charges. So if there is still anybody who has not purchased them yet now may be the time to do so!Since I had never watched EL 1952 before it was the first one to go through my DVD player. It was a chilling parable of an insanely jealous middleaged man played with acute intensity by Arturo De Cordova. It afforded Bunuel ample opportunity to make practical use of overt Freudian symbolism without lending the film a heavyhanded air of pretentiousness. While there are some critics who consider it as merely 'an engaging minor work' I regard it as being among Bunuel's finest arguably with this film Bunuel reached the culmination of his work in Mexico but it also looks forward to similar sequences and themes he would tackle later on in his career especially TRISTANA 1970 and his last film THAT OBSCURE OBJECT OF DESIRE 1977.EL was beautifully abetted by another of his lowbudget Mexican films the great black comedy THE CRIMINAL LIFE OF ARCHIBALDO DE LA CRUZ 1955. Again critical reception was a bit muted in some circles dismissing it as 'just a throwaway oddity' typical of Bunuel's films of the period. However it is much more than that it is certainly very funny if you can accept its macabre sense of humor. It allowed Bunuel to create some of the most memorable images in all of his films especially the celebrated dummy incineration scene which could have been inspired by a similar scene in Michael Curtiz's marvelous MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM 1933 which Bunuel must have seen while working at Warner Bros. in the Thirties. A similar instance of this eclectic approach on Bunuel's part can be found in the walking hand sequence in his THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL 1962  one of my favorite Bunuels  which harks back to an identical premise in Robert Florey's THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS 1946 another Warner Bros. horror melodrama. For me one of the enduring assets of THE CRIMINAL LIFE OF ARCHIBALDO DE LA CRUZ is the charm and great beauty that was Miroslava Stern who played the part of Lavinia and was the model for the illfated dummy. Tragically she would take her own life a mere two weeks after the film's release with her body ironically enough ending up cremated!Both the print utilized and the transfer for both films were adequate enough and perfectly acceptable under the circumstances. However EL's overall visual and aural qualities where distinctly superior to those of ARCHIBALDO which suffered from excessive specks and slight audio dropouts at times but were never so alarming as to dispel from one's viewing pleasure of the film.".

The honeymoon and the following months have an unnerving effect on Gloria along with Francisco's rigid principles . She learns her husband results to be an irrationally jealous man . Francisco is a dedicated husband but step by step his passion shows to exhibit paranoia and disturbing traits .Another film masterpiece by the director of the prizewinning The Young and the Damned  being shot in three weeks by the great Luis Buuel who even makes a cameo appearance as one of the monks. This rare movie is largely considered a Luis Buuel's masterpiece . It is packed with thoughtprovoking drama surreal moments  jealousy  criticism  paranoia and religious elements about Catholic Church  furthermore Buuel satirizies and outright attacks bourgeois lifestyles . Good acting by Arturo De Cordoba as the wealthy religious and leery middleaged Francisco Galvn as well as Delia Garces as suffering spouse . This splendid Buuel film was nominated Grand Prize in Cannes Film Festival 1953. Good and atmospheric cinematography by excellent Mexican cameraman Gabriel Figueroa  though being necessary a perfect remastering .The motion picture was stunningly directed by the genius Luis Buuel who was voted the 14th Greatest Director of all time . Moving to Mexico in the late 1940s he teamed up with producer scar Dancigers and after a couple of unmemorable efforts shot back to international attention with the lacerating study of Mexican street urchins in Los Olvidados 1950 winning him the Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival. He subsequently produced Don Quintin Amargado  El Bruto El Abismos De Pasion  Robinson Crusoe  among others . But despite this newfound acclaim Buuel spent much of the next decade working on a variety of ultralowbudget films few of which made much impact outside Spanishspeaking countries  though many of them are well worth seeking out . After returning his native country Spain by making 'Viridiana' but this film was prohibited on the grounds of blasphemy then Buuel with his screenwriter Julio Alejandro go back Mexico where realizes in low budget 'Simon of the desert' and produced by Gustavo Alatriste . Buuel went on directing in France where filmed other masterpieces such as Belle De Jour The Milky Way  The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie  The Phantom of Liberty  his last picture was That Obscure Object of Desire shot in Spain .".

Good acting by Arturo De Cordoba as the wealthy religious and leery middleaged Francisco Galvn as well as Delia Garces as suffering spouse . This splendid Buuel film was nominated Grand Prize in Cannes Film Festival 1953. Good and atmospheric cinematography by excellent Mexican cameraman Gabriel Figueroa  though being necessary a perfect remastering .The motion picture was stunningly directed by the genius Luis Buuel who was voted the 14th Greatest Director of all time . Moving to Mexico in the late 1940s he teamed up with producer scar Dancigers and after a couple of unmemorable efforts shot back to international attention with the lacerating study of Mexican street urchins in Los Olvidados 1950 winning him the Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival. He subsequently produced Don Quintin Amargado  El Bruto El Abismos De Pasion  Robinson Crusoe  among others . But despite this newfound acclaim Buuel spent much of the next decade working on a variety of ultralowbudget films few of which made much impact outside Spanishspeaking countries  though many of them are well worth seeking out . After returning his native country Spain by making 'Viridiana' but this film was prohibited on the grounds of blasphemy then Buuel with his screenwriter Julio Alejandro go back Mexico where realizes in low budget 'Simon of the desert' and produced by Gustavo Alatriste . Buuel went on directing in France where filmed other masterpieces such as Belle De Jour The Milky Way  The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie  The Phantom of Liberty  his last picture was That Obscure Object of Desire shot in Spain .";

	schema:reviewBody "We are taken to the Holy Thursday rite in which Roman Catholic priests wash the feet of a few young men to show humility. In the case of Father Velasco a Mexican prelate his interaction with the young men has more of a sexual feeling than anything else. Looking to the rite is Francisco a rich man who watches the scene but keeps glancing until he meets the beautiful Gloria in a pew with her mother. There is also a clear feeling of class values as the shoes of the people around the washing ritual have shining if not new shoes in contrast with the humble young men's bare feet.Francisco is a complex man suffering from paranoia. After he wins Gloria who had been engaged to a wealthy man he marries her. For all practical purposes it's a marriage made in heaven. Things begin to deteriorate between the newlyweds as they take the train that will bring them to Guanajuato for their honeymoon. Francisco begins accusing Gloria of flirting with some of the men she meets something that is absurd.The story follows Francisco's descent into a madness caused by his own inability to cope with the facts. His marriage is ruined because Gloria can't put up with his irrational accusations. In a change of pace a miracle happens at the end in which we meet Francisco again in a strange land under a new persona. Finally it seems he has found peace within himself not without destroying what he loved the most.Luis Bunuel's Mexican years produced a string of movies that are now classics because of his vision. The director had a deep resentment of the Catholic Church as he saw it. In his pictures Mr. Bunuel made clear as he did here to show how the institution was hypocritical in the way Father Velasco almost looks as though he is playing a sexual act with the young men he is supposed to be washing their feet. Yet in the end Mr. Bunuel switches gears in presenting a serene setting in which a repenting Francisco is seen.There is one amazing sequence when Francisco takes Gloria to the bell tower of a church. The deafening sound of the bells drive Gloria to the point of insanity. She realizes Francisco is mad. One wonders if Alfred Hitchcock might have found inspiration for a variation of his own take for the famous scene in Vertigo.Arturo De Cordoba gave an impressive performance as Francisco the man driven by his jealousy and madness because of his paranoia. Delia Garces the exquisite Argentine actress is impressive as Gloria. The director got in general good acting from his ensemble cast. Some of the Mexican films of that period dealt with sentimental melodramas none of which is found here.The film is worth a look because of the work of Mexico's best cameraman Gabriel Figueroa. The city of Guanajuato which is key to the story is shown in all its splendor. This was a triumph for Mr. Bunuel one of the most original directors from all times.".

So in hindsight the tongueincheek reference of feet fetish not just insinuates one of Francisco's essential quality is his religious fervour but also incriminates religion as a main cause in his paranoid psyche.

Thus by throwing a lavish dinner party in his immense villa Francisco cunningly wins her over by his dedicated idea of true love should germinate from the very first sight of course his wealth and debonair flair also tip the scales. Then the timeline forwards a unspecified period of time when a distraught Gloria seeks help from Ral the flashback unveils what is actually underneath the urbane facade of Francisco after they get married during that spell.Being an objectionable composite of wanton jealousy paranoia male chauvinism self centeredness wanting confidence as a competent lover and overbearing selfrespect nothing I hate more than happy morons Francisco is played out as a complete obnoxious character far far away beyond any redemption while Gloria's own safety slowly but surely slides down into an ominous menace to a point we wonder why she is still willing to live with him a lavish villa is difficult to jolt one may say. This is Buuel in the midstream of his career applies a more discreet visual style to this unsophisticated narrative the showiest parts strike when Francisco totally loses his sanity the irregular shooting angles two different worlds surreal and real alternately materialise in front of him honed up to a thrilling tension with Luis Hernndez Bretn's arresting score.Arturo de Crdova's performance is sterling despite of Francisco is the impossible sort to invite compassion utterly compelling when he betrays his deeprooted vulnerability although he is deeply in love with Gloria he is unable to love cannot even pull off his evil attempt of murder an outandout weakling subverted by his bourgeois upbringings and religious influence monastery is the fitting final settling place for him. Delia Garcs's Gloria adopts a comely appearance but hampered by her own indecision and subservience to a patriarchal supremacy which society casts on women at that time she is spellbound to watch when she finally opens up about all her suffering.

This time I picked it up on You Tube of all places so now I've seen all of Bunuel's Mexican films. I suppose I was hoping for more. Some of the earliest Mexican films were pretty standard fare  not much to be detected from L'Age d'Or or anything like that. Bunuel had to cooperate with the standard melodramas of the day to get his films made in Mexico. Occasionally his special eccentricities would come out of the woodwork but not often enough for me. This film was released by Columbia Pictures which means Harry Cohn and Cohn was truly a monster for any director to work with. There are some pot shots at the church throughout and l'amour fou so close to the director but there was precious little humor in this one.I felt the film didn't always know where to go. It describes obsession in detail and conveys it extremely well with talented performances. The Vertigo stretch was a bit much for me. Both films dealt with obsessive men and had scenes in bell towers but there couldn't be any mistaking Bunuel for Hitchcock or the other way around nor how the two directors treated it in such vastly different ways.Curtis Stotlar.".

Bunuel begins to express his familiar themes within the commercial framework of this film from his Mexican period. The protagonist is a narcissist paranoid that loses any sense of perspective as he pursues his agenda. Also a masterful use of music and clever commentary on the Catholic church in Mexico. I was lucky to see El on TCM Latin America in Spanish. It prefigures later Bunuel films with surrealist moments yet these are well placed within the narrative. Interactions between the characters show insight into subtleties of Mexican and Spanishspeaking culture. This and El Gran Calavera are the only Mexican period Bunuel I've seen but I will seek more of them out.".

In his contemplation of where to begin his career he is contacted by Gary Winston whose character is loosely based on Bill Gates. Winston is the CEO of a company called NURV and they are on the brink of completing the global communication's system Synapse. They need Hoffman to help them meet their launch date so after much thought and with the full support of his girlfriend Alice he accepts the job. Tragedy soon after strikes and Milo becomes suspicious of the company he has been wrapped up in. He learns that trusting anyone could be a mistake and that nothing is as it seems.";

From the first 30 seconds of the preview you can pretty much tell that the opensource sidekick is marked for death and Bill Gates...I mean Gary Winston was a criminal mastermind who will do anything to get ahead in business.  I'd happy to say that while the first half of the movie went without any surprises there are enough plot twists in the 2nd half to keep you guessing who's on who's side.  Tim Robbins and Ryan Philippe both give good performances and nobody seems out of place talking about technology.  It's not the best movie I've seen this year but it definately blew away my expectations.".

So in that sense at least the writer did their job.Alas in other areas they let the team down.I like the basic premise. Tim Robbins Gary Winston as an evil Bill Gates Gary Winston  William Gates GWWG is certainly an idea that appeals to me as a an antiMicrosofter from way back. There are even a number of little injokes through the plot that pick out the GatesMicrosoft connection the artwork screens in Winston's house a character called Redmond the Dept of Justice accusations etc. And it was so nice to see so many computers on screen and not one Windows window anywhere.Into all of this comes Ryan Phillipe as a hotshot programmer  who as far as I can see never actually programs anything. He stares at a lot of code on screens and types in some pseudounix commands but I can't recall him actually coding anything. As a geek he looks the part and certainly has the introvertsocial inept bit down pat. But even geeks have other emotions.And how the hell does a guy like him get a girl like Claire Forlani?? Surely that must have sent alarm bells ringing for him early on? Yes even allowing for the plot twist half way through guys like him just don't get girls like her  because they're rarely out of the garage.Rachel Leigh Cook  stunning and wasted. There was so much more scope for her in this. And the final twist with her character at the end just was not believable. I'm glad to finally see a movie in which computers and computer programming are an essential device actually treat them with some accuracy. It's fantastic to have a fantasy in which an evil Bill Gates actually gets whats coming to him. All it needed was a little more character injected into the three main young characters and it would have worked perfectly.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK make no mistake this movie was made to convey a message. If criticised in terms of say similarity to the Firm or yet another cyber thriller then you really missed the point. The message is pretty blunt and guaranteed to anger a certain large corporation. This is not an anticorporate movie it is anti a particular corporation and if you can't guess which one maybe you should go back to exploring the Kalahari or whatever you've been doing for the last ten years. This corporation has been known to spend extraordinary resources on PR including for example bribing journalists and college professors so almost certainly some of the comments on this message board will be produced by that corporation and should be read in that light.Second while murder is a bit over the top pretty well all the other crimes committed by the large corporation in this movie are things of which the real corporation has been seriously accused been found to be planning or in some cases convicted yet in every case managing to escape with fines or compensation payments much smaller than the profits they made from the crime. That is why we hate them so much and why this movie was made. It's also obvious why the motif of murder was added some of the technical details of why their actions are pure evil are difficult for a nontechie to understand so to make the movie accessible to a wider audience they added a more blatant crime plus pyrotechnic special effects a tense chase scene love interest etc.Thirdly it is not a futuristic movie it is present day nothing in this movie is more than about 1 or 2 years in the future at most and most of it is happening now or happened several years ago.Fourthly technical realism while some of the tech stuff is rubbish hey it's a movie! the effort put into realism is dramatically good compared to information technology in any other movie I have ever seen. When we see IP's they are actual IPs but martian I guess they don't want geeks going home and whoising them! the code is all real code some HTML some C real scripting but mostly VB a language the certain large corporation is known to use a lot. The algorithms they discuss improving are even algorithms the product would really require! Not only that the product is frighteningly similar to the large corporation's actual current development path!So if you walked away from this movie thinking just for geeks or totally unrealistic you need to give yourself a good hard slap wake up and see what is really going on in the world around you. This movie was about as unrealistic and irrelevant as All the President's Men.Oh by the way I better say that all the above comments are only my personal opinions in case they try to sue me because they do do stuff like that.".

It's also obvious why the motif of murder was added some of the technical details of why their actions are pure evil are difficult for a nontechie to understand so to make the movie accessible to a wider audience they added a more blatant crime plus pyrotechnic special effects a tense chase scene love interest etc.Thirdly it is not a futuristic movie it is present day nothing in this movie is more than about 1 or 2 years in the future at most and most of it is happening now or happened several years ago.Fourthly technical realism while some of the tech stuff is rubbish hey it's a movie! the effort put into realism is dramatically good compared to information technology in any other movie I have ever seen. When we see IP's they are actual IPs but martian I guess they don't want geeks going home and whoising them! the code is all real code some HTML some C real scripting but mostly VB a language the certain large corporation is known to use a lot. The algorithms they discuss improving are even algorithms the product would really require! Not only that the product is frighteningly similar to the large corporation's actual current development path!So if you walked away from this movie thinking just for geeks or totally unrealistic you need to give yourself a good hard slap wake up and see what is really going on in the world around you. This movie was about as unrealistic and irrelevant as All the President's Men.Oh by the way I better say that all the above comments are only my personal opinions in case they try to sue me because they do do stuff like that.";

You can't look at a screen of code and tell what an entire program will do.  Huge systems are not written by one person.  The system does not know when you have finished a module and inform you that you are done.  You can't access a satellite by its IP address.

In reality most opensource advocates believe that they have an obligation to release what they have done but don't believe they have some right to other peoples work.

It's stupid.This film also avoided dealing with real issues such as antitrust violations cloning source you have add access to buying out competition and other issues that would have make this an interesting film in the same vein as Wall Street.  Instead it turns into the standard giant conspiracy story with lots and lots of guntoting bad guys.  You can tell they took the cast tossed them into a bin and pulled out the names of who would get to be the few good guys.  It's a tried and not so true plot line and it's just plain dull.

The local Burgomaster gives him a sealed briefcase left by his father and inside Wolf finds his father's scientific notes. At the manor house he meets his father's assistant Igor who has a surprise for him the monster his father created is still alive though in some sort of coma. Wolf's initial attempts to reanimate the creature seem to fail but when Peter says he saw a giant in the woods it appears he's met success.

	schema:reviewBody "With the runaway success of the reissue on a double bill of both Dracula and Frankenstein in the late nineteen thirties Universal Studios decided it was time to resurrect their most lucrative property the Frankenstein Monster if the studio was to have any chance of surviving the fiscal year. True to form they originally intended to produce nothing more than a quick cheapie to cash in on the public's renewed interest in horror films. Director Rowland V. Lee had other ideas. He envisioned the film as a modern fairy tale with Frankenstein's Monster as the traditional giant ogre stalking a primordial landscape and to be sure it is in this film that he first enters the realm of myth. To help achieve this goal he set Jack Otterson to create the most expressionistic sets of any horror film since The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. The universe of Son is a world of perpetual night and fog rain swept castles and blasted heaths terrifying flashes of lightening shadowy corridors where giants lurk hidden passage ways leading to underground crypts where time dust and the worm aren't the only things that move among the dead. Son of Frankenstein is the most visually impressive of all of Universal's horror films and George Robinson's gorgeous black and white cinematography captures every shadow every outsized distortion beautifully.This would also be the last time a Frankenstein film would have a script worthy of the subject. Willis Cooper fashioned a contemporary Grimm's fairy tale in which the journey of the film's outsiders Wolf Elsa and Peter will become progressively more nightmarish the deeper they descend where even breakfast in the morning will be overseen by a pair of monstrous gargoyles. They're journeying by train to inherit the Frankenstein estate unknown to them a house literally at the edge of Hell and these opening shots are the most normal in the entire film. They think of themselves as explorers and exploring something so foreign we can't even imagine what its like. They speak of the castle being haunted while outside the window we see through the wind and the rain a gray expanse of desolation and dead trees. What a strange country! Elsa exclaims. Their passage into the subterranean netherworld of mad doctors murderous hunchbacks and monsters has begun and will climax in a necrophilic family reunion We're all dead here. in the Frankenstein crypt in which both grandfather and father are dead but the stepbrother the monster and family black sheep is very much alive. Do you mean to imply that is my brother? Wolf asks. Igor the true Frankenstein family retainer replies Only his mother was the lightening. And it is Wolf's voyage from arrogance and ignorance Why should we fear anything! to humility and wisdom Never in my life have I known cold fear until that moment I felt his hand on my shoulder! which is central to the film.While the film is a follow up to Bride of Frankenstein it very much stands on its own. Gone are any references to the Bride and Dr Praetorious both presumably blown to atoms at the climax of that film. Also the monster doesn't speak. All traces of speech at Karloff's insistence were eliminated. The portrait of Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein dominates the castle's study and recalls the earlier films. In the scenes on the train Wolf refers to the Blunder of a stupid assistant who gave his father's creation the brain of a killer instead of a normal one. This is of course a direct reference to the first film. Karloff's return to his greatest role completes the linking of the three films. And consistent with the impressive visuals the Monster is given his most striking look. Gone is the distinctly twentieth century black garb so beloved of the Universal Frankenstein films. Instead the Monster is clothed in a crude sheepskin jersey with heavy shirt and trousers stitched together with strips of leather. Indeed his whole appearance has become that of a giant an ogre out of Grimm or Perrault. He even gets the traditional giant's club in the form of Krogh's wooden arm at the film's climax. As if to underscore this Peter gives the Monster a presenta storybook of fairy tales!The film may have the greatest horror film cast ever. There is Karloff dominating as the Monster. Given less screen time than in the previous film his scenes are still among his most powerful. To cite just two examples the scene where he rises like Lucifer out of the pit is like an image from Dante's Inferno while his primal howl of grief upon discovering the dead Igor is one of the Monster's greatest moments from any of the Frankenstein films. Bela Lugosi easily has his best role after Dracula as the broken neck hunchback Igor. Creepy roguish even pitiable one is reminded of what a fine actor he could be with a role worthy of his talent. Lionel Atwill with his beautifully clipped vocal delivery and sardonic sense of humor has his definitive screen role as the one arm Inspector Krogh he doesn't miss any opportunity for scene stealing bits of business with that wooden arm. And there is Basil Rathbone as Wolf. He doesn't have Karloff's makeup or Lugosi's broken neck or Atwill's wooden arm but he gives a fullblooded commanding performance that refuses to get lost in this who's who of cinematic ghouls. William K. Everson once said that only a truly great actor can get away with a little deliberate ham now and then and if Rathbone is a little over the top it is ham well seasoned and served and adds enormously to the enjoyment of the film. Finally Frank Skinner's incredible film score would set the standard for Universal's horror films for the next decade.".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly Good Sequel";
	schema:reviewBody "Usually the third film in a series shows signs of decline either in quality or inventiveness. Even the third 'Godfather' was significantly less than its predecessors. Universal's 'Frankenstein' series that began in the early 1930's was no exception and showed some wear by the end of the decade when 'Son of Frankenstein' was released. Under the sensitive direction of James Whale the original 'Frankenstein' was a classic and in the first sequel 'Bride of Frankenstein' Whale even managed to better it. However while Whale was not involved with 'Son' the third installment turned out to be a surprisingly good movie even if it failed to match the two preceding films. Perhaps the major reason for the success of 'Son' was the casting of Basil Rathbone as Wolf Frankenstein the original Baron's son. Rathbone is a fine strong actor and his characterization certainly exceeds Colin Clive's somewhat colorless portrayal of his father in the preceding films. Rathbone holds the viewer's attention throughout as he becomes immersed in the legacy of his father and fails to comprehend the consequences of what he is doing. Boris Karloff returns for a third time as the monster. Although he does a fine job there is less opportunity for the actor to show the range of emotion in this film that he displayed in 'Bride.' Another aspect of 'Son' that raises it above the ordinary is the set and lighting design which owes a debt to German expressionism. The sets have bold diagonals in their construction and the cameraman has lit them to cast equally bold shadows against bare walls and create abstract patterns that often recall 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.' The lighting and design of one particular section of a cave under the Frankenstein laboratory could have been blown up and framed as an expressionist photograph. Although it does not reach the heights of the Whale films 'Son of Frankenstein' is a worthy successor and an engrossing film in its own right.".

	schema:reviewBody "Series note I strongly recommend that you watch the Frankenstein films to this point in order. Each builds on the events of the previous entry and will have much more meaning and significance if watched in order. The first film is Frankenstein 1931 and the second is Bride of Frankenstein 1935.The third film in Universal's Frankenstein series Son of Frankenstein is set after the first two film's Henry Frankenstein has passed away. Baron Wolf von Frankenstein Basil Rathbone Henry's son is on his way to claim his inheritance from his father and receives a nottoowarm welcome from the small German town that has been frightened out of its wits by Henry's doings with monsters. While staying at the family castle Wolf opens a box containing his father's research records and a note from his father encouraging him to follow in the same footsteps. He initially believes he's not worthy of such encouragement but becoming a mad doctor may be easier than he thinks.In both the overall tone of the film and in the tone of Boris Karloff's last turn as The Monster Son of Frankenstein is much more closely allied with James Whale's first Frankenstein film rather than the campfest that was Bride of Frankenstein. New series director Rowland V. Lee has everything played various seriously even Bela Lugosi's Ygor which could have easily become funny intentionally so or not.Adding to the atmosphere are the sets which are just as grand in their own way as anything in either of Whale's two Frankenstein films. This time around the expressionist influence is at its strongest but it is combined with a prescient minimalism. While the first two films had strong surrealist visual touches combined with their expressionism Son of Frankenstein dispenses altogether with any concerns of approaching realism or naturalism. The idea here instead is to create starkness and shadows often with a maximum of intentional artificiality. It's an appropriate approach that both pays homage to the earlier films and reflects the plot of the present filmshadows are an offspring of their parent objects and the monster is an artificial man. The production and set design of the film is even more remarkable when one realizes that art directors of the era routinely worked on many films at once. Son of Frankenstein's Art Director Jack Otterson for example worked on over 50 films in 1942 alone! It's a rare treat to have three genre icons the caliber of Rathbone Karloff and Lugosi together in one film. They mesh exquisitely managing to enhance each other's performances with no one upstaging anyone else. Lionel Atwill as Inspector Krogh easily holds his own with the trio although any fan of Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein 1974 is sure to laugh at occasional moments involving Krogh since he is so perfectly spoofed in Brooks' film as does the beautiful Josephine Hutchinson as Frankenstein's wife Elsa named after the woman who played The Bride in the previous film Elsa Lanchester and Donnie Dunagan as their son Peter.Lugosi's Ygor was supposedly improvised then written into the filmLugosi was originally slated to play a policeman. This is remarkable in that his shepherd character and relationship to The Monster are so well integrated. The Monster symbolically wears a heavy woolen vestsmock and has a deeply symbiotic relationship with Ygor that is the core of the film. Ygor is also undead in his own way.While Son of Frankenstein is not nearly as epic as the first two films it should not be. Its aim is to unfold more like a stage play with highly abstract symbolic sets and finely integrated performances from a skilled cast. As such it is every bit as good as the first two films in the series.".

	schema:reviewBody "Son of Frankenstein is the third installment of Universal's long running Frankenstein series. It is also the longest running at 92 minutes and was given the biggest budget of all the Frankenstein films. Apparently Universal wanted this film to be their showpiece for 1939 and actually planned to film it in color. Unfortunately the monster's makeup photographed a pale green and they went back to the old reliable black and white. With all the hoopla and first rate cast this film comes up short of the first two in the series. The story picks up some years after the first two. Baron Wolf von Frankenstein Basil Rathbone the son of Henry his wife Elsa Josephine Hutchinson and young son Peter Donnie Dunagon return to the family castle. The village resents him having not forgotten the carnage created by his father's creation. Lurking about the castle is the mysterious Ygor Bela Lugosi who harbors a deadly secret. Frankenstein confronts Ygor who shows him that the monster Boris Karloff created by his father did not perish. Ygor explains that He is my friend...he does things for me. We then learn that several prominent villagers have been mysteriously murdered and that the killer remains at large. Frankenstein gets his creative juices flowing and agrees to restore the monster to his full potential. Unknown to Frankenstein the monster has been in contact with his son and has been moving about. A suspicious police inspector Lionel Atwill begins to watch Frankenstein's movements. Realizing that Ygor is in control of the monster the Baron confronts him and..... Director Rowland V. Lee takes over from James Whale as director and seems to favor dark shadowy geometric designs for his set pieces. Gone are the classic gothic creepy settings of the first two films. What we have are a sparsely furnished barn of a castle and only remnants of the glorious laboratories of the earlier films. This was the final appearance for Karloff as the monster. Here he is given little to do except to be Ygor's henchman. He no longer talks and invokes no pathos whatsoever. Rathbone is way over the top as usual as the Baron. Lugosi in his best part in years steals the film. He is the real villain of the piece. Given the time of the film Lionel Atwill's character seems to be a lampoon of a German officer. And poor old Dwight Frye wasted again appears in the crowd as a villager. After this film the series would degenerate into B status with running times of just over an hour.".

A suspicious police inspector Lionel Atwill begins to watch Frankenstein's movements. Realizing that Ygor is in control of the monster the Baron confronts him and..... Director Rowland V. Lee takes over from James Whale as director and seems to favor dark shadowy geometric designs for his set pieces. Gone are the classic gothic creepy settings of the first two films. What we have are a sparsely furnished barn of a castle and only remnants of the glorious laboratories of the earlier films. This was the final appearance for Karloff as the monster. Here he is given little to do except to be Ygor's henchman. He no longer talks and invokes no pathos whatsoever. Rathbone is way over the top as usual as the Baron. Lugosi in his best part in years steals the film. He is the real villain of the piece. Given the time of the film Lionel Atwill's character seems to be a lampoon of a German officer. And poor old Dwight Frye wasted again appears in the crowd as a villager. After this film the series would degenerate into B status with running times of just over an hour.";

	schema:headline " Or...The Legend of the Frankenstein Monster!";
	schema:reviewBody "'Frankenstein' and 'Bride of...' pretty much told a complete story. And the story was fashioned in such a way that the viewer is watching the events as they unfold. As the events unfold the story shifts from the torment of the creator Frankenstein to the torment of the creation the Monster.Now in 'Son of...' the emphasis is shifted back to the scientist. And Karloff no longer has a monopoly on the role of the 'Back From the Dead' he shares that with Lugosi's 'Ygor'. Nor does he have the monopoly on the 'Artificial Human' he shares that spot with Atwill's onearmed 'Inspector Krogh'. Nor does he possess his personality that was gradually evolving in the first two entries. The Monster has been reduced to a hulking henchman bound to the will of the evil Ygor. The 'Monster turned pawn' had actually begun in 'Bride of...' as Pretorious used him to force Frankenstein to create the Monster's mate. You could almost say that the Monster was used as a tool for Henry Frankenstein to play God a tool for Pretorious' dream to create a new race and a tool for Ygor's desire for revenge on the jurors who condemned him to the hangman's noose. The difference in 'Son of...' is that the Monster no longer evolves and the character is left with no where to go.But this is still a fascinating film. Director Lee replaces realistic sets and background with surrealism. Details from the first two films are abandoned for light background and twisted gargantuan shadows. And much of some great action setpieces have already occurred off screen before the movie begins. Which means we're left with alot of talk of 'what was' and 'what happened before'. Which kind of fits into the definition of what a legend constitutes. Fortunately the actors doing the talking are Rathbone Lugosi and Atwill. Even Rathbone's over the top performance can be forgiven knowing his next film? was his signature  debut role as Sherlock Holmes in 'Hound of the Baskervilles' a role he was absolutely brilliant in.Even though Karloff has a much reduced role the gigantic sets dead trees and slanted architecture compels the viewer to be constantly aware of his lurking menace. It is this approach that standing on its own makes this a fine film. The viewer is forced to rely on imagination more than the first two movies put together. It is certainly a more polished film than the original. And Lugosi and Atwill's support acting are leagues above the wooden Mae Clarke John Boles and Valerie Hobson. Like the Monster tis better to have been made than never to have been made at all. We would have missed out on all that fun.7 out of 10 !  One of my favorite 'Frankenstein' films.".

Wolf's father created a monster that terrorized the community and the townsfolk want no more of that. Wolf assures everyone that he has no intentions of creating a monster. But when Wolf finds Ygor Bela Lugosi living in the ruins of his father's laboratory he is soon headed down the same path of destruction that claimed his father.Over the years there have been volumes written on the Universal classic horror movies. Realizing that it would be foolish of me to attempt to improve or add much to the writings of these scholars I'll instead focus on a couple of areas that make Son of Frankenstein so special to me.1. The Acting. Son of Frankenstein features a Who's Who of the best of the classic horror actors. Joining Rathbone and Lugosi in the cast are Boris Karloff and Lionel Atwill. While each gives a noteworthy performance in their own right Lugosi's performance is generally held up as the best of his career. And while I agree Rathbone makes Son of Frankenstein a joy for me to watch. There are very few actors that I can think of who could have played Wolf with the same type of intelligent energy that Rathbone exhibits. He's wonderful. As for Karloff I'm glad he decided to make Son of Frankenstein his last as the monster. By the time of the second sequel Karloff's monster became little more that a prop for Lugosi Rathbone and Atwill to fight over.2. The Sets. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the sets in Son of Frankenstein are among the best I've ever seen. The sets are amazing with their bizarre angles and shadows. Two that immediately come to mind are the dining table set and the staircase set at the beginning of the movie. They are in a class of their own.Every fan of horror or just good classic movies in general owes it to themselves to see Son of Frankenstein. It may not be as well known among the casual fan as either Frankenstein or Bride of Frankenstein but it many ways it's the equal of those two films if not better.".

The Great Basil Rathbone now played Baron Henry Frankenstein's son who would journey to his homeland to claim his inheritance.Rathbone is Baron Wolf von Frankenstein and his wife is Baroness Elsa von FrankensteinJosephine Hutchinson who have a little boy.Rowland V. Lee is the Director of this film and has made what is considered to be the darkest and most germanic film in the series.The village is now known as Frankenstein and the villagers are hateful even when Rathbone tries to reach out to them by making a passionate speech regretting what has happened to them and his Father having been responsible for the creation of the Monster...but it's to no avail as the Burgomeister says to this Baron von Frankensteinwe come to meet you not to greet you. Colin Clive would be seen in the series only in clips now from the first two films he was in because he'd expired in 1937.IronicallyBasil Rathbone was in real life older than the man who'd played his Father with this Son Of Frankenstein having been born in 1892 and Colin Clive in 1900. The old watchtower is now on the Frankenstein estate where Rathbone's character goes and explores one morning.It is inside this old structure that he meets Bela Lugosi's greatest role of all timethe evil Ygor.A shaggy Lugosi with a moustachebeard having a broken neck and speaking with a gravelly voice in broken English leads Rathbone to a secret crypt in the old watchtower where Baron Wolf von Frankenstein sees where his FatherBaron Heinrich von Frankensteinbetter known as Henry and his Grandfather are now buried. As Wolf and Ygor walk farther into this crypt he discovers the Frankenstein MonsterBoris Karloff in a comatose state.In this scenethe Monster flinches as Rathbone's Baron von Frankenstein screams out in shockHe's Alive! ...proving he has the same great Frankenstein blood flowing through his veins as that of Colin Clive. This film is this writer's favorite of the Karloff and Lugosi films with Basil Rathbone and Lionel Atwill as Inspector Krogh giving excellent performances as well. The world that these character's live in this film is the most unreal of any in the series.It's always overcast or foggy with enormous dead trees that Karloff's Monster topples over while he goes about doing Ygor's bidding.Josephine Hutchinson had said that sheRathbone and Lionel Atwill had found the movie hard to take seriously which may explain why Rathbone is delightfully hammy at times.But don't get this writer wrong I LOVE THIS FILM AND CONSIDER IT AN ALL TIME CLASSIC. Lionel Atwill is excellent as Inspector Krogh who had his arm pulled off by the Monster as a child and makes a point with it in numerous scenes throughout this movie. But Karloff and Lugosi work excellently together seeming to be the absolute closest of friends as Monster and the evil Ygor.Boris Karloff left this series on truly a high note . Son Of Frankenstein is one of the greatest movies ever made.The Great Boris Karloff would return to the Universal series one last time in 1944 in House Of Frankenstein to play the mad scientist Dr.Gustav Niemann...and he makes the most of this evil character too.".

Seeing the three of them in one shot gave me a special feeling these three guys are among the biggest screen legends of all time.Basil Rathbone is always a big pleasure to watch in a movie he was a true great 'classic' actor. Bela Lugosi was almost unrecognizable in his role as Ygor and he played his character with lots of passion. Unfortunately the age was showing for Karloff. He was well over 50 years old when he played the Frankenstein monster for the last time in this movie. His 'old' age is truly notable even through his makeup. I think it was a good thing that he never played the famous classic horror character again after this movie.The story is still interesting enough to make this movie original even though the depth and emotions of the previous two Frankenstein movies is missing.It's a bit strange that the first two Frankenstein movies with Karloff are very well known but this movie is not. This movie is truly excellent and should deserve so more recognition and appreciation. The atmosphere is just as good as from the previous two movies and the monster is still one powerful horror character even though his role is rather limited compared to the first two movies. This time the real main part is Baron Wolf von Frankenstein played by Basil Rathbone. Some people might be disappointed by this but being a fan of Rathbone I'm not complaining about this.The movie has enough originality and the story is surely interesting enough to call this movie a worthy addition to the Frankenstein movie legacy.

The townspeople get excited a couple die and mayhem takes over.  This movie is aboveaverage for a number of reasons.  First and foremost it is a highly stylized movie in the German impressionistic manner.  The sets are incredible and director Rowland Lee spares little in showing us his appreciation of movies such as Nosferatu and Caligari.  The castle is a huge atmospheric temple and each room is just as big in its own way.  This is the film that inspired most of Mel Brook's Young Frankenstein both in look and plot.  The plot is good but the acting carries it beyond that.  Karloff as always does a great job in his final role as the monster.  Rathbone makes a great scientist trying to avenge his father's name.  He starts the movie very relaxed and his tension builds and builds.  His scenes with Atwill are his best.  That brings us to the two great performances of the film...Lionel Atwill and Bela Lugosi.  Lugosi as Ygor is perhaps his greatest role after Dracula.  His voice his leers his manner are all wonderfully played.  It is Lugosi that steals every scene he is in.  That is not bad because Lionel Atwill steals every scene he is inthe two have no scenes together.  Atwill brings life into his role as an inspector with a wooden arm.  Atwill has grace and charm and a generous dose of humour.  This is his best role as far as I am concerned.  Just listening to him give his speech about his encounter with the monster as a child is at one hand chilling and at the other emotional.  Son of Frankenstein deservedly ranks as one of the great Universal horror pictures.  It is not as good as The Bride of Frankenstein but looks better than any of the Universal horror pictures.  And that is as great a compliment as any!".

	schema:reviewBody "Son of Frankenstein Universal 1939 directed by Rowland V. Lee marked a new beginning to the second cycle of Universal horror a lavish stylish stagy production as well as the longest 94 minutes movie in the FRANKENSTEIN series. Boris Karloff returns for the third and final time as The Monster but unfortunately after such a grand performance in The Bride of Frankenstein 1935 in which Karloff got star billing The Monster in this production is of secondary importance coming late into the story and spending more than half the film lying in an unconscious state on an operating table inside the lab. Star billing goes to Basil Rathbone as Baron Wolf Von Frankenstein the son of the scientist who brought nothing but misery in the German town but the scene stealer in this production happens to be Bela Lugosi almost unrecognizable as the bearded character of Ygor possibly his best performance in his latter day career. It features Lugosi in a performance unlike anything he has done thus far and he virtually helps the story along especially during its numerous slow spots. This also marked his fourth teaming opposite Karloff but this time Lugosi outshines Karloff's performance. Then there is Lionel Atwill another horror film veteran making his debut in the series playing a one armed police inspector another interesting presence to the story.The story set in a Gothic German village finds Wolf Von Frankenstein Basil Rathbone returning by train to the town where his parents once lived. He is accompanied by his charming wife Elsa Josephine Hutchinson and their little boy Peter Donnie Donegan. Wolf hopes to make amends to the villagers from what his late father had done creating a Monster who terrorized their village years ago and become their good neighbors but with the Frankenstein name the family is cursed and nobody wants anything to do with them. The Frankensteins are first met by Inspector Krough Atwill a police official with an artificial arm claiming to have lost his real arm when he was a young boy when the Monster ripped from his body by the roots but in spite of all this Krough is on duty to aide the Frankensteins in case trouble amongst the villagers prevails. Also in the castle where the Frankensteins are staying are Aunt Amelia Emma Dunn and Thomas Benson the butler Edgar Norton.While the movie starts off rather slowly it then comes to life when Wolf encounters Ygor Bela Lugosi a crazed bearded shepherd who was once or twice sentenced and hanged for grave robbing and still lives. Ygor is also the master of the Monster Karloff who does things for him. His coma condition happens to be a result of an aftereffect of being struck by lightning and Ygor calls on Wolf to help revive the monster.Son of Frankenstein is more of a science fiction nature than horror since the movie spends a great deal of footage in the laboratory having Frankenstein examining his father's creation and how this physical being has survived such ordeals after finding his heart containing two bullets etc. But after Karloff's monster is revived he manages to present himself with some key scenes such as looking at himself in the mirror and pulling Wolf along side him as a comparison and the Monster's fondness of children especially Wolf's little boy who fears him not.The storyline however contradicts what had been said and done in previous movies such as letting the Monster who had learned to talk in The Bride of ... resorting back to only grunts. It even fails to explain how the Monster had survived his demise from the earlier film. And what's the deal with the woolly garment he is wearing? In spite of these drastic changes the movie itself is full of characters ranging from Lionel Bellmore the Burgomaster in 1931's Frankenstein now playing Emile Lang along with Gustav Von Seyffertitz the villainous Grimes in the 1926 silent classic Sparrows as one of the jurors. While Colin Clive's Frankenstein character allowed himself to become hysterical in the first two entries viewers expect and accept this but when Rathbone's character calls for him to do the same especially during the dart playing sequence with Krough this somewhat becomes embarrassing to sit through in spite that Rathbone is a very capable actor who seldom overacts as he does here.While not on the same scale as James Whale's earlier carnations of the Frankenstein films Son of Frankenstein is still watchable mainly because of its Universal staff players and added sound effects of thunder and lightning as well as very moody setting made to the comforts of home for the Frankenstein family. The underscoring by Frank Skinner introduced here would be heard time and time again in other Universal horror films of the 1940s. This movie played on numerous cable channels including the SciFi Channel American Movie Classics 1991 and again from 2000 to 2002 2006 and finally on Turner Classic Movies where it premiered in January 2003. It can also be found as a videoDVD purchase or rental. ".

	schema:headline " The Monster That Revived Horror at Universal";
	schema:reviewBody "In the mid30s Universal saw a change in management and slowly moved away from the horror genre. In 1938 however theaters in the states began showing a successful double bill of Dracula and FRANKENSTEIN which revived interest. Naturally Universal saw this publicity opportunity and went to work on a new monster movie. The success of this movie would lead to relaunching of all three of their original monsters in the years to come after.Of those three monster series FRANK Dracula and MUMMY the Frankenstein flicks seems to make the most sense in terms of continuity. Yes there are plenty of plot points that seem to conveniently forget anything that has come before but for the most part each movie picks up where the previous left off.This movie is nowhere near the classic that the first two entries in the series are probably owing to the loss of director James Whale. It's lacking the Gothic shadows and electrical mad science lab feel of the original. Gone are the whimsical humor though maybe not a bad thing and humanization of the monster from BRIDE. Instead we get a less atmospheric sequel focused more on an evil new character the son of Frankenstein slowly descending into hysteria and more violence and murder.The best additions are the two new actors. Bela Lugosi plays Ygor for the first time here and is remarkable. I am a huge Lugosi geek even loving his poverty row cheapies but the majority of the time he plays the same character in different clothes. Here we have his most fully realized character since Dracula. Ygor is an evil little man hellbent on revenge for a botched execution. Lugosi plays the role well even using a voice acting that almost eliminates traces of his accent. The other addition is Basil Rathbone as Wolf Von Frankenstein. He does a very admirable job of running through a range of emotion. At first humbled by guilt for the sins of his father his discovery of the monster leads to the same fervent fever for creation of life that overtook his dad. Eventually as he realizes the implications of his actions he begins a descent into hysteria that only culminates in the finale of the movie as he atones for those actions.The monster is a disappointment though. In the first movie we got a sense of his complicated nature as we see the innocence as well as the monster to fear. In BRIDE he begins to talk and really develop as a sympathetic creature. All of that is gone here. He is essentially a minion of Ygor sent to do his bidding and we only briefly see glimpses of his humanity. Of course this is Karloff's last appearance as the monster and it would continue to devolve in the following movies.This is definitely one of the better Universal sequels and would prove to be the last time Universal sank a large budget into one of their horror offerings. From here they are all strictly b class.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wolf von Frankenstein Basil Rathbone the son of Henry Frankenstein from the first two films has returned to Europe from America to inherit his father's castle. He brings along his wife and young son. They are greeted coldly by the local villagers who are suspicious of anyone bearing the Frankenstein name. Their suspicions are soon justified when Frankenstein meets Ygor Bela Lugosi a graverobber who has a deformed neck due to a botched hanging. Ygor takes Wolf to the comatose body of the monster Boris Karloff his father created and the son decides to follow in his father's footsteps by reviving the creature.The third film in Universal's Frankenstein series and the first without James Whale. It's a terrific movie that adds a lot to the Frankenstein mythos particularly Ygor. It doesn't get as much respect as the first two Frankenstein films but it really should. It's just as creative and influential. The plots of the Frankenstein sequels that followed would owe more to this film than its predecessors. It would also be the primary source for the Mel Brooks parody movie Young Frankenstein. Rowland V. Lee's direction is impressive and he more than proves himself worthy to follow in the footsteps of Whale. The music by Frank Skinner is wonderful. I love the Expressionistic sets. The cast is one of the finest Universal ever assembled. Horror legends Bela Lugosi and Lionel Atwill both have roles here that are career highlights. Lugosi's Ygor is often touted as his best acting performance something that is very hard to argue against. Atwill's woodenarmed Inspector Krogh is undeniably memorable and might be his finest role as well. For his part Basil Rathbone plays the part of Wolf brilliantly but he doesn't get much respect from critics who call him hammy. To me he's never over the top or distracting in his performance. If he's hammy it's with a precision that many actors could learn from. This was Boris Karloff's final turn as the monster in the Frankenstein series. While he's given less to work with than the last film he still manages to create a sympathetic and human monster. The subsequent actors taking on the role would pretty much play the monster as a mindless hulking creature with little personality. When it comes to actors portraying Frankenstein's monster there's Boris Karloff and then there's everybody else far down the list. The only oddity in the cast is Donnie Dunagan the little boy playing Frankenstein's son. He was from the American South so he has this noticeable accent that stands out as well as being a pretty poor little actor. He flubs several lines. Still for avid fans like myself there's a certain charm to his quirky casting. Perhaps it's because so many of the Universal horrors took place in a blended 19th20th century fictional world with actors of various nationalities all playing countrymen.Son of Frankenstein serves as a perfect finish to the series. Yes there are more sequels but those films while very entertaining are not on the level of the original three masterpieces. The trilogy of Frankenstein Bride and Son are among the finest most creative films Universal put out regardless of genre. There is genuine artistry on display in these three films. While the first two get an appropriate amount of respect and praise I can't help but feel this one gets the short end of the stick. It's really a fantastic movie and one of my favorites of the entire Universal horror catalogue.".

After enjoying Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein I feared Son Of Frankenstein would be a poor attempt to bring in a few extra dollars using the Frankenstein franchise. Boy was I wrong! I found this to be the best of the Frankenstein films. For the first time the motivation of a mad scientist is explained. Previously audiences were not given a reason for Henry Frankenstein's madness. This time they learn that Wolf von Frankenstein seeks to vindicate his father's work. The monster has never looked better either. He wears a sheep skin pancho that gives him an even grimmer appearance. Bela Lugosi really shines as Ygor who has befriended the monster. Inspector Krogh is a great addition to the cast as a fair but cautious lawman. I feel this film was the peak of the Frankenstein movies as it seems Ghost of Frankenstein and House of Frankenstein did not match the quality of Son of Frankenstein.".

	schema:reviewBody "SON OF FRANKENSTEIN marks the last appearance of Boris Karloff as the Frankenstein monster and it's easy to see why he started to feel unhappy with the character . Where as in BRIDE he gave a memorable performance bathed in pathos here he merely becomes an instrument for Ygor . It's also at this point you notice how clumsy the studio are to continuity . Where as in the previous film the monster has the power of speech here his vocal communication begins and ends with grunts and groans . This clumsy  dare one say ignorant  lack of continuity would dog Universal through the rest of their FRANKENSTEIN franchise SON is a very mixed bag . One thing noticeable is that war with Germany is on the horizon and America was far less neutral than she was during the last one hence the need for Frankenstein's son to be Anglinised . It's interesting to see the native German characters being both Teutonic and suspicious of outsiders . There's also a noticeable scene where a spy can be easily bought . You can't trust these Germans  especially if they're poised to invade the rest of Europe Director Rowland V Lee isn't really in the same class as James Whale but does bring a directorial touch to the film . The sets are expansive and impressive and he makes good use of shadow lighting which gives the movie a bleak mood . Unlike the previous two films there does seem to be a large lack of studio exteriors which might make the film more claustrophobic but also makes it appear more static too He does have an erratic time with the cast though . Bela Lugosi is best remembered as Dracula but as Ygor he probably gives a lifetime best performance and he's the standout character of the film . Karloff is less good because the screenplay by Wyllis Cooper makes him an archetypal monster   Though it's interesting to see a reference that erroneously confuses the monster with the creator  a mistake that lasts to this day  while Donnie Dunnigan as Peter is like most child actors from the period bloody irritating whilst Basil Rathbone as Baron Frankenstein over acts every time he's supposed to nervous All in all this is a rather uneven film  more so if you've seen either of the first two films very recently . It continues the standard by the earlier FRANKENSTEIN films by blending chills and off beat humour   You spat on me    No I didn't I was clearing my throat   but shows flaws that become more and more apparent in later films of the franchise of poor continuity and having the monster as literally a monster . You can see why Karloff went off to pastures new".

You won't soon forget Lionel Atwill here as the Burgonmeister having been offscreen maimed by the monster when he as a boy had his entire arm ripped off from its socket.The Frankenstein castle looks nothing like it did in either one of the two films its interior decoration looking like something more out of The Lion in Winter than the early 1800's. Basil Rathbone adds on much authority to the morally torn son of the original Dr. Frankenstein with Josephine Hutchinson equally as disgusted as her unseen motherinlaw Elizabeth over Rathbone's obsession with his father's work. The film really makes an effort not to outdo the original in horrors but expand on the story and even give hints of dangers with the European political atmosphere of the late 1930's. Although much longer than the first two entries it never lags in pacing and for that the results are a third installment that retains an A status soon to be reduced to B's with its followups that just got sillier and sillier.".

It also contains the live body of the monster known as Frankenstein Boris Karloff who has been seriously injured. After a thorough examination and at the urging of Ygor he decides to bring the monster out of his comatose state. Things begin to spiral quickly out of control after that. Anyway this is the third film in this series and while it might not be up to the same high standards of Frankenstein and The Bride of Frankenstein it still packs a decent enough punch.

	schema:reviewBody "People seem surprised that this is a rather good third film in the Frankenstein series. But I'm not surprised since the original was made in 1931 and this sequel in 1939. Film and sound had undergone tremendous improvements in those 8 years...keep in mind that 1939 was the crowning glory of the all incolor Gone With The Wind. This film was to be made in color as well but apparently they just couldn't get the color of the monster's face reasonable.We aren't told how many years have transpired since the monster was created and destroyed or was it? but you do see a car in this film and the inspector Lionel Atwill  whose arm was torn off by the monster when he the inspector was a boy appears to be around 50 years old. Baron Wolf von Frankenstein Basil Rathbone  the son of the creator of the monster  takes his wife the marvelous Josephine Hutchinson and young son Donnie Dunagan back to the village where it all began to claim his inheritance. Unfortunately Rathbone decides to also redeem his father's reputation. But the villagers still hate everything to do with Frankenstein.One day Rathbone stumbles upon Ygor Bla Lugosi a crazy old blacksmith who survived being hung for graverobbing...deformed neck and all. They then find the monster  in a coma  in a crypt. Rathbone decides to revive the monster to vindicate his father. The monster seems to have an affection for Ygor and murders at his command  all jurors at Ygor's trial. In a fight between Rathbone and Ygor Ygor is shot and the monster decides to kidnap Rahtbone's son as revenge. But a more gentle side of the monster prevails and he does not harm the child. Cleverly the monster is cornered and in the battle it tears out the inspector's false arm. Rahtbone manages to save his son by knocking the monster into a boiling sulfur pit.As the film closes the villagers cheer the Frankenstein family as they leave by train. Is this the end of Ricco...I mean Frankenstein? Of course not but that is for future sequels! Make no mistake this film focuses on Basil Rathbone and he definitely brings some class to the story line although his acting is a little over the top when things begin going wrong late in the film. But it's rather nice seeing him in a role where he is  for the most part  the good guy. As far as Boris Karloff goes he does nothing but lie there comatose for the first half of the film and then  finally  he rolls one eyeball. He does no real acting as it were until a full hour into the 1 hour and 39 minute film. It is no wonder that he chose to make this his last appearance as the movie monster for many years. Bela Lagosi is bearable here in part because his face is covered with a scruffy beard. Other character actors do their jobs with special note being given to Lionel Atwill. A particularly nice touch is when Atwill and Rathbone are playing darts and Atwill holds his darts by sticking them into his wooden arm! This is a good horror film and well worth watching. The sets are stark and dramatic and really aid the film. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rowland V. Lee takes over the directing reigns from James Whale for this entertaining entry in the Universal series. Basil Rathbone is great fun in the title role Baron Wolf von Frankenstein who comes to claim his inheritance upon the passing of his father and in no time flat causes no end of problems trying to clear the family name. He finds that the Monster Boris Karloff in his final performance in the part is still alive but not doing well and that the evil Ygor Bela Lugosi in one of his best ever performances an evil body snatcher who managed to survive a hanging and a resulting broken neck has a powerful hold on the Monster and that it is doing Ygor's bidding all in the name of vengeance. Son of Frankenstein is notable for a number of things. To start with it has good atmosphere as so many Universal horror films of the '30s and '40s did but it takes place in a more modern setting with Lee taking away some of the Gothic trappings of their other productions. We do still see wonderful lab sets a foul looking sulphur pit which we know will have to be paid off at some point and the standard issue angry villagers although by this point the set up is familiar and rather formulaic. We know without a doubt that Wolf is going to be intrigued with his father's work too intrigued for his own good and that he will spend too much time trying to rehabilitate the Monster rather than just finding a way to end its suffering and saving everybody a whole lot of trouble. What makes Son of Frankenstein something worth savouring are the ingenious characters of Ygor whom Lugosi plays to the hilt and the tough stolid Inspector Krogh a onearmed policeman portrayed with conviction by the always delightful Lionel Atwill fans automatically recognize that this is the character that inspired Kenneth Mars's Inspector Kemp in Mel Brooks's Young Frankenstein. A decent supporting cast also helps including Josephine Hutchinson as Wolfs' lovely wife Elsa and old pros like Lionel Belmore and Michael Mark. Unfortunately the Monster just doesn't get to do too much this time around as the accent is largely placed on both Wolf and Ygor. But it's still a treat to see Karloff in the role and the interplay between Rathbone and Atwill is great as we see Krogh constantly regarding Wolf with some suspicion even though he has sworn to protect him from the presumptuous villagers and as Wolf racked by guilt starts acting in an antagonistic manner toward the Inspector. Clocking in at 100 minutes pretty long for a genre film during this period when they usually came in under 80 minutes the story is pretty involved and enjoyable enough that the time goes by quickly enough. The finale is reasonably exciting stuff and getting there is fun too. Eight out of 10.".

Clocking in at 100 minutes pretty long for a genre film during this period when they usually came in under 80 minutes the story is pretty involved and enjoyable enough that the time goes by quickly enough. The finale is reasonably exciting stuff and getting there is fun too. Eight out of 10.";

Actually the monster may be the most normal looking critter in the place.Credit set design and art direction for these unforgettable assets. Looks to me like Universal just left the sound stage floor bare and concentrated on the rest. And if there's a chair anywhere in the furnishings I couldn't spot it. But who cares given the surreal effect. And catch that fiery pit that also serves as a doorway down to somewhere. It looks straight out of Dante's Inferno another great effect.I guess my only reservation is with an overheated Basil Rathbone of all people. No cool and calculating Sherlock here. In fact by the end he's almost chewing the scenery. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it. I know he didn't like horror movies IMDB so maybe he thought getting overexcited would be a fun departure from his usual icy composure. Anyway this has to be one of the most visually stunning of all horror movies and shows what lots of imagination can do even without much money.".

Some consider this Lugosi's best role despite his being more well known for playing Dracula. Lugosi has been known to dip into camp but this is not camp and it is a great makeup job as well.Lionel Atwill is Krogh the local cop. Howard Maxford says that this film is sometimes unintentionally funny due to Mel Brooks and I presume that the character of Krogh is what he has in mind when he says that.Mike Mayo correctly says the acting carries the film with Lugosi seldom better Karloff excellent and Rathbone and Atwill never upstaged.

	schema:reviewBody "If there is any significance at all in the third chapter of the longrunning Frankenstein movie series it is that it brought together the two most iconic and famous vintage horror movie stars and one of the greatest hero actors to oppose them. The movie stars Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes as thelike the title suggeststhe son of Dr. Frankenstein who was played by Colin Clive in the first two movies. The son of Frankenstein while investigating the decimated ruins of his father's old laboratory comes upon the comatose remains of the Frankenstein monster still played by Boris Karloff. In addition the living corpse of Ygor played by Bela Lugosi Dracula keeps a close eye on his halfliving halfdead companion and uses the new Dr. Frankenstein to return life to the greenskinned creature.Son of Frankenstein is not a very significant horror movie and is not in the same league as the first two movies of the series but in comparison to a great many of the sequels that followed it does stand out as one of the few passable entries. I enjoyed this twice as much as I did the 1994 adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein Rathbone Karloff and Lugosi are all very good in this film. I also liked Lionel Atwill as the onearmed mustached inspector trying to find out what's going on. I also liked the touch of how the villagers have prejudicially turned on Baron Wolf Frankenstein on account of what his father created before him.Now what I did not like and what cost the movie what was potentially a higher rating was the long moments of dead space in between the monster sequences. Karloff does not have very much to do in this film he mostly just lies around or stands around. I also did not find the selfdestruction approach of Basil Rathbone's character like I did the one with Colin Clive in the first two Frankenstein pictures. The most interesting thing in the movie is Lugosi as Ygor and it does rival his performance in Dracula 1931. It's just a shame his performance here wasn't in a better more significant film.Nevertheless on the whole I did enjoy Son of Frankenstein and found it a lot more pleasing than a lot of the absurdly ridiculous followups that came after it. No it's not in the same league as the original Frankenstein 1931 or the surprisingly wonderful Bride of Frankenstein 1935 but very few horror movies are. But it is at the same time a missed opportunity and will probably only work for the fans. I recommend it for three things Rathbone Karloff and Lugosi.".

Bill Dean and Grace Cave are all too believable as the aforementioned mother and father and are true screen monsters.  Despite never believing that they are in the wrong neither of the oh so reasonable parents are able to see beyond the end of their noses.This film does have some touching moments but alas the ending is not a happy one. Which is especially a shame as the film does occasionally allow a faint glimmer of hope shine through.".

	schema:headline " The pressures of meeting conventional standards !!!";
	schema:reviewBody "The opening credits for Ken Loach's 'Family Life' are accompanied by a montage of still shots of an industrial working class British town to establish the setting and backdrop of the narrative. During this montage we get an image of a straight line of houses in the neighbourhood. I think from a certain angle that image is expressive of the struggles that the protagonist Janice goes through in the film. The houses stacking up one after the other in a rigid line is thematically similar to the what Janice's parents expect her to do live her life in a specific and preordained way within inflexible parameters and become the person that they want her to be instead of allowing herself to discover and realise what she wants to do with her life. They want her to become another addition to the rigid straight line of conformists. This is a tale of suffocation brought on by a rigid obligation to conform.This was released in 1971 that is right after the swinging sixties and there is abundant reference to the counterculture movements and the hippie revolution. Janice's parents are conservative Christian working class people who look down upon the new ways of the new times. They want their daughter to do 'what's good for her' as long as what she does conforms to their rigid idea of 'good'. After Janice gets forced to abort her unborn child by them she slowly and gradually disintegrates and becomes a mere shadow of her former self. Her rights get taken away from her and she succumbs to the pressure of rigid traditionalism.Loach doesn't do anything flashy with the camera. As a matter of fact I can't remember a single shot in the film that seeks attention. It's very understated. Loach uses the quintessential kitchensink drama approach and allows the scenes to progress with the help of strong dialogue instead of visual poetry. Although there is one distinct poetic scene where Janice goes on a sweet spray painting spree and we see a look of sheer joy on her face for a change. This moment reminded me of the scene in Loach's 'Kes' where Billy explains his bird's habits to his classmates and for the first time we can distinctly hear a new sense of passion in his voice.The screenplay I think has some weaknesses. The timeline gets muddled up unnecessarily at the beginning which makes it a bit confusing to get a grasp of the timeline and the order of the events. Secondly although there is an attempt made to explore and humanise the parents towards the beginning of the film with a scene involving the father somewhat opening up to the doctor about his marriage and family life however those efforts get abandoned completely and the parents gradually become more and more hate worthy due to their constant reprehensible actions and words. I feel Loach and his screenwriter could have tried to humanise the parents a bit more which thereby would have added more complexity to the film instead of making them completely antagonistic.The tone set by Loach is naturalistic and the acting is likewise. The conversations and verbal exchanges are acted out and staged with an admirable air of authenticity. Sandy Ratcliff deserves a special mention. She convincing manages to portray a mentally troubled and depressed individual without the clichd mannerisms that some actors resort to for selling a state of mental imbalance. She managed to make me really care for her character which is necessary for this role.'Family Life' isn't a perfect film but it is certainly worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "I suppose everyone has seen one or more film representations of The Holocaust but this one is different.  It focuses not on the horror of the events themselves rather it's main thrust is struggle to return from the nightmare.I liked the film for its apparent accuracy in location and the detail of what it was like for some of the Jews liberated from Auschwitz to find their way back to their homelands.  Virtually helpless the Jews in Primo Levi's autobiography embark on an odyssey that eventually gets them back to their homes  at least some of them.  All the more surprising is that Stalin's Soviet Union is their main benefactor throughout all of this.  While this is supposed to be an autobiography I have to wonder at some of the scenes for example when the train load of Jews arrives at the Munich main rail station a former Werhmacht soldier kneels before them.  In another a Jew with barely enough food for himself gives some bread to German POWs in Russia so that he can watch them fight over it.  The irony is unmistakable.Overall I liked the film.  It's one you have to see more than once because of all the detail.  It's a bit difficult to follow the dialog in part because much of it is in the language of the people who are represented Poles Russians Ukrainians French Germans Italians.  Not only that but the English dialog is accented and somewhat difficult to follow.I intend to see it at least one or two more times in order to get the full effect of this very well done story.".

	onyx:emotionText "I suppose everyone has seen one or more film representations of The Holocaust but this one is different.  It focuses not on the horror of the events themselves rather it's main thrust is struggle to return from the nightmare.I liked the film for its apparent accuracy in location and the detail of what it was like for some of the Jews liberated from Auschwitz to find their way back to their homelands.  Virtually helpless the Jews in Primo Levi's autobiography embark on an odyssey that eventually gets them back to their homes  at least some of them.  All the more surprising is that Stalin's Soviet Union is their main benefactor throughout all of this.  While this is supposed to be an autobiography I have to wonder at some of the scenes for example when the train load of Jews arrives at the Munich main rail station a former Werhmacht soldier kneels before them.  In another a Jew with barely enough food for himself gives some bread to German POWs in Russia so that he can watch them fight over it.  The irony is unmistakable.Overall I liked the film.  It's one you have to see more than once because of all the detail.  It's a bit difficult to follow the dialog in part because much of it is in the language of the people who are represented Poles Russians Ukrainians French Germans Italians.  Not only that but the English dialog is accented and somewhat difficult to follow.I intend to see it at least one or two more times in order to get the full effect of this very well done story.";

Second the events are distilled through the eyes of a particular victim Primo Levi an Italian chemist and disbelieving Jew who recorded his experiences in an autobiographical memoir The Reawakening transformed into a film by the Italian director Francesco Rosi. Levi himself is portrayed by John Turturro the only name likely to be recognized by an American audience. Turturro is a skilled actor and his performance is marked by emotional restraint. There are some telling scenes in the movie and improbable coincidences relating to reappearance of characters who had previously departed the scene for destinations unknown. What holds the film together and makes it worth seeing is Levi's sensibility and occasional direct quotes e.g. In a world where there is Auschwitz there is no God.

But there were silly moments that were clearly intended to please the movie going crowds those who can enjoy a romantic remark or stereotyped environment but not challenging a movie audience to think a little more. Scenes like the dining table with italian soldiers for example was just silly.  While all the paneuropean characters spoke in their native tongues the italian soldiers were dubbed in english.  The dialoges were clearly intended to please the crowds to show how funloving italians are always singing always eating always together.  From a great book a mediocre movie.  Contrast this with another holocaust movie made also in italy Life is Beautiful and in this film the language differences is instead exploited to make it a great film.  As for the tongue that should be used to make a holocaust film authentic Yiddish should be used except of course for the russian and german soldiers and the western european jews that spoke no yiddish.  All eastern european jews that found themselves struggling together in the camps did not speak Polish Romanian German or Hungarian but the language that was common to most of all Yiddish. Don't know of a holocaust movie that is like that.".

Barthes already proclaimed 'the death of the writer' the discourse is not a message of the writer. But sometimes it's impossible to ignore the writers' work and his message. This is the case with one of this centuries' most important writers Primo Levi.

Rosi did well not to choose Primo Levi's 'if this is a man' se questo e un uomo which describes the unimaginable experiences of Levi in the German Lager he chose what could be called its' 'sequel'.

From there the journey continues by train by foot meeting various characters. Levi played by John Torturro is a silent man who now and then expresses wise words or memorable sentences but somehow never really makes you think. It's a man we follow but doesn't touch us let alone move us. This is not Turturro's fault he gives a fairly good performance but Rosi wants too much tell an important story forgetting the ones who ARE the story namely the characters.

The movie was good enough but the dialogue was rather chaotic. You had the Russians speaking Russian and the Germans screaming their heads off in German but how is it that the central Italian characters spoke English? I was in Rome recently and I must say they are very seriously inadequate in English there and I doubt it was any different especially in WWII. I could understand if the lead character and the Greek spoke in English but the other Italian characters all spoke English too. Perhaps it was necessary to reach a wider audience but the authenticity wasn't there. However the movie did show subtle signs of the various myths of the Holocaust like when Primo Levi John Turturro tried to sell his wares in the Polish market but was shunned against I had heard that the Poles practically handed the Jews to the Germans on a silver plate so Primo's experience showed a little of what the Poles were really like. I thought John Turturro did a brilliant job he was almost unrecognisable. This movie did show how it was like after the fall of Berlin the German soldiers were made to work without food and how one of them fell on his knees when Primo Levi showed his concentration camp uniform to him. It showed very subtle signs of the Holocaust but focused more on their journey home and how they tried to cope with their newfound freedom and the fact that their peers friends and family were all gased and they survived. It was a good movie but it could've been better.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember something that Roger Ebert said in an interview with Martin Scorcese. Ebert said that Raging Bull was a great movie. People would protest that they didn't want to see it because they didn't want to see a film about boxers. No Ebert insisted. The subject matter of a film is not the heart of the film. Rather it's how well a film is made that matters. An expertly made film about boxers is better than a badly made film about a topic you may be interested in. So no I'm not a man I'm not divorced. But The Odd Couple was so well made that I fell in love with it. I surprised myself by laughing out loud throughout the film. The Odd Couple of course is the story of news writer Felix Unger leaving his wife and children and moving in with his friend sports writer Oscar Madison who is himself a divorce. Oscar lives in an eightroom Manhattan apartment which he used to share with his wife and their kids. Felix is neat Oscar is messy. Sounds pretty trite.But the movie is a revelation. The script reveals surprising depth about love hate and human relationships. The WalterMatthauJackLemmon team is like a welloiled machine  they seem to have perfected their shtick together through several lifetimes. Jack Lemmon plays the entire movie completely straight. He gives the exact same kind of performance as he did when he was acting in The Days of Wine and Roses a hyper serious film about alcoholism. When Lemmon as Felix is upset about his meatloaf burning he shows as much agony as he showed in the previous film about a drunk ruining his own life. It's hysterically funny to watch this poor schmuck wrestle with his petty obsessions and compulsions oblivious to how he affects others. Even as you laugh at him you realize he can't help himself. Felix Unger has Asperger's. What has changed in America and American film that this film from 1968 feels like a time capsule from a lost moment in America? Oscar lives in a spacious eightroom Manhattan apartment. Manhattan real estate has become more expensive of course. But it's more than that. The words that kept going through my head as I was watching the movie were grownup and intelligent. Oscar Felix and their poker buddies are six white guys. They meet and play poker. There are no scenes where these adult white men are revealed to be inept in comparison to women blacks or homosexuals. There are no scenes where the sassy gay man instructs the straight men on how to dress or create romance. There are no scenes where the magical negro shows the men that they can't dance. There are no scenes where a woman puts the men down for not knowing how to take care of children or shows the men up as being blinded by lust. There are no scenes where these straight white men are made to apologize for being straight white men. The men are grownups. They have jobs. They wear adult clothing. They wear white shirts and ties slacks belts and shiny shoes. Oscar does wear a backwards baseball cap but he is the clown of the group. And he does not wear it throughout the film. When he goes out he dresses properly. They speak of their marriages as if marriage were something important. They speak of their children as if they love them. They go on dates. They ask women out dress up for the occasion and make witty banter with subtle double entendres. While watching The Odd Couple I thought of recent Judd Apatow comedies starring men like Jason Segel Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill. These current male stars all play children they all play losers. They play failed men. The humor in these films is built around what pathetic creatures they are. In Forgetting Sarah Marshall Jason Segel who is fat and prematurely saggy is shown fully naked. The nakedness highlights his humiliation when his girlfriend Sarah Marshall dumps him. These films all use the F word over and over in a manner that feels desperate and limited. There is one very sly very funny reference to the f word in The Odd Couple. Oscar complains to Felix Unger that he is tired of getting little notes from Felix like We are all out of cornflakes. Signed FU. Oscar says it took him hours to figure out what FU meant. A funny joke. Delivered deliciously. The only time The Odd Couple has to refer to the F word to get a laugh. I've never felt while watching a Judd Apatow comedy that I was gaining any insight into the human condition. There are so many payoff moments of absurd comedy in The Odd Couple as when Oscar steps on a vacuum cleaner cord and then takes his foot off the cord at just the right moment to send Felix reeling. But there were so many moments that made me say Gosh yes that's what human relationships are like. That's what it's like to lovehate another human being.I can't imagine a film like The Odd Couple being made today. A genuinely funny intelligent rich grownup comedy about men that shines light on the human condition and that need never speak the F word to get a laugh. And I can't imagine anyone other than a Trump being able to afford that eightroom apartment in Manhattan.".

	onyx:emotionText "I remember something that Roger Ebert said in an interview with Martin Scorcese. Ebert said that Raging Bull was a great movie. People would protest that they didn't want to see it because they didn't want to see a film about boxers. No Ebert insisted. The subject matter of a film is not the heart of the film. Rather it's how well a film is made that matters. An expertly made film about boxers is better than a badly made film about a topic you may be interested in. So no I'm not a man I'm not divorced. But The Odd Couple was so well made that I fell in love with it. I surprised myself by laughing out loud throughout the film. The Odd Couple of course is the story of news writer Felix Unger leaving his wife and children and moving in with his friend sports writer Oscar Madison who is himself a divorce. Oscar lives in an eightroom Manhattan apartment which he used to share with his wife and their kids. Felix is neat Oscar is messy. Sounds pretty trite.But the movie is a revelation.

	schema:reviewBody "I don't think I've really ever given Walter Matthau his due as a comedic performer. He's certainly been wonderful in plenty of lighthearted roles but I guess I always put his success down to his characters' grumpiness and ruthlessness a gruff contrast to the flamboyant personality of his frequent costar Jack Lemmon and I suppose a natural extension of his earlier work in dramatic pictures. Watching Gene Saks' 'The Odd Couple 1968' adapted from a popular Neil Simon play the realisation suddenly clicked Matthau is in his own right absolutely hilarious! Initially striking the audience as filthy crude and generally unappealing his Oscar Madison eventually manages to worm his way into our hearts culminating in a hilariously overplayed confession of emotions that Matthau rasps out in a voice not entirely his own. At the same time while holding his own as a comedian his interplay with Lemmon is of course pitchperfect indeed the film rightly belongs to both actors who have never failed to light up the cinema screen by themselves let alone together.Calling to mind Billy Wilder's screenplay for 'The Apartment 1960' this Neil Simon comedy builds itself around around a rather morbid premise. Compulsive housecleaner Felix Unger Lemmon having just been evicted by his wife of twelve years attempts to commit suicide but fruitlessly abandons the idea after he wrecks his back trying to open the hotel window. Dejected he arrives at the house of good friend Oscar Matthau a divorced slob who lives alone on a diet of potato crisps and green sandwiches that might contain either very new cheese or very old meat!. Oscar kindly offers Felix a place to stay but is soon overwhelmed by his friend's finicky personality and constant insistence on absolute cleanliness. The pair form an unusual sort of marital arrangement with Felix assuming the role of the effeminate and constantlynagging wife and Oscar as the sloppy unappreciative husband who always comes home later than he's supposed to. This is a marriage that barely lasts three weeks and by the end of it we can completely sympathise with Felix's exwife who remains unseen.'The Odd Couple' is a terrific comedy most of all because it has a lot of heart. For all their arguing it's obvious that the two roommates have plenty of affection for each other most movingly seen when Felix tries to launch into a furious tirade instead  perhaps inadvertently  ending up informing Oscar how tops he his. The pair's four poker buddies John Fiedler Herb Edelman David Sheiner and Larry Haines are also constantly badgering each other about some obscure annoyance but you can't deny that they've got the best of intentions. Their decision to treat Felix as though nothing has happened to him may have sounded fine in theory but maybe being ignored wasn't quite the correct solution to Felix's gloomy feelings of inadequacy and inconsequentiality. Unlike some comedies based on popular stage plays I was recently disappointed by Wilder's 'The Seven Year Itch 1955 this film doesn't simply strike at the same chord throughout and the relationship between the two leads is progressively developed through tears laughter and much disagreement.".

That particular movie wasn't as great as this one because the story couldn't sustain such a long running time I think it was almost 2 hours.

That's a minor quibble though and for the rest of the running time you have a marvelous time.I have already written a comment about how the followup to this film sucked and I won't go deeper into that.

	schema:reviewBody "Buddy comedies always come down to two things actors and their scripts. The Odd Couple works because it has two endearing characters and an often hilarious and always downtoearth script making it one of the best odd couple films of all time  inspiring but not surpassing movies that share its genre such as John Hughes' Planes Trains and Automobiles 1987 and Martin Brest's Midnight Run 1988. And in some ways even Barry Levinson's Rain Man 1988 a more dramatic buddy comedy that nevertheless takes a lot of pointers from this one.Plots always help buddy comedies of course but it really depends on whether the two actors  when confined to a solitary confinement  can interact and make the audience laugh. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau two legendary screen comedians can do just that. Their comedic chemistry in this film has often been mimicked by other ripoffs such as Grumpy Old Men. But this remains their ultimate combinedeffort comedy.This is the type of movie that is often referenced as the pinnacle buddy movie. Sure it may not be the best but it did inspire the entire odd couple genre and I would definitely place it in the top five buddy comedies list if I ever made such a thing.Felix Jack Lemmon has just been left by his wife and so he goes to live with longtime poker pal Oscar Walter Matthau a grumpy and filthy slob who is the exact opposite of Felix an uptight orderly man with a fetish for cleaning. In fact he does just that in Oscar's apartment which drives Oscar to the point of ultimate frustration. If these guys can't get along much longer they'll just have to move along and forget their friendship. But things don't always turn out the way they appear.Neil Simon's The Odd Couple is full of inspired lunacy. It has some truly hilarious moments with great gags and interaction between its two lead stars whose screen chemistry is undeniable  there's a reason Hollywood paired Lemmon and Matthau together an uncountable number of times.The film is lacking the humanity and sorrow of its characters that shines through in Planes Trains and Automobiles there are few  if any  moments where the characters become so frustrated with each other that they blow up and then realize that they're not exactly how they thought. Remember the scene in the motel when Neal Page Steve Martin lashed out against Del Griffith John Candy? But after the comedy tirade ended and as we laughed the film took an unexpected turn when it revealed the Del character's utter hurt inside. Then we stopped laughing and we started crying.That's lacking in The Odd Couple making it inferior to Hughes' comedy masterpiece but it's a clever little film that inspired it all. Perhaps the best gag in the entire movie is one that was quite controversial at the time Oscar finds a note next to his bed from Felix that says they're out of cereal and the last two letters of the note are F U. Of course the two letters F U are Felix Ungar's initials but as Oscar implies just imagine what he thought it meant when he first read the note.I love comedies where you lock down a small number of people  preferably a pair of opposites  in a room and let their characters take over. I like when the dialogue is rich and funny and so very real. I guess I just like subtle character comedies  overblown special effects comedies aren't always favorites of mine. Dumb and Dumber is one of my favorite buddy comedies and it's not because it's crude or silly but because I like the pairing of its two stars Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels and I like the situations they get into. The Odd Couple based on the stage play by Simon is the odd comedy that puts a smile on your face and delights the viewer. It's a fun movie a great comedy one of the finest and arguably the most acknowledged buddy film of all time. I saw it years ago and I've been laughing ever since. And despite its inferiority to some of the other buddy films that followed in its path The Odd Couple is a delightful character comedy that will inspire similar comedies for years to come. Lord knows it already has.55.".

And in some ways even Barry Levinson's Rain Man 1988 a more dramatic buddy comedy that nevertheless takes a lot of pointers from this one.Plots always help buddy comedies of course but it really depends on whether the two actors  when confined to a solitary confinement  can interact and make the audience laugh. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau two legendary screen comedians can do just that. Their comedic chemistry in this film has often been mimicked by other ripoffs such as Grumpy Old Men. But this remains their ultimate combinedeffort comedy.This is the type of movie that is often referenced as the pinnacle buddy movie. Sure it may not be the best but it did inspire the entire odd couple genre and I would definitely place it in the top five buddy comedies list if I ever made such a thing.Felix Jack Lemmon has just been left by his wife and so he goes to live with longtime poker pal Oscar Walter Matthau a grumpy and filthy slob who is the exact opposite of Felix an uptight orderly man with a fetish for cleaning. In fact he does just that in Oscar's apartment which drives Oscar to the point of ultimate frustration. If these guys can't get along much longer they'll just have to move along and forget their friendship. But things don't always turn out the way they appear.Neil Simon's The Odd Couple is full of inspired lunacy. It has some truly hilarious moments with great gags and interaction between its two lead stars whose screen chemistry is undeniable  there's a reason Hollywood paired Lemmon and Matthau together an uncountable number of times.The film is lacking the humanity and sorrow of its characters that shines through in Planes Trains and Automobiles there are few  if any  moments where the characters become so frustrated with each other that they blow up and then realize that they're not exactly how they thought. Remember the scene in the motel when Neal Page Steve Martin lashed out against Del Griffith John Candy? But after the comedy tirade ended and as we laughed the film took an unexpected turn when it revealed the Del character's utter hurt inside. Then we stopped laughing and we started crying.That's lacking in The Odd Couple making it inferior to Hughes' comedy masterpiece but it's a clever little film that inspired it all. Perhaps the best gag in the entire movie is one that was quite controversial at the time Oscar finds a note next to his bed from Felix that says they're out of cereal and the last two letters of the note are F U. Of course the two letters F U are Felix Ungar's initials but as Oscar implies just imagine what he thought it meant when he first read the note.I love comedies where you lock down a small number of people  preferably a pair of opposites  in a room and let their characters take over. I like when the dialogue is rich and funny and so very real. I guess I just like subtle character comedies  overblown special effects comedies aren't always favorites of mine. Dumb and Dumber is one of my favorite buddy comedies and it's not because it's crude or silly but because I like the pairing of its two stars Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels and I like the situations they get into. The Odd Couple based on the stage play by Simon is the odd comedy that puts a smile on your face and delights the viewer. It's a fun movie a great comedy one of the finest and arguably the most acknowledged buddy film of all time. I saw it years ago and I've been laughing ever since. And despite its inferiority to some of the other buddy films that followed in its path The Odd Couple is a delightful character comedy that will inspire similar comedies for years to come. Lord knows it already has.55.";

I love it when killjoy Felix gets them out of a romantic mood with a good cry. No wonder Ineedtotouchsomethingsoft Oscar wants to throttle him. And I'm still wondering whether Simon came up with the name Felix Unger because of the loaded initials or just happened to notice them. Anyway the initials provide a good laugh.Of course filming a stage play is always tricky since there're minimal scene changes. Here there're basically only two sets. But I hardly notice because director Saks manages to keep somebody moving all the time. That plus the quality of writing and acting keeps attention from wandering. One thing I did notice. Catch how the poker players are bunched on one side of the table so that the camera can have an unobstructed angle. It's artificial but understandable.Anyway this is one of my favorite comedies and I catch reruns of the TV series when I can. Thanks Neil Simon for a truly inspired comedic setup.".

But for all you folks that are only familiar with the TV versions the play and movie were very different. While they're all comedies the play and film were very dark...little like the TV program. The TV show never would tackle issues like suicide and Oscar would never come to a point where he contemplates murdering Felix!!The film begins with Felix Jack Lemmon wandering about New York City is a daze. His wife sick of his incredibly neurotic and irritating behavior has finally tossed him out...and Felix doesn't know what to do with himself. He eventually wanders over to the pig sty where Oscar lives and his poker buddies all just heard about what's happened with Felix...and they are worried he might harm himself. So Oscar asks Felix to stay with him. After all Felix is a neat freak and Oscar a total slob...and perhaps they could help each other! Well easier said than done as Felix is so annoying that instead of helping Oscar he might just help push Oscar over the edge! How's it all going to end? See the film.As I sad this film is dark. In the TV show no matter how angry Oscar got at Felix you know that down deep they love each other. Here however you think that perhaps THIS Oscar Walter Matthau might just kill Felix! Overall a very good film but one that will appeal to a different sort of audience than the TV show...a more adult one that doesn't mind exploring this dark side.".

	schema:headline " A comedy of timing and leisure whatever happened to UNpredictability?";
	schema:reviewBody "Gene Saks' The Odd Couple is a masterwork of comedic timing and actors showcasing their energy and talents on screen. It marks the debut film showing both Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau together in a film and would unfold into a long flourishing career featuring the talent and humor of both men. The Odd Couple is amazingly crafted because it shows its actors as people and utilizes rare long takes in small settings that allow the actors to recite dialog that shows their specific character personalities and traits.Jack Lemmon plays Felix Ungar who is seen at the beginning of the film checking into a seamy motel with plans to kill himself after his wife claims she wants a divorce. After pulling a muscle in his back trying to open the window of the room that he plans to jump out of  a delightful example of pitch dark comedy  Felix wanders hopelessly around the wasteland that is Times Square with no clear direction or feelings of purpose. We then cut to a cluttered disgusting mess of an apartment that belongs to divorced sports columnist Oscar Madison Walter Matthau who is hosting a card game with several pals and anticipating the arrival of Felix. This scene in Oscar's messy apartment lasts an upwards of twentyfive minutes even past the arrival of a depressed Felix giving Matthau and the band of hilarious character actors time to spit memorable oneliners and uproarious meditations on life.Upset that Felix arrives with suicidal thoughts and feelings of uselessness Oscar opens his apartment to Felix despite their opposite personalities. Felix is a compulsive cleaner and so neurotic he'd make Woody Allen wince. Oscar on the other hand simply doesn't care about cleanliness or anything of the sorts. This as expected leads to contention between their differing personalities. For a typically predictable and ostensibly tiresome premise writer Neil Simon and director Gene Saks know how to keep this material lively. For one they rely on the characters and their interactions with each other and their conversational relationship rather than a series of events that anger one another. This is the biggest key to the success of The Odd Couple. There is no reliance on crudeness or overthetop humor involving stock situations based on the characters' personalities. The relationship Felix and Oscar bear is one predicated off of lengthy conversations and deep thoughtful realizations on life.Lemmon and Matthau are a comedic force of ingenuity and hilarity. It's no surprise that their film career together was expansive and their friendship remained strong until their death. They have an exceptional way of building off one another through energetic banter and despite their characters being polar opposite there's no mistaking the way they feel like they need each other in order to thrive in the world. Few comedic talents could bring such an oddball chemistry to necessitylevels but Lemmon and Matthau do an exceptional job at conveying such a need for one another.Furthermore it's refreshing to see a film not feel rushed and utilize its onehundred and five minute runtime calmly and effectively. I tire quickly of films that feel that things need to be rushed or hurried so that the maximum amount of antics need to ensue. Saks and Simon are smarter they are much more lax and have a looser grip on the material allowing for sequences in the same setting to continue long past twenty minutes and this is a great thing. Two things have changed in contemporary comedies  the jokes are raunchier and often dirtier and the settings are utilized for not as long as they once were. Older comedies don't feel like they have a schedule while newer comedies feel like a businessman aboard a 915am train that arrives ten minutes earlier than scheduled.The Odd Couple is a hilarious endeavor not hurried not contrived and not forced allowing the energy of its screentalents with their conversational fluidity and the genius of its writing and directing team to make an uproariously funny comedy the oldfashioned goodintentioned way. The way that is unfortunately neglected in contemporary times.Starring Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. Directed by Gene Saks.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Odd Couple 1968  out of 4 Hilarious adaptation of the Neil Simon play about two friends who try to make it as roommates. The slob Oscar Walter Matthau lets his cleanfreak friend Felix Jack Lemmon move in after he's kick out by his wife but it doesn't take long for Oscar to see why the wife wanted no part of Felix. THE ODD COUPLE is without question one of the greatest comedies ever made and it really doesn't matter how many times you watch it the thing always comes across as fresh original and downright hilarious. There are so many terrific moments in this movie but there's no doubt that the two stars deserve a lot of the credit for making it work so well. Of course there's the Simon play which is pretty much a masterpiece because how many stories could take a subject like suicide and turn it into something hilarious? The early sequence with the poker buddies fearing that Felix has killed himself contains some of the biggest laughs you're ever going to see and things just get even funnier once we move along to Felix and Oscar living together and not working. It's said that Matthau originally wanted to play the Felix character but thank God he didn't. That's not to say that Matthau couldn't have pulled it off but he's at home perfectly as the slob. Just the way Matthau walks talks and acts is just so funny and you can perfectly believe him in the role. Lemmon is also terrific because of how innocent and loving he is but at the same time he's just so annoying and too perfect for anyone to live with. The way Lemmon and Matthau play off one another shows why they're considered one of the greatest comedy teams ever. The supporting cast are also terrific with John Fiedler Herb Edelman and David Sheiner really standing out in their roles as the poker buddies and then you have Monica Evans and Carole Shelley as the Pigeon sisters. THE ODD COUPLE has been copied and ripped off countless times over the years but there's still no question that this here is the king of all buddy movies.".

	schema:headline " Male bonding comedy at its best ...";
	schema:reviewBody "Told you 158 times I can't stand little notes on my pillow. We're all out of cornflakes. F.U. Took me three hours to figure out F.U. was Felix Unger! Felix Unger Jack Lemmon is the neat freak forming with his buddy Oscar Madison Walter Matthau the titular odd couple and this line is only one drop of the ocean of hilarious oneliners this adaptation of Neil Simon's play contains.And 'hilarious' is an understatement because the more I watch The Odd Couple the more tempted I am to believe this is one of the funniest films ever. In other reviews I would have left such a bold statement for the conclusion after a series of welldeveloped points but this time I give up I have to say that first. I have to shout how truly funny Gene Sachs' film is how high is the level of hilarity reached by its best scenes and how delightful it is to watch Lemmon and Matthau inhabiting the conflict between two grumpy middleaged men that couldn't have been more opposite the neurotic and overanxious Unger and the joyful and frivolous slob Madison. Even the title even resonates as the comical premise and the psychological core of the story two men two attitudes towards loneliness ... Felix is the agony Oscar the ecstasy.Much more their attitudes in life have one thing in common they're driven by their marital experience. Felix inherited the manic habits of cleanliness Oscar not only rejected them all but exorcised his demons by shamelessly getting back to his roots and living like a bachelor again. In a way the film opened my eyes of some endearing aspects of being a man carelessness. You can smoke drink a beer and put a glass on the table even if it leaves rings or not eat over the plate even if it leaves crumbs on the floor no one would shout at you. And every once in a while Mister Hyde becomes the Doctor Jekyll and it's time to turn the place into something more presentable. Generally it happens when you expect a charming visit but that's the virile circle of life 80 dirty and 20 clean and I guess male bonding is about rediscovering the joy of carelessness together. Believe me it's been eights months since I'm married and one year since I lived with my wife and I wish I could savor the taste of carelessness again. Yes sometimes I look at bachelor's life envy. And when I go to my friend's house I'm like in heaven. The Odd Couple has this appealing quality it shows you that life hasn't changed much since 1968. I could respond to Matthau's Madison even more because in life my wife turned me into Lemmon's Unger. When my friend came to my house I asked him to leave his shoes near the door to have the round thing for the beer not to mess with the carpet. He couldn't believe it but well he couldn't believe either the way the house improved how full was the fridge maybe he felt he was missing things too. Well that's women the cause and the solutions of our problems. And I guess the joyful bunch who come to Madison's flat to play poker every Friday night great cast by the way enjoy their game even more because they know after this virile oasis they'll get back to marital routine. Married guys don't know what they miss but when they become bachelors again they miss what they lost.And that's what Oscar and Felix have in common they're not married anymore both are divorced and divorcing and when out of friendship Oscar invites Felix to live in his eight room apartment he doesn't realize that he brought himself a man whose habits are worse than a woman's without the advantages of a woman. Both have two philosophies of life extended to their most extreme sides one wants to enjoy freedom another to control things you could tell why both divorced we can figure that for them because basically they can't so maybe the salvation is somewhat inbetween. But the film is less about the cohabitation process with a learning or a message than a series of hilarious sight gags and oneliners that are both witty and true to life. It feels like a sitcom sometimes but it transcends the material of a sitcom through powerful performances from a genuine odd couple.Indeed it's a comedy a gagdriven comedy and any other considerations are totally useless it's all about the interactions between Matthau and Lemmon the Auguste and the white faced clown. And the force of the film is to never reach a breaking point of absurdity. Lemmon's mimics are hilarious the opening sequence is probably the greatest tribute to his comedic talent he's the true successor of Silent legends his FMUH in the restaurant scenes killed me but he never exaggerates them he always carries the gravity of his character with such versatility he could have made him a pathetic in a drama. Another example is when they invite two English sisters both equally cute and funny. Well in a bad film the date would have been turned into a disaster Today it would have lead to some gratuitous crude gags in The Odd Couple it's dealt with sweetness and a rare sensitivity.The film deals with the pathos of his character with sweetness and intelligence and their confrontation are so full of memorable lines that you never get tired of their interactions. It's funny witty hilarious. I guess it exceeds The Producers as the best comedy of 1968 and last but not least it features a very catchy theme. Remember it's the one Homer Simpson sang to Lisa convinced that it was her favorite film tatatatataaa".

	onyx:emotionText "Told you 158 times I can't stand little notes on my pillow. We're all out of cornflakes. F.U. Took me three hours to figure out F.U. was Felix Unger! Felix Unger Jack Lemmon is the neat freak forming with his buddy Oscar Madison Walter Matthau the titular odd couple and this line is only one drop of the ocean of hilarious oneliners this adaptation of Neil Simon's play contains.And 'hilarious' is an understatement because the more I watch The Odd Couple the more tempted I am to believe this is one of the funniest films ever. In other reviews I would have left such a bold statement for the conclusion after a series of welldeveloped points but this time I give up I have to say that first. I have to shout how truly funny Gene Sachs' film is how high is the level of hilarity reached by its best scenes and how delightful it is to watch Lemmon and Matthau inhabiting the conflict between two grumpy middleaged men that couldn't have been more opposite the neurotic and overanxious Unger and the joyful and frivolous slob Madison. Even the title even resonates as the comical premise and the psychological core of the story two men two attitudes towards loneliness ... Felix is the agony Oscar the ecstasy.Much more their attitudes in life have one thing in common they're driven by their marital experience. Felix inherited the manic habits of cleanliness Oscar not only rejected them all but exorcised his demons by shamelessly getting back to his roots and living like a bachelor again. In a way the film opened my eyes of some endearing aspects of being a man carelessness. You can smoke drink a beer and put a glass on the table even if it leaves rings or not eat over the plate even if it leaves crumbs on the floor no one would shout at you. And every once in a while Mister Hyde becomes the Doctor Jekyll and it's time to turn the place into something more presentable. Generally it happens when you expect a charming visit but that's the virile circle of life 80 dirty and 20 clean and I guess male bonding is about rediscovering the joy of carelessness together. Believe me it's been eights months since I'm married and one year since I lived with my wife and I wish I could savor the taste of carelessness again. Yes sometimes I look at bachelor's life envy. And when I go to my friend's house I'm like in heaven. The Odd Couple has this appealing quality it shows you that life hasn't changed much since 1968. I could respond to Matthau's Madison even more because in life my wife turned me into Lemmon's Unger. When my friend came to my house I asked him to leave his shoes near the door to have the round thing for the beer not to mess with the carpet. He couldn't believe it but well he couldn't believe either the way the house improved how full was the fridge maybe he felt he was missing things too. Well that's women the cause and the solutions of our problems. And I guess the joyful bunch who come to Madison's flat to play poker every Friday night great cast by the way enjoy their game even more because they know after this virile oasis they'll get back to marital routine. Married guys don't know what they miss but when they become bachelors again they miss what they lost.And that's what Oscar and Felix have in common they're not married anymore both are divorced and divorcing and when out of friendship Oscar invites Felix to live in his eight room apartment he doesn't realize that he brought himself a man whose habits are worse than a woman's without the advantages of a woman. Both have two philosophies of life extended to their most extreme sides one wants to enjoy freedom another to control things you could tell why both divorced we can figure that for them because basically they can't so maybe the salvation is somewhat inbetween. But the film is less about the cohabitation process with a learning or a message than a series of hilarious sight gags and oneliners that are both witty and true to life. It feels like a sitcom sometimes but it transcends the material of a sitcom through powerful performances from a genuine odd couple.Indeed it's a comedy a gagdriven comedy and any other considerations are totally useless it's all about the interactions between Matthau and Lemmon the Auguste and the white faced clown.

	schema:headline " A OneJoke Comedy Which Works";
	schema:reviewBody "Neil Simon's plays have enjoyed great popularity ever since he started writing in the 1960s not only in the theatre but also as the basis for film scripts generally written by Simon himself. Most of his plays are set in his native New York Biloxi Blues based on his wartime experiences is an exception and it is notable that Gene Saks the director of The Odd Couple is a New Yorker as was Walter Matthau one of its stars. The other star Jack Lemmon was a Bostonian. All three men were involved in other Simon films. The previous year Saks had directed Barefoot in the Park Lemmon was to appear in The OutofTowners and The Prisoner of Second Avenue and Matthau was to appear in several including Plaza Suite and California Suite. When New Yorker Felix Ungar and his wife split up he decides to move in with his old friend Oscar Madison himself a divorce. The film which tells the story of their cohabitation is essentially a onejoke comedy the joke being that despite their longrunning friendship the two men are very different in character. Oscar a highlypaid sportswriter takes no interest in cooking cleaning or housework. Although he lives in a luxurious and obviously expensive apartment he has ever since his wife left him several months earlier allowed the place to degenerate into an untidy mess. Felix by comparison is not only an excellent cook but also neurotically obsessive about cleanliness after he moves into the apartment he spends most of his time cleaning and tidying it and berating Oscar for his slovenly ways. As a result the two men continually quarrel and bicker like an old married couple. Most onejoke comedies do not really work in the cinema but The Odd Couple is perhaps one of the few exceptions. Its great advantage is that Lemmon and Matthau were two of the best comic actors of the period and both are on good form here. In his comedies Lemmon played various different personality types but one thing that several of his characters have in common is that they like to be in control of their lives and the humour derives from their usually vain attempts to reassert control after losing it. Thus Stanley the hero of How to Murder Your Wife wakes up one morning to find that he has inadvertently got married while drunk and George the testy impatient business executive in The OutofTowners finds himself confronted with an insuperable series of disasters. Felix's problem is precisely the opposite of that which confronts Stanley. Stanley is a confirmed bachelor suddenly threatened by the loss of his bachelor status which he equates with a loss of freedom. Felix is an apparently happily married man whose world collapses with the sudden collapse of his marriage. Oscar by contrast treats his divorce with much greater equanimity. Felix is a comic character but also a genuinely pitiable one in the early scenes he is actually contemplating suicide. His obsessive tidying of Oscar's flat can be seen as a desperate attempt to regain control over at least one area of his life. Although Felix might sometimes act like Oscar's wife there is nothing effeminate about Lemmon's portrayal not is there any attempt to insinuate a gay relationship which is important. Not only would any implication of homosexuality been frowned upon in 1968 much of the humour derives from the fact that the relationship is between two masculine heterosexual men. Suggest that one or both is gay and much of that humour is lost. The Odd Couple is not Simon's best screenplay but he always had the ability to write witty dialogue and there is enough in this film to prevent the humour from becoming merely repetitive. Another plus is the attractive witty jazz score from Neal Hefti who also wrote the score for How to Murder Your Wife. 610".

She sees the prostitutes on the street and she decides to sell her body to earn the money. She does not succeed and tries to steal money from a customer of a street vendor. Angela is arrested and sentenced to one year in prison but she escapes and finds her mother dead.

Angela meets the painter Gino Charles Farrell and they fall in love with each other. When Angela breaks her ankle in a fall she returns to Naples with Gino that grows as painter and is hired to paint a mural in the church. Gino proposes to marry Angela but a policeman recognizes Angela and gives one hour to her to say goodbye to Gino. Angela does not tell him about her past and vanishes from his life. One year later Angela is released and she immediately goes to see the mural painted by her beloved Gino. However she sees the name of Roberti instead and she learns that Gino had been fired. Now the starving Angela wanders on the harbor. Meanwhile a prostitute tells to Gino that his love is a street angel and he decides to paint again not the face but the soul of prostitutes and seeks a model on the harbor. When they stumble on each other Gino sees her soul through her eyes and they stay together. Street Angel is silent movie with a wonderful melodramatic romance and magnificent performance of Janet Gaynor the first winner of an Oscar in the Best Actress in a Leading Role category for her work in 7th Heaven Sunrise A Song of Two Humans and Street Angel. The camera work is amazing for a 1928 movie and the introduction is impressive with a long 360 degrees shot. The cinematography is also stunning and this movie deserved to be restored. My vote is nine.Title Brazil Anjo da Rua Street Angel".

Street Angel is silent movie with a wonderful melodramatic romance and magnificent performance of Janet Gaynor the first winner of an Oscar in the Best Actress in a Leading Role category for her work in 7th Heaven Sunrise A Song of Two Humans and Street Angel. The camera work is amazing for a 1928 movie and the introduction is impressive with a long 360 degrees shot. The cinematography is also stunning and this movie deserved to be restored. My vote is nine.Title Brazil Anjo da Rua Street Angel";

Of course Gaynor is really not a woman of the streets but is convicted up this crime and stealing money from a lunch counter which she does out of desperation to save her sick mother. She escapes the police however and hides out with a traveling circus. She becomes part of the troupe and meets a vagabond artist Charles Farrell and falls in love.His love for her inspires him to create a great painting of her. This art gets him a muralist job with the city. On the verge of marriage the police find her and take her to prison. Farrell doesn't know what's happened to her and his life is destroyed until a chance meeting on the foggy shores of Naples.Janet Gaynor is superb as the street angel quite able to show passion despite her youth and she looks great. Charles Farrell is OK as the artist. Henry Armetta is one of the circus performers and Natalie Kingston is the mean prostitute.Director Frank Borzage creates a great city set amidst fog and shadows. This setting is used to great effect in the several chase scenes. The set design and cinematography earned Oscar nominations and this is one of three films with Sunrise and Seventh Heaven for which Gaynor won the very first Oscar as best lead actress beating out Gloria Swanson and Louise Dresser.Gaynor achieved stardom at the end of the silent era but easily made the transition to sound and had a solid career through the late 30s. She is best remembered as the star of the original A Star Is Born in 1937.".

For her performance in STREET ANGEL Gaynor along with both SUNRISE 1927 and SEVENTH HEAVEN earned her the Academy Award as Best Actress during its initial ceremony. This was the only time an actress was honored for three motion pictures. While SUNRISE and SEVENTH HEAVEN remains relatively known and important in cinema history STREET ANGEL continues to be the least known and discussed of Gaynor's award winners. Following the pattern from SEVENTH HEAVEN with the Borzage style of sentimental delight its use of dark images and interesting camera angles obviously borrows from the F.W. Murnau style of SUNRISE. It also provides its two leads Gaynor especially a wider range of showcasing their ability as a fine romantic couple with Gaynor's fragile appearance of charm and sincerity.Opening title Everywherein every town in every street we pass unknowingly human souls made great by love and adversity. The setting is Italy in the city of Naples under the smoking menace of Vesunius ... laughterloving careless sordid Naples. After the introduction of a circus troupe coming to town the camera pans over towards the apartment where a doctor having examining a very sick woman informs her daughter Angela Janet Gaynor to have his prescription filled immediately. Unable to obtain the 20 lire for the medicine Angela in desperation goes out into the public streets where she imitates a common streetwalker to sell herself for money. The scheme fails when she's caught picking a man's pocket by a observant policeman Alberto Rabagliati who arrests her on robbery charges while soliciting in the streets. Sentenced to a year at the workhouse by the judge Angela escapes to return home and find her mother has died. When she sees the policeman approaching her apartment door to take her in she eludes him once again by hiding inside a broken musical drum belonging to Mashetto Henry Armetta leader of a visiting circus. Feeling pity for the young girl the kindhearted Mashetto takes Angela on as one of the circus acts. Outside of Naples Angela encounters Gino Charles Farrell a young artist known as The Vagabond Painter. Unaware of her past and envisioning her as an angel pure in heart he has her pose for him. After capturing her portrait on canvas the couple fall in love with plans to marry. Following her accident leading to a sprained ankle Gino takes Angela back to Naples for proper medical treatment. While there they take up residence in an apartment where they live in separate sleeping quarters. After selling the painting Gino is offered a job to paint the great Miro for the Teatro San Carlo church which is just cause for celebration and he placing an engagement ring on Angela's finger. On the eve of their marriage the policeman unexpectedly comes to arrest her. Through her pleas he agrees to give her one final hour with Gino before going with him. The next morning Gino discovers Angela has disappeared without a trace. Her loss brings forth depression his loss of artistic creativity and a destitute life regardless of his renowned portrait of Angela displayed inside a stately church.Released with synchronized musical score occasional sound effects whistling and off screen singing of O Sole Mio STREET ANGEL is typical good girl gone wrong story. While actually an ordinary motion picture Gaynor's tender celebration dinner sequence with the man she loves knowing full well she'll be arrested once her hour is over along with her having Gino believing her tears of sadness as tears of joy is well handled. Gaynor's Best Actress win for this production was obviously on the basis of this scene alone. Farrell who rarely gets any honorable mention for his work should be given homage for his performance such as this one. Although not very convincing as an curly haired Italian he gets by dramatically during its second half where his character literally goes on a brink of insanity after learning from Lisetta Natalie Kingston a former neighbor just released from prison for prostitution that Angela had also served time on those very same charges. The scene where Gino attempts to strangle Angela for deceiving him after their paths meet again through the use of dark photography or film noir style is quite effective.While STREET ANGEL is a rarely seen item getting a home video distribution in 1998 with limited release through Critic's Choice Video Masterpiece Collection from the Killiam Library it did have a cable television showing years later on Turner Classic Movies TCM premiere February 17 2011 with original musical score. Although some may rank STREET ANGEL better than SEVENTH HEAVEN or visa versa each is worthy of rediscovery especially silent film enthusiasts or anyone who's pure in heart for sentimental love stories featuring the frequently teamed pair of Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell.

	schema:reviewBody "Street Angel 1928What a great surprise!Just as sound was all the talk and all the necessity of Hollywood and just as Fox Studios has released a quasisound masterpiece in the fall of 1927 called Sunrise a few months later comes Street Angel continuing in a silent mode from Fox's great director Frank Borzage. And it's lively fast well acted and frankly terrific.Janet Gaynor above all like Lilian Gish in her films lifts this story through sheer acting and screen presence. She's a live wire and a tender victim a fun and emotional and interesting person. This comes across without the supposed exaggerations of silent cinema and is enough to make you forget the silence completely. Her partner in all this Charles Farrell is also good though a bit stiff and pretty like Gary Cooper would be a decade later.Equally terrific is the filmingthe photography and editing and the necessary set design and atmospheric effects night fog great heights tiny rooms. Photographer Ernest Palmer had already made a slew of films at Fox and was at the top of his game and he had just worked with Borzage and Gaynor and Farrell in the equally well made 7th Heaven the year before. It's beautiful glowing subtle stuff.The plot? More interesting that you'd expect at first and more complex though with a strand of inevitable sweetness too. The title refers to a prostitute and streetwalking girls are a recurring part of the film from the fringes. The place is Italy in the 1920s and Gaynor plays Angela who turns to the street to try to get enough money to save her mother's life. Things quickly spin out of control from there with jail and a small time circus and a life of impoverishment in Naples for our two leads. Temporarily. Farrell plays a painter with some talent but imperfect ambition and no business sense so promise turns to heartache. And then things shift again.If there is anything constant in this movie it is the good inner souls of the main characters and so you suspect they will at least have a chance of surviving the hardship that seems to never quite be their own fault. I'm sure most of the audience identified with that then just as I could now. The scenes are really dramatic the interactions between the actors completely fresh and honest and the photography fluid and modern. Yes it's a sentimental old movie still of course but with so much going on so well you'll be glad.".

She turns to it briefly although not entirely thankfully for 1928 audiences because her ailing mother needs some medicine she can not otherwise afford. She's caught but escapes to a traveling circus and falls in love with an idealistic painter played by Farrell. Farrell though handsome was not the best of actors and faded from the limelight when the sound era took over. The story is pure fluff and contrived to say the least but its Gaynor's performance the cinematography and Frank Borzage's direction which carry the film. Borzage owes much to German Expressionism in his shooting of this film. The first half of the film moves at a good pace but the second half drags incessantly at times with closeups of Gaynor that linger forever capturing her waiflike angelic look. The whistling Gaynor and Farrell do throughout the film grows more tiresome with each succeeding episode. As in many silent films the pace varies in average films of the period. This was one of the films which included sound effects musical interludes and transition music but not spoken dialog in the transition period between silents and sound. 12 of 4 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1928 Fox tried the impossible they wanted to make a film that echoed the prestige of Sunrise with the commercial success of Seventh Heaven and they almost pulled it off with Street Angel. The film reunited Janet Gaynor with her Seventh Heaven costar Charles Farrell and it was a huge success. Fox more than any other studio embraced the expressionism of the German UFA studios and for the first 15 minutes of Street Angel there was a concentration of ten years of the best German techniques  fantastic sets symbolic and geometric grouping of people a mobile camera and amazing lighting. It was almost impossible to maintain that high artistic level but it did return for the closing reel. In between the story was rambling but it was saved by the freshness and enthusiasm of it's two stars.With the constant musical love theme Angela Mia played continuously throughout the movie the story is set in Naples as Angela sweet Janet Gaynor desperate for money for medicine for her ailing mother tries her hand at soliciting  she has seen how easy it is for other girls but men just don't seem interested in her. In desperation she steals for which she is bought before a magistrate and sent to the local workhouse for a year. She escapes and a chase through almost surrealistic streets sees her helped by a traveling carnival.One day she meets handsome Gino Charles Farrell he is a painter and his funny antics are drawing the crowds away from the circus!!! It is love at first sight  for Gino!! Angela hates men and says she will never love  silly Angela!! Being in a circus is a nice change of pace for Janet who gets to wear lots of spangley tutus and to show off her fetching figure but all too soon the light hearted days are over. Angela falls off a pair of stilts breaks her ankle and Gino takes her to Naples to seek medical assistance. They settle down to a blissful yet poor existense always one step ahead of being evicted but a local gendarme observes Angela and tries to remember....The last part of the movie returns to the moody and atmospheric seediness of the film's beginning. Angela is taken back to the workhouse but is happy because she is convinced Gino will do great things. Oddly enough she doesn't tell Gino where she is going only requesting the policeman to let her have an hour with Gino who is celebrating his Mural commission!!! But Gino is not doing well he is suffering depression has lost his job and is drifting into the life of a barfly.The last ten minutes or so are magnificently stylized as Gino wanders along the waterfront looking for a girl to paint  one with the face of an angel whose soul he can show as being as black as night. Of course he finds his Angela and within a few moments all his dark thoughts are dispersed as they embrace at a church altar. Even though the story bordered on pretentious Frank Borzage showed why he was the master of romance in Hollywood.".

It was almost impossible to maintain that high artistic level but it did return for the closing reel. In between the story was rambling but it was saved by the freshness and enthusiasm of it's two stars.With the constant musical love theme Angela Mia played continuously throughout the movie the story is set in Naples as Angela sweet Janet Gaynor desperate for money for medicine for her ailing mother tries her hand at soliciting  she has seen how easy it is for other girls but men just don't seem interested in her. In desperation she steals for which she is bought before a magistrate and sent to the local workhouse for a year. She escapes and a chase through almost surrealistic streets sees her helped by a traveling carnival.One day she meets handsome Gino Charles Farrell he is a painter and his funny antics are drawing the crowds away from the circus!!! It is love at first sight  for Gino!! Angela hates men and says she will never love  silly Angela!! Being in a circus is a nice change of pace for Janet who gets to wear lots of spangley tutus and to show off her fetching figure but all too soon the light hearted days are over. Angela falls off a pair of stilts breaks her ankle and Gino takes her to Naples to seek medical assistance. They settle down to a blissful yet poor existense always one step ahead of being evicted but a local gendarme observes Angela and tries to remember....The last part of the movie returns to the moody and atmospheric seediness of the film's beginning. Angela is taken back to the workhouse but is happy because she is convinced Gino will do great things. Oddly enough she doesn't tell Gino where she is going only requesting the policeman to let her have an hour with Gino who is celebrating his Mural commission!!! But Gino is not doing well he is suffering depression has lost his job and is drifting into the life of a barfly.The last ten minutes or so are magnificently stylized as Gino wanders along the waterfront looking for a girl to paint  one with the face of an angel whose soul he can show as being as black as night. Of course he finds his Angela and within a few moments all his dark thoughts are dispersed as they embrace at a church altar. Even though the story bordered on pretentious Frank Borzage showed why he was the master of romance in Hollywood.";

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER NOTE this contains spoilers about Street Angel and its predecessor Seventh Heaven.Seventh Heaven is somewhere in the middle of the pack of silent films that are still seen today but in its day it was a huge success and it's no mystery why. With World War I less than a decade behind it Seventh Heaven 1927 offered shameless fulfillment of one of the most persistent fantasies of the war that your loved one believed dead will rise and come back to you if you just wish for it with all your heart. The film is mainly remembered as a proletarian Parisian romance between the sewerworker Chico Charles Farrell and the waif Diane Janet Gaynor set on a visually active representation of a Paris neighborhood in which the stars and the camera are always roaming over stairs and rooftops but the last act and climax are driven by the war and by Diane's wishing that her beloved will come back to her which struggling against great odds including having been blinded he does in a scene of sentimentality rendered with the kind of noholdsbarred brio that only the silent cinema with its booming organs and dreamlike absorption could achieve. Not surprisingly Street Angel was an attempt to make lightning strike twice with the same stars and director in another tale of lovers parted by circumstances bigger than themselves a theme Borzage would continue to explore not only in the third of his GaynorFarrell silents Lucky Star but throughout the 1930s in such films as Man's Castle in which it's the Depression History Is Made at Night a Titaniclike shipwreck and Three Comrades the rise of Nazism. Gaynor plays another waif driven in desperation to prostitution quite frankly portrayed arrested for theft while soliciting before she actually has to do anything sordid she escapes with a circus meets painter Farrell they fall rapturously in love and then a policeman remembers where he's seen her. She goes away in secret rather than let Farrell know her shame but alas he turns to drink in disappointment at the perfidy of women and in the big climax it is not that he must crawl back to her from the dead but that she must convince him of her purity before he does what a man's gotta do. Using a similar moving camera on a stage setlike cityscape but with lighting far more influenced by German Expressionism than Seventh Heaven the result of following Sunrise in production at Fox no doubt Street Angel is visually impressive but the plot and the attitudes that underlie it are repugnant it's one thing for a young couple to be torn apart by war it's another to be torn apart by your own sanctimony. And part of the reason we may find it unappealing is because we're not swept away by Farrell's character in this tale it's the kind of role that if it didn't kill his career outright certainly helped type him as a relic of the more florid silent era as sound progressed. One of the truisms of movies is that men happily in love are unwatchable dopes. Happy couples are in general undramatic to be interesting there needs to be some form of conflict before you find happiness in the fadeout your two families are feuding you're fighting like cats and dogs on the Twentieth Century your elderly father has hired a private detective to keep you and your sister out of trouble. But the man in particular stands a high chance of looking like a big emasculated idiot if he just spends the movie gooning at his gal. Borzage's Man's Castle 1932 shows how to do this right Spencer Tracy does manly stuff out in the world to try to get by while Loretta Young tries to make them a happy home on no money. Street Angel does it all wrong Farrell who has a strapping physique and handsome face but a little pursed mouth just stares and moons at Gaynor like a lovesick beagle which means we already can't stand him by the time he turns out to be a moralistic jerkslashpretentiousartiste. It doesn't help that the early soundtrack breaks into either whistling or saccharine serenading on a regular basis. I guess we can be grateful that no one yodels.Film fans may find delights in Borzage's photography and in Gaynor's more appealing performance as the longsuffering gal but today at least Street Angel proves to be the least appealing of the trilogy next to Seventh Heaven or Lucky Star.".

	schema:headline " Onethird of an Oscar";
	schema:reviewBody "In the first year of the Academy Awards the voting was based on the performer's entire body of work for that year. Thus Emil Jannings won the first Best Actor Oscar although they weren't cried 'Oscar' yet for two films he made in 1928 whilst Janet Gaynor won the first Best Actress Oscar for three films she made that year. One of her three films was 'Street Angel' so her starring role in this film has to be reckoned as onethird of an Oscarwinning performance. But surely Gaynor's magnificent and multilayered performance in 'Sunrise' deserves most of the credit for that award. 'Sunrise' is such a masterpiece it's hard to see how 'Street Angel' could compare with it.This film takes place in Naples where 'street angel' is apparently the term for a prostitute. Janet Gaynor usually played virginal good girls. Here she gets arrested for prostitution. Impressively the script avoids the easy excuse of making Gaynor a victim of mistaken arrest. Instead through clever but plausible script machinations Gaynor's heroine has legitimate reasons for feeling some guilt and stigma for being a prostitute while making it clear to the audience that she hasn't actually done the deed. As an Italian peasant girl Gaynor impressively uses Neapolitan hand gestures and head movements in a few scenes but does not employ them consistently.As to leading man Charles Farrell the less said the better. Gaynor and Farrell were the most popular romantic team in silent films but I've always found Farrell impossibly goodlooking without the acting ability to match. His portrayal of an embittered paraplegic in 'Lucky Star' is his only performance that deeply impressed me.Gaynor typically played goodgirl roles in an interview she noted 'I was the essence of first love' so I was pleasantly surprised by her appearance here in a circus costume that shows off her exquisite figure in black tights and leotard. While Gaynor balances upsidedown the camera lingers from her slippershod feet downwards along her extended legs to her torso. What a woman! Gaynor who usually dressed much more modestly is clearly delighted to have this chance to show her stuff.The production design is exquisite with dozens of highly individualised stucco buildings. They actually look like a street in Naples not a movie set. Henry Armetta restrains his histrionics for once. Natalie Kingston is enticing as a local slut named Lisetta. In his brief role as an Augustestyle circus clown I was very impressed with an obscure actor named Louis Liggett who died shortly after this film was released he shows real talent here.The plot of this film is soapopera bathos the most interesting thing about it is that Gaynor's character serves a year in the workhouse conveniently getting sprung on the same day as her rival Lisetta even though the latter was arrested much later and then she emerges wearing a surprisingly stylish pair of highheeled pumps are these prisonissue in Italy? I'll rate this movie 5 out of 10 mostly for Gaynor's nuanced performance and partly for the brief scenes of her performing in black tights.".

Now 19271928 was an amazing time for Gaynorshe was the top actress in Hollywoodhaving received an Oscar for Best Actress. Oddly in those days you could receive an Oscar for a collection of performances that year. Gaynor was being honored for Sunrise Seventh Heaven and Street Angeland the least of these clearly is Street Angel. While it also features amazing cinematography that makes Gaynor seem luminous it just doesn't rise to the same level as the other two films. Worth seeing? Sure...just understand that the end will probably frustrate you.The film in many ways is like a reworking of Les Misrables and combining it with a romance. The film begins with dirtpoor Gaynor in a dilemmaher mother will die unless she gets her medicine. However because they have no money Gaynor must either let the old lady die or somehow earn some money...fast. When she sees prostitutes walking the streets outside their apartment she decides to give it a try. But she looks so innocent and nonsexy that no one is interested. Finally in desperation she steals a few coins. She is caught and sentenced to a year in jail for prostitution though there were no takers and theft. She manages to rather easily escape and establishes a new life with a swell fellow her perennial costar Charles Farrell. But she's afraid to tell this bohemian artist about her arrest as he envisions her as the essence of purity. For a while things are great but eventually the law catches up to her and she is imprisoned. Farrell decides she isn't the woman he thought she was and starts up life without her. So far all this is quite moving and exceptional.How all this eventually ends is sweet but very very heavyhanded and silly. This is odd since the film in some ways is very open in discussing prostitution and is a rather adult filmmaking it seem very modern. But at the same time the ending is so corny and old fashioned it seems like a bizarre blend of the old and the new. Worth seeing of course but NOT until you've seen Sunrise and Seventh Heaven.By the way the version I saw on DVD was not from the Fox box set which tends to have excellent prints but from a minor distributor. As a result the print was occasionally rough and could have used further restoration.".

	schema:reviewBody "This one has the strengths and weaknesses of the late silent films. It is not as good as 'Sunrise' but it has some wonderful bw deep field shots with a distant town down a mountainside and a busy harbor for a background. Also  some fine Monetlike fogbound portside shots with the characters walking in silhouette toward each other. Some of the scenes are too long and too sentimental  to show off Janet Gaynor's skill at pathos and the theme music and whistling is badly overused. But the portrait which becomes Madonnaized as an old master does capture Gaynor's pure character.

	onyx:emotionText "This one has the strengths and weaknesses of the late silent films. It is not as good as 'Sunrise' but it has some wonderful bw deep field shots with a distant town down a mountainside and a busy harbor for a background. Also  some fine Monetlike fogbound portside shots with the characters walking in silhouette toward each other. Some of the scenes are too long and too sentimental  to show off Janet Gaynor's skill at pathos and the theme music and whistling is badly overused. But the portrait which becomes Madonnaized as an old master does capture Gaynor's pure character. It is taken from the lovers as her purity is for the time being stolen from her but then in the final scene the image and reality are reunited. In a sense the Madonna blesses the two reunited lovers.

	schema:headline " One of Borzage's best";
	schema:reviewBody "By the late 20s director Frank Borzage was really starting to find his rhythm. He was always prolific and his films were largely successful but his unique brand of romanticism was starting to take inspiration from German Expression and in particular the work of F.W. Murnau. The late 20s saw him direct 7th Heaven Street Angel and Lucky Star  all huge successes and all starring the glamorous pair of actors Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell. These movies helped establish Borzage as a champion of the lower classes where he would find human souls made great by love and adversity. Street Angel was of his finest and most unjustly forgotten pictures and while it boasts a Naples setting described as laughterloving careless sordid Borzage is keen to highlight how a decent and honest person can be left humiliated and shunned by society for a moment of sheer desperation born out of poverty.The film introduces our heroine Angela Ganyor as she is receiving some devastating news from the local doctor her desperately sick mother will die without urgent medical treatment only Angela is so poor that she can't afford the medicine required to make her mother better. With seemingly no other option Angela takes to the streets to solicit men and when that doesn't work she looks to thievery. She is caught redhanded and is charged not only for attempted theft but also for prostitution becoming the 'street angel' of the title. The court sentences her to a year of hard labour but knowing her mother is alone and dying Angel manages to escape custody. On her return home she finds her mother already dead draping her lifeless arms around her in a desperate plea for affection. With the police now hunting her Angela joins up with a travelling circus who welcome the beautiful lady with open arms despite her recent runins with the law.Time with the circus folk toughens Angela up. She vows to go on fighting and turns her back on the idea of love. If you've ever seen a romantic movie then you'll know where the story is going and soon enough a young artist named Gino Farrell has his head turned by the charming tightrope walker. They fall in love but an accident means the couple must return to Naples a city which threatens to expose Angela's past and send her back to jail. The story is predictable enough but Borzage finds real poetry in this tale of two lovers brought together by fate. Murnau's Sunrise had been released just a year before and Borzage had clearly taken notice. From a purely visual standpoint Street Angel is one of the most innovative movies of its time. The camera feels constantly in motion as it navigates Angel's treacherous path with a looming sense of unease and settles down to savour the small beautiful moments of Angela and Gino's romance. It all leads to a breathtaking final scene that takes place in a world of deceptive shadows and fog a moment which may bring our lead characters together again for the final time. It's the work of cinematographers Paul Ivano and Ernest Palmer and it's one of the most splendid sights in silent cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "As much as I love silent cinema and can usually enter into the spirit of the emotions and story telling techniques of the 20's this film left me sorely disappointed.SEVERAL SPOILERSThe first half hour was rather grim and quite promising as the waif like character played by Gaynor tried everything she could to save her mother including a half hearted attempt at soliciting and a little thievery. All to no avail and worse still she get's caught and  arrested. These scenes are handled in an atmospheric and brooding way with excellent photography and a good synchronised score.She escapes from prison and goes to the circus where for a short time she's successful. She meets and falls for Charles Farrell a performer in a rival troupe and all is well until one day the prefect of police and the man who arrested her happen to pass by as she is performing her trapeze act. In fright she falls and is too badly hurt to continue performing. Unable to continue in the circus she and Farrell sail across the river and set up a platonic home in town where she must fear that arrest could come suddenly. She keeps the secret of her criminal past from Farrell for fear that he will dessert her.Up to the point they leave the circus I really enjoyed this film Gaynor and Farrell were appealing and the sequence where he rows her across the river to safety is beautiful done but once they set up home the film degenerated into an unbearably slow and mawkish romance and Janet's child like or in this case just childish persona began to grate badly.For one thing these two relatively adult looking people were living together in a situation so chaste it was laughable. Why they couldn't just make up their minds to be a couple was beyond me although this undoubtedly points to the standards of the time. I can see the film is aiming for a fairy tale feel  and  presumably for audiences in '28 it achieved it but for me the result was quite different. But more importantly the sense of drama that drove the first half hour is completely dissipated by these overlong and meandering scenes. Another thing that really wore me down was the repeated motif of the film where the two would whistle sweetly to each other. The first time it was cute but after about the eighth time I wanted to strangle them.After what seemed like an eternity of this bland pair's simplistic billing and cooing I was actually pleased when the law caught up with her and she was hurled back in jail. At least they wouldn't whistle that damned tune again. But oh no now they do it in a split screen effect. aaaargh I'm tearing my hair out!!!The last 10 minutes or so actually improved as there was a very real possibility that now Farrell knew her sinful past he might well kill her.However by this time the film had killed my interest and I really didn't care anymore. Maybe some day I'll see it again and feel differently who knows. If I do you can be sure I'll review it here.".

For this reason I do not find Gaynor's character very appealing or sympathetic at all. She's definitely no angel in this movie. I feel sorry for the painter guy.

Many of Borzage's dramas were overly sentimental and full of implausible plot developments but his touch was usually light enough to overcome these tendencies. Not so in this film. The melodrama is ladled on so thick you can barely see the movie through the syrup and the film takes forever to get around to the resolution the viewer can see coming a mile away.Street Angel was oddly also nominated at the following year's Academy Awards in the categories of Art Direction Harry Oliver and Cinematography Ernest Palmer.

Gaynor comes off somewhat better as a circus performer with an illicit past who initially rejects all men and love but then predictably falls in love with the painter's idealism and optimism. The sets are wonderful also operatic in atmosphere especially in the street scenes. There is an excruciatingly long goodbye scene where unbeknownst to Farrell Gaynor must leave him to pay her debt to society. Yet the movie could have been saved if it ended with the melodramatic scene with Farrell finally learning the truth choking Gaynor in a side altar of a church under the picture of her he had painted previously. The Madonna symbolism is pretty obvious. Unfortunately in literally the last five minutes a happy ending destroys the entire spirit of the movie.".

	schema:headline " a kind of prototype for Kurosawa's future films aside from being a fine debut";
	schema:reviewBody "There's a great small scene about ten to fifteen minutes into Sanshiro Sugata where the young and inexperienced Sugata who has just gotten into a turbulent streetfight is told by a judo instructor the one he wants to be his instructor that he has no humanity at least not to be fighting Judo and that giving judo skills to one without humanity is like giving a knife to a lunatic. Did Akira Kurosawa know that one of his paramount concerns as a filmmaker would be to tell stories where characters were faced with this problem of either gaining appropriate humanity or losing it or having the difficult but rewarding task of embracing it for himherself? Probably not exactly at the least that his other end of the career spectrum Madadayo would be precisely concerned with this ideal of a man having to deal with self worth and the skills that one's been given in life properly and with humility and in essence Kurosawa himself as a director. But it's of interesting note at least in the scope of his first film Sanshiro Sugata Judo Saga which contains many of the trademarks of a Kurosawa film and at the same time the fiery passion if only in big spurts of a filmmaker right on the edge of a career for Toho studios.There are little notes to take for Kurosawa fans little things that will give many a grin and even a laugh at what pops up the classic wipes as means of scene transitions the usage of slowmotion during an actionfight sequence in this case at the end of a fight as the opponent conks out and the flag this part in slowmotion falls to the ground Takashi Shimura who appeared in more Kurosawa films than Mifune as one of Sugata's opponents who's a tough cookie but a fair fight who at the end gives Sugata praise as a great fighter symbolism in usage of the sky flowers and other Earthly means as a way to communicate the environment of a scene and a specific nature about it as much as the characters in it. All the same this is not to say that Sanshiro Sugata is exactly a masterwork right off the bat for the 32 year old filmmaker the use of certain symbols like when Sugata is in the mucky pond trying to have his own form of penance and snaps out of it once seeing a flower right in front of his face isn't really as effective as intended and comes off as more of a clich than anything else. The subplot with Sugata and the daughter is undercooked as romance even as brief as it is. And the fact that the film now stands as missing 17 minutes is a hindrance one has to comment on what remains as opposed to what could have been a complete work from Kurosawa not as detrimental as the Idiot but still bothersome all the same as in the titlecard transitions.But as an act of passionate action filmmaking it stands its ground some 60 years later in containing some intense scenes involving Sugata's training I liked seeing Sugata coming face to face with a man who wants to challenge his boss and dressed in more Western garb than anyone else in the film and more specifically the actual fight scenes. While its a given that Kurosawa is a pro at getting down stubborn men and professional traditionalist men for that matter getting down and dirty and violent it's impressive in hindsight from the rest of his career that he could add tension just by tilting the camera up during the streetfight or in staying on the faces of the fighters and numerous reaction shots during the fights in the arena area. The Shimura fight especially has an aura of being as thrilling as a modern fight sequence with aforementioned humanity coming through with every pummel and thrust and tossup of one character over another. This all leads up to the climax which is not only a highlight of the film but a highlight in the history of classic Japanese action sequences as we see Kurosawa already relying on the sky the grass pushed and pulled by wind and the compassion of the others around the two opponents the old man and the girl as a fight to the death seen mostly out of sight through the grass proceeds intensely more due to the intent and emotion of the characters than traditional stunts and fastpace editing.Sanshiro Sugata is a worthy production in the cinematic cannon of Kurosawa acting as a very good standalone effort for genre fans while speaking to his practically intuitive cinematic strengths at controlling the pace of a scene and meaning via certain visual cues and enjoyable performances garnered by the pro actors. It does show some of its age and along with the cuts made in the only version available today in a print by the way that is rather horrid considering who the director is it had to face some given restrictions due to Japan's censorship laws but it's also a cunning display of a debut showcasing the talents of a confident director in a film that was meant to be seen by a mass audience if only for diversion during the war.".

	schema:headline " AN EARLY MASTERPIECE? NOT QUITE BUT...";
	schema:reviewBody "Kurosawa's first feature. It is an action film but not of the samurai genre. Nevertheless we can already notice Kurosawa's outstanding use of editing techniques that give an amazing sense of movement and speed to the judo fight sequences. He will later develop these techniques to greater effects in more famous films such as Seven Samurai Throne of Blood and Yojimbo.Two sequences are particularly remarkable. The first one occurs at the beginning of the film. Members of a rival jujitsu school which Sanshiro had joined that night ambush Yano the founder of Judo. Even though outnumbered Yano manages to throw all his opponents in the river nearby. Whereas the camera focusing on the gang pans continuously and is almost always in motion the shots of Yano waiting for them to attack are always static. This contrast in shots suggests Yano's fighting skill superiority as well as a greater physical and mental control of himself. Sugata is impressed and rapidly helps Yano to pull the rickshaw left abandoned by its owner. For this he gets rid of his geta shoes. They leave but the camera is fixed on the shoes. We see them getting worn out bystanders kick them a dog bites them rain  snow fall on them. Eventually we see one of the shoes stuck on a grille. The next sequence starts with a crane shot of a narrow street where Sugata is seen surrounded by a threatening crowd. He moves frantically backs and forwards throwing people to the ground. He is now a judo master. We have not seen his training but the shoes sequence has provided a metaphor of this achievement suggesting that Sugata has been through a painful and tough training. Even though he is learned the judo techniques he has not achieved the mastery of Yano. He lacks the restraint and coolness of Yano. His fighting resembles that of the members of the jujitsu gang who had attacked his master previously. The next sequence shows Yano telling him that he lacks control over his emotions he has achieved some a physical skill but not a spiritual one. The next sequence I would like to talk about occurs at the end of the film. Sugata is seen having dinner with Hansuke Murai played by Shimura Takashi and whom Sugata had previously defeated in combat and his daughter Sayo who is very fond of Sugata. The dinner is interrupted by the abrupt appearance of Gennosuke Higaki a jujitsu fighter wearing western clothes and smoking cigarettes who challenges Sugata to a duel to death. Higaki's entrance is accompanied by wind. Wind is used as a metaphor for the threatening West. This motif will be later used in Yojimbo for the arrival of Tatsuya Nakadai carrying a revolver to the town a sign of Western power. This is the only suggestion made in the film pointing at Japan being at war even though it was made for war propaganda. The scene then moves to the actual duel which takes place on a hillside. The wind is still blowing and clouds are seen passing really fast above their heads. Kurosawa's use of weather to complement the feelings of the characters is outstanding and will become of his trademarks later in his career.".

Some edits are inexplicable and some scenes are muddy.Having said that you will find this to be one of Kurasawa's most interesting projects. Two things...One is that this was made by the bad guys during the war. Incredible atrocities were being committed in the name of racial superiority and the supposition of a refined nobility. Japanese German and American films even Italian ones turned to reinforcing the national character. In the Japanese case that was linked to matters of honor refracted through Shinto spirituality honor of a past ideal that never really existed which in US terms means what conservatives tout.It was a terrible exercise more obvious in looking at it from the outside and knowing the context. Kurosawa's story was every bit as engineered for this purpose as any Reifenstahl project. Oddly this film is fragmented because the sensors thought it not ennobling enough. One presumes that Kurosawa's moments of reflection and possibly a whole love story were among the half of the movie that was removed. So just on the level of the story itself a modernized samurai tale its of interest.But it IS Kurasawa so we have to pay attention to the way the camera engages with the space. This is his very first film as director though he had written before. In all his films he registers the camera first in a space and then allows action to happen in that space. He has three periods of different types of spatial identity each illuminating each inventing new language. But this is before all that and what we have is clear overt experimentation with space. Some of it is quite thrilling quite independent of the fascist movement of the story proper.Even here he is breaking the rules of flat Japanese composition from eons of painting. He was considered unJapanese in his native country and never very popular. So at the same time that those censors were chopping story and posture they must have been shaking their heads at this three dimensional art and wondering if they had already lost the war  and if they won what for?Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

The 91minute restored film we know today is still missing important scenes. Here is a short history of that censorship.According to a very interesting online article by Walter Klinger the film was submitted to two distinct forms of censorship. First of all during production from government censors urging Kurosawa to make a film glorifying Japanese warriors and their spirit of devotion to chuukou i.e. loyalty and devotion understood as an infallible principle requiring absolute loyalty to one's superiors and blind obedience to orders a principle that made Kamikaze pilots possible. In the pond scene Sanshir's master urges him to follow chuukou and after his nighttime revelation Sanshir bows obediently to his master.In the postwar period all references to this principle were outlawed by the General Headquarters of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Forces SCAF  the occupying Americans as an antisocial remnant of Japanese feudalism which was perceived as the root cause of Japan's stubborn refusal to surrender. Not only was the chuukou word excised from that scene in midsentence and never put back in even in the restored version but all subsequent editions of the novel the film was based on even in anim or manga form or in film remakes and sequels were also excised for the same reason which means that the hero was reduced to finding satori in other more universal Zen sources or nuanced feelings such as the love of his beloved the realization of his own selfishness or respect for his master.As postwar young Japanese people weren't particularly fond of chuukou to begin with especially as it concerned blind devotion to tradition and unconditional loyalty to one's parents or employers this was not seen as a major problem.The SCAF however also outlawed scenes of feudal loyalty cruel violence and the undemocratic idea of revenge feudal commodities for which the Japanese public never really lost its tremendous appetite and which eventually became the main themes of Yakuza samurai and martial arts films. Furthermore martial arts including judo with their stigma of warrior's ways and blind obeisance were also banned from governmentsponsored settings like schools and police departments until 1950 at the very time when they were conquering the rest of the civilized world including America.".

It's tough to say that about a movie with martial arts where violence abounds but Kurosawa's subtle approach to character development and mood carry this film above and beyond. Even those who don't look for the art in films will see the beauty of this direction.  The definition of characters is difficult to follow in the early scenes but Susumu Fujita does a marvelous job with his portrayal of anunsure judo student.  Definitely a film that deserves your full attention.".

Sugata Sanshiro proudly carries his name. Man of the people attending a school of Jiu Jitsu a martial art which derive Judo a risky way to debug the techniques paradoxically called art of softness. But when he meets the skill of the master judoka Yano Sanshiro decides to become his student and then faced the challenges that will give him a place in the new institute.What follows then are the circumstances of life that prove the man to his ideals and give opportunity to specify the strength of their inclinations. For it is with chiselases which are polished gems and it is with fire that demonstrates the strength of the metal. But there are things that weigh in man as love is born and who never wants to hurt and then when man is forced to the difficult choice between self interest or what benefits the group.I think Sugata Sanshiro was a good start for the master Kurosawa. The film denotes human sense defending the rules and the collective interest as it should be but also understands the meaning of love and compassion and rejoices as they deserve. The director shows fairly distanced with the scenes of violence and although I'm sure weighed and weighed now more than ever this gives a clear account of its central goal was the feeling and no physical force. After all is in being and not in the domination as a man can know himself and as the teacher Yano saysThe way is the search for truth that governs the nature of man as this is what will give us a peaceful death. It must have been that this first film was well received at the box office since two years later the third Akira Kurosawa film continue the story with the title Soku Sugata Sanshiro. There is only regrettable that so valuable a work with moments of undeniable beauty plastic and is committed to a positive outlook on life Japan's clumsy censorship of the time perhaps there will not be clumsy censorship? has cut about 600 feet which may never recover and leave the film in some way unfinished. Against all I think any fan of the great Japanese filmmaker should be deprived of seeing this remarkable debut.".

From here the film proceeds at a fast clip aided by some crude chopping done by contemporary censors to set what proved to be the blueprint for the Asian action flick. And frankly few future films have improved on it. Kurosawas imaginative camera work and brilliant editing keeps the whole thing very watchable and the subtlety of the character development is still well in advance of the typical modern action film. The famous scene where Sugata finds himself stuck in a muddy pond trying to find some sort of enlightenment is still fascinating and beautiful. And typically the film ends with an amazing fight scene  the fight choreography might be primitive by todays standards but the glorious moonlit mountain top scenery is still thrilling  its been imitated numerous times but why watch the imitators when the original is still best? You can of course say this about pretty much any Kurosawa film.I saw this on the Australian Mad Men DVD. The print quality is pretty poor and the translation isn't great. And it would have been nice if they had done more work to reconstruct the original cut  some deleted scenes are added as extras. I suspect the original Kurosawa cut was much better sadly we may never see it.".

The quality of the print was very poor though MUCH worse on the sequel and the captioning was beyond abominable! When my daughter saw part of it she immediately recognized the problem. It seems that many Japanese movies are released by Chinese companies so the movie is translated from Japanese to Chinese and finally to Englishand so much was lost in the translation it practically ruined the experience. For example JUDO is translated as either Karate or Kung Fu in the movie. If you don't know much about martial arts there is a world of difference between them. For two movies about Judo the word NEVER appears in the subtitled version! Also countless sentences simply make no senseit's as if the words are almost random at times.Now as far as the movie itself goes this is a purely ordinary film with very little of the magic of later Kurasawa films. It is a not particularly involving movie about a judo master. Some of the cinematography and acting is very good and at other times it isn'tit's obvious Kurasawa is still learning his craft. Also part one is ruined by the fact that part two is a worse film in most ways so the viewer never really gets a payoff for seeing the conclusion.".

	schema:reviewBody "Viewed on DVD. Restoration  eight 8 stars score eight 8 stars subtitles  eight 8 stars lighting  four 4 stars. Director Akira Kurosawa's first released film exhibits uneven interscene direction and an overall lack of energy and excitement. The directorial reins are often not held with a firm hand and occasionally seem to be dropped completely. The plot revolves around the fierce competition between two schools of handtohand combat during the late 1800's and accordingly contains the ingredients for a heavyduty action movie. But Kurosawa's execution is generally limp with the exception of the first street fight that kicks off the film. Interior arena i.e. tournament shots fail to capture much of the excitement and action the viewer might be expecting to see the actors seem to be performing many of their own stunts and professional stunt men seem be in very short supply. It gets worse. The climatic grudge fight which the film has been building up to is all but hidden from the viewer it takes place in a field of tall grass which pretty much obscures what is happening! The opening credits indicate that a portion of the film was removed by Japanese military authorities and it's interesting to speculate on what may have been censored and where censorship may have occurred. But judging from the extant print the one allowed to be exhibited circa 1943 the film could have benefited from the removal of even more footage on artistic rather than political grounds! Cinematography narrow screen black and white is fine although interscene lighting is startlingly uneven. The latter adds to the bumpy road encountered by the viewer film fluidity is poor and the nutsandbolts of the editing process are on full distracting display. Film score is excellent but totally Western. Subtitles are just right and show that the writer knows herhis grammar. Restoration is quite good except it missed vertical wear lines and dirt toward the end of the movie. WILLIAM FLANIGAN PhD".

It has since been remade five times and Japanese censors cut 17 minutes from it that has never been recovered.Based on the life of Shiro Saigo Who one of the earliest disciples of Judo. Sanshiro is a hot headed young man who travels to the city in order to learn Jujitsu only to discover a new form of self defence Judo. Among the path there is love and rivals that would make your typical high school teen movie blush.Though there is nothing wrong with the movie I personally wouldn't rush yourself to see it. Whilst it has moments and methods Kurosawa would be particularly know for it somewhat remains a relic given the censorship he faced from the times. One scene in particular that lasts when reminiscing is our hero chucking himself into a lake in order to prove himself. But I would only recommend this film to certain enthusiasts of Mr. Kurosawa's work and even then I would rather sit you through one of his more famed masterpieces. If you really want to see Kurosawa put through obscure limitations then check out Drunken Angel 1948 where he managed to cleverly work around some U.S Government censorship.Final Verdict A harmless story that proved popular among audiences enough for a sequel.

It involves the story of an arrogant young man who wants to be taught by a Judo master but is so full of himself that he is unwilling to put in the effort or follow the instructions. He ends up in a pond where he spends the entire night in the swampy water until he makes up his mind to be a part of the master's school. Once he does this he kills a man who challenges him and he becomes a legend. This brings out people who want to knock the pegs out from under him. Of course there is one really bad guy who is determined to fight him to the death. This is a bit fragmented since much of it was lost but it holds together pretty well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Akira Kurosawa is widely known as one of the twentieth century's greatest directors responsible for masterpieces like Rashoman Ikiru and The Seven Samurai. But every director must begin somewhere. John Ford got his start on Bwesterns. Steven Spielberg began with Duel the story of a man being chased down a desolate stretch of highway by a homicidal bigrig trucker. And Kurosawa started with that most Asian of genre films the martial arts movie.Sanshiro Sugata subtitled Judo Saga tells the story of a young man who seeks to learn jujitsu but upon seeing his prospective sensei thwarted in an attack on a rival instructor chooses to follow this man and his new art of judo. Don't expect any nefarious plots by criminal syndicates with innocent lives hanging in the balance. Sanshiro Sugata is more like an American boxing film in that it focuses mainly on the hero's personal development and his rise to become a great fighter.And rather than the flying kicks and fists of fury that characterize modern entries in the genre this movie uses pure judo and jujitsu which consists of the combatants struggling shoulder to shoulder seeking to throw the other with only the occasional block or legsweep. The fighting here is simple but authentic and fairly well staged. In between the fights we see Sanshiro train develop a budding romance and learn that a warrior's spirit is as important as his skill. There is of course a villain instantly recognizable as such because of his resemblance to Snidely Whiplash and of course they fight before it's all over.I must confess that the villain is never given much characterization nor is his hatred for Sanshiro explained. More interesting is Murai an aging jujitsu master who faces Sanshiro in the annual police tournament. He is fighting for the honor of his dojo and to make his daughter proud. Their match pitting Murai's skill and experience against Sanshiro's strength and agility was the movie's high point for me.The film's low budget does show at times mainly in the set pieces and the low quality of the night shooting. More seriously the significance of some scenes isn't clear and others felt like they should have been developed further such as when the daughter of a fallen rival seeks vengeance on the hero. However this may be due to the fact that wartime authorities cut a great deal of footage most of which was never recovered.Sanshiro Sugata is a long way from the kind of movies Kurosawa would be making just a few short years later but it's not bad for a debut film and there are signs of the greatness he would later achieve.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though the story presented in Sugata Sanshiro might not be the most appealing one it's still a considerably enjoyable tale about the beginnings of Judo and its most prominent representative the titular Sugata played by Susumu Fujita in a role that earned him a notable spot in the Japanese cinematic history. It's a simple and modest but a truly elaborate and serious tale of one man's difficult journey to martial arts stardom. In order to find peace in life and achieve perfection in the craft that he's been practicing for some time Sanshiro needs to come to terms with his own emotions and find a right path which might eventually lead him to the desired golden mean. Based on a bestselling novel Sugata Sanshiro established the reputation of Kurosawa and made him a prominent figure in the filmmaking business. Though it's far from being a genuine masterpiece the film still shows the director's steady hand and is the admirable proof of his aweinspiring versatility.To become the master of martial arts is an uneasy task and Sanshiro learns the lesson in the first minutes of the picture. Trying to join a clan of Jujitsu fanatics he quickly realizes that they're just a bunch of up to no good coxcombs. Seeing how easily Yano Denjir kchi the originator and master of Judo defeated the group Sanshiro decides to become his student. To become a proficient Judo technician the young strongwilled yet somehow reckless Sugata must overcome many of his weaknesses and find out the meaning of a warrior's way thus learning the true meaning of life. The student struggling to accustom himself to the situation is constantly tested by his master in many more or less laborious ways. And when the time comes Sanshiro is finally able to take part in tournaments in order to prove his indisputable technique and unrestrained power. On his way Sanshiro meets a mysterious elegant devilish man by the name of Hagaki Rynosuke Tsukigata who's like a shadow that's been following Sugata everywhere that he goes. Ironically so the man  with his familiar look and specifically evil attitude  comes as a typical dark character taken straight out of a superhero movie. In the film's most climatic and disquieting sequence the two rivals participate in a duel that will determine who's the strongest living martial artist.For all the lovers of Japanese culture and for all the adepts of Asian martial arts Sugata Sanshiro will definitely be a worthy film experience. For the rest it might be an insightful valuable and wellcrafted period drama that's not only full of perfectly choreographed action scenes but also full of humane qualities that prove to have an authentic meaning even in the modern times.".

Scott Adkins is also an incredibly adept martial arts performer and comes off as an appropriately menacing villain. Michael Jai plays George Chambers with all the hubris and latent anger you could want but also with an undertone of humor not present in Ving Rhames' portrayal of the character. The last reviewer made a good point about this film having an 80's action feel to it. There's a nononsense brutality to the fighting that you don't often see these days. This is no Jackie Chan hitemwithabroomstick fest. Think Rocky meets UFC. A definite adrenalinepumper!".

Even this time the creators made the fight scenes even more interesting mainly because this time you will see not only clear boxing as the previous Undisputed but also you'll see very exciting moves by kicks knees and even grappling. This time Chambers unlike the previous part will have to face much more devastating opponent in the person of the Russian prisoner Yurii Boika whose character will take your attention from the beginning of the movie with his splendid moves on the ring. In my opinion the character is created perfectly for the atmosphere of the movie. Those of you who'll watch the movie expecting something as good as the first part wont be disappointed at all just because the director presents one well known of the audience Jorge Chambers. In that movie he is the same tough and proud guy who becomes clearly that if you try to tell him what to do he would crush at least your nose. Namely that side in the Iceman's character to be proud fighting for his honor made him one of my favorite characters I've ever seen.".

The other delight about this film is that the the acting was very good and the ending was a real surprise that elevated the movie from a macho martial arts movie to one that had real emotion and humanity that anyone who still has a beating heart inside of him can relate to. I did not just like it because I am a martial artist and the fights scenes were superb I liked it because I was taken in and I began to care about the people and the characters.So many martial arts flicks lack this kind of substance and richness.

The producers could't have chosen better i mean they are spectacular.This movie should be on the TOP10 fight movies ever made in Hollywood. The Russian prison is well chosen the story would no be so spectacular if the action took place in an American prison.On top of it all.. GREAT MOVIE i recommend 910 rating and stop with the poor rating go and watch some other type of movie but don't rate this great movie so badly.".

	schema:headline " Brilliant fights truly unique!";
	schema:reviewBody "Bizarrely a sequel to a film no one saw about boxing only this time it's about kickboxing. Now surely there must be more to the plot? Well no it is essentially an excuse to have some downright superb fight scenes. Michael Jai White stars as George the Ice Man Chambers played in the original by Ving Rhames. He's not playing the Wesley Snipes character as we might have assumed considering White has been rumoured to be replacement Blade for Snipes and after all Snipes and White are both martial arts demon's.Anyway director Isaac Florentine has always shown a knack for filming fight scenes without ever really getting the rest particularly right. Similarly his films never really look too polished unable to look beyond their clearly meagre budgets. Similarly Florentine's previous films tended have bizarre mixes of time periods costumes etc to create non descript worlds which just came out as strange on film. Bridge Of Dragon's for example was a pretty bog standard kind of fairy tale action movie. Also his use of cartoony sound effects for every movement no matter how small become tiresome in previous flicks. For example someone would raise an eyebrow and it would be accompanied by a whoosh! Having said all that I enjoyed his previous films for the action and the cheesiness of them. But Florentine has reigned himself in here and in what is probably his most high profile and lavish production he has produced a kick ass action film. Previously too he never really got any particularly good performances form his cast be manages to here. White doe okay and has the build and a certain amount of charisma that makes you wonder why he's not competing in the DTV wars with the top dogs like Seagal Snipes and Van Damme. Strangely he's not much of an action star despite the huge muscular frame and martial arts prowess. Ben Cross also appears and as he did in the Lundgren flick the Mechanik he adds class to proceedings because he can act. He does well in making his supporting part memorable in a fairly tragic kind of role and he gives it some humanity and some humour. Ken Lerner too makes a welcome appearance playing a role we've seen many times before from him and he of course he'll always be remembered as the agent Arnold stabs in the back with a pen in Running Man. Eli Danker is also superb.However the real star of this piece is Scott Adkins the British born KickboxerGymnast here playing a Russian prison tournament champ. Adkin's not only has a good screen presence but like White is built like a brick outhouse and to add to that he's an amazing athlete for a guy so huge. If marketed right Adkins could be the next big action star he's got the ability to be one of the best. Adkin's performs some amazing gymnastic feats here. He's not a bad actor either and I think people will actually assume he's Russian so he does a good job here despite playing a comically two dimensional villains worthy of Ivan Drago himself. The fights are really well done. They feel unique too much down to Adkin's himself but also the great photography dolly and steadicam work.This may have a plot that could have been written on the back of a match box probably reading something along the lines of Michael Jai White is forced to fight Scott Adkin's twice! However the film looks polished thanks to Ross Clarkson's photography while Florentine is allowed to show some auterism that many DTV directors for hire aren't allowed to. It's simply a few situations that are thrown in to lead into fights but the fights come thick and fast and as well as that they are original and pretty awesome. Thankfully the cast are good enough to rise above the trite situations which is why it's important in these films to include guys like Ben Cross who can act.Overall this is a film that will no doubt gain cult status amongst martial arts fan's. It's the most Driveish film since Drive something simple yet for what it is brilliantly delivered. There's rumours of another sequel which I'd hope to see but truthfully if it didn't have Adkin's it would be sorely lacking a one man special effect. Adkin's is even better than Kong! ".

	schema:headline " Why did this movie not make it to the theatres?? No really why??";
	schema:reviewBody "Undisputed 2 could be one of the best action movies that you never seen. I mean really people if you never saw the first undisputed would you really even know what the heck undisputed 2 was about. Undisputed 2 never made it to theatres and the reason is beyond me really why on earth did this movie never make it to theatresI mean really how many saw films and other horrible movies do we need out there maybe because there is no big actors and the director is not really well known and so the movie was sent to Direct to Video and what a shame. Let's talk about what I just said I mean Micheal J White is not really a well known actor but he did come in a lot of movies I mean he in Universal Soldiger 2 and he was in Exit Wounds and he also was in Spawn but I don't think Hollywood ever really known what to do with him. Micheal is a excellent martial artist and he is a OK actor I mean he sure is a best action star than those Van Damme and Segal guys and he should be better known. The other actor is the really unknown actor is Scott Adkins who really should be better known. I mean a lot of kung fu movie fans will know you this guy is I mean he was in Unleashed with Jet Li in a bit part and he was also in Medallion with Jackie Chan I mean he was also in a lot of other action movies. Scott Adkins is really a excellent fighter and he does have the look and the acting chops to be the next big thing I mean really there is not really a big action star out there in the USA I mean Jackie and Jet are getting older and Van Damme and Segal are other there making some movies somewhere and there is Jason Statham who other making some action movies. But Scott Adkins needs to noticed and some producer needs to get him some work. The plot deals with Micheal J White character plays George Chambers a ex champion boxer George Chambers was played by Ving Rhames in the original who is in other country down on his luck making cheap commercials and going know where in his life and gets convicted of a crime and goes to jail wow what a day. In jail he see's that there is a underground figting ring and soon enough he has to do battle with Scott Adkins. Scott Adkins plays Yuri Boyka a Russian mix martial artist fighter who is the champion of the underground fighting ring and soon enough George and Yuri will have to do battle. But first George has to learn how to fight because he is a boxer and he has to learn mix martial arts so he gets fight lesson from Crot  Played nicely by Eli Danker who teaches him the way to fight. I mean that is all about the plot I mean really when the movie is called Undisupted 2 do really need the plot to be air tight no but what makes the movie different than your usual direct to video action movies is that the plot try's to have a plot with a little bit of heart and little bit of emotion which actually make's the movie above the norm. But the biggest selling point of a action movie is of course the ACTION and boy my friend do we get the action and action and did i say there was action. Isaac Florentine makes sure the action is shot well and we see all the fights in all their glory and the movie mixes good martial arts and boxing and just good direction the fight choreographer is J.J. 'Loco' Perry who really delivers the goods so much that it compares to some hong kong movies which you know it means it must be good and the fights are kinda short but boy do they deliver the goods. On my last point why is this director Issac Florentine not better known I mean i know this director and i know that all his films are lower budget than Hollywood movies are and maybe they suffer from some acting problems and some other issues but they deliver the good with great martial arts and gun battles and Issac is one of the only director in Hollywood that knows how to shoot action  no camera just jumping around YOU HEAR THAT Micheal BAY. I hope his next movie which looks freaking awesome will be great and it also stars Scott Adkins which should if all things go right could be his big break through. On final point go watch Undisputed 2 because it is one of the best diect to video movies ever and really this movie should have been in theatres and not that so called movie which is called i think Transformers 2 i mean really the make up budget for Megan Fox on Transformers 2 probably costed more money than the whole budget of Undisputed 2 Undisputed 2 get a B or A So there Thank You".

	schema:reviewBody "I voted Undisputed II last man standing a 10 largely due to the fact that it was one of those rare sequels that was better than it predecessor. It lacks the stare power of Undisputed but the story is just as powerful though it largely resembles the plot of the original and the fight sequences give you the rush of the original rocky films. This is the movie the original should have been. Both Michael Jai White and Scott Adkins have shown their ability to adapt their martial arts background into very believable choreographed fight scenes. Each scene not only delivers as well as keeps the viewer in anticipation they also set up powerful character development and progression. At times I wanted more from the film and in turn I sometimes the film went beyond its believability however all and all I thoroughly enjoyed Undisputed II and I look forward to seeing more from Michael Jai White and Scott Adkins.".

The purpose is to get Chambers to fight the prison's undisputed champ a big bully of a guy named Uri Boyka impressively played by Brit thesp Scott Adkins. Boyka fights with both hands and feet so Chambers must learn to fight the same way. He takes lessons from a fellow convict an old Russian general played by Eli Danker who is confined to a wheelchair but whose mind remains razorsharp. This film like the original is heavily padded with sporadic fight scenes and other bits of business like Chambers ending up in solitary with rats for cell mates and later being staked out in the bittercold prison yard. The ring matches are the best part of the movie and are amazingly staged and edited. In fact they are better than those in the first movie although UNDISPUTED 2 feels like a TV movie. I imagine it was an STV since there are no big names in it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I absolutely love every film Scott Adkins has a major role in and i thought Micheal Jai White was fantastic as Spawn so i was definitely satisfied with this well made low budget martial arts film.Where many feel the martial arts films of the 1970's and 1980's was the prime age of karate movies i disagree and believe the newer martial arts films are far better.Look at OngBak Fearless The Protector Unleashed Kung Fu Hustle The Transporter Transporter 2 and this film UndisputedLast Man Standing.While i'm not an enormous fan of martial arts movies i do watch them a lot due to my karate obsessed friend.Today he and I watched UndisputedLast Man standing and I'm surprised at the quality work put into this low budget movie.The storyline makes you root for Micheal Jai White as he's framed and put into a Russian prison there he is forced to fight a dangerous man in a mafia run UFC for prison inmates.This film focuses on the morality of selflessly helping others in need even without gaining anything but that feeling that you've done good it's overall a very uplifting movie that is more than pointless violence.The fight sequences are amazing as Scott Adkins shows off his stuntman skills with fast paced grappling punches and of course his signature spin kick.The actual fight scenes are shot at normal speed but when a punch or kick connects it freeze frames just as the shot connects and returns to normal speed a very exciting film technique that shows off some great karate moves.The dialog is solid and the lines that are meant for comic relief are actually funny a rarity with any film todaynot to mention the very British Scott Adkins putting on a very believable Russian accent and playing his character to perfection in fat all the actors played there characters to perfection.If UndisputedLast Man Standing received a theatrical release it could probably hold it's own against big budget martial arts films like The Transporter or Dead Or Alive.The flaws are in the pacing and a few of Micheal Jai Whites fight scenes without Scott Adkins as his attacks look very phony and the reactions are far too over the top but overall this is another good martial arts film that the year 2006 has to offer I now await the next martial arts movie Rogue.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Japanese sure have an unmatched talent for creating such unusual and unexpected projects creativity at its finest. What we have here is one of those films. The unique art style and story immediately caught my attention and thus I was naturally curious to check it out. IT WAS WORTH IT! This is the awardwinning Oblivion Island Haruka and the Magic Mirror.Plot 16year old Haruka had just lost her precious hand mirror given to her by her mother who died of a terminal illness long ago. Recalling an old story her mother used to read to her Haruka visits an old shine where she encounters and follows a strange foxlike creature named Teo to a mystical world called Oblivion Island. Here these fox creatures collect forgotten or lost objects from the human world and use them for their own purposes. As she befriend Teo and her long lost stuffed sheep Cotton Haruka must find her hand mirror before the island's ruler the Baron uses it for his own devious ends.From beginning to end this movie had an incredible effect on me. The characters are developed very well and they become lovable almost instantly. The art style combines CGI with traditional handdrawn animation to create a visuallystunning world full of interesting creatures and colorful environments. The music is quite memorable and it complements or enhances the mood of various scenes throughout the film. There's also some surprising bits of action which are thrilling to say the least.By far one of the biggest elements that makes Oblivion Island so great are some of the emotionality of the film. Each of the main characters has a charm matched only by their vulnerable qualities particularly the protagonist Haruka. Seeing her go through such an emotional journey as she searches for her lost mirror is heartwarming and it moved me a little. This characteristic in turn affects her friends such as Teo as they also have journeys of their own. It's like the old saying it's not the destination as is the journey which I totally agree.I can see why this movie won some awards and be nominated for others. Oblivion Island is a very unique family film that in my opinion deserves greater recognition in the world. The English dub done by Funimation is solid as is the original Japanese. With that said this charming film is worth every penny and I highly recommend that you check it out. Peace!".

I was wondering what would the moral be treat things with respect? Don't forget your stuff? Anyway my hopes were not that high and I expected something overly predictable. And what did I get? Well it wasn't a total opposite of what I thought it would be but it wasn't a clich storm either. I liked where the movie went and how it ended. It was a truly magical adventure that made me happy once I took it. I do not want to spoil anything so find it and watch it. There is a fansub a very good one floating around the Interwebs plus there is also a DVD release by Funimation planned for 2012.Now to the technical details Look 910. The character 3D models aren't the best in the industry but they are alive with emotion and move nicely. The backgrounds steal the show however since they are either handpainted or made to look like it. And the colors in everything are AWESOME.Length 1010. An hour and a half perfect for this film.Story 810 or 1010. It is not too complex but little details here and there make it perfect. Perfect for me at least. For this kind of movie I cannot imagine another story. But some viewers might find it too simple for their sofistik8ted tastes hence the possible rating of 810.Voice acting 1010. I only watched the fansub but I thought the lines were delivered with the right emotion for every scene.Music 1010. Hear it to believe it. I for one am going to hunt the down the soundtrack CD.Closing remarks  SEE IT.".

	schema:headline " Oblivion Island Haruka and the Magic Mirror 2009";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie opens with a stylized piece of animation that tells the audience about a race of fox spirits who sneak around your property stealing any of your possessions that've become neglected or unloved. This story is being told to little Haruka by her mother who's on her death bed. Haruka says she won't get visited by the foxes because she takes care of her possessions including a beautiful mirror that her mother gave her. I wonder where this is going.Fast forward about ten years to when Haruka is sixteen her father is working hard to support her and right off the bat Haruka comes off as a very unlikeable character. She walks into the house with a friend from school sees that it's still a mess and complains that her father doesn't clean the house often enough. She's angry that he drank her ginger ale as well as at the fact that he's rarely home. Because of his job. Where's the Facebook Parenting guy when you need him? Looking at her clock somehow reminds her of her mother's mirror which she lost several years ago so she visits a shrine to the fox spirits to ask for it back. Her keys fall behind the stairs to the shrine so she crawls underneath to get them back. She places them on the step but before she can get out a fox spirit runs up and takes them offering us our first actual plot hole of the moviewait for it. She follows him to the base of a tree where she gets sucked into Oblivion Island. She meets up with the terrified fox and accuses him of theft but he reassures her that he doesn't steal. He reclaims abandoned and neglected objects.Okay so there are two plot holes here. First of all yes he just STOLE her keys which had only been on the step for a few minutes. Not abandoned not neglected. And despite being a fox he didn't notice her there less than a foot in front of his face. And I'm sorry but if these fox spirits were really this careless we'd have captured at least one by now.Anyway he agrees to help her to get her mirror back which she believes must be down here. This is where the plot finally takes off and trust me the plot holes have just begun.Production wise Oblivion Island is pretty underwhelming. It's a fully CGI movie so it doesn't have the typical anime problems... Like low frame rates... But it's still really cheap looking. The style and quality of the animation seem like an awkward cross between Mr.Stain in Junk Alley and a Kingdom Hearts cut scene. The artwork is colorful and highly detailed but at the same time bland and gummy looking. There are times when it breaks away from this happy color palette like the real world scenes and a giant skeletal beast that they deal with late in the movie but for the most part this movie is visually unremarkable.The story is well paced and never boring but the amount of contrived plot twists and broken physics rules that they use to tell the story is absurd. At one point in the movie Te'othe fox spirit has to give a speech about humans not being all that bad although he's the only character who was ever afraid of her. He shows them a windup toy plane she built and they react like they've never seen one before. Her mirror was supposedly stolen from the Baron by some mysterious underground thieves but when they go underground to retrieve it there's nobody down there who looks capable of such a feat. Just creepy dolls slimy bugs and a sortacool giant monster that looks like a cross between a rancor and an ugly quilt.But my real problem with this movie above all else is the ending. As ridiculous and dumblyplotted as this movie was it could have been saved by having a smart ending. As it turned out when they came back to the surface with the mirror the Baron was waiting at that location... Somehow... and takes it along with his new prisoner Haruka. Now this is what I was hoping would happen Upon entering his castle Haruka notices that the Baron really does love and treasure her mirror. It's like a comfort blanket to him. Being without it for so long has driven him mad and having it back his life is complete again. She realizes that she doesn't need some mirror to remind her of her mother because the memories in her heart are enough. She agrees to leave this world empty handed but not empty hearted as she's taking a valuable life lesson and several steps towards maturity along with her.I won't tell you exactly what actually happens but to put it in broad strokes The Baron is a Bond villain and the mirror is a MacGuffin. The entire third act of this obviously easterninspired movie is an explosion of westernized clichs. Haruka learns to appreciate her father and her possessions but she never really grows or develops as a character because Spoiler alert she got exactly what she came for.I own a 12 inch stuffed Bulbasaur that my father won for me at a carnival when I was little. I still own it. It's on my dresser as we speak. But if one of my little cousins saw it and fell in love with it I'd surrender it in a heartbeat. Why? Because when you grow up your childhood relics deserve to be with someone who needs them more than you. Toy Story 3 nailed this idea and in a different way so did Labyrinth.Overall it's a pretty bad movie by all accounts but it's not terrible. It's watchable and safe and entertaining for younger audiences. It's not worth all of it's awards but it's worth a rental.".

Bergman's direction is polished and never detached while the film looks beautiful and is photographed every bit as strikingly. The music is hauntingly understated the right approach for the story Waiting Women is conveying while the writing is splendidas is the comic finale especially in the elevator sequence. The three stories that form the film are done in a heartwarming yet sincere way the first is a tad clichd and probably the weakest of the three but still does its job well while the second story was the one with the most heart and the third was the one with the most pleasantly funny moments. What really matters is that all three had subjects that anybody can identify with and dealt with them realistically. The characters weren't the most likable on the planet nor were they intended to be. That said I wasn't annoyed or frustrated by them. All six leads give deeply felt and believable performances Eva Dahlbeck and Gunner Bjornstrand are particularly noteworthy. Overall while not one of Bergman's best it is one of his more underrated films and is very well done. 910 Bethany Cox".

They converse and soon begin to tell each other the big stories of their lives. The first tells how she had an affair with her teenage sweetheart and how her husband reacts. The second tells of how she was seduced and became pregnant. And the third tells about how she once got her husband to admit his philandering when they were stuck in an elevator. Meanwhile in the framing episode a younger sister of one of the women has fallen in love with the fourth brother. The first and third stories are a little cliched especially the elevator sequence but they're still quite great. Being trapped in an elevator is a nice easy and overused way for two characters to solve problems but the dialogue between Gunnar Bjornstrand and Eva Dahlbeck is so excellent that it works out wondefully. The heart of the film is in the second story. It's so simple and welldone so utterly beautiful in its conception and execution. It is of course a flashback like the other two stories but the story itself is also told in flashbacks. It works far better than I would have ever guessed. Secrets of Women is an underrated Bergman film a mustsee for any fan. 910.".

There are also already some typical Bergman postures with one woman talking intensely and the one next to her staring vapidly past her downwards seemingly lost in her own inner world. All that in well and good but as soon as I heard the first monotonous monologue from the mother her eyes turning to heaven speaking of how she can not reach out to her husband not even to scratch his eyes out my Bergmanradar immediately hit the red zone. And surely enough we are in for group therapy all the way as each woman tells of one significant episode from their lives with their husbands. But it is a very elegant movie and along the way you become quite sympathetic even though all the stories describe infidelity and frigid bourgeous lives. My eye was caught by Eva Dahlbeck who I also recently saw in Sommarnje skes. Here at 32 she is sizzlingly hot. Overall it is a movie not to be missed by Bergman lovers if mainly for historical reasons. His next movie was Monika so this one can be said to commence his golden period. For the triviaconsumers IMDb informs that Eva Dahlbeck has recently filed for divorce after ahem 67 years of marriage. You go girl!".

Well starting in the 1960s to the 1980s these were the main themes of his movies but in some of his earlier films these are not so pervasivesuch as the movies The Devil's Eye a comedy and The Magician Ansiktet. Because of this they may be more approachable to the average viewer who would balk at the much more serious tone of such classics as Through a Glass Darkly deep depression Persona mental illness Autumn Sonata repressed anger and abandonment The Seventh Seal death and the plague or Fanny and Alexander child abuse and emotional neglect.The story is about a traveling group of hoaxters who put on a show combining magic and animal magnetism i.e. an early name given to hypnosis. When they arrive at a Swedish town they are forced to come to an audience with the local official and his cronies who want to prove that the act is a fraud. Bergman really doesn't try to resolve this issue but instead shows how the town officials are really rather petty and mean people. How this traveling group deftly survives this encounter is the main focus of the movie. I especially liked the portion of the movie about the autopsy. It sounds gross but I thought it was actually kind of funny. One of the officials is a cold and rather nasty doctor who longs for a chance to do an autopsy on the hypnotist. He gets far more than he bargains forthat's all I really want to sayotherwise it might ruin the suspense.So overall I liked the movie. It was not great but well acted and not the least bit depressing.".

Indeed there is some comedic material in this film reminiscent of Smiles of a Summer Night but don't mistake this movie for one of Bergman's less masterful light pieces this has real depth and substance.There are some amazing bits of cinematography especially the early scenes. The pacing of the movie is masterful as is the clever use of parallels in the story  the failed actor dying and then reviving is a prelude to the pivotal incident around Vogler's demise.Top notch scenes include Mrs Egerman opening up to Vogler  she seems so lost  also both scenes in which Bjornstrand's character Vergerus insists that he was not taken in by the magic.This is now in my Bergman top 5 which makes it a must see in my book.".

Without giving anything of the plot away I can say that The Magician is a reflection on Bergamn's role as a creator of illusions. He uses the story of a roving theatrical troupe with an magician to illuminate the metaphor. The apparently abrupt turn of events at the end is Bergman's signal that he is the master of your perceptions in this medium that he compares to the experience of dreaming. It is interesting to compare this film with Fellini's 8 12 another filmmaker's reflection on the process and meaning of filmmaking. Two very different sensibilities are at work in these two films but with surprisingly close parallels in their endings and involuted plots. I found this film highly satisfying on many levels even taken at its apparent face value as a romp. Seen a second time the illusionist begins to emerge more clearly from the moment the film opens with the lighting of the arc lamp of a film projector.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1846 the Albert Emanuel Vogler Max Von Sydow and his magnetic health theater is moving in a coach to Stockholm escaping from the accusation of charlatanism. By the way they find a very sick drunken man on the road and give a lift to him. The drunk wants to die to release his spirit from the spoiled body. The man dies along the journey. Near the border they are forced to present their show to a group of skeptical persons leaded by the local chief of police the consul and the scientist Vergrus Gunnar Bjrnstrand and their families. There is a great confrontation between magic and science.This movie has a great performance of the whole cast and a great black and white photography. The story about reality x illusion is very attractive. The VHS released by the Brazilian distributor Continental is a shame. It seems to be filmed from an English projection having black stripes covering the English subtitles and trembling image. Unfortunately this is the unique option I have in Brazil to possess such a film in my collection. My vote is eight.Title Brazil 'O Rosto' 'The Face'".

	schema:reviewBody "This 1958 Bergman film is often overlooked sandwiched as it is between Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries on one side and the Faith Trilogy on the other. Nevertheless it still offers many profound moments and remains a complex tale about masks and illusions.The film can be read as Bergman the master illusionist destroying the critics who set out to humiliate him. The fact that the magician has no apparent voice of his own but lets his act speak for him is a reflection of the director's role quietly manipulating the audience from behind the scenes through his art.The traveling group of entertainers representing the restless roaming life of the artist is a common motif through much of Bergman's middleperiod work including Sawdust and Tinsel and the Seventh Seal. These characters are depicted as never at home in society nor appreciated by it. Invariably they represent lowculture forms of entertainment from circuses and medieval troupes to in this case a magic and animal magnetismhypnotism show. Perhaps there was still a feeling at this time that cinema could not be one of the high arts? This is ironic as Bergman was of course doing so much to legitimise cinema as a serious art form with each film he produced at this time.Masks and layers of truth are symbolic throughout the film. The magician lives his role and is only exposed at the end after he has broken through his critics' own masks and truly scared them for one fleeting moment.Likewise hands are symbolic throughout this piece. As an apparent mute the magician expresses his thoughts through his hand gestures and it is a disembodied hand at the end that he uses as part of his tricks.The ending however is truly subversive. Whilst the audience are encouraged to identify with the magician has he outwits the cynical and mocking critics once his masks are stripped away he is shown to be indeed just another vagabond entertainer who grovels for some money whilst the critic humiliated moments before reassumes his own mask. Rejected by the woman who loved the illusion and not the man behind it he seems on the verge of another defeat. Once the audience is tempted to conclude that perhaps the critics were right after all Bergman follows with a feint of his own the magician has found royal favour and is off to perform at court. Whilst the petty officials have rejected him he is about to be received by the highest office in the land.In terms of social strata he has moved from a station wellbelow the officials to a privileged audience with the king that they themselves have probably never had.

Maybe the ending while intriguing is rather rushed but as always with Bergman there is so much good. As to be expected I love the look of the film the settings are appropriately Gothic and everything is beautifully shot. Bergman's direction is also superb no qualms there while the symbols and images are meaningful and stay in your mind for a long time. The music is appropriately haunting while the story has its compelling magic along with its fair share of fun and thrills and the dialogue is very thoughtprovoking. The characters are also interesting and this is elevated hugely by the acting. Max Von Sydow gives a bravura performance not a surprise as he is a wonderful actor whose face alone tells so much. Ingrid Thulin Gunnar Bjornstrand Bibbi Andersen and Naima Wifstrand give splendid support as well. All in all The Magician is a very interesting Bergman film but sadly it is also an overlooked one. 910 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " A forgotten atmospheric Bergman classic";
	schema:reviewBody "The Magician came out at the high point of the famous and fantastic Swedish director Ingmar Bergman's career it came out right after Wild Strawberries and The Seventh Seal and right before The Virgin Spring and his famous SpiderGod or God's silence trilogy. But the magician has not been remembered in the same light as those films in fact it's been mostly forgotten. The Magician follows Volger's Magnetic Health Theater a traveling performance troupe that is run by Albert Emmanuel Volger. Played by Max Von Sydow. Many authority figures are skeptical on whether they should be allowed to perform in public. So they are asked to come perform for Dr. Vergerus played by Gunnar Bjrnstrand and Police Superintendent Starbeck played by Toivo Pawlo at the house of the rich merchant Mr. Egerman. So that they can see if the performance is fit for public consumption. After watching the Magician I can see what it is less popular than The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries it lacks the dark atmosphere and theological complexity of The Seventh Seal and soft subtle human emotion and melancholy of Wild Strawberries. But even though The Magician lacks the depth of some of his other films Ingmar Bergman's skill and style are still present. The Magician is mostly restrained to the large estate of Mr. Egerman which is composed of some of the best sets I've seen in an Ingmar Bergman film this gives the film a wonderful isolated feel. The film's isolated feel is only magnified when coupled with the film's sense of mystery which makes for one very entertaining film.I really shouldn't even have to say this considering it's an Ingmar Bergman film but the acting is great. A lot of Bergman favorites like Max von Sydow Gunnar Bjrnstrand Ingrid Thulin and Bibi Anderson all star in the Magician and they're all as good as ever. Max Von Sydow deserves special praise his character doesn't even speak until an hour through the film but everything we need to know about him is told through his pose and facial expressions. His character is one that is filled with a deep sadness he has clearly lived a difficult life but it know it is finally his chance to prove himself to real professionals. The films cinematography is on par with most Bergman films of the time. The film was shot by Gunnar Fischer who has done wonders on some of Bergman's past films like The Seventh Seal and Smiles of a Summer Night and does wonders here. He captures the dark halls of Mr. Egermans estate perfectly.Even though I can see why The Magician is not considered as good as some of Ingmar Bergman's other films it is still criminally under seen. The film is one of they most comfy Ingmar Bergman films out there. And sure it may not be as complex or beautiful as some of his other films it is still classic Bergman. And if you're an Ingmar Bergman fan you definitely don't want to pass this film up but if you're not familiar with Bergman I would suggest checking out some of his more famous films before watching this one.7.910".

	onyx:emotionText "The Magician came out at the high point of the famous and fantastic Swedish director Ingmar Bergman's career it came out right after Wild Strawberries and The Seventh Seal and right before The Virgin Spring and his famous SpiderGod or God's silence trilogy. But the magician has not been remembered in the same light as those films in fact it's been mostly forgotten. The Magician follows Volger's Magnetic Health Theater a traveling performance troupe that is run by Albert Emmanuel Volger. Played by Max Von Sydow. Many authority figures are skeptical on whether they should be allowed to perform in public. So they are asked to come perform for Dr. Vergerus played by Gunnar Bjrnstrand and Police Superintendent Starbeck played by Toivo Pawlo at the house of the rich merchant Mr. Egerman. So that they can see if the performance is fit for public consumption. After watching the Magician I can see what it is less popular than The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries it lacks the dark atmosphere and theological complexity of The Seventh Seal and soft subtle human emotion and melancholy of Wild Strawberries. But even though The Magician lacks the depth of some of his other films Ingmar Bergman's skill and style are still present. The Magician is mostly restrained to the large estate of Mr. Egerman which is composed of some of the best sets I've seen in an Ingmar Bergman film this gives the film a wonderful isolated feel. The film's isolated feel is only magnified when coupled with the film's sense of mystery which makes for one very entertaining film.I really shouldn't even have to say this considering it's an Ingmar Bergman film but the acting is great. A lot of Bergman favorites like Max von Sydow Gunnar Bjrnstrand Ingrid Thulin and Bibi Anderson all star in the Magician and they're all as good as ever. Max Von Sydow deserves special praise his character doesn't even speak until an hour through the film but everything we need to know about him is told through his pose and facial expressions. His character is one that is filled with a deep sadness he has clearly lived a difficult life but it know it is finally his chance to prove himself to real professionals. The films cinematography is on par with most Bergman films of the time. The film was shot by Gunnar Fischer who has done wonders on some of Bergman's past films like The Seventh Seal and Smiles of a Summer Night and does wonders here. He captures the dark halls of Mr. Egermans estate perfectly.Even though I can see why The Magician is not considered as good as some of Ingmar Bergman's other films it is still criminally under seen. The film is one of they most comfy Ingmar Bergman films out there. And sure it may not be as complex or beautiful as some of his other films it is still classic Bergman.

	schema:headline " has at least one sequence that stands among Bergman's major triumphs";
	schema:reviewBody "The Magician's original Swedish title is Ansiktet which in Ingmar Bergman's language means 'The Face'. It's also worth noting thanks to the Peter Cowie essay with the DVD that the subtitle in the script is 'A Comedy'. Is much funny in this film? There is some absurdity  very dark brooding harrowing sometimes horrormovie absurdity  but maybe it's there. There's even some humor to be had among the supporting characters like the for 1958 frank sexual talk with Bibi Andersson's character and the younger man with the magician troupe. But it's all the same fascinating to see those two points  the fact that as in many of Bergman's other films the face is key as almost a plot device and that he sees it as a comedy. But hey so did Hitchcock with Psycho right? The Magician is set in the mid 19th century and is Bergman right after the onetwo punch of The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries continuing his cinematic inquest into truth and enlightenment. The conflict is not exactly plot driven though there is a solid premise and a good story a Magical Health Troupe that may not be the exact wording but 'health' is in there arrives to do a performance  this includes the Magician Vogler Max von Sydow and his assistant Mr Vogler Ingrid Thulin dressed like a man for a little while  for a heavily skeptical doctor and his group other Bergman regulars include Erland Josephsson and Gunnar Bjornstrand the latter being the doctor. This troupe carries some baggage with them  they've been in prison before it's spoken of  and it's obvious just by Sydow's face with a fake beard and dyed hair that there's something 'funny' going on.Rationality and irrationality that's what's at play here and also the whole idea of what constitutes believing in something that's outside of the 'scientific' explanation. It's interesting to see that Dr. Vergerus and this name would later pop up as antagonists in Bergman films most notoriously in Fanny  Alexander is probably more interested in doing the eventual autopsy of Vogler than really seeing any magic 'tricks' he has to offer  if they're tricks at all. And it's even noted that they are charlatans by one of the members in a key scene. But Bergman's aim here and what drives things to be so moving and compelling and even touching is how other characters react to these magicians with their 'potions' and fortune telling. One of the doctor's wives actually takes a liking to Vogler  it should also be noted this is over the course of a night  and it's one of those scenes that is so striking for the tension in Sydow's face how everything is building up inside of him.It may be almost a spoiler to say that Vogler can in fact speak and just chooses to use it as part of his disguise. But the conflict is constantly driven by the choices and worldviews of these characters and this goes too for a 'dying' actor who is seen early on in the film and... we assume he dies en route to the main part of the story but he reappears midway through to give Vogler some latenight advice before he departs again. Is this Bergman putting himself in the film saying that whether you bring illumination and wonder and the unknown in the world that you're still mortal? Probably and it certainly wouldn't surprise me.There are two main magic acts in the film and they're both brilliant aweinspiring works if only on technical grounds how characters move in the frame the surprises that come to these people. One of these is a little quicker the one you'll see involving 'invisible chains. In the second without saying too much Vergerus does do an autopsy on a character late in the story and this is something closest to a horror movie ten years before Hour of the Wolf no less and how Bjornstrand moves in this attic how the elements may be playing 'tricks' on him but most importantly how Bergman is making his own magic trick going on is shocking and a lot of fun. It's actually terrifying and in the way that you may wonder how it's being done... or maybe that's not true you know so much of the conflict has led to this point in the story  between what is quantifiable to a villainous man of science yes in this story villainous and what may be unknown in the world of conjuring and pulling the imaginary out of thin air  and it's because of that that you can't turn away from what will come next while Bergman uses all the tools of cinema cinematography playing with light and shadow ominous music how the actors move and react in such a tight place.Some of the choices aren't great I wondered why there was such BIG music near the end it felt out of place. And I almost wished there were more 'little' moments in the film like when the Granny character sings to one of the lady workers at the house and she slowly falls asleep. That's a really nice moment that adds to that hypnotic ambiance in The Magician. Yet I can't recommend it enough especially to those just getting into the director's work. Not everyone here may be likable matter of fact even the characters you're supposed to have most sympathy for are manipulative and jerky and full of angst. But do they make for some great drama? You betcha.".

After fleeing the law after a performance in one town they pass through the forest and enter another community.

Characterization is pretty slim  we get no idea of why Vogler and his companion chose this life and Vergerus is so shallow that Gunnar Bjornstrand seems wasted. And had the film ended three minutes earlier it would have been one of Bergman's more powerful conclusions but instead we get a completely unexpected happy ending that just seems lame. Much of the middle part of the film depends on sex jokes that are funny at times but I suspect anyone who knows Bergman's great output will continuously be thinking that he's capable of so much more than this.Still ANSIKTET does have a generally thoughtprovoking dramatic arc and some moments will prove memorable. I especially admired the battle between Vergerus and Vogler and the magician's breakdown funny how his temperment appropriately changes with his clothes in this scene.".

Trust me it's much lighter than a film like Winter Light a Bergman film that's basically about a priest that starts losing his faith and just becomes depressed.

It's enough to make the reader dread hearing any news about earthquakes in Japan.Now I've read the book and seen this 2006 movie version the first movie came out in 1973. And you know what? I thought the movie was quite good even if there are major changes from novel to film but that's understandable. The story is simplea major tectonic shift will cause Japan to sink within a year. Massive earthquakes volcanic eruptions and tsunamis rock the country as frantic efforts are made to evacuate as many people as possible. One scientist has a plan that could stop the sinking of the country and save what's left of the landmass but can it be implemented in time? I saw JAPAN SINKS at Otakon 2007 and while there were a couple of problems I had with itit does run a bit too long and a couple of the character moments were a little too sappyI was nonetheless blown away. The sheer concept of an entire nation sinking into the sea was made terrifyingly real and the effects were some of the best I've ever seen rivaling anything that Hollywood has done. The film also plays no favorites with the main characters with some not making it to the closing credits.Frankly I've been surprised by some of the negative comments made about this film. Difference of opinions I guess. Personally I enjoyed it. And I've read the original book.".

	schema:reviewBody "As done with economic theory disaster movies can be subdivided into micro Poseidon The Towering Infernal and macro Deep Impact Armageddon. SoJ falls somewhere in between. It's neither the destruction of our entire planet nor does it pertain only to a cruise ship or a building. It's about the threatened obliteration of an entire island nation.I have not seen the 1973 original and can only dwell on the current remake. It gives you everything you expect from a disaster movie  the CGI mayhem the scientific backbone the action and reaction of various government officials the plight of the little people lovers caught in a struggle of life and death. But somehow that doesn't seem enough.The mood is gloomy throughout accentuated by the faded brown hue and grainy shots. There are not only one but two claustrophobic deaths you can choke on. What we don't find are the occasional upbeat moments even in the face of heroic sacrifices. Here I must digress and mention the excellent madeforTV docudrama Krakatoa The last days 2006 that I happened to have watched just 7 hours after watching SoJ. Krakatoa is REALLY gloomy but for a good reason  it tries to recreate a REAL disaster possibly among the most devastating known in human history. SoJ however is pure fiction and the audience has the right to expect more uplifting treatment of the material.The more positive note on this movie comes from the two leads. Tsuyoshi Kusanagi of the top Japanese pop group SMAP plays a likable gentlemanly role similar to the one he had in Yomagaeri 2002 and more  with heroic selfsacrificing. Immensely popular Kou Shibasaki Crying out love in the centre of the world is distinguished not by her beauty but by her charm as a character actor. In SoJ she finds another role that is a perfect match for her screen persona.Some local critics point to the lack of chemistry between the two protagonists and I'll not debate that point. What I find refreshing is the unHollywood treatment. On the night when he comes to say goodbye before he seeks refuge in England his sincerity finally breaks down her inhibitions. Returning his love and promising to join him in England soon she offers herself to him. After an initial moment of emotional response he backs off gently declining her offer saying that as they will be together in England soon he can wait. The real reason however is that he is not going to England but a suicide mission  the last chance to save Japan from sinking. He did not want to take advantage of her. By Hollywood standard this is unrealistic fairytale. But despite Hollywood noble sentiments still exist.In the end the movie is far too long clocking in at 135 minutes and poorly paced. Taking away 30 minutes in my view should put it in much better light with the audience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nihon Chinbotsu is another example of Japanese creativity and ingenuity. The original story written in the early seventies is truly incredible in terms of thrill and how thoughtprovoking it was. Very basically the story is about the Japanese archipelago sinking into the ocean due to plate tectonics. I'm not an expert on this branch of science so I can't say how realistic the science behind the disaster is but it sounded very believable as a layman.There are many elements which make this disaster movie stand out compared to other disaster flicks like Day After Tomorrow Independence Day Twister etc. No matter what devastation there is in the aforementioned movies the land itself remains to fix. The people can rise out of the rubble is usually the end of the film. However Japan sinking means that the Japanese can't do anything to rebuild their homeland. Japanese will have to live somewhere else forever. Which raises many philosophical questions. What happens to a people without a homeland? Are the Japanese going to be worth anything to the other nations when they've lost their factories cities cultural artifacts? More specifically do the Japanese today have any value? Will the Japanese have to simply assimilate into other nations and disappear as a unique civilization?This film is a remake of the 1970s classic which is itself the film adaptation of the novel. There are many changes one being the obvious CGI which is on par with Hollywood standards which some may find a prerequisite for a good disaster film. But there are some crucial story edits that some may find for better or worse. I personally found the differences neither better or worse just another alternate ending. This remake however is a bit faster pace and focuses more on the destruction and relies heavily on the action to keep people excited which was probably not the intention of Komatsu Sakyo the author. The questions raised continue to exist in this remake but are not the main focus of the film.In conclusion this remake is exciting as an action packed disaster flick with great CGI destroying familiar sites if you're Japanese as well as a thoughtprovoking film. What's great about it is that if you want to just watch it as an action flick you can if you want to think about the questions raised you can as well but you won't be forced to. It's a good balance. I would recommend it.".

	schema:headline " Incredible effects good acting good beginning but unfortunate ending";
	schema:reviewBody "Another end of the world film that begs comparison to the abysmal Day After Tomorrow. Following the same sort of structure as DAT but with a distinctly Japanese style. How does it fare? That depends on your taste for Japanese melodrama. I found that the small human touches to be what makes this film compelling for most of it's 2  hours. Also the frequent title cards explaining some of the science. The effects are probably the best I've seen in a Japanese film and they compare very well to anything out of Hollywood. Many of the disaster scenes are truly horrifying even though the human carnage is usually off screen. And that is one of the drawbacks. While the terror of thousands of on screen deaths like in the recent War of the Worlds might have too overwhelming we also don't really get a sense of the chaos of an entire nation crumbling into the ocean. A few scenes touch on the chaos but for the most part this part of the story is barely touched on. Regardless this film works on a lot of levels and is way more realistic then DAT that is until the end.Unfortunately the story hinges itself on one clichd plot device and another plot device that would be at home in the 1960's Japanese Earth in peril film Gorath. After the reasonably good science and mostly realistic take on the disaster this makes for a bit of disappointment. The sudden stopping of the film for a pop love song doesn't help either unless you like the song. This made the exciting ending a bit of a drag for me.The overall direction is good and the art design is excellent. Acting is all good as well. Recommended.".

It covers the ongoing disaster from the perspective of several people directly affected by the events from ordinary people to scientists rescue workers and political leaders.This movie is a remake of a 1973 film of the same title and in many ways is a major rewrite. While an excellent premise based loosely upon actual plate tectonics the elements of social shock which were central to the original film are totally absent from this try replacing the original messageladen content with Godzillastyle entertainment.If there's any single impression one can get from a sidebyside comparison of the two films it's just how far special effects have come over the last 30odd years. Nonetheless special effects alone cannot make a great film. I gave this a five out of ten rating.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know what Dick steel was talking about but I found this film to be one of Japan's most thrilling epics to date. As for Armageddon or Deep Impact or for that matter The day after tomorrow is pale in comparison. For what I know of films most of the catastrophes in films are basically run of the mill asteroid flicks or one of which of Global Warming. This how ever ran a different course. A course of natural means where the earth's crust is beginning to erode to such a degree that it will take another piece of land with it for the ride. What the scientific teams had to do was create a way to stop the erosion from going to far and Sinking Japan altogether. In most cases this would simply be called tectonic shifting on steroids. I found the characters rather appealing in every way from the child who lost her mother only to face her own demise among unfamiliar friends. Or the rescue girl who does all the she can to save lives in the face of disaster. Or a man who thought he could change her mind not to be such a dare devil and go with him to safety only to become the hero himself and save his homeland. And let's not forget how the rest of the world just shucked them all back only to be forgotten by having the world turning their backs on the Japanese citizens who cried for help. This was a great movie in all aspects. What Dick is trying to say is that this movie was not Hollywood made that it was made in Japan that it had characters which rival other actors around the world that the effects are very gorgeous as he mentioned but it's all he was waiting for and nothing else. He lacks the vision of what's important to everyone and why this film had every element of feeling of grandeur and of humanity. I thought this film was top rate and I have seen many disaster films to know that Japan Sinks was possibly one of the most original and well thought out projects I have witnessed. I really hope Shinji Higuchi will make another of such films. Oh and by the way I am not Japanese though in many ways I wish I was. I am Canadian born and raised. And an avid movie buff in all aspects. Predjudicial visions are bitter and not worth the effort to be recognized as an opinion. Dick you should watch it with a more open heart and mind don't just look for the eye candy which makes a films content look for what's more important and understand it. They may not be American but the Japanese have cornered the market lately for some of the most breath taking and down right gritty film making to date. Which is why spending 25000000 is just what the Doctor ordered. You heard right 25000000 to make this film. Now you tell me was it worth it? or was it worth it because American actors weren't in it?".

	schema:reviewBody "This disaster flick is a remake of a 1973 movie of the same title based on a novel by Sakyo Komatsu. Japan is located right alongside the Pacific Ring of Fire active volcanoes and also along the edges of plate tectonics whose shifting will cause earthquakes and tsunamis a Japanese term in itself for tidal wave. Naturally this makes a natural premise for a disaster picture what with Hollywood having a field day with films like Armageddon Deep Impact and more recently The Day After Tomorrow which tackles how global warming becomes the catalyst for natural disasters gone bonkers around the world.But I'll have to say this The Sinking of Japan makes all the films mentioned earlier look like classics. This disaster movie IS a disaster and a massive one at that. Having to look at my watch every 1015 minutes is a signal that the movie doesn't engage and feels than it had overclocked its runtime.The special effects are gorgeous to look at. From satellite styled outer space pictures to the vivid recreation of every conceivable natural disaster that can strike the land of the rising sun the effects are the star of the show. However having spectacular computer generated graphics does not in itself make a movie palatable as too much of a good thing just plain bores.If you had seen the trailer where you're enticed by the effects and specific scenes of chaos and mayhem then yes in fact those scenes are just that. There are no details and everything is seen from afar in a Godlike mode. Things happen just like that on screen with nary an attempt to try and delve deeper to look at issues up close. It's akin to Godzilla knocking over buildings and it's as if there are no humans or loss of lives through that single act. Morbid as it might sound show us the victims! A populous nation like Japan doesn't just suffer disaster after disaster with an extremely low fatality count not when the filmmakers unleash mayhem in such an epic scale.Trying to weave a romance into the movie it stood out like a sore thumb. There are many characters in the movie but each one of them lacking real characteristics or humanity and look like wandering zombies without expression without emotion and definitely very stiff and unconvincing. Heroes become stuck in generic control rooms issuing statements instructions and form policies and react to incidents like it was a computer game all settled with a push of a button. These are characters that you don't give a hoot about.If I may just use The Day After Tomorrow as a comparison while there are terrific effects there is at least an attempt to provide a microscopic view of the entire disaster from different individual's point of views. And infused within are plenty of action sequences big ones like the disasters themselves and small ones with the focus on the triumph of the human spirit that makes it relatively compelling.Unfortunately for The Sinking of Japan this movie should preferably be one to sink and tank and hopefully undergo a short and quick death at the local box office to make way for better stuff.".

These are characters that you don't give a hoot about.If I may just use The Day After Tomorrow as a comparison while there are terrific effects there is at least an attempt to provide a microscopic view of the entire disaster from different individual's point of views. And infused within are plenty of action sequences big ones like the disasters themselves and small ones with the focus on the triumph of the human spirit that makes it relatively compelling.Unfortunately for The Sinking of Japan this movie should preferably be one to sink and tank and hopefully undergo a short and quick death at the local box office to make way for better stuff.";

Apart from that it is all a bit ropey in this understated disaster flick. The incongruities in the pacing are bizarre. At one point we have Hokkaido sinking into the sea and pyroclastic snow falling on the rest of Japan while Osaka is buried under an immense tsunami.

Kusanagi also manages to travel great distances without any hindrance or even a crease in his cream shirt. Other people turn up with burns ripped clothes and mudstreaks on their faces. The Japaneseness of the film is both touching and repugnant. Kusanagi's sacrifice in his final evening with Shibasaki is a touch of chivalry seldom seen in this genre these days. However the illfated PMs musings on the Japanese psyche and the seduction of death and the fact that Japan is abandoned by everyone and has no friends in the last instance hint at a darker paranoia that infects Japanese concerns regarding their status in the world.Sadly the final sequence is a ripoff of Armaggedon edited with a cookiecutter.Finally my own particular bugbear  the heavy handed product placement for cigarettes. This time around it is madorishe? scientist Toyokawa who gets to be the poster boy for Japan Tobacco. At one point he manages to light up 5000 meters below the ocean surface in a miniature sub the size of a phone box. Gimme a break.".

I do not watch them to be touched by humanity and feel humble. I do not watch them to listen to endless relationship exposition interspersed with the odd highlevel disaster scene. Unfortunately this is what the film provided. That plus awful pop songs with lyrics such as Melodies bathed in your reflection....The acting was good. The technical aspects were good. However the film was boring. I was thankful when it ended. I am ashamed to admit that despite the awful acting and story I enjoyed the terrible 2012 more as at least it flung disaster after disaster at the viewer.I also found that it had a faint sense of ingratitude to other countries and rather hypocritical in that some of the characters discussed various countries abandoning Japan and not taking Japanese refugees when in the real world Japan is one of those countries that refuses to accept refugees! It would have been interesting if that had been discussed as a point of irony. I think the Day After Tomorrow did that visavis Mexico.I like Japanese films.

In the past decade the Asian markets have been trying their hand at homegrown disasters with the likes of the Chinese AFTERSHOCK and the Korean TIDAL WAVE proving that the East knows how to handle mayhem and chaos on a big scale just as well as us in the West. THE SINKING OF JAPAN as the title would suggest is a Nipponese take on a truly catastrophic disaster.The film explores the impact of the country literally sinking into the ocean due to its precarious position on the edge of a tectonic plate the socalled ring of fire that sees a distinctly high prevalence of natural disasters even at the best of times. Of course a handful of scientists have a plan to stop it happening but they have to fight with stubborn officials and national panic at the same time. Despite its Eastern flavour THE SINKING OF JAPAN is a very familiar sort of film for those brought up on Hollywood equivalents.Sadly it's also way too long which seems to be a common concern with disaster flicks these days. I prefer my disaster movies to focus on the individual showing them battling against nature's fury in a bid for survival this is one of those films about dedicated scientists with a little bit of disaster thrown in for good measure. The disaster scenes themselves are very well achieved and dotted throughout the movie but they're also brief and almost glossed over in places.Instead we're in for plentiful emoting lots of long and drawnout dialogues and arguments and even a cheesy romance complete with a love song playing over the visual imagery. It's pretty cheesy downright laughable in places and not really very entertaining. I want to watch a disaster film give me the disaster you know?".

So hats off to the author of the book and the researchers who put it all together in an understandable fashion.What are also realistic are the attitudes by governments of some countries to Japan's plight as the situation worsens into a projected total catastrophe i.e. the probable complete sinking of the Japanese islands. Some countries are helpful others prefer to do nothing. All too real in my opinion.What's not so plausible though is first the speed with which the scientist's manage to achieve their goals to save Japan second the degree of effort by rescue teams to dig out survivors knowing that only more of the same is very soon inevitable and finally the actual process used to retrieve a special explosive device designed to help stop the sinking process. This last one is just pure fantasy as you will see that is if you see this.The production is okay the CGI is adequate but not extraordinary in my opinion but the action drags because there is too much about personal stories that detract from the ongoing disaster. When you produce a monumental disaster movie by golly you better make the action monumental. This one fails in that regard.The acting is okay the subtitles are quite readable and the street miseenscene is suitably dramatic and destructive when the earthquakesvolcanoestsunamis arrive. Sadly one is reminded of the destruction at the Fukushima nuclear site in MarchApril 2011. On that point it is noteworthy that in this film there is no mention of shutting down reactors prior to the disaster  an oversight the producers must now regret for sure.As a curiosity it's worth seeing this flick.

However much like a Roland Emerich film any attempt to suspend the audiences belief is abandoned in favour of a too unlikely scenario occasional cheap thrills and shallow paper thin characterisations and clich. All of which I could have coped with if the film were at least vaguely entertaining. Like Armageddon 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow the film takes a huge pinch of salt and throws it at a premise that has some potential basis in fact in this case the precarious location of Japan along the Pacific ring of fire and the likelihood of apocalyptic disaster the like of which we have seen in all to great a reality in recent months. It adds an uninspiring dash of flat clichd characters you know the ones male and female protagonists who are divorced but forced to reconcile cute little orphan girl Awww chain smoking maverick scientist and a bunch of old stubborn politiciansand shoves in the S L O W cooker until every molecule of freshness vitality and energy has been vaporised along with your patience attention span and desire to keep watching. Before I knew what a disaster this disaster movie would turn out to be I had prepared for a schlock movie that might numb the brain but would at least delight my senses with elaborate special effects and multiple scenes of mayhem and destruction.... I settled down to watch and within the first few minutes decided that I might end up with just the numb brain. How right I was. A veritable movie by numbers it became clear that this was an Asain movie that would abandon the usually carefully constructed plot lines and interesting 3 dimensional characters that usually inhabit the world of Japanese Cinema rather it would aim to emulate American cinema in practically every way possible. After a rambling introduction that serves as a geology lesson for infants we are 'told' that a series of events are underway that would ultimately lead to the entire Japanese archipelago sinking within 40 years... within the next hour or so however these events begin to unravel with unbelievable speed erupting volcanoes tidal waves and earthquakes soon begin to plague the good citizens of Japan with an over used satellite POV showing us the scale of the disaster. And so the movie continues peppered with some extraneous and totally predictable romantic fluff with the male and female 'leads' and the chain smoking maverick scientist coming up with a plan to save the rapidly ailing country. All these scenes are nothing more than long episodes of pointless exposition the scriptwriters and director using their actors to explain each and every event to the audience... because apparently we are too stupid to work it out for ourselves I could have watched the movie without subtitles and told you exactly what was happening. All this is very very boring and only sparsely interspersed with some pretty impressive set pieces which at least have the benefit of being more believable than the rest of what is happening. Sadly the special effects sequences are far too few and far between and serve only to jolt you from the frequent bouts of approaching slumber that you will doubtless succumb to as the film plods on with a pacing akin to a snail race. Unfortunately whilst worthy these effects cannot do anything to save the film which crumbles pathetically with each erupting volcano and rumbling earthquake. The ending when it eventually comes is woefully inevitable from very early on in the script rendering the 'plot' such as it is redundant for much of the film. With dull characters predictable and unoriginal script and a running time of 135 minutes you'll be wishing that the place had sunk in the first 5 minutes of inserting your DVD.".

It's boring implausible poorly shot ridiculously scripted and lacking in cool disaster effects.Worse it is intensely patriotic without a trace of irony or fun wallowing in a sense of Japanese uniqueness and victimhood. Everyone abandons the Japanese in their hour of need. Particularly the Koreans. The most noble characters choose seppaku  going down with their ship as their beloved island sinks. Only Japanese would think this way says the prime minister.If this movie in any way reflects the Japanese opinion of their place in world opinion the first thing they should do to rectify the problem is stop making movies like this.".

Compare to the movie the day after tomorrow i would have rate it at least 810.The sinking of Japan does not show much about the disaster that actually happening right in front of our eyes. there isn't much excitement at all...boring... all i can say...one more point... i would recommend this movie to have a better title... maybe something like the romance of sinking of japan because this movie does have lots of talkings waste of time... talk nonsense  the love story is extremely boring  have been dragging too long...honestly.. i almost get frustrated.Overall... this movie does not show enough details of the disasters e.g. many people running like hell to avoid death..love story part was extremely not touching enough for me.but hey... there is one thing we should appreciate about this movie though....  its has got good songs!".

	schema:reviewBody "This review contains MILD SPOILERS but not enough to spoil the story...Watched Nihon Chinbotsu Sinking of Japan or Japan Sinks depending on where you live recently a remake of the 1970's movie of the same name which itself was based on Sakyo Komatsu's bestselling novel. This movie is a gem of Japanese filmmaking. It appears that Japan is sinking due to a subduction of a tectonic plate to the west. The Americans predict that it would happen in the period of 40 years but according to Dr.Tadokoro a seemingly 'mad' scientist it will happen in less than a year. The Japanese government isn't that convinced but sets up a Disaster evacuation plan as well as form a new D1 team to handle the crisis. While on a trip to China to negotiate evacuation plans the Japanese Prime Minister was killed and sends the cabinet into a state of panic. The D1 team is left to handle most matters and led by the newly elected Minister of Crisis Management Saoro Takamori Dr.Tadokoro's exwife. She turns instead to Dr.Tadokoro for advice and he has plans to blow astronomically HUGE holes under Japan to avert the process of sinking.Japan would soon have to negotiate with various countries and persuade them to adopt Japanese refugees. Soon it seems that a lot of countries are reluctant to accept any more due to the sudden influx of Japanese in their country and the chaos that follows if this ever happens touchwood I hope Ito Misaki will be safe... she can always stay at my place... hee hee. The scenes of evacuations are really well done showing the havoc suffering and desperation civilians have to face in such disastrous times. And the many faces of human beings surface arrogance selfishness bribery bravery cowardry...This is a really wellmade film. the storytelling is solid with an engaging storyline and wonderful acting. Dr.Tadokoro played by Toyokawa Etsushi was done really well portraying a divorced and often mad scientist who kicks and bashes up stuff. His frustration and concerns were very visible and that's a really good thing. Reiko played by gorgeous Shibasaki Kou was also played rather well and has the most memorable line in the entire movie go watch it to find out and I fancy that she has a nice acting voice. She plays the love interest of Toshio Onodera played by Tsuyoshi Kusanagi of SMAP. Oh I almost forgot... she has really really long hair And there's also a subtle but background love story which is well written and if there's something the Japanese do really well it's love stories...One thing that makes this movie interesting is the technical explanations of the events that occur and if you're interested in geography you'll have a really good time I know I did... hehe. I can see that they went to great lengths to make this movie's theory believable and the first few graphical displays and explanation were done rather well although you'll have to excuse the Japanese's famous Engrish.OK now about the effects it's all about the effects isn't it?. After watching the movie with pure awe I must say that this movie has special effects that are on par or even better with some Hollywood productions. The volcanic eruptions... the massive earthquakes... destruction... tsunamis... explosions... all done splendidly. The opening scene is so cool the 1st earthquake catches you by surprise mountains fall the destruction due to volcanic eruptions makes you cringe... to actually watch Mount Fuji heat up is a marvel... then you see Shibuya fall to the ground... it's so sad!!! However what I felt was one of the best scenes was the giant tsunami scene which sees rescue operations fail and people left with nowhere to run and no hope to hold on to... the ending scene also deserves a mention... wonderful stuff. If you like effects you'll love this movie.Oh ya... every good movie has a great song behind it. The seriously addictive Keep Holding U sung by the supercute and adorable SunMin is a duet with Kubota and it's simply lovely. I feel it suits the movie really well and it shows that no matter what disasters hit us our love and strength would keep us holding on. The disaster scenes are handled with orchestra music and at times silence a Japanese specialty and really gives a sense of chaos to the destruction on screen. Oh and did I mention it's a really really really WIDE screen? Okla been going on and on about this movie. Yeah I LOVED it and hoping to watch again... It does have plot holes but it's all excusable because it was just a wonderful popcorn movie. Not perfect but really wellmade. I'd give it a 9 out of 10. I'm glad to say that the most expensive movie in Japanese history is also one of their best. If you haven't watched it you really should today... it is a MUST WATCH!".

It is at least as nationalistic humourless and lacking in selfawareness as that Hollywood film would be though and probably has even worse acting. It does have the hot evil chick from Battle Royale as one of the leads... but she's not even slightly evil and is therefore much less hot.The film is much too long at 132 minutes and gets worse and worse as it progresses towards a conclusion that had me in danger of puking. I certainly didn't care in the slightest whether Japan sank or not by the half way point and well before the end I was trying to think of ways to expedite the process should I ever find myself in that situation for real.But it does have nice special effects and Kou Shibasaki is still pretty hot so I magnanimously give it... 310.".

	schema:reviewBody "Seventythree years have elapsed since this Gold Diggers movie was released and it is well worth remembering that for many Americans The Great Depression was still fairly well depressing. Two years into the first administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt the overall level of unemployment was dropping but entirely too many people were what we would now call underemployed. They were working  like the hotel staff in the fictional resort where all of the events in this movie occur  for tips. Not only that they were required to pay their managers 'a tithe' of whatever they collected. All of that is laid out in the first sequences of this incredible film.In a very real way this movie was an employment bonanza all its own.The extraordinary dancing sequences in Lullaby Of Broadway clearly required about a hundred dancers and the musicians this means that there were also dozens of supporting personnel required for the task of doing rehearsals  including musicians . Perhaps it wasn't the best payday for most of these people but it was a payday in Hollywood.Busby Berkeley has received many accolades for his work in 42nd Street which is quite possibly one of the greatest American films ever made. But the energy and style and the enthusiasm which is on display in the dancing routines for Lullaby was not faked. Maybe this movie has all the intellectual 'nutrients' of cotton candy and maybe that's a valid criticism but it was work and honest work at that. This is a greatly entertaining film built out of the flimsiest of dramatic components yet one thing remains true it's a hell of an entertaining ride.The comedic elements were clearly drawn comicbook style and I do not find that objectionable in the least for the goofiness of the lead comic actors is still charming all these decades later. OK it is true that many millions of modern film fans may not have the slightest idea what 'snuff' is  finely powdered tobacco  but funny is funny and the obsession of the screwball expert who is collecting them is still really funny !! If it wasn't funny then why are 'nerds' still getting laughs in movies today ?? It's the same basic kind of humor.The rating of 8 for this film does take into account the tissuethin plot for this second Gold Diggers episode but it remains one of my personal favorites and that is said after having given it several viewings. Look back on this as an historical document. See how people behaved before being constantly tethered to their cell phones before being obsessed with 'global warming' or the price of gasoline.Oh and Gloria Stuart is so incredibly beautiful that she stops the action in almost every scene she's in as does Wini Shaw's singing.A great film for a cozy Saturday night and it is also certified as being 100  zombiefree.".

With some gutsy performers unhampered by anything remotely resembling an intelligent plot Berkeley provided plenty of laughs  glitz in this followup to his popular GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933.The large cast is all attuned to the nonsensical merriment. Preppy Dick Powell is in excellent good voice as the hotel employee wooing rich girl Gloria Stuart who only has to look lovely for the cameras. Alice Brady is properly shrill  strident as a miserly millionaire insistent on getting her own way in all things. Hugh Herbert is delightful as a daffy fellow interested only in his collection of snuff boxes.Hilarious Adolphe Menjou steals his every scene as a penniless Russian impresario who is obviously slightly crazed. Bold  brassy the marvelous Glenda Farrell gets to play the only true gold digger in the film. Frank McHugh is Brady's son desperate to enjoy a forbidden romance. Grant Mitchell oozes unctuous charm as the somewhat smarmy hotel manager.Movie mavens will recognize Nora Cecil as the head hotel housekeeper  E. E. Clive as Herbert's chauffeur both uncredited.While the cast is all shamelessly willing to entertain it is the two production numbers near the film's climax which have given it its place in movie history. The Words Are In My Heart' with its gorgeous girls and hypnotically undulating white pianos showcases Berkeley's love for regimented precision  choreography engendered years before during his stint with the military. The seminal Lullaby Of Broadway' is a perfect example of Berkeley's way of telling a story through music  dancein this instance the tale of a Big City girl's ultimately horrific night. These two completely different numbers are tied together by the skein of Berkeley's genius and counterpoint each other beautifully.".

In this edition the Gold Digging is done by both men and women with the exception of the romantic leads. Dick Curtis Dick Powell a desk clerk working his way through medical school is engaged to marry Arline Davis Dorothy Dare employed as a the hostess there. Guests at the swank hotel include Ann Prentiss Gloria Stuart the daughter of the ultra wealthy but stingy widow Matilda Prentiss Alice Brady who wants Ann to marry eccentric middleaged millionaire T. Mosley Thorpe Hugh Herbert but before Ann will commit herself into a loveless marriage she wants to go out and enjoy herself first. Mother Prentiss consents to this but with protection by hiring Dick as her escort. In the meantime Arline becomes interested in Humbolt Frank McHugh Ann's girlchasing brother with four previous marriages. While Mosley gets time away from Ann to write a book about snuff he is pursued by Betty Hawes Glenda Farrell a golddigging stenographer. More complications ensue when the freeloading Nikolai Nicoleff Adolphe Menjou a Russian theatrical producer mooching off the hotel is asked by the manager Louis Lamson Grant Mitchell to stage a musical show that will not only help pay for his bill but to help benefit the Charity Milk Fund. Sponsored by Mrs. Prentiss she wants everything in the show to be small and cheap. With all this is set aside the real entertainment begins with two lavish production numbers choreographed by Busby Berkeley.With the score by Harry Warren and Al Dubin GOLD DIGGERS OF 1935 opens instrumentally to I'm Going Shopping With You where employees including bellboys and chambermaids musically preparing the hotel for the upcoming guests. The song is later introduced by Powell as he escorts Stuart on a shopping spree charging everything to her mother. This is later followed by the tender love song The Words Are In My Heart sung by Powell to Stuart on the motor boat. For the charity show the first number is The Words Are In My Heart introduced by Powell to Stuart in period clothes followed by a parade of chorus girls playing the tune while sitting on movable white pianos. An excellent number that needs to be seen to be appreciated. When one thinks Berkeley cannot outdo that piano segment stay tuned for the 14 minute finale The Lullaby of Broadway. Sung by Winifred Shaw the big climax of hundreds of dancers in the night club sequence is an instant classic. This segment alone is usually clipped into movie documentaries especially a segment into public television's 1971 90minute presentation of The MovieCrazy Years a look back into the history of Warner Brothers movies of the 1930s. The Lullaby of Broadway went on to win the Academy Award as best song of the year. While Shopping and Words are underscored throughout the story with insert of Tango Del Rio from WONDER BAR 1934 only Lullaby of Broadway gives indication of one being inserted here from another movie or musical short considering the fact that the song isn't heard at all until its grand finale thus saving the best for last. In closing GOLD DIGGERS OF 1935 is grand scale musical showing that Berkeley handles his production numbers better than the weak plot. Alice Brady's character can often be annoying while the Warners reliables of Frank McHugh and Hugh Herbert tend to strain a bit for laughs. For character acting Adolphe Menjou acquires a thick Russian accent to match with his comedic moments opposite Joseph Cawthorne as another heavily accented August Schultz. Distributed to home video in 1989 and DVD many years later as part of the Busby Berkeley collection GOLD DIGGERS OF 1935 often plays on cable television's Turner Classic Movies. ".

I'm speaking of Lullaby of Broadway which won the second Best Song Oscar given out. it's Busby Berkeley at his surreal best.";

For your money you were able to forget your troubles as you watched the Busby Berkeley dance numbers and listened to the tunes of Harry Warren and Al Dubin.

I also like the cast introductions common to the era showing a brief moment from the film portraying the introduced in a flattering way. Style and class unfortunately seem to be in short supply in most films of the present era which has become much more concerned with finding new ways to shock or offend us as they happily take our money 9 bucks?.Sure there were better examples of the 1930s musical genre but this one really ain't all that bad.

For once the dialogue isn't as bad as it is in most 1930s musicals with some truly funny comic relief.  Also Berkley throws in two just unbelievable production numbers.  One of them is set to The Lullaby of Broadwaythe tap dancing in this one is incredible and it tells a story with a surprisingly depressing ending.  Aside from the Berkley numbers however this is no great shakes but very pleasant and lots of fun. Look for the hilarious scene where Powell and Stuart are on a lake supposedly at 900 at night but a wide shot shows the sun shining and a clear sky!

	schema:headline " disappointing  compared to some previous films in the Busby Berkeleychoreographed film series for Warners";
	schema:reviewBody "This was the last released of 5 films currently included in a Busby Berkeley films collection consisting of Warners films released between 193335. So far I've only seen Dames along with this one. Dames clearly was more entertaining than this one to me. Some previous reviewers have come to a similar conclusion comparing this film to others in the series. The first approximately hour before the 2 big musical production numbers is especially weak in entertainment value. Both films save the 2 big productions until the last part of the film. Thus a boring or too inane screen play will make you want to hurry out of the theater before the best parts. In Berkeley's later 3 films costarring Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney one of the big production numbers occurred midway in the film and there were often smaller musical numbers early on. I consider that a better and safer format. This film contains some commonalities and differences from the other 4 films in this series. Although Busby was the chief choreographer for all each of these films had a different director. This is the only one of the 5 in which Busby was also the overall director. All featured Dick Powell as the male lead or colead and main male soloist and all were scored by the composerlyricist team of Harry Warren and Al Dubin. This film includes one of their best remembered songs  The Lullaby of Broadway used as the featured song in one of the big production numbers. However it's not a love song. Dames includes another of their best remembered I Only Have Eyes For You which was used as a featured love song in an informal setting as well as in one of the later big productions. This is the only one of the 5 that was released after the Hays commission censorship fully kicked in around mid'34. It's also the only one that lacks Ruby Keeler as Powell's ingnue musical girlfriend. It also lacks the charismatic Joan Blondell who was an important character in several others of the seriesand would soon marry Dick Powell. It also lacks Ginger Rogers who was another significant character in several of these films. In their places  we have only Gloria Stewart. Gloria developed many talents over the years. However she had no appreciable singing or dancing talent at this time and appears to have little chemistry with Dick Powell. Thus she comes across as just another pretty face among many in this film whom Powell happens to single out as his girlfriend. Gloria's last film role some 60 years later is the one present audiences most remember as 100 yearold Rose in Titanic. Although Gloria lived to be 100 she was actually 86 when this role was shot.Middleaged Hugh Herbert returned from several other films in this series to reprise his Ed Wynnlike humor. However in place of Fred Mertzlike Guy Kibbee as another older male comedic character we have the quite different Adolphe Menjou who enjoys shouting at people. He could be an effective part of the comedy as in the later You Were Never Lovelier. However here both he and Alice Brady as Gloria's superrich mother with her periodic hysterics over her finances or daughter's romantic choices often come across as more irritating than funny.The two main musical productions consist of 1many chorus girls supposedly each playing or cavorting around an identical piano or 2many male and female dancers dancing in unison emphasizing the rhythmic sound of their feet. To me these were far less interesting than the multiple kaleidoscopic patterns formed by the chorus girls often seen in overhead projections and other unusual features of the productions in Dames and some of the other films in this series. However the segment with the apparently undulating 2 lines of pianos is an impressive accomplishment. As usual Busby made the most of sharply contrasting black and white or neon in his musical productions. He would eventually get a chance to choreograph in color albeit not until his career was in steep decline. The Gang's All Here with Carmen Miranda is probably his first choreography in color. It certainly most clearly bears the stamp of classic '30s Warners Busby among the half dozen Busbychoreographed color films I've seen. In the early '50s he did the choreography for Esther Williams' Million Dollar Mermaid water ballets having previously choreographed a water ballet in Footlight Parade part of the present film series. During this period he also did the choreography for several of Jane Powell's musical comedies. Then after a decade of no film credits his last credited choreography was for the Doris Daystarring Billy Rose's Jumbo a most underrated musical comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Among the films Busby Berkeley was associated with Golddiggers of 1935 is a standout. Other viewers have noted the astonishing Lullaby of Broadway sequence which yes is everything they say it is. And the dreamy white piano sequence is pretty amazing too.But you know there's more to it. And I think you just have to chalk this up to Berkeley's drillteam background. The sequences come off with such precision.There's the crisp editing at the beginning when the hotel managers are explaining the financial arrangements at the hotel to their employees. No pay just tips and make sure the managers are cut in. It's a funny bit of course but the way the film is assembled here accentuates the humor in a way you just don't see in your typical movie of 1935.The part that really is memorable though is the sequence at the beginning where Dick Powell escorts his young lovely through the hotel lobby. I guess I really ought to go back and time it but I think it runs for something like three minutes without a cut. And all the while hundreds of extras are rushing back and forth and you can tell the crew must have been dashing in and moving things that were just out of camera range. You know how much work that must have took? You know how everyone on the set must have been sweating at the 2 12 minutemark worrying that someone might trip and they'd have to start all over again? I have to wonder  how many takes were required? It's a scene every bit as complicated as the celebrated opening shot of Touch of Evil and maybe more so certainly a dozen times more tricky than anything in Rope  and yet this one doesn't seem to be noted anywhere in the annals of Hollywood.So let's just say that this film is one of Berkeley's most inventive and technically interesting offerings. And you know what else? It's a fun movie too.".

And all the while hundreds of extras are rushing back and forth and you can tell the crew must have been dashing in and moving things that were just out of camera range. You know how much work that must have took? You know how everyone on the set must have been sweating at the 2 12 minutemark worrying that someone might trip and they'd have to start all over again? I have to wonder  how many takes were required? It's a scene every bit as complicated as the celebrated opening shot of Touch of Evil and maybe more so certainly a dozen times more tricky than anything in Rope  and yet this one doesn't seem to be noted anywhere in the annals of Hollywood.So let's just say that this film is one of Berkeley's most inventive and technically interesting offerings. And you know what else? It's a fun movie too.";

	schema:reviewBody "I loved this film. Not only because Gloria Stewart was in it whiched helped me love it even further but the music numbers were amazing and had good humor and a good story. The only thing I could say was wrong was that the wonderful Ruby Keeler wasn't also in the film but Gloria Stewart is also wonderful. I guess Dick Powell can only have one love interest at a time. The story was very good with a good cast working at a fancy resort. Powell meets Gloria and her severely penny pinching mother Alice Brady who gives 5 bellhops one quarter between all of them. That today would be like 3 split between five people or a 60 or 70 cent tip for each bellhop and remember the supervisors wanted a piece of the tips too. Not good pay. That for carrying up her royal heiness's mass luggage that line I said there sort of a Spaceballs reference. Alice initially trusts Powell to escort Gloria to the department store. Powell and Gloria then go on a shopping spree along to the tune I'm going shopping with you and run up a bill much bigger than they were supposed to which causes Alice to faint. She's realized now Powell and Gloria developed a romantic interest in each other and that is not what Alice wanted. All good films need someone though who's not sweet and nice as long as it's not the heroine so the film doesn't get saccharine and Alice was it here. I liked Alice's raging did I hear you say.. Honeymoon!!?. She reminded me of Cruella the way she said that. Gloria's flamboyant brother Frank Farrell well remembered as the whiny it just can't be done! assistant director in Footlight parade is back here a little more mellowed out and a lot more flamboyant but still makes it obvious he's girl crazy. His flutter flutter scene was amusing after his successful date with beauty Glenda Farrel. Eccentric yet theatrically talented Adolphe Menjou joins the hotel too. He was not my favorite character in this film but he was not as annoying as some of the dramatic characters in Busby's slump period films such as the annoying band players and French ballet teacher in the not so good Gold diggers in Paris. Gloria and the two musical numbers in this film were so amazing and beautiful which played a big help in making this film better than Busby's 3 slump films Hollywood hotel Varsity show and Gold diggers Paris. Gloria and Powell have a very nice passionate romantic scene on a boat on a lake. The best most wonderful part comes soon next in the delightful and amazing song The words are in my heart. 1520 beautiful girls on shiny white grand pianos sliding around and forming more great Busby patterns and shapes while the girls play the beautiful music. Some of the piano patterned shapes were taken from the By a waterfall number in Footlight parade such as the snake patterns and the swirl patterns where then it was the swimming girls and here it's the girls on the pianos. The pattern work though was fabulous and the guys under those pianos being able to move them around so smoothly and timely like that could not have been any easy task. Even the girls' dancing by the pianos was very nice in the shadowy half dark with the shining light from the big open doorway behind them which created a eerie beauty of its own. Then the piano sections were bookended by three beauties playing a piano in a nice living room in beautiful floor length dresses before climbing the stairs at the end. Then a model on the piano zooming in at the end zooming out at the beginning  at closer view being a pretty spot by a pond under a blossom tree with Powell and the gorgeous Gloria sitting under it in her beautiful very large ruffled dress Powell singing to Gloria Gloria looking like an angel which completes the wonderful golden bookends to this amazing number. The other fabulous umber Lullaby of Broadway  tells an exciting tale of a girl's day in the city through song and dance. Then a spoiler near the end of the number I won't reveal above the Spoiler below section below which makes the number even greater and tear jerking. SPOILER BELOWLullaby of Broadway was fabulous due to the girl the story and about 100 or more very talented dancers in a big hall tap dancing so well and in such complete unison. I loved that sound of so many shoes tapping together in such skilled patterns along with some amazing dance moves. Dick Powell and the beautiful Lullaby girl watched then danced with all of the others wonderfully until near the end when the number has a big climatic fall literally. What makes the Lullaby of Broadway number even more amazing and tugging at the heart strings was the moment after the climax where we get what started to look like an it was all a dream session but just then surprises us. I loved it. Overall this film's fantastic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many will lump this into the sequels of Stephen King based movies which is correct. This one was not written by King but despite this lack of originality it is a fairly good sequel to an excellent movie.The mood is dark just not as dark as the first film. We have Geoff and his veterinarian dad relocating to rural Maine and the location of the Pet Sematary after Geoff's mom is accidentally killed in front of him while shooting a movie. In their new small town Geoff's dad opens up his own practice while Geoff has trouble adjusting to his surroundings. He befriends another outcast Drew who has an abusive stepfather named Gus to deal with at home. One night out of meanness Gus shoots and kills Drew's loyal dog Zowie. Drew then gets Geoff to help him bury Zowie in the notorious cemetery in hopes of bringing his dog back to life. It comes back just different mean and nasty like it's mad about being resurrected and now hates everything and everyone like all things brought back to life in the cemetery act. This starts off a chain of events that leads to the destruction of the lives of everyone involved and some who aren't involved incidentally. Now its just a matter of who can survive the supernatural terror engulfing the town. The storyline is fun and the acting is good enough. The gore and other special effects are great.I can easily look past the bad points in a film and see the good in it. This film is like that for me. The film also posses qualities that make me automatically like it. It is an underdog film meaning it's not very popular with most people on this site. It also has that early 90s disillusioned grunge youth generation feel to it. Some may see this quality as making the film darker even meanspirited but I love that era and love its influence in movies. This is just the frosting on the cake for me and overall the cake is worth a viewing on its own merits even if it's just so you can judge for yourself.".

I was positively surprised though as the plot was interestingA widower vet moves to the village from the first movie together with his son to start a new life and so was the characters. The actors was also good and performed excellent especially the guy who played Guscant remember his name. He manages to actually behave like a gleeful psychotic man without going so far that his performance would evoke laughter instead of shivers. His performance is without doubt the best part of the movie. This movie is more gory than the original movie and has less of the psychological terror elements that were a big part of the first movie although this is rarely taken too far a few moments of the movie features overthetop goriness but not enough to make it ridiculous in any way. To sum it up Pet sematary 2 is a good horror movie featuring both psychological terror as well as gore the simple yet interesting plot as well as the performance of the actors makes this a movie well worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "All right...I think that many commentators hate this film for what seems like good reasons to them at least. And I agree that PS II is definitely not for everyone maybe even not for fans of the original film  or even for fans of Stephen King.But there are things I enjoy about this film.I enjoy watching Clancy Brown chew up the scenery in the 2nd half of the movie after his character 'comes back'. Brown has a real gift for physical comedy and black humor and he does a great job portraying a shambling revenant...he just radiates savage hateful glee and very effectively comes across as a...THING masquerading as a man an agent of chaos and misery just barely keeping it together long enough to extract his revenge. PS II is worth watching just for his performance.I enjoy the way the plot spirals out of control after the opening events as the two boys try to fix things early on by using the Pet Semetary to cover up their um mistakes only to find themselves completely over their heads.There are individual moments of meanspirited gallows humor that are a lot of fun and even a few good one liners  No brain No Pain Think About It Won't You? was a screamingly funny line in the context it was delivered in. And the bit where Anthony Edwards staggers back into the Gilbert house and you hear 3 more shots was perfectly timed and worth a chuckle.In fact I feel that the entire movie seems to somehow embody the spirit and malice of whatever it is that brings the dead back from the Sematary. The director and screenwriter manage to make every scene almost every shot feel as if the wrongness of the Sematary has infected the very air and light of the town from the very opening shots.And in this they may have been too successful. The glumness the sense of oppression and airlessness and dread the rot and gore and malice from beyond the grave are simply too much for the average film goer if the director had backed off a little and allowed a little more light into the mood and not rubbed our noses in the gore and blood and maggots quite so much I think the results would have been more accessible for a lot more people. There a moments where I wish that we didn't have to see quite so many spurting wounds and decaying flesh and that not quite so many characters had gotten killed in the last 20 minutes.So...I think the movie was what the creators intended to make but they may have misjudged the reaction most people would have to their creation. I can still watch this on occasion and admire the energy and effort put into bringing this feeling to er life.".

Furlong has a glowing presence that fits the material beautifully and McGuire has a naturalness that is refreshing and real.And the story actually covers a lot of ground everything from bad parenting to bullying from one's peers and lots of revenge motifs that lead to some truly harrowing moments.

Had another director handled it the film could have lost any flavor of the original that might exist. There is some similar tone and such which I think keeps it a strong sequel. I love the young Edward Furlong during his career peak and Anthony Edwards with a beard. Great casting that keeps this film relevant even if it carried over pretty much nobody from the original. I say pretty much because I think it has no one but a minor character might have made it past me.The film as a whole has received negative reviews but the fact is that the original really is not that great.

	schema:reviewBody "It seems to me that everyone is too critical when it comes to this film. I never dreamed that the original would bear a sequel and the ingenuity involved to come up with this script should be commended. Mary Lambert is a terrific horror film director and it is sad to see that she isn't getting the chance to direct more of them excluding her recent D.T.V Urban Legends sequel. The atmosphere is well done and creepy and all in all this is an entertaining fun very gory romp that fans of the genre should applaud. This film misses the like of Fred Gwynne but Clancy Brown steals the show here as Gus the dead is better sheriff that for the last 45 minutes really makes this script work. Anthony Edwards turns in a solid performance the biggest drawback would have to be Edward Furlong who has never impressed me and Jared Rushton who are horrible in their respective roles. Great soundtrack includedall and all top notch entertainment for horror fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pet Sematary II is an overall good movie except for two things one it doesn't explain what happened after the events of the first film. Two Its too different from the first one. Pet Sematary II does actually deliver some good chills even though it is mostly just facial expressions. The acting was very good considering the fact that most of the stars in Pet Sematary II were kids. The plot is a little bit different from the first one but it still manages to impress and the gore effects are spectacular. Here's the story Geoff has just witnessed his mother die right in front of him on the set of her new film she is electrocuted and him and his dad move. Out of all the places in the world they decide to move to a neighborhood near the infamous Pet Sematary. Geoff meets Drew Gilbert an overweight teen who is coping with an abusive stepfather. Drew's stepfather Gus shoots Drew's beloved dog Zowie and that's when it all begins. Drew and Geoff bury Zowie up in the sacred burial ground that bring the dead back to life. Drew isnt sure about the fact that the sacred burial ground will bring Zowie back but he tries it not knowing that he will come back evil. When Zowie comes back hell breaks loose. Zowie kills Gus and then Drew buries him in the burial ground. Gus comes back and finds more victims to bury. Meanwhile Geoff's dad has opened up a Vet. Geoff sees that the burial ground works so he decides to bring his dead mother back. The plot is one of the main reasons why this movie is so much different than the first. Pet Sematary II is more engaged into the basic horror genre while Pet Sematary I is from the original horror genre. The first film had some killings in it but Pet Sematary II has more basic killings. The gore effects come up more often in Pet Sematary II than in Pet Sematary I. I really didn't like the fact that they didn't explain what happened after the events in the first film because they don't explain what happened to Louis Creed's daughter and they don't explain how Rachel Creed was killed for a second time. Overall Pet Sematary II is a tad underrated but it still delivers some good chills a mediocre plot good acting and very good atmosphere. This movie is pretty good but the first one was better. 9 out of 10.".

While not being the best booktomovie adaptation it had its moments. This one has none.Premise A son loses his mother in a fatal accident on a movie set. The boy's father moves to the same town that the Creed family died in. things start to happen when a boy loses his dog Zowie to a gunshot would by his abusive step dad who is also a sheriff. The boy buries his dog in the same Indian burial set and things get worse from there.Opinion This was one pointless sequel. At least the characters in the first movie had a method to their madness. The characters in this movie are just plain stupid. The acting is bland and the story is backwards. The characters who die and come back to life have more personality as a reincarnated corpse than they did when they were alive. How insane is that? Plus this movie leaves questions unanswered? Why would Gus bury Clyde in the sacred burial ground after he killed him? It makes no sense as is the son who buries his abusive stepfather in the same burial site. If you saw that you dead dog came back to life more deranged wouldn't you think your spiteful step dad would come back more psychotic than he originally was? I didn't feel an ounce of sympathy for that pudgy idiot when Gus killed him and his mother. Stupid! If you want a better horror movie from Stephen King check out Misery. That was a classic. Pet Sematary Two is just a rotting fleainfested dog of a sequel that should have never made it to the cutting room floor.".

Believe it or not I like the film slightly more than most other people but that is not saying much because this is a movie that has basically no following. It is early1990s Maine a few years after the original and once again a new family has moved into the sleepy community. Anthony Edwards is a veterinarian that has no ideas about the titled place and son Edward Furlong basically destroying the short celebrity status he had after Terminator 2 is still reeling emotionally after his actress mother's death during a freak studio accident. Furlong meets the chubby Jason McGuire an adolescent disenchanted with sadistic stepfather Clancy Brown and he soon learns of the town's history and the fact that some things in life or death can indeed be changed. Pet Sematary II is a studio project all the way. The first was a minor box office success and it naturally spawned this one. This is not from the mind of Stephen King and thus the short series falls even further down the cinematic ladder. Director Mary Lambert who also directed the original once again shows her shortcomings as a filmmaker with an uneven pace that is not helped out by a sophomoric screenplay and subpar performances across the board. By far not the worst horror flick I have ever seen but still a movie that ranks real low in the American cinematic machine. 2 stars out of 5.".

It was good that they kept Mary Lambert as director.Nowhere near as good as the first but not a bad film to watch.Still got moments of good suspense and a few gore scenes.This would work as a stand alone film not a sequel.

The movie opens with a young boy seeing his mother electrocuted to death and then cuts to a dog being put to sleep by lethal injection!  That's just the openingall through the movie there are vivid scenes of child and animal abuse shoved in your face.  It makes you feel dirty and disgusted.  Also there's a truly sick and unnecessary rape scene and pointless female nudity.  And there's some really sick graphic gore.The direction is lackluster and with one exception all the actors are terribleAnthony Edwards appears to be sleepwalking and Edward Furlong is just pathetic in the lead role.The only thing that makes this film bearable is Clancy Brown's hilarious performance as a resurrected sheriff.  But that's not enough to sit through this crap.Cruel sick badly acted badly directed stupid scriptto be avoided at all costs.  This definetely does belong in IMDB's bottom 100.".

	schema:reviewBody "A fan of 70s Blaxploitation cinema I've had Truck Turner of 1974 sitting on my DVD shelf for some time now always eager to watch it and the recent death of Isaac Hayes R.I.P. big man was reason enough to finally do so. And I was not disappointed. Isaac Hayes is probably most prominent in Blaxploitation cinema for composing and performing the theme song for the subgenre's most famous film Gordon Parks' Shaft of 1971 and he also starred as the supertough and supercool eponymous hero in a flick that ranges among the most entertaining of its kind  namely this Truck Turner. The bald and bearded Mac 'Truck' Turner is a former football player turned bounty hunter and Hayes is supremely badass in the role. Inbetween crimebusting and drinking sessions with his colleague Jerry Alan Weeks Truck who sleeps with his holster on and whose mere name makes the bad guys shake in fear pays visits to his sexy girlfriend who tends to get jailed for her quick temper...The film basically has everything good blaxploitation cinema needs A supertough badass of a hero as you will only see them in 70s cinema a cool sidekick eccentric villains violent shootouts funky music delightfully vulgar slang dialogue including many unforgettable lines and last but definitely not least dozens of sexy and dangerous women. None other than Star Trek's Nichelle Nichols plays the beautiful and lethal crimemadame and prostitutionmastermind Dorinda and Yaphet Kotto Alien makes a perfect crimeboss in his role of Harvard Blue. Alan Weeks makes a good sidekick for Truck Turner and beautiful Annazette Chase fits greatly in the role of Truck's girlfriend. Isaac Hayes himself is great simply the definition of BadAss in his role. Every line he says is the epitome of coolness and so is everything he does. The funky themesong which was of course composed and sung by Hayes himself is great and contributes a lot to the unique blaxploitation feeling. The film furthermore profits from great camera work  Truck blows them baddies away from some very cool angles. All in all Truck Turner should not be missed by a fan of 70s Exploitation cinema. Highly Recommended!".

Turner has a reputation for being an intimidating and confident force and can command top dollar for the jobs nobody else is willing to take. When the job of retrieving pimp Gator Johnson turns sour Tuner has to kill Gator and invokes the ire of his girl Dorinda. While Dorinda tries to hold her stable of girls together in a male dominated industry she offers up a significant business share in her girls to the man who is able to kill Turner for her revenge.I have taken recently to watching some Blaxploitation films mostly because I find the genre to be agreeably trashy and in a way the weaknesses can be accepted and almost enjoyed as part of the experience that you have come for. Trashily made violent tough black male leads gorgeous females with lots of sass funky soundtrack solid action and unintentional laughs  all of these things sort of come with the territory. Truck Turner actually stands out as one of the more enjoyable of the genre while still very much being a genre film with all the staples in place. The film is built on the usual sense of tough cool in the packaging and in the lead character and the plot pretty much does what you expect as a revenge plot provides plenty of gun battles and bright red blood squibs going off  none of it particularly thrilling but none of it dull either.Where it actually benefits is in the casting. Hayes is not the best actor of course but he does have a lazy cool charm about him and he leads the film well. He is totally outacted though by Nichelle Nichols who is not only sexy but is convincingly full of murderous rage  as others have said it is a world away from her character on Star Trek but she really dominates the screen here with a marvellously over the top and driven housemother harpie. Kotto is not quite as good but he is a very good presence and deserved to be used a bit better than he was. That said he still rocks most of his scenes and is rewarded with a memorable final scene. Weeks is funny Chase is cute and beyond that everyone is par for the genre course with plenty of bad hair and overacting in the men and lots of flesh in the women.Truck Turner is still a genre film of course and it needs to be met on those terms but it does stand out as a good example of the genre  tough cool good performances lots of pimp etc stereotypes and plenty of silly gun action. Far from being a great film it is still a very good genre piece.".

While I expected something along the lines of Shaft and I wasn't disappointed there I noticed a lot of similarities between this movie made in 1974 and recent releases like L.A. Confidential and Jackie Brown! The plot Hayes plays Mack Truck Turner a former football star who was forced to retire due to an injury. Now he works as a bounty hunter with his partner Jerry Alan Weeks is great! When he kills his most recent target a pimp named Gator he's in trouble with Mack Daddy Harvard Blue and his vicious hoes as well as a oneeyed assassin and a lot of other unpleasant characters! Isaac Hayes proves that he can act almost as good as he can sing! Nichelle Nicols of Star Trek gives the secondbest performance in the movie as a hoe Scatman Crothers is slick as Duke the only pimp who backs Truck and Annazette Chase is surprisingly good as Truck's lady! This one is a real classic. If you like Isaac Hayes or blaxploitation and you find this movie somewhere no matter how much it costs buy it. It's worth it.  out of ".

Aiming the gun close to the camera looked fascinating. The combination of action and exploitation is not just smooth as velvet but also rough as guts. Apparently critics wanted to dismiss this film from all the graphic violence it displays and while that still remains the case it gave the genre a step forward and was much needed to satisfy its fans. Hayes' music score is pure all the way and runs along with the plentiful but simple straightforward action sequences. I felt the piano score was tiringly repetitive for a film that offered more punch. It wouldn't be a blaxploiter without some groove humor and soul poured in and there's a lot here. TRUCK TURNER is one of the finer movies from an era that's been vanished a good long time but do check out BLACK CAESAR SUPER FLY and BLACK BELT JONES for the very best.

Hayes has great screen presence and is in fine form here as a bounty hunter who you don't want to push too many of his buttons. I love the start where he finds his cat has p...ed on another of his shirts. His partner bestfriend is a racey talking dude who Hayes coaxs into taking his new sports car on a speed run and of course he's pulled over and ticketed where Hayes smugly says after In future you should drive more carefully. A.k.a Black Bullet this is good solid rate entertainment. Hayes who of course is Truck Turner or Truck Mac Turner if you wanna get more technical has gone too far with his latest bounty that has him accidentally killing him. The dead pimp's girlfriend who runs her own stable of high class girls is none too pleased and puts a bounty on Truck's head employing mob guy acquaintance Kotto to take him down. As a madam she's a sour loose tongued ho a real nasty so and so describing some of her beauties with references to finger lickin' Fried Chicken and turnpikes. And if you want to leave her stable girls you better have one hell of a reason. In the wake of this tragedy. Kotto even pays his respects by slagging into an open casket containing the poor SOB. How respectful is that. She wants so bad to kill Hayes where earlier questioned in a salon surrounded by her beauties she plays funny buggers Hayes finding this scene not so funny. I've never seen such hostility between cop and madam in this than I have in other blackploitation movies which gave it a nasty edge about it I liked. After one ho knife's Hayes partner Weeks in the back Hayes he knocks her out than says Bitch in a Damn you manner. Hayes too has a woman he really loves and will do anything to protect her even if it means setting up for theft and putting her in prison. The last twenty minute revenge part of the film was great Kotto staggering back to his car outside a hospital after killing Weeks and being shot in the back by Hayes showing such determination for the black guy. When he steps inside the car his head hits the horn. Dead. Too I loved the shootout bit between Hayes and the Madam where I was rooting for Hayes always the winner here. If blackploitation movies are your thing and by high chance you haven't seen thismy advice to you. Hunt it down. This one's a classic and one with style plus some of Hayes's scores the magic singing voice of a black god who could act too.".

The last twenty minute revenge part of the film was great Kotto staggering back to his car outside a hospital after killing Weeks and being shot in the back by Hayes showing such determination for the black guy. When he steps inside the car his head hits the horn. Dead. Too I loved the shootout bit between Hayes and the Madam where I was rooting for Hayes always the winner here. If blackploitation movies are your thing and by high chance you haven't seen thismy advice to you. Hunt it down. This one's a classic and one with style plus some of Hayes's scores the magic singing voice of a black god who could act too.";

The film itself is also technically quite interesting both in the direction cinematography and editing I loved the camera on Blue's face when he's about to die or the shots that make Turner appear taller or his gun appear gigantic. The movie is also very funny at times maybe more than it was actually intended the vocabulary several oneliners and the way the main characters bully anyone in the way just cracked me up. Hayes' music is also great as usual. Great fun great performances great flick overall. A mustsee for any who loves Blaxploitation. I wish I could see more of him Turner deserved one or several sequels.".

	schema:reviewBody "Blaxploitation films are so frequently ridiculed and parodied much of it with reason these days that it's easy to forget that some of them were actually pretty good. Shaft 1971 paved the way for the subgenre with its strutting badass lead who's a sexmachine to all the chicks and Isaac Hayes' Oscarwinning score for what he will forever be best remembered for. Hayes himself steps into the lead role here as ex American football star and bail bondsman Mac 'Truck' Turner who according to Yaphet Kotto's badguy pimp Blue is like a bulldog with eyes up his ass! and displays some surprisingly charismatic qualities that makes it quite a shame he didn't appear in more.Greasy lawyer Fogarty the great Dick Miller employs bountyhunters 'Truck' Turner and his partner Jerry Alan Weeks  with the best grin in cinema to track down a lowdown pusher and pimp named Gator Paul Harris. After an extended chase scene Turner and Jerry manage to kill Gator much to the dismay of Gator's lady Dorinda Nichelle Nichols  Uhura!. Dorinda rounds up the big pimps and offers her valuable collection of whores in exchange for Turner's head a deal in which Blue accepts. Wanting to settle down with his girlfriend Annie Annazette Chase Turner finds his life turned upside when Blue employs a gang of hired killers.Beginning almost as a buddycomedy the witty script and some genuine chemistry serve up some amusing early scenes showing off Hayes' natural screen presence. But this turns into pure police procedural blaxploitation as the main plot kicks in with jivetalk pimps in some of the most delightfully ludicrous dress I've ever seen carchases slowmotion shootouts cocaine hookers and of course a tragically neglected soundtrack from Hayes himself. The action scenes are surprisingly good and Corman protg Jonathan Kaplan director of fellow Grindhouse Project feature Night Call Nurses 1972  review 443 makes sure he includes as much slowmotion men falling off rooftops and gushing fake blood as possible. Bloody good fun and probably better than Shaft.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

Prior to this movie Hayes was only known as the performer of the legendary Shaft theme but God bless the person who came up with the idea of giving him his very own moviefranchise! Hayes is brilliant and much cooler  tougher than all the other Blaxploitation heroes together in my humble opinion. If I were to be stuck in a dark alley late at night I would rather run into a combination of Richard Roundtree Fred Williamson and Jim Brown than facing the gigantically postured and naturally petrifying Hayes. The plot of Truck Turner is rudimentary but nevertheless engaging and literally stuffed with awesome characters witty comical undertones and phenomenal action sequences. I truly adore how each and every character that walks through the screen even including Truck and his lovely wife is a bit of a badass and living on the edge of the law himherself. Mack 'Truck' Turner is a former football player who now works as a feared bounty hunter since an injury ruined his career. Truck loves his wife even though she's a recidivist shoplifter and all the women in the neighborhood crave him and there isn't a single thug on the streets who doesn't fear and respects him. Together with his partner Jerry he's tailing the fugitive big shot pimp Gator but when the latter gets killed during a spontaneous bust all hell breaks loose. Gator's main biatch Dorinda Nichelle Nichols acting like the black version of Ilsa Harem keeper of the Oil Sheiks gathers all the city's most prominent pimps and promises the ownership of all her topclass prostitutes to whoever succeeds in killing Truck. Seeing the main story lines are so thin Truck Turner mostly benefices from its 'shoot first ask questions later' action sequences the splendid soundtrack and multiple stellar performances. Hayes receives great support from Yaphet Kotto as a really creepy superpimp Alan Weeks as the sidekick and Sam Laws as their employer. There are also excellent cameos for prominent Bactors like Scatman Crothers and Dick Miller. The violent climax in the hospital is simply awesome and has an original and tense anticlimax. Another downright brilliant and unforgettable scene takes place during the pimp's funeral. Pure 70's goodness!".

In fact everything and I mean everything about the film for the said first half is absolutely meriting of a full ten stars. Our main protagonists are instantly likable the seventies fashions are groovy the music is super cool and the action is spot on.Unfortunately although the film remains superb throughout the feel good factor that so permeates throughout the proceedings early on is all but abandoned in favour of a far more brutal approach in the second half. Don't get me wrong this in itself isn't a bad thing it's just that the sudden loss of all humour is sadly missed.On the other hand the action and indeed gore! picks up a major pace at the same point as if to compensate for this subtraction. And if it's violent action that you're after then you've come to the right place because Truck Turner proves to be one hell of an adversary to the villains in this. Special mention must be made of the main villains played by the excellent Yaphet Kotto eventual demise which utilises an intriguing reverse POV camera shot meticulously mimicking his staggering death throes  great stuff!All in all this is quite rightly regarded as a true blaxploitation classic.

Hayes is not too squeamish about what he has to do to bring back a given quarry and along with partner Alan Weeks being a skip tracer he's not bound by the rules that Clint Eastwood has to live by as a cop.My best recollection of Isaac Hayes is as the jail house friend of James Garner in The Rockford Files. Gandolf Fitch was a man of few words and a very short fuse and next to him Truck Turner is positively garrulous. The first part of the film is almost lighthearted in nature as we see Hayes and Weeks go about their jobs and we Hayes's relationship with girlfriend Anazette Chase. She's a nice woman but an incurable shoplifter that Hayes constantly has to bail out and pay the fines or the merchandise for. The end of the first half though concludes with a car chase to rival Bullitt in which Weeks is wounded and their skip trace a pimp played by Paul Harris is killed.After this the film changes mood so abruptly it's like watching a second film. Harris's woman and partner Nichelle Nichols wants Hayes dead and will pay anything for it and brings in a whole bunch of business competitors led by Yaphett Kotto to do the job. The second half of the film is a serious of gunfights climaxed by a blazing shootout in a hospital.For those who remember Nichelle Nichols as the nice Lieutenant Uhura forever with that earpiece and trying to open channels on the starship Enterprise you won't recognize the murderous fury that's in this character played by the same woman. She steals the film from Hayes in every scene she's in. I would not want her on my case.Truck Turner is a good action film with an astonishing portrayal from Nichelle Nichols. Star Trek fans might want to check this one out.".

This doesn't sit well with Gators' woman a madam and maniacal harridan named Dorinda Nichelle Nichols a long way from Lt. Uhura. So she recruits other pimps to act as assassins and take out Truck.Hayes's screen presence makes all the difference. This is a mighty fine vehicle for him and he composes the delightful score as well. He has fine chemistry with both the amiable Weeks and the very sexy Annazette Chase as Trucks' frustrated girlfriend Annie. Jonathan Kaplan The Accused Heart Like a Wheel directs in high style and there's quite an enjoyable amount of action. Things get effectively violent too with lots of squibs going off and much gushing of the red stuff. Truck Turner is not without a sense of humour as proved by the funeral for a pimp sequence. The final shootout inside the hospital is visceral and exciting.Nichols is a fiery and striking villainess with a foul mouth and the other supporting players fare pretty well. Yaphet Kotto does what he can with an underwritten role as an ambitious crook who understands Truck better than most of the inept would be killers in the story. But get a load of the actors who also appear Sam Laws Charles Cyphers Scatman Crothers sporting a hilarious ridiculous wig Dick Miller Stan Shaw Henry Kingi Don Megowan Tara Strohmeier Mel Novak Matthew Stymie Beard Johnny Ray McGhee and John Dennis. Look for director Kaplan in an uncredited cameo as a cook.Truck Turner is solid and diverting a good example of the blaxploitation genre overall.Eight out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "The late 60s and early to mid 70s was when the height of the iconic blaxploitation cinema was booming in theaters. This subgenre of movies usually included an almost all African American cast where the lead character was after justice and or revenge. Besides the amazing Fred Williamson being the poster child for these films Oscar winner Isaac Hayes was right up there standing with Williamson. With the amount of success that 'Shaft' had in 1972 the studios wanted Hayes for his own film. Just two years after 'Shaft' Hayes starred in 'Truck Turner' which is one of the best blaxploitation films you'll ever see.It's highly entertaining full of action and one liners and even served as inspiration for future films and comedy sketches throughout the years. Even 41 years late 'Truck Turner' with Isaac Hayes still holds up with the rest of them. That being said the acting by Hayes really isn't anything to commend here as this was one of his first outings into acting but luckily director Jonathan Kaplan weaves is more action and chases into 'Truck Turner' than having Hayes try and deliver melodramatic monologues. It was a wise choice and made the film much better.The film follows Mack Turner Hayes who goes by the name Truck hence the title. Truck used to play profootball but had to retire after a bad injury. Now he is one of the best bail bondsman bounty hunters in the area along with his partner Jerry Alan Weeks. There is no criminal or bond jumper to difficult for Truck and Jerry to find and capture. They soon get a difficult criminal to capture by the name of Gator Paul Harris who is a violent pimp. Truck and Jerry have trouble locating him since his madam girlfriend Dorinda Nichelle Nichols has him in hiding.To make matters worse Dorinda puts out a bounty to all the criminals and violent pimps for Truck's head on a stick in so many words. Meanwhile another rowdy pimp by the name of Harvard Blue Yaphet Kotto is playing both sides for his own secret reasons. It's a lot like 'Warriors' when you think about it. A couple of people are trying to not get killed by a bunch of people looking for them on the city streets.Here though you have the wit and seduction of Isaac Hayes front and center. I don't know who's idea it was but it's hilarious to watch every single female in the film minus Dorinda fall head over heels for Truck no matter what he does. It's just hilariously fantastic from start to finish. The action never really lets up either and has some great chase and fight sequences including a surprising death scene.Nichelle Nichols is by far my favorite character here because I was so used to seeing her as the bold and great character on 'Star Trek' but here she is rude vicious and plain old evil. What a fantastic performance. 'Truck Turner' is one of those rare gems of a film that people rarely discuss but you know it's almost always on their minds for just how much fun it really is. With energetic performances a great cast and one heck of an original music score 'Truck Turner' still is pure cinematic joy.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Psychic finds Italian filmmaker Lucio Fulci in a decidedly more restrained mood. Never a director to shy away from excessive sex and violence this entry in his cannon is far more an exercise in suspense with a real focus on presenting an interesting mystery. There is an early scene where a character falls off a cliff resulting in their face being bloodily shredded by rocks as they fall  basically a scene repeated from Fulci's earlier giallo classic Don't Torture a Duckling 1972  but apart from this there is no real excessive bloodletting at all. The story is essentially about a psychic woman who experiences premonitions about mysterious murders before long she finds herself in the midst of a dangerous situation.The atmosphere of this one generates a real sense of dread. This is mainly on account of the quite distinctively structured mystery that underpins the storyline. The mixing of visions of the past and events yet to come was clever. It means that there is a real sense of intrigue to this one with lots of visual clues thrown at us that progressively make sense while often setting us off to entirely the wrong conclusion. It's a jigsaw puzzle of a movie and this is a very nice touch. Because it came quite late in the giallo cycle I guess it was for this reason that it adopted a more original approach mixing the standard tropes of the genre with a supernatural angle. Whatever the case this is one of the better written and thought out storylines from the subgenre and what it lacks in visceral excess it does make up for with a wellconceived mystery. It benefits too from a good leading lady in Jennifer O'Neill who later starred in David Cronenberg's excellent scifihorror Scanners 1981. In addition it also features a Goblinesque score which was another nice touch.".

The only real gore was in the beginning of the movie when a woman falls off a cliff. Her face is shown hitting the side of the cliff repeatedly. Don't let the lack of gore stop you from renting this though because this movie is well worth it.The story is as follows A clairvoyant of sorts has a vision of a murder taking place in the house in which she lives. She then digs a skeleton out of the wall of the house. She calls the police who in turn arrest her husband the longtime owner of the house. In attempts to get her husband out of jail she tries piecing together what happened based on her vision. It should be noted that the major plot twists are given away on the back of the box so avoid reading it if surprise is wanted.The Psychic is one of Fulci's few technically competent movies containing few plot holes and a great storyline. Unfortunately the same can not be said about the dialogue which is subpar and the quality which takes away from the movie's viewing experience. Also the first half of the movie drags but luckily things pick up for the second half. Be sure to listen for the tune in the watch it starts out like the theme song to Zombie!This is an enjoyable movie for all audiences. My rating 7 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Often nicknamed the 'Godfather of Gore' cultdirector Lucio Fulci is doubtlessly most famous for his gruesome Zombie films. The man's greatest achievements however are in my humble opinion his comparatively goreless but spinechilling and extremely elegant Gialli from the 70s. After the brilliant Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino aka. Don't Torture A Duckling 1972 which I would name as one of the top5 Gialli of alltime Sette Note In Nero aka. Seven Notes in BlackMurder to the Tune of the Seven Black Notes of 1977 is a close second on my list of the greatest Fulci films and it also ranks among the true greats of the Giallo genre in general. As a child the clairvoyant Virginia has a vision of her mother's suicide at the very moment of its occurrence. As an adult Virginia Jennifer O'Neill who has recently married the wealthy Francesco Ducci Gianni Garko continues to have menacing visions. One day she has the disturbing vision of a gruesome murder in which a woman is being walled in...I do not want to go deeper into the plot because this brilliant film is filled with clever twists from the very beginning. Seven Notes in Black contains no sleaze and hardly any gore but has an incredibly intriguing and suspenseful plot containing ingenious red herrings and unpredictable plot twists and is filmed in an incredibly beautiful yet unspeakably creepy visual style. While the film includes little blood and only very few gruesome scenes the suspenselevel is extremely high and intense and the mystery is maintained until the very end. A fascinating plot a truly haunting atmosphere and uncanny visual style make this one of the most tantalizing Gialloexperiences ever brought to screen. The score is another insanely brilliant aspect about Seven Notes in Black  Seldom is a soundtrack as successful in building up tension and beautiful to listen to at the same time. Especially the haunting 'Seven Black Notes' theme is incredible I'm sure Quentin Tarantino had good reasons to reuse it for Kill Bill. The performances are also very good. The ravishing Jennifer O'Neill is great as the original and likable protagonist Virginia. The biggest name in the cast is doubtlessly Gianni Garko who is most famous as star of many Spaghetti Westerns and who delivers another great performance here. However all cast members many of them Italian Horror regulars fit greatly in their roles. Overall I can not come up with a single negative aspect about this film. Sette Note in Nero is incredibly suspenseful genuinely creepy extremely elegant and simply brilliant in all regards. No lover of Italian Horror can possibly afford to miss this tantalizing Giallogem which is yet another proof that Fulci was a Horrorgenius! 9.510".

	schema:headline " Another excellent Giallo offering from the great Lucio Fulci!";
	schema:reviewBody "Murder to the Tune of Seven Black Notes is the last of Fulci's pregore flick Giallo's and it has to be said that it's the lowest quality of the bunch. That however is more down to the fact that the others are such brilliant films rather a shortfall with this one. Having already done straight murderers with A Lizard in Woman's Skin and Don't Torture a Duckling Fulci has resorted to a supernatural plot line for his fourth Giallo feature and the plot draws its mystery and intrigue from it. Fulci has taken influence from the more psychological Giallo films made before this one as well as a plentiful helping of Edgar Allen Poe's The Black Cat. The plot kicks off properly with the uncovering of a skeleton inside the walls of a villa belonging to the husband of our young lady protagonist. Clairvoyance is the reason for finding the skeleton and naturally it isn't long before the husband is put under suspicion for the murder given that the body was uncovered inside his house and he finds himself on the inside when it turns out that the body belonged to one of his exlovers...Despite the fact that this film serves as something of a prelude to the latter half of Fulci's career there is a surprising lack of blood and guts and this film isn't even as gory as the earlier Don't Torture a Duckling. Fulci presents his plot with a surprising amount of restraint and doesn't even take the opportunity to show a heavily decomposed corpse as he did in the largely goreless One on Top of the Other over a decade earlier. While the plot itself does serve up intrigue it has to be said that it's a little too bare to cover the running time properly. The suspense is there throughout but Fulci's script certainly could have benefited from adhering a little more to the common convoluted Giallo plot. The technical side of the film makes up for this shortfall however as Fulci's use of the camera is excellent and he continually presents a morbid and foreboding atmosphere particularly inside the central villa location. The tension mounts as we approach the ending and Murder to the Tune of Seven Black Notes boils down to a satisfyingly macabre  if a little abrupt  conclusion. This film may not be Fulci's best Giallo attempt and it is liable to disappoint fans of his later bloodier films but if you like your atmospheres grim and your plots suspenseful Fulci's fourth Giallo comes recommended.".

	schema:headline " Yes Virginia There IS A Sanity Clause";
	schema:reviewBody "Although director Lucio Fulci had excelled in the early '70s with such marvelous gialli as Lizard in a Woman's Skin and Don't Torture a Duckling his 1977 offering The Psychic is not really a giallo at all. Indeed to my surprise it turned out to be more of an oldfashioned murder mystery with decided overtones of the supernatural. In it beautiful Jennifer O'Neill plays Virginia a decorator American I take it who is newly wed to a hunky Italian businessman. Gifted with transient powers of ESP she had as a child seen her mother's freefall suicide off the White Cliffs of Dover from hundreds of miles away she is now being bothered by troubling visions again. But what do the mental images of a broken mirror an old woman's bloody face an ornate red room a limping man an excavated wall and a blue ashtray have to do with her? With a cleverly executed plot Fulci  Co. bring all their great talents together to create one fairly suspenseful stew...especially as Virginia slowly begins to realize that her visions may not necessarily be of events already transpired. The Psychic hardly qualifies as a giallo in that the body count is extremely low the gore is mostly absent that drippy face excepted! and the murderous set pieces are kept at a minimum. Still the film holds the viewer's attention and even boasts several riveting sequences such as the pursuit of Virginia by a sinister man the always dependable Gabriele Ferzetti through an abandoned palazzo somewhat reminiscent of Florinda Bolkan's pursuit through an empty cathedral in Lizard and the film's Poeinfluenced claustrophobic finale. The film's plot does hold together well although a repeat viewing may be necessary to really appreciate all its complexities. While the gorehound fans of Fulci's later period may feel a bit disappointed by the film's restraint those seeking a stylish wellacted and genuinely eerie entertainment could certainly do a lot worse. The wetblanket editors of the Maltin Movie Guide rate this movie a Bomb and even my beloved Psychotronic Encyclopedia calls it dull but I think they're being way too harsh here. See for yourself....".

	schema:reviewBody "Picked up an entirely French version of this and even I a vivid Lucio Fulci fan couldn't immediately tell what film it was I held there in my hands. When it comes to style and substance 7 Notes in Black comes darn close to the master's ultimate success film Don't Torture a Duckling. Less gruesome and the emphasis lies on story and atmosphere. I guess that's why this little gem got catapulted straight into oblivion as numerous gore flicks settled Fulci up with his infamous and still growing Godfather of Gorereputation. 7 Notes in Black is an unhinged and powerful giallo complete with a very twisted plot morbid atmosphere spooky sound effects and farfetched twists. Dario Argento and Mario Bava usually are the experts in this domain but Fulci once again proves himself capable of delivering an equally brilliant and suspenseful mystery that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. The film opens with an unsettling sequence in which a young girl witnesses her mother committing suicide by the way the actual suicide is almost an exact copy of the one in Don't Torture a Duckling and shows the victim bumping her head against the cliff several times...quite gruesome even though she's in a completely different country. The young Virginia is clairvoyant and almost 20 years later she has a similar vision in which she witnesses a woman getting walled up in the house belonging to her husband. When there really is a skeleton found inside the walls of the mansion Virginia attempts to reconstruct what happened to this unfortunate women by the images shown to her in a vision. But our courageous heroine is in great danger since it's unclear whether the vision illustrates past ...or future. The screenplay is wellwritten and smart while Fulci's professional directing manages to keep you guessing along until the very last second. There's a constant ominous tone featuring in this film and the magnificent 7 notes tune even increases the tension. This is vintage Italian horror and definitely Fulci's most regretfully underrated achievement. Despite of what everyone thinks of him he's a gifted filmmaker with an eye for absolute terror and a passion for the macabre. If you also were a fan of Don't Torture a Duckling and I know there are a lot of fans of that title here on this site I strongly advise you to look for this film as well. It's a hard one to find but it's worth every minute of trouble.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whilst I have become a huge fan this year of Italian directors Dario Argento and Umberto LenziI have really been struggling to see what all the praise is about for another Italian directorLucio Fulci.With the two films that I used for my introduction to Fulci the funFlashdanceFame ! riffing Giallo Murderockand the slow paced Italian Crime film The Smugglerleaving me with a feeling that there was nothing else to seeonce the end credits started to roll. With having been trying to find a Bollywood Giallo to introduce my friend to the fantastic subgenre for a good whileI was thrilled when I found someone on the IMDb Horror board talking about a Bollywood Giallo remake called 100 Days.Reading up the plot outline for the unofficial remakeI was really surprised by the the plotdue to it sounding like a very Hitchcock inspired filmwhich seemed to be the complete opposite of Fulci being called the Godfather of Gore.Due to now being very interested in seeing Fulci take on a Hitchcock style thrillerI decided to rush and get my hands on itwith a good feeling that I made be about to see something pretty special from Fulci..The plot1959As Virginia Ducci's mother commits suicide by jumping of a cliff in EnglandVirginia makes the painful discovery that she has a psychic abilitydue to being able to see her mothers suicide whilst staying at a school in Italy.Years laterDriving her car to a new mansion that her partner has recently broughtDucci's visions come back with a vengeancewith Virginia seeing small glimpses of what looks to be a murder being done on an old woman.Arriving at the mansion on her ownDucci gets a strong sense thatalthough the interior of the building is vastsomething seems to be trapped inside the walls.Breaking one of the walls downVirginia discovers a skeleton which looks like its been there for a good number of years.After having gotten hold of the skeletonthe police become pretty uninterested in taking the investigation farther which may be due to the superintendent of the police forcehaving had an affair with the deceased victimshortly before she was reported missingLuckally for Virginiaher best friendpsychiatrist says that although he does have some doubts over the accuratchy of her visionshe is still extremely keen in getting to the bottom of the mystery of the skeleton girland Ducci's visions of a murder.Slowlyas the psychiatrist and Virgina start to find information about the skeleton girlthe psychiatrist begins to fear that Ducci may be putting her life in great dangerdue to him beginning to suspect that her visions are not of a murder that has taken place in the pastbut one that is going to take place in the near future...View on the filmAlthough Lucio Fulci is most famous for being a very gungho directorwith some real eyepopping flairhere he astonishingly goes into the opposite direction.For the manychilling scenes of Virginia being on her own in the disused mansionFulci stunningly uses the vast environment around Ducci to create a strong sense of Foreboding fearthat with all the emptiness around hersuggested that something or someone could pop out of nowhere at any moment.For the last 30 minutes of the filmFulci and coscreenwriters Roberto Gianviti and Dardano Sacchetti turn the film into a almost dialogue free blazing thrillride!with Lucio delivering amazingly precisestylised camera moves which could make even the Giallo genre's star director Dario Argento look on with envyas Fulci delivers a classic Giallo with chilling atmosphere.Along with the mesmerising directingand the brilliant supernaturaltinged Giallo screenplaythe film also includes some terrific performanceswith lead actress Jennifer'O Neil doing really well at showing the increased pressure that Ducci puts herself underas she begins to feel that her visions of murder are about to become true.For the last section of the filmO'Neil smartly avoids the character turning into a Dumb Blondeby having Virginia attempt to run awayfight back against the killerwhich helps to give the film a tremendous edge of the seat rush to the finishing line. Final view on the filmA grippingatmospheric Giallo mysterythrillerwith a great tense screenplayvery good performances and absolutely stunning directing from Lucio Fulci.".

With having been trying to find a Bollywood Giallo to introduce my friend to the fantastic subgenre for a good whileI was thrilled when I found someone on the IMDb Horror board talking about a Bollywood Giallo remake called 100 Days.Reading up the plot outline for the unofficial remakeI was really surprised by the the plotdue to it sounding like a very Hitchcock inspired filmwhich seemed to be the complete opposite of Fulci being called the Godfather of Gore.Due to now being very interested in seeing Fulci take on a Hitchcock style thrillerI decided to rush and get my hands on itwith a good feeling that I made be about to see something pretty special from Fulci..The plot1959As Virginia Ducci's mother commits suicide by jumping of a cliff in EnglandVirginia makes the painful discovery that she has a psychic abilitydue to being able to see her mothers suicide whilst staying at a school in Italy.Years laterDriving her car to a new mansion that her partner has recently broughtDucci's visions come back with a vengeancewith Virginia seeing small glimpses of what looks to be a murder being done on an old woman.Arriving at the mansion on her ownDucci gets a strong sense thatalthough the interior of the building is vastsomething seems to be trapped inside the walls.Breaking one of the walls downVirginia discovers a skeleton which looks like its been there for a good number of years.After having gotten hold of the skeletonthe police become pretty uninterested in taking the investigation farther which may be due to the superintendent of the police forcehaving had an affair with the deceased victimshortly before she was reported missingLuckally for Virginiaher best friendpsychiatrist says that although he does have some doubts over the accuratchy of her visionshe is still extremely keen in getting to the bottom of the mystery of the skeleton girland Ducci's visions of a murder.Slowlyas the psychiatrist and Virgina start to find information about the skeleton girlthe psychiatrist begins to fear that Ducci may be putting her life in great dangerdue to him beginning to suspect that her visions are not of a murder that has taken place in the pastbut one that is going to take place in the near future...View on the filmAlthough Lucio Fulci is most famous for being a very gungho directorwith some real eyepopping flairhere he astonishingly goes into the opposite direction.For the manychilling scenes of Virginia being on her own in the disused mansionFulci stunningly uses the vast environment around Ducci to create a strong sense of Foreboding fearthat with all the emptiness around hersuggested that something or someone could pop out of nowhere at any moment.For the last 30 minutes of the filmFulci and coscreenwriters Roberto Gianviti and Dardano Sacchetti turn the film into a almost dialogue free blazing thrillride!with Lucio delivering amazingly precisestylised camera moves which could make even the Giallo genre's star director Dario Argento look on with envyas Fulci delivers a classic Giallo with chilling atmosphere.Along with the mesmerising directingand the brilliant supernaturaltinged Giallo screenplaythe film also includes some terrific performanceswith lead actress Jennifer'O Neil doing really well at showing the increased pressure that Ducci puts herself underas she begins to feel that her visions of murder are about to become true.For the last section of the filmO'Neil smartly avoids the character turning into a Dumb Blondeby having Virginia attempt to run awayfight back against the killerwhich helps to give the film a tremendous edge of the seat rush to the finishing line. Final view on the filmA grippingatmospheric Giallo mysterythrillerwith a great tense screenplayvery good performances and absolutely stunning directing from Lucio Fulci.";

It's not your typical Fulci film though.

The script is solid and lacks the dreamlike feel of his other films but it's that's obviously not the main thing here. The acting is nothing special but that is to be expected. The music score is just amazing and helps set up the creepy atmosphere. The middle part of the film drags on a bit but the final payoff is brilliant and very Spoorloosesquire.

Jennifer O'Neill is a great leading lady who sees visions as she travels through a very dark tunnel in her car of a murder scene. These visions haunt her and she is bound and determined to find out their meaning. Are they visions of the past or premonitions that is the main plot and with a pretty neat twisty ending. This movie ranks up there with the best of Fulci imo and I need to watch it again because I had trouble with a couple of plots points. One of the better Giallo I've seen for a while.".

Jennifer O'Neill is a great leading lady who sees visions as she travels through a very dark tunnel in her car of a murder scene. These visions haunt her and she is bound and determined to find out their meaning. Are they visions of the past or premonitions that is the main plot and with a pretty neat twisty ending. This movie ranks up there with the best of Fulci imo and I need to watch it again because I had trouble with a couple of plots points. One of the better Giallo I've seen for a while.";

Although he is often considered a top tier director of Italian horrorgialli I found his films to be nothing more than exploitative and shameless capitalizing on violence and sex to appeal to nothing but the viewer's carnal desires while providing little if any intelligence for the viewer's mind and cognitive thinking.Imagine my surprise when I found this not only to be a good movie but also quite possibly one of the best gialli I have ever seen second only to some of Dario Argento's best work.Despite a rather unnecessarily violent and gory opening which is more laughable than shocking the film is very subtle and restrained with no nudity and very little violence focusing upon its labyrinthine mystery to provide the thrills rather than anything visceral.And the mystery is superb playing out very much like a jigsaw puzzle. The main character Jennifer O'Neal sees a barrage of images in the opening of the film like pieces of a puzzle and as the film progresses we see the pieces beginning to come into place and form a whole picture. All of this creates a very engrossing experience as we get enwrapped within he mystery.That is not to say the film is totally devoid of visceral thrills. The suspense sequences are genuinely suspenseful with the chase scene in the rundown church being almost unbearable in its potent tension. Not to mention the very last sequence in the house will also have you on the edge of your seat.And the story isn't the only thing that makes this giallo work so well  the direction by Fulci I can't believe I'm saying this is magnificent with such stunning sequences of camera movements and edits that just draw the viewer into the action. Also the music by Bixio Frizzi and Tempera is hypnotic creating a very much palpable atmosphere of dread and ominous foreboding.However I don't mean to sound like this is a masterpiece of Italian cinema  it's not. I am merely so shocked at how good this film is considering its filmmaking pedigree. The opening scene as mentioned earlier is entirely out of place and the plot while complex is strangely predictable once you begin to understand what's happening.Despite this the plot is tight focused and clever with genuine suspense which makes it one of the best giallo films ever.Essential viewing for not only giallo fans but also any lover of a good mystery.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1959 Virginia Ducci Jennifer O'Neill has a vision of her mother's suicide. Virginia was in Florence Italy and at the very same time her mother committed suicide in England. In the 70's Virginia is married to Francesco Gianni Garko When she goes to the old abandoned house of her husband for redecorated it she found the rests of a dead body and is all related to a vision that Virginia previous has. When Francesco is accused for the murder Virginia must find the proofs for her husband's freedom thought her vision.This is the plot of this terrific giallo of Lucio Fulci. Sette Note In Nero is the only film of Fulci that has been released on DVD in Mexico and was my introduction to Fulci's work. The plot is great showing a simple murder mystery story with suspense all of its 95 minutes. The unexpected change in the plot is great just as the end.First the film is about one murder mystery with Virginia relating all to her vision but later her vision doesn't agree with the case and we realize that she saw the future. So is great how the film suddenly has two different murder cases unsolved one of the past and the other that is going to happen in a very near future. The climax and the end are just excellent and it was because of the music that Virginia was saved or at least we like to imagine that.Conclusion I love this film that was just a terrific introduction to Lucio Fulci. It has a great atmosphere perfect for a story full of suspense. The cast is good with the amazing beauty of Jennifer O'Neill that here's plays a brave role. If you're expecting to see a very bloody film maybe because you have hear something about Fulci this is not what you're looking for but I do recommend this film. 9.5 out of 10Region 4 DVD Like I said this is the first film of Fulci on DVD in Mexico and the presentation is just good. Is a single disc edition without extras but the quality of the image is just terrific and is great that is in Italian with Spanish subtitles. So is always great to can get this kind of films. We need more films of Fulci on DVD in Mexico!".

Her marriage is troubled by her relationship with her former lover Mario.This film has been on my towatch list ever since seeing a brief snippet of it in Nanni Moretti's Caro Diario.  For the most part I think it was referenced as a dancing film but if you watch this you'll see there are some subtler ties to which I can't mention without spoiling the film.Silvana's closing lines Perhaps in my third world the absorbing world of the Mambo I could find forgetfulness of the past and in time peace and happiness.".

The story is a modern fairytale Giovanna is like Cinderella there is a thief and there is a real Prince too. But the thing I remember most is the dancing costumes and the music. This is an important record of the work of the wonderful dancer and choreographer Katherine Dunham. I believe Ms. Dunham wrote some of the songs too. The scenes of the hard work that goes into a life of performing struck me as very real shocking even since blacks and whites were working so closely together. But unlike most fairy tales Giovanna must choose which world she really wants to belong in. She chooses wisely.Silvana Mangano is radiant as the young Giovanna. She was 24 at the time. Her performance is nuanced beyond her years a shy shop girl one moment a diva the next. The rest of the cast is also excellent. I especially liked Shelley Winters in her role as the manager of the troupe. I think the nice girl Giovanna has coffee with is Julie Robinson who later married Harry Bellafonte.Don't miss this excellent movie.".

In the first On My Vespa he narrates while riding along and says I always wanted to be a dancer He reflects on the importance of dance in not only film and stage but in life in general. Later on while waiting for a beverage in an Italian juice store he notices a television playing and the movie Mambo was playing. He knows the song and begins to sing and dance along with the unfourtanatly little known Sylvana Mangano as she does a unique version of the Mambo. Afterwards at the outside caf table his friend asks him what he was doing in the shop and he relates that he was watching a Strange scene starring Sylvana Mangano and that it had effected him in a strange way. I went to IMDb and looked up Sylvana's name only to find an amazing actress who was a big star in Italian film for a short time. She was married to Dino DeLaurentis and would have followed in the steps of Gina Lolobrigada and Sophia Loren had not she been married to DeLaurentis. Her most famous movie was Riso Amaro where she toiled ever so sexually in rice fields. She separated from DeLaurentis and lived out her life in Paris and Spain sewing tapestries. The scene was mesmerizing to me as well as Moretti and she was a beautiful and talented woman. Such is show BIz I guess!?! You can read the complete story of this unsung actress by entering Mambo in the search box on IMDb and clicking on the links. By the way she never divorced Dino DeLaurentis and died in 1989.The movie Mambo originally had a completely different storyline but was banned due to it's homosexual theme. Caro Diario is playing all this month on IFC channel.".

	schema:reviewBody "With Iphigenia Mikhali Cacoyannis is perhaps the first film director to have successfully brought the feel of ancient Greek theatre to the screen. His own screenplay an adaptation of Euripides' tragedy was far from easy compared to that of the other two films of the trilogy he directed. The story has been very carefully deconstructed from Euripides' version and placed in a logical strictly chronological framework better conforming to the modern methods of cinematic storytelling. Cacoyannis also added some characters to his film that do not appear in Euripides' tragedy Odysseus Calchas and the army. This was done in order to make some of Euripides' points regarding war the Church and Government clearer. Finally Cacoyannis' Iphigenia ending is somewhat ambiguous when compared to Euripides'.The film was shot on location at Aulis. The director of photography Giorgos Arvanitis shows us a rugged but beautiful Greece where since the Homeric days time seems to have stood still. He takes advantage of the bodies the arid land the ruins the intense light and the darkness. The harshness of the landscape is particularly fitting to the souls of the characters. The camera uses the whole gamut of available shots from the very long reinforcing the vastness and desolation of the landscape as well as the human scale involved to the extreme closeups dissecting and probing deep into the soul of the tormented characters. In particular the film's opening with a bold accelerating tracking shot along a line of beached boats followed by an aerial view of the many thousands of soldiers lying listlessly on the beach is a very effective means of communicating Agamemnon's awesome political and military responsibility.No word but sublime can describe the stunning performances of Costa Kazakos Agamemnon Irene Papas Clytemnestra and Tatiana Papamoschou Iphigenia. Kazakos and Papas embody the sublimity of the classical Greece tragedy. Kazakos' character is extremely downtoearth and his powerful look into the camera more than his words reveals the unbelievable torment tearing his soul. Irene Papas is the modern quintessence of classic Greek plays. In Iphigenia she is terrible in her anguish and even more so for what we know will be her vengeance. Tatiana Papamoskou in her first role on the screen is outstanding in her portray of the innocent Iphigenia which contrasts with Kazakos' austere depiction of her father Agamemnon.Cacoyannis is faithful to Euripides in his representation of the other characters Odysseus is a sly scheming politician Achilles a vain narcissistic warrior Menalaus is self centered obsessed with his honor eager to be avenged and to have his wife and property restored.The costumes and sets are realistic no Hollywood there. Agamemnon's quarters resembles a barn he dresses as do the others in utilitarian handwoven simple garb. Clytemnestra's royal caravan is made up of roughhewn wooden carts.The music is by the prolific contemporary music composer Mikis Theodorakis. Theodorakis' score intensifies the dramatic and cinematographic unfolding reflects on the psychological aspect of the tragedy and accentuates its dimensions and actuality.This film and the story it narrates offer considerable insight into the lost world of ancient Greek thought that was the crucible for so much of our modern civilization. It teaches us much about ourselves as individuals and as social and political creatures. Euripides questions the value of war and patriotism when measured against the simple virtues of family and love and reflects on woman's vulnerable position in a world of manly violence. In his adaptation of Euripides' tragedy Cacoyannis revisits all of these themes in a modern clear and dramatic fashion.The relationships governing the political machinations are clearly demonstrated war corrupts and destroys the human soul to such an extent that neither the individual nor the group can function normally any longer. With the possible exception of Menelaus whose honor has been tarnished by his own wife's elopement with her lover everyone else has his own private motivation for going to war with Troy which has nothing to do with Helen the thirst for power Agamemnon greed the army Odysseus or glory Achilles. And so in a real sense Helen became the WMD of the Trojan War. The war stripped of all Homeric glamor and religious sanctioning was just an imperialist venture spurred primarily by the desire for material gain all else being a convenient pretext.Another conflict raised in the film is that between the Church and the State. Calchas who represents the Church feeling the challenge to his priestly authority and wishing to destroy Agamemnon for the insult to the Goddess he serves tells him to sacrifice his daughter. In consenting to the sacrifice the King comes closer to his moral undoing but in refusing loses his power over the masses his army who are brainwashed by religion. Of course for Agamemnon it's a game. The King must go along with the charade whether he honestly believes in the Gods or not until he realizes too late that he has ensnared himself into committing a despicable filicide.Is it a sacrifice or a murder and how can we tell the difference between the two? By focusing on the violent and primitive horror of a human sacrificeand worst of all the sacrifice of one's own childEuripidesCacoyannis creates a drama that is at once deeply political and agonizingly personal. It touches on a most complex and delicate ethical problem facing any society the dire conflict between the needs of the individual versus those of the society. In the case of Iphigenia however as in the Biblical tale of Abraham and Isaac the father is asked to kill his own child by his own hand. What sort of God would insist on such payment? Can it be just or moral even if divinely inspired? Finally does the daughter's sacrificial death differ from the deaths of all the sons and daughters who are being sent to war? These are many deep questions raised by a twohour film.".

Adapted by Cacoyannis from the play by Euripides it's a superior rendering of the classic tragedy and recently made its first television appearance in many years in the United States courtesy the Flix Channel. The film is shot on an epic scale but is decidedly not a 'big' film with the emphasis placed on the simple story in supplication to the gods King Agamemnon Kostas Kazakosis compelled to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia Tatiana Papamoschou much to the consternation of Queen Clytemnastrae Irene Papas. Kazakos and Papas are both outstanding but it is the stunning Papamoschou who brings the most interesting elements to the screen blending the innocence of childhood with the dawning realization that she is the pawn in a political game.

The third piece of Cacoyannis' Greek TRAGEDY trilogy the other two are ELECTRA 1962 and THE Trojan WOMEN 1971 both I have yet to watch. IPHIGENIA firstly astonishes in its epic scale its solemnity and optic grandeur is quite unparalleled for its time and what could be more legitimate than a Greek tragedy concocted by a Greek maestro in situ? This proposition alone is alluring enough! This is a prelude of the Trojan War Agamemnon Kazakos has to tough decision to make under the oracle from Artemis he must sacrifice her firstborn child Iphigenia in order to atone a slip when his army accidentally slaughtered a sacred deer in a temple dedicated to Artemis a consequence is that all his fleet is kept at bay without the aid of wind to sail while his men are growing fatigued bored and anxious for the battle. Then Agamemnon's wife Clytemnestra Papas and Iphigenia are tricked to the front under an ostensible pretext to marry Iphigenia to Achilles Mihalopoulos but soon the lie is debunked can Iphigenia escapes her doom? It is a nobrainer actually because it is named tragedy for an obvious reason.When fate rules individual effort cannot alter it so what is intriguing falls on the process itself how Clytemnestra fights wholeheartedly and desperately for saving her beloved daughter how Achilles transitions from an outsider to swear protection for her with no regard of his own life how Agamemnon is tormented by the guilt and grief yet he is too proud to disregard the interest of the bigger picture. But most essentially is Iphigenia's own mental progress from a bright young bridetobe to a designated oblation for others' sacrilege her anticipated weddingday turns into her lastdayonearth and from the initial entreatment to her final tranquil acceptance of her unfair fate. On paper it is a role seems too challenging for Papamoschou who is only 13yearold at then without any acting experience but in reality her performance is a key element ascribed to the film's success a Palme d'Or competitor and an Oscar nominee. Bearing an angelic appearance she balances against histrionics her costars establishes a poignant image of a martyr St. Joan of Arc style and never let her own innocuousness off the map that's what we call a pathos generator.There is no question of how excellent is Papas the Greek equivalence of Anna Magnani her expressive face alone can be so revealing and informative as in ZORBA THE Greek 1964 another Kakogiannis film words are powerless in front of her presence. But here equipped with her mother tongue she is in her full wings to bring Clytemnestra to life an anguished mother fights bravely from her submissive position to defend her own blood to no avail nevertheless she shines in every scene. A solid theatrical background benefits Kazakos greatly in rendering gravitas to Agamemnon but compared to Papas and Papamoschou he is rather stiff and so are Mihalopoulos and Karras who plays Menelaus Helen's husband. Last but not the least two thumbsup for Theodorakis' engaging score percussively rollicking during the frenetic spectacles and imposingly impassioned during the central narrative. Surely only Greeks know how to cook up an authentic feast from a Greek tragedy highly recommended!".

	schema:headline " Pity and Fear";
	schema:reviewBody "Though I've enjoyed reading most of the regrettably few Greek tragedies I'm familiar with until now Aristotle's pity and fear his words for what successful tragedies are supposed to provoke in their readers was only a concept to me. I had never experienced it myself not from texts and certainly not from the few and universally mediocre productions I've seen of classical Greek tragedy. I didn't expect to experience it during this film adaptation either which begins as a goodlooking but emotionally overwrought melodrama. Somehow though by its end the movie has worked up to a level of emotional intensity that does justice to Aristotle's famous phrase. Iphigenia is about the Greeks' determination to reach Troy and about the terrible decision that their commander Agamemnon is presented with by the gods as the price for doing this. After his men inadvertently offend Artemis by killing a sacred deer the gods withhold favorable winds from the Greek fleet stranding their ships halfway to Troy on the island of Aulis. In this version of the old myth taking place in a Bronze Age warrior society but produced by a young and troubled democracy the leaders Agamemnon Menelaus Achilles enjoy only a partial and shaky control over their men who tired of waiting without adequate food or supplies are on the brink of mutiny as the story begins. Odysseus is portrayed here as less just another tribal chieftain than as a dangerously eloquent demagogue further stirring up the troops with resentment against their leaders. In this tense situation the Greek chieftains particularly Agamemnon and his brother Menelaus are relieved when the prophet Calchas announces that he has learned of a sacrifice by which they can appease the gods. Agamemnon's relief turns to horror however when he learns that the required sacrificial victim is none other than his own daughter Iphigenia. He keeps this secret from everyone except Menelaus while at the same time he summons Iphigenia to Aulis. Caught between a rock and a hard place Agamemnon seems unable to come to a decision or rather to be trying to put off a decision until the last possible moment. Agamemnon's mistake is that in trying to keep his options neither of them good he ends up backing himself into a corner where he no longer has any choice. In part Euripides seems to be showing how power can be as imprisoning as powerlessness. Agamemnon Menelaus suggests at some point has spent his whole life in pursuit of power and now his ambitions are rebounding on him. The horrible dilemma with which he is faced drives the story forward. The story's drive is supplied by the horrible nature of Agamemnon's dilemma and probably as a result momentum is exactly what is missing from the movie's beginning. The film looks good throughout and the foreign language helps stave off the overt kitsch which most mythological films fall prey to but these early scenes are nonetheless pretty tedious. The filmmakers plunge us into the story's strange alien world without giving us much of an emotional stake in the Greeks' dilemma. These problems seem to stem mostly from the inherent difficulties of adaptation. I've never read Iphigenia at Aulis but considering the tight restrictions in time and space of the Greek theater I would assume that much of the script is of the filmmakers' own invention. The director tries to keep things cinematic but really the film is at its best when it sticks to the text and to dialogueheavy exchanges between the characters. The movie only starts to really work when Iphigenia and her mother arrive at the Greek camp. Up until then the scenes consisting as they do of exchanges between burly armorwearing almost indistinguishable Greek warriors tend to feel a little flat so the introduction of the slight delicatelooking Iphigenia brings a new note of dramatic contrast that grounds Agamemnon's dilemma in reality it's an obvious but very effective device. As word spreads among the characters of the nature of the planned sacrifice Agamemnon almost fades into the background of the story and his dilemma takes on a life of its own. Once the army has learned of the gods' demand Iphigenia is doomed. Considering that I already knew the outcome Euripides's play and the filmmakers' adaptation does a remarkably good job of sustaining the tension and suspense to an almost unbearable degree. As Iphigenia comes closer to that inevitable ending I finally understood what Aristotle meant by pity and fear. It may not be pleasant but it is a riveting experience that left me somewhat shaken and certainly rather subdued after it was all over.".

	onyx:emotionText "Though I've enjoyed reading most of the regrettably few Greek tragedies I'm familiar with until now Aristotle's pity and fear his words for what successful tragedies are supposed to provoke in their readers was only a concept to me. I had never experienced it myself not from texts and certainly not from the few and universally mediocre productions I've seen of classical Greek tragedy. I didn't expect to experience it during this film adaptation either which begins as a goodlooking but emotionally overwrought melodrama. Somehow though by its end the movie has worked up to a level of emotional intensity that does justice to Aristotle's famous phrase. Iphigenia is about the Greeks' determination to reach Troy and about the terrible decision that their commander Agamemnon is presented with by the gods as the price for doing this. After his men inadvertently offend Artemis by killing a sacred deer the gods withhold favorable winds from the Greek fleet stranding their ships halfway to Troy on the island of Aulis. In this version of the old myth taking place in a Bronze Age warrior society but produced by a young and troubled democracy the leaders Agamemnon Menelaus Achilles enjoy only a partial and shaky control over their men who tired of waiting without adequate food or supplies are on the brink of mutiny as the story begins. Odysseus is portrayed here as less just another tribal chieftain than as a dangerously eloquent demagogue further stirring up the troops with resentment against their leaders. In this tense situation the Greek chieftains particularly Agamemnon and his brother Menelaus are relieved when the prophet Calchas announces that he has learned of a sacrifice by which they can appease the gods. Agamemnon's relief turns to horror however when he learns that the required sacrificial victim is none other than his own daughter Iphigenia. He keeps this secret from everyone except Menelaus while at the same time he summons Iphigenia to Aulis. Caught between a rock and a hard place Agamemnon seems unable to come to a decision or rather to be trying to put off a decision until the last possible moment. Agamemnon's mistake is that in trying to keep his options neither of them good he ends up backing himself into a corner where he no longer has any choice. In part Euripides seems to be showing how power can be as imprisoning as powerlessness. Agamemnon Menelaus suggests at some point has spent his whole life in pursuit of power and now his ambitions are rebounding on him. The horrible dilemma with which he is faced drives the story forward. The story's drive is supplied by the horrible nature of Agamemnon's dilemma and probably as a result momentum is exactly what is missing from the movie's beginning. The film looks good throughout and the foreign language helps stave off the overt kitsch which most mythological films fall prey to but these early scenes are nonetheless pretty tedious. The filmmakers plunge us into the story's strange alien world without giving us much of an emotional stake in the Greeks' dilemma. These problems seem to stem mostly from the inherent difficulties of adaptation. I've never read Iphigenia at Aulis but considering the tight restrictions in time and space of the Greek theater I would assume that much of the script is of the filmmakers' own invention. The director tries to keep things cinematic but really the film is at its best when it sticks to the text and to dialogueheavy exchanges between the characters. The movie only starts to really work when Iphigenia and her mother arrive at the Greek camp. Up until then the scenes consisting as they do of exchanges between burly armorwearing almost indistinguishable Greek warriors tend to feel a little flat so the introduction of the slight delicatelooking Iphigenia brings a new note of dramatic contrast that grounds Agamemnon's dilemma in reality it's an obvious but very effective device. As word spreads among the characters of the nature of the planned sacrifice Agamemnon almost fades into the background of the story and his dilemma takes on a life of its own. Once the army has learned of the gods' demand Iphigenia is doomed. Considering that I already knew the outcome Euripides's play and the filmmakers' adaptation does a remarkably good job of sustaining the tension and suspense to an almost unbearable degree. As Iphigenia comes closer to that inevitable ending I finally understood what Aristotle meant by pity and fear. It may not be pleasant but it is a riveting experience that left me somewhat shaken and certainly rather subdued after it was all over.";

	schema:reviewBody "They certainly don't make movies like this anymore. Likable characters good story a very charismatic Burt Reynolds. As for the action I would take wellfilmed exciting car chase and action sequences as seen in White Lightning over CGI special effects in today's films any day! Rural locations in the South are also used to great effect. You can almost feel the cold water of the swamp in a great opening sequence the ears of corn bouncing off the windshield as Reynolds drives the soupedup Ford through a cornfield and the dust coming off the tires. As also observed by movie critic Roger Ebert today's special effects laden movies have forgotten how to make the location of the story the land a character in itself. After seeing this film at a drivein theater around 1975 White Lighting was a bad influence on a kid as I was in rural Wisconsin who had just gotten his driving license. I would discreetly take the parent's car and my friends out on dusty dirt roads in the countryside to execute some Burt Reynolds style driving. In addition some parts of the movie are even touching. These include when Reynolds meets his parents for the first time after spending time in prison. And when Reynolds prior to the big chase sequence at the end proclaims his confusion to a young woman at the Home For Young Mothers as to why his brother who tried to make something of himself was murdered while he had not done a damn good thing his entire life. Enough of my ramblings. In summary a movie with a number of added dimensions to put it far above and beyond a standard action movie. A pure classic.".

As for the action I would take wellfilmed exciting car chase and action sequences as seen in White Lightning over CGI special effects in today's films any day! Rural locations in the South are also used to great effect. You can almost feel the cold water of the swamp in a great opening sequence the ears of corn bouncing off the windshield as Reynolds drives the soupedup Ford through a cornfield and the dust coming off the tires.

	schema:reviewBody "Some people renting this expecting Gator style silliness are probably in for a surprise. This movie had a lot more of a Deliverence feeling than I expected and felt authentic to the South of the 1970s. Ok I wasn't there at the time so it could be completely wrong. But it was convincing.This is what Reynolds could have beena middleweight serious Southern Action actor like a cornpone Marlon Brando. There's just enough meat on the script to get the old mental wheels turning and just enough action that it doesn't turn into one of those boring intellectual films about the Bad Ol' South. All in all a good interesting tight movie. Of course it unfortunately led to Gator  a bloated mess  a few years later. Watching them back to back it's pathetic to watch how Reynolds declined into a buffoon. As he showed in Boogie Nights he's quite capable of playing serious dramatic roles. Too bad he didn't follow through on the promise of White Lightning but I'm sure the  were better for the garbage films he later made.".

Here Burt proves he can handle the serious stuff as the story of this movie is very serious. Burt plays Gator McKlusky an excon out to avenge the death of his kid brother at the hands of ubercrooked sheriff Ned Beatty. Beatty makes a truly hateful bad guy as he strives to keep his jurisdiction of Bogen County Arkansas the way he likes it ie with him as the absolute ruler.Reynolds agrees to help some federal agents prove that Beatty is taki9ng money from moonshiners but finds himself in a difficult moral position as it may mean betraying friends of his family. Ultimately there are a lot of cool car chases and nailbiting drama as we head towards the final clash between Reynolds and Beatty. There is great support from Jennifer Billingsley Bo Hopkins R.G. Armstrong and Matt Clark and the stunts arranged by Hal Needham who would later direct Burt in SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT and CANNONBALL RUN are excellent. This film is a mustsee".

Not only did Donny die but he was deliberately drowned by a crooked sheriff J.C. Connors Ned Beatty. Gator decides to cooperate with the Feds in order to get himself out of jail so he can seek revenge. His official mission will be to get the goods on not just Connors but the moonshiners with whom he does business.In general White Lightning is no great shakes but it's certainly a pleasant and watchable enough rural action flick. If it does one thing well it's that it showcases the charms of its star in fine fashion. Burt is engaging and the strong supporting cast is a big asset. Beatty actually underplays the role of the antagonist never turning him into the kind of cartoon character we might otherwise see in movies of this type. Jennifer Billingsley adds substantial sex appeal as Lou the gal who turns Gators' head. First rate character actors and actresses such as Bo Hopkins Matt Clark Louise Latham Diane Ladd R.G. Armstrong Dabbs Greer John Steadman and Iris Korn all contribute heavily. Buffs should note that Ladds' daughter Laura Dern appears in a couple of shots it was her film debut.The flavourful score by Charles Bernstein is most enjoyable and the filmmakers get great use out of various Arkansas locations. Joseph Sargent Colossus The Forbin Project The Taking of Pelham One Two Three does a fine job with the first unit direction but it's really Hal Needhams' deft handling of the action sequences that bring White Lightning to life at just the right times. William W. Norton wrote the screenplay creating a convincing milieu where traditional Southerners mistrust the current young generation of hippies and protesters. There are some poignant interludes with Gator  Lou and at a home for unwed mothers.Fine entertainment for devotees of old drivein movies.Seven out of 10.".

And that revenge plot must of necessity track to Bogan County Sheriff J.C.

In White Lightning wonderful Louise Latham makes a semicameo appearance as Sheriff Connors' reliable secretary.Aside from casting and acting White Lightning has other things going for it not the least of which is a realistic portrayal of a small Southern town. The authenticity with its various bubbas who frequent the pool halls display their guns with pride and race cars at the local fairgrounds is striking. And with their big engines the film's muscle cars gleefully tear up the pavement with their screeching tires and agile corner turning.Indeed those cars are so soupedup they even burn rubber on dirt roads. Oh well who cares if there's a minor sound effects plot hole. A more substantive plot hole has Sheriff Connors unfamiliar with the geography of his own county. In particular he might want to check the map again to note the existence of a large lake at the end of one particular dirt road. Still his ignorance is our gain as a plot point that proves symmetrically effective.Plot holes aside this is a film of dust dirt car chases whiskey stills the sounds of screeching tires and some dang good performances. White Lightning is worth viewing also for its 1970s nostalgia and for its authentic Southern setting.".

	schema:reviewBody "White Lightning is a terrific actiondrama that tells the story of a harddriving moonshiner named Gator McKlusky Burt Reynolds who is released from prison early in exchange for any help he can give the government with its case against his fellow moonshiners. Gator however has his own agenda and it has nothing to do with his altruistic nature. It seems that Sheriff J.C. Connors Ned Beatty of Bogen County is not only one of the biggest moonshiners in Arkansas he's also responsible for killing Gator's brother. And Gator wants revenge.One of the coolest things about White Lightning is that it presents Burt Reynolds as an actor at the top of his game. This was a Burt Reynolds who seemed to actually care about the final product and not just yucking it up with his buddies on screen. White Lightning was made before Burt became a clown mugging for the camera. That's not to say there isn't any humor in White Lightning  it's just used judiciously. Burt is joined by phenomenal cast. In addition to Ned Beatty who's perfect as the Sheriff R.G. Armstrong Bo Hopkins Diane Lane and Dabbs Greer give solid memorable performances. In fact I can't think of a single actor that bothered me. The movie was helped tremendously by the decision to film in rural Arkansas. I grewup in the South and everything from the locations to the sweat dripping off Burt's chin had a feeling of authenticity. I've been to places like the old Kroger I spotted in the background and I sweat just like Burt in the oppressively hot Southern summers. It all felt real to me. Finally the plot is just terrific mixing in just the right amount of high speed car chases brutal looking fight scenes and dramatic conversations. It drew me in right from the start and held my attention throughout. Overall it's a wellmade entertaining movie.".

Genial Wilfred HydeWhite one of Britain's finest character actors has a single scene as the local commissioner.The sequences dealing with the elephant herds the lives of the mahouts and the building of the stockade are all fascinating and give an almost documentary quality to the film at times.Born Sabu Dastagir in 1924 Sabu was employed in the Maharaja of Mysore's stables when he was discovered by Korda's company and set before the cameras. His first four films ELEPHANT BOY1937 THE DRUM1938 THE THIEF OF BAGDAD1940 JUNGLE BOOK1942 were his best and he found himself working out of Hollywood when they were completed.

Sabu is very good though his English is sometimes difficult to understand. This was Flaherty's only narrative film  I expect that he directed the nature parts of the film and Zoltan Korda directed the actors. The best moments feel just like Flaherty's masterpieces including a wonderful opening bit discounting the unnecessary prologue where Sabu his elephant and a monkey echo each other's movements as they all wake up in the morning.

A simple but strong story great shots of elephants.. who needs monster movies when you have these creatures? I can now better understand Sabu's short success story in the movies.

	schema:reviewBody "Long before Elizabeth Taylor took an unwanted stroll with these gentle giants in Elephant Walk there was Sabu as the Elephant Boy. This adorable adolescent who went on to play many delightfully mischievous free spirits obviously had that rare ability to cavort with nature unlike any other human. In this British made adventure drama from the Korda brothers Sabu is an Indian boy who comes from a long line of ancestors who have emotional ties with these pachyderms. Yes even as a beast of burden the elephant can sense that their master has passed on to that great elephant graveyard in the sky and they cry out in grief before going crazy. Only Sabu can stop the elephant who was mourning his father the leader of a hunt for wild elephants to be used as beasts of burden and now he must find a way to prove his worth to take his father's place. The kindly British commander of this expedition Walter Hudd takes a shine to little Sabu who has become the target of jealous hatred by others in the quest. This will lead to the test that Sabu must pass in order to continue his family's legacy.A magnificently filmed adventure drama with dollops of humor and a memorable debut by a young boy who hadn't set out to become a child star makes this a must. Other films with certain animals show their love for humans in spite of what some humans do to the animal kingdom and these elephants are no exception. The scene of Sabu being picked up by his beloved elephant is warmhearted as if the elephant considered him one of her own. Of course the shots of the baby elephants are just adorable and like the humorous scene in Hatari 1962 with a baby elephant falling for the pretty Elsa Martinelli you can't help but go Ah...... But like in all elephant movies even Dumbo you know that elephants deep down are wild creatures and once man does their worst to them it will not be a quiet payback. Scenes of a few other jungle animals Bengal tigers some cute little spider monkeys add to the nature of the film. The movie also speaks to the innocence of children when it comes to their love for the animal kingdom and the world they are learning about as well as the cynicism of the adults and how sometimes it is the child or childlike quality in grownups which brings peace to the world.".
