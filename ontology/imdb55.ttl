	schema:headline " Yet another Eastwood gem";
	schema:reviewBody "I feel like I should let everyone reading this know of my inherent bias in favor of this film. I have seen twenty eight films from Clint Eastwood as director and have liked the vast majority of them and loved a good number of them my average rating for the 28 films is 7.9. Still something felt off about Gran Torino based on the trailer. I read it as Eastwood trying to be 'badass' again trying to be Dirty Harry again. Gran Torino is not that. Walt Kowalski may have similarities with Dirty Harry and could possibly be read as a significantly older version of Harry it's a stretch but he is a distinctive memorable character on his own and I'd go as far as saying that it's one of Eastwood's finest performances and one which gives him a chance to show off his dramatic and comedic chops.I'm not going to argue that Gran Torino has perfect acting from the younger supporting cast. It doesn't. In fact some of them are downright bad at times but the film works in spite of its flaws. This screenplay was probably written with Eastwood in mind I am not sure of the behindthescenes details on this and it shows. He captures Kowalski perfectly. The film is surprisingly humorous something that isn't being captured well enough in advertising. It's absolutely hilarious at times watch as Kowalski attempts to make a man out of Thao by teaching him how to talk like men do and Eastwood handles the shifts in tone brilliantly. When the film takes a dark turn towards the end I sat on the edge of my seat in suspense fully aware of where it was heading but still mesmerized by Eastwood's tourdeforce direction. This is an artist at his prime as an actor and as a director.Whether or not Gran Torino will hold up as one of Eastwood's great films remains to be seen and the film feels like it would be good for multiple viewings. The characterization is strong and not simplistic at all you could argue that Kowalski is just another grouchy war vet but Eastwood's beautiful nuanced performance as well as some neat little touches in the screenplay particularly towards the end which I won't discuss in detail to avoid spoiling anything and it's really fun to watch this movie unfold Eastwood keeps the film moving at a wonderfully involving pace would prove you wrong. The film works on yet another level as a deconstruction of Eastwood's image. I don't mean that as a negative it just adds to the film's strength as a character study.It's a more intimate film than Eastwood's other film this year Changeling and also on a smaller scale than many of his other films but it's just as ambitious in many ways. This is not a politically correct film about a grouchy old racist suddenly turning into the most tolerant person around it is a film about a man who near the end of his life is forced to confront his demons and on the sunnier side about a man who finds true friendship where he least expected it. By the end of Gran Torino I had forgiven any flaws it might have and was completely satisfied with the film which far exceeded my expectations. I have a feeling that Gran Torino which has already been met with strongly positive reviews but is still being described as a 'minor' Eastwood film by some will eventually become an especially important part of Eastwood's filmography.".

Though Eastwood would rather focus on directing he can still carry a movie with his on screen presence and he's pure dynamite in Gran Torino. Perhaps the poor box office results of hollywoody movies like Absolute Power True Crime Space Cowboys and Blood Work caused Eastwood to shy away from acting but given cutting edge material to work with as Million Dollar Baby and Gran Torino he's as good as ever. His character as the racist and salty war vet makes you think of that old guy we've all had on our blocks with the garbage door open the million tools hanging everywhere and always fixing or building something. I found myself not wanting the movie to end because the scenes between himself and the various Hmong characters where priceless. There may be complaints over the racist remarks and scenes but Eastwood pulls it off in a way a real person like that would talk or act to a point where it ends up being lighthearted.

In so many subtle and intelligent ways we are allowed to make our own choices. Like with Kowalski in the movie you are not confronted with a role model hammering home all those life's important messages but rather with a movie saying Look! This is the way it worked out for me. And I think I know a few tricks that might help you but in the end it's your own life. However you have to trust me when I say that there are a some things you don't want to see or experience!. Some people will leave this movie entirely untouched others will certainly be crying their guts out. Not because some people get it and others don't but because it is a brilliant piece of entertainment reaching out to every viewer in its own specific way.Eastwood's acting is top notch again although the years have not been very kind to his voice. The rest of the cast are fine but one can certainly spot their more amateurish backgrounds here and there which is the main reason why I could not give this one a 1010.Apart from that there is little to criticize. It's not an action movie not a drama movie and certainly not a comedy even though you get a few laughs out of this one. It's simply a good story about life.....and death.".

	schema:headline " Another topnotch Clint Eastwood film that entertains and teaches.";
	schema:reviewBody "Manohla Dargis writes in the New York Times Dirty Harry is back in a way in Gran Torino not as a character but as a ghostly presence. He hovers in the film in its themes and highcaliber imagery and of course most obviously in Mr. Eastwood's face. It is a monumental face now so puckered and pleated that it no longer looks merely weathered as it has for decades but seems closer to petrified wood. Words like flinty and steely come to mind adjectives that Mr. Eastwood ... expressively embodies with his usual lack of fuss and a number of growls. More praise for Eastwood comes from Joe Morgenstern in the Wall Street Journal who comments No one makes movies like Gran Torino any more and more's the pity. This one with Clint Eastwood as director and star is concerned with honor and atonement with rough justice and the family of man. It raises irascibility to the level of folk art takes unapologetic timeouts for unfashionable moral debates revives acting conventions that haven't been in fashion for half a century and keeps you watching every frame as Mr. Eastwood snarls glowers mutters growls and grins his way through the performance of a lifetime. Elizabeth Weitzman in the New York Daily News remarks that it's clearly a careercapping work. Kenneth Turan in The Los Angeles Times writes that the movie is impossible to imagine without the actor in the title role. The notion of a 78yearold action hero may sound like a contradiction in terms but Eastwood brings it off even if his toughness is as much verbal as physical. Even at 78 Eastwood can make 'Get off my lawn' sound as menacing as 'Make my day' and when he says 'I blow a hole in your face and sleep like a baby' he sounds as if he means it.There are at least four reason why I like this film 1. Clint Eastwood shows that the character he is playing is willing to serve in a war and die if necessaryto preserve freedom and he has a medal to prove it 2. he has grown old and the whole world has changed and everyone around him seems to indicatein one way or anotherthat he is no appreciated or needed 3. even with a transformation he demonstrates that people tend to be reactiverather than responsiveand are slow to change this is particularly true with bias discrimination and prejudice and 4. that tolerance can lead to understanding he tries to give tough love but he becomes softer in his responseinstead of his reactionafter giving and receiving genuine love. It seems that everyone around him wants his Gran Torino and everything else he owns before he even has died instead of being interested in him. He lives in a community that is transformation and he knows absolutely nothing about culture diversity ethnicity race or sexual orientation. He does know about aging however if nowhere else he learns about it from people's adverse and negative reactions everywhere around him. He isn't exactly treated with dignity and respect so why should he treat anyone else with dignity and respect? And trust must be earned.If this is Clint Eastwood's last film I can only say that that his performance in this stunning film is what legends are made of. There are some wonderful performances in Milk Sean Penn Australia Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman Changeling Angelina Jolie and director Clint Eastwood and The Dark Knight a riveting performance by Brokeback Mountain's Heath Ledger. In viewing all of these films there are performances that are not only superb but they evoke every one of the emotions and carry the intellect and intelligence of human cognitions to the highest pinnacle of excellence. As a gay person I must say that I am moved by Sean Penn's portrayal of Harvey Milk I am moved by the romantic chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman and I would be remiss if I did not mention Angelina Jolie's flawless and moving performance. But I give the top honor to Clint Eastwood for giving us films that educate and entertain. And Gran Torino 2008 is no exception. One cannot walk away from a Clint Eastwood film without saying that they haven't learned something or without saying just like the legendary Ethel Merman used to sing 'there's no business quite like show business'. I rank Gran Torino 2008 a 10 out of 10. Clint Eastwood's performance is more than another version of 'Dirty Harry'. In fact his portrayal is reminiscent of the Paul Newman character in Nobody's Perfect.".

	onyx:emotionText "Manohla Dargis writes in the New York Times Dirty Harry is back in a way in Gran Torino not as a character but as a ghostly presence. He hovers in the film in its themes and highcaliber imagery and of course most obviously in Mr. Eastwood's face. It is a monumental face now so puckered and pleated that it no longer looks merely weathered as it has for decades but seems closer to petrified wood. Words like flinty and steely come to mind adjectives that Mr. Eastwood ... expressively embodies with his usual lack of fuss and a number of growls. More praise for Eastwood comes from Joe Morgenstern in the Wall Street Journal who comments No one makes movies like Gran Torino any more and more's the pity. This one with Clint Eastwood as director and star is concerned with honor and atonement with rough justice and the family of man. It raises irascibility to the level of folk art takes unapologetic timeouts for unfashionable moral debates revives acting conventions that haven't been in fashion for half a century and keeps you watching every frame as Mr. Eastwood snarls glowers mutters growls and grins his way through the performance of a lifetime. Elizabeth Weitzman in the New York Daily News remarks that it's clearly a careercapping work. Kenneth Turan in The Los Angeles Times writes that the movie is impossible to imagine without the actor in the title role. The notion of a 78yearold action hero may sound like a contradiction in terms but Eastwood brings it off even if his toughness is as much verbal as physical. Even at 78 Eastwood can make 'Get off my lawn' sound as menacing as 'Make my day' and when he says 'I blow a hole in your face and sleep like a baby' he sounds as if he means it.There are at least four reason why I like this film 1. Clint Eastwood shows that the character he is playing is willing to serve in a war and die if necessaryto preserve freedom and he has a medal to prove it 2. he has grown old and the whole world has changed and everyone around him seems to indicatein one way or anotherthat he is no appreciated or needed 3. even with a transformation he demonstrates that people tend to be reactiverather than responsiveand are slow to change this is particularly true with bias discrimination and prejudice and 4. that tolerance can lead to understanding he tries to give tough love but he becomes softer in his responseinstead of his reactionafter giving and receiving genuine love. It seems that everyone around him wants his Gran Torino and everything else he owns before he even has died instead of being interested in him. He lives in a community that is transformation and he knows absolutely nothing about culture diversity ethnicity race or sexual orientation. He does know about aging however if nowhere else he learns about it from people's adverse and negative reactions everywhere around him. He isn't exactly treated with dignity and respect so why should he treat anyone else with dignity and respect? And trust must be earned.If this is Clint Eastwood's last film I can only say that that his performance in this stunning film is what legends are made of. There are some wonderful performances in Milk Sean Penn Australia Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman Changeling Angelina Jolie and director Clint Eastwood and The Dark Knight a riveting performance by Brokeback Mountain's Heath Ledger. In viewing all of these films there are performances that are not only superb but they evoke every one of the emotions and carry the intellect and intelligence of human cognitions to the highest pinnacle of excellence. As a gay person I must say that I am moved by Sean Penn's portrayal of Harvey Milk I am moved by the romantic chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman and I would be remiss if I did not mention Angelina Jolie's flawless and moving performance. But I give the top honor to Clint Eastwood for giving us films that educate and entertain. And Gran Torino 2008 is no exception. One cannot walk away from a Clint Eastwood film without saying that they haven't learned something or without saying just like the legendary Ethel Merman used to sing 'there's no business quite like show business'. I rank Gran Torino 2008 a 10 out of 10. Clint Eastwood's performance is more than another version of 'Dirty Harry'. In fact his portrayal is reminiscent of the Paul Newman character in Nobody's Perfect.";

Crusty old Kowalski a Korean war veteran now living in run down Detroit hates the Vietnamese immigrants that have moved next door to him.

	schema:reviewBody "Hot on the heels of 'Changeling' Eastwood is back and as well as directing he is back in front of the camera. He plays Walt Kowalski a recently widowed exVietnam veteran who harbours slight racism and bitterness which isn't helped by the changing world he now lives in alone. He has relatives but they only seem to call when they want something and his grandkids have already started deciding what they will have of his when he dies. He has a few mates he drinks with in the pub but other than that his neighbourhood is being overrun by immigrants and gang warfare. Walt's next door neighbours are a Hmong family with no father figure and after the son tries to steal his prize car the 'Grand Torino' of the title Walt decides to try and reform the boy and hopefully as time passes learn about their culture and change his mind before he dies. As with all Eastwood films where you begin isn't where you will end up and the story takes many turns that will test all of your emotions I laughed I cried and I got angry it's a real rollercoaster. But its Clint's aged 'Dirty Harry' in Walt that steals the show and anytime he is on screen he is mesmerising which means that the supporting cast members are barely noticeable. At times it plays like Lynch's 'Straight Story' with sprinkles of 'Taxi Driver' but the real beauty is in the old fashioned storytelling something that Clint is a dab hand at mix that with the modern day context and you have a gripping and enthralling film. It's no wonder that so many 'best of year' lists contain this film they should it is that good and it proves that even at 78 Eastwood is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to movies in front or behind the camera or in the case of 'Grand Torino' both.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Gran Torino opening weekend and after hearing rave reviews I was looking forward to it. After seeing it I realized what people were excited about it was Clint's performance this is a man you do not want to mess with. He's the perfect good guy with a bad guy's lust for vengeance. I love his growls he sounds like a great guard dog I would love to just have him by my door if a salesman comes by to make that noise. I can't believe what a triple threat Clint is he's a writer director and an actor not to mention that he's great at all three of them. He presents Gran Torino with grace and style of an old man that society has forgotten about because of his bad mood not realizing that deep down he's truly a good man.Walt Kowalski a retired Polish American Ford automobile assembly line worker and a Korean War veteran lives with his dog Daisy in a changing neighborhood which is dominated by immigrants. At the start of the movie Walt is attending his wife's funeral bristling at the shallow eulogy of young Father Janovich. Similarly he has little patience with his two sons Mitch and Steve and their families who show little regard for Walt's grief or the memory of their dead mother. Walt's sons see him as always disappointed with them and their families unaware of their obnoxiousness. Walt's teenage Hmong neighbors a shy Thao Vang Lor and his feisty sister Sue live with their widowed mother and grandmother. The Hmong gang at that point tries to persuade Thao to join them. Thao's initiation is to steal Walt's prized car a 1972 Gran Torino Sport. Walt interrupts the robbery pointing a rifle in Thao's face and forcing him to flee. After a few days Spider and his gang return. With Sue at his side Thao manages to verbally confront them to no avail. The gang drags Thao off his porch in an attempt to assault him. His family tries desperately to fend off Spider and his cohorts. The conflict ends when Walt who fought in the United States Army's 1st Cavalry Division threatens the gang members with his M1 Garand rifle and orders them to get off his lawn. They leave the neighborhood telling Walt to watch his back.After seeing Sue being harassed by three black teenagers while her date cannot help her Walt steps in to rescue her confronting the teenagers and threatening them with a pistol. Sue gets to know Walt and invites him to a family barbecue on his birthday bringing him closer to her family explaining Hmong culture and that during the Vietnam War they fought on his side. Sue Thao and their mother visit Walt the next day with Thao's family forcing him to work for Walt for a week to atone for his attempted theft of the Gran Torino. Walt has Thao clean up the neighborhood until his debt is paid and shows Thao the ways of American men. Meanwhile the Hmong gang keeps pressuring Thao to join them. But when he refuses the Hmong gang goes too far in getting their revenge leading to Walt wanting more than punishment he wants justice.I highly recommend Gran Torino if you get the chance to see it it has terrific performances and a touching story. I'm really surprised that Clint didn't get more recognition for his strength in Walt he became that character and I loved how he protected the family that he once hated. It was wonderful to see all these characters develop and grow together they had great chemistry and made this movie into a great one. I think down the line Gran Torino is going to be considered a classic this is a terrific movie and deserves it's praise.910".

	schema:reviewBody "If movies like Indiana Jones Iron Man and The Dark Knight were the thoroughbred hits of 2008 then Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino is the dark horse. This rousing crowdpleaser is sure to surprise many through its copious sour humour and pure badassery while managing to still be an affecting and sombre dramatic entry in Eastwood's longenduring and wildly successful career in front of and behind the camera.You know that a movie has something going for it when it can a pack in so many oneliners you can't bring yourself to remember them after the show from oversaturation of the brain b be unboundedly racist yet still never seen exploitative or condescending and c make a pure grit andnails grimacing antihero one man army out of a seventyeight year old man. What is likely to surprise the most number of viewers is how funny this movie really is. Eastwood's direction and line delivery as a diamondhard antisocial veteran is bangon but never makes the film into a farce or embarrassment. This is due in part to the handling of the more touching dramatic moments which anchors the film in reality and reminds us of what is at play so to speak.Following the death of his wife Walt Kowalski Eastwood has nothing left but his dog to truly be with. His two sons and their families drift in and out but Walt's less then cheerful demeanour and their impartiality keeps them in different worlds and in different times. Walt is peppered by visits from Father Janovich Christopher Carley of the local church at the request of his late wife to 'keep an eye on him' but has little place for religion on his heavy conscience about as much time as he has for his new Hmong neighbours that move in next door. That is until the family's youngest son Thao Bee Vang begins to be harassed by a local gang who persuade him to steal Walt's prized Gran Torino as initiation. Saving Thao in an ensuing altercation Walt sweeps the fatherless teen away from the pressures of the criminal life and puts him to work at the request of his mother. Thao and his sister Sue Ahney Her befriend Walt in a way and for a reason none can truly explain.All of the Hmong actors in Gran Torino are pure novices who have never acted before and this is readily apparent. While a weak link the film as a whole is so satisfying it is really a moot point as it serves as no thorough determent. The arc of Walt is simple and easy to predict but then anything but would not work. Many scenes with the cultural clashes are funny and touching as with an unspoken dynamic with the elderly grandmother of the Lor family next door. A number of exchanges between the few remaining people in Walt's life who he still respects such as his barber and a construction worker who gets Thao a job are nothing short of comic genius and piece the Walt character into a true three dimensional individual.With a great song by Jamie Cullum to conclude the film which stands as a horrendous Oscar snub equalled only by the additional snub of the Bruce Springsteen Song from The Wrestler Gran Torino is a pure gem a film that both draws unexpected laughs soft smiles and tears from an audience that is happy to oblige as well as salute a screen legend in another iconic role that proves even at an old age a dark horse can still kick you in the face.".

His two sons and their families drift in and out but Walt's less then cheerful demeanour and their impartiality keeps them in different worlds and in different times. Walt is peppered by visits from Father Janovich Christopher Carley of the local church at the request of his late wife to 'keep an eye on him' but has little place for religion on his heavy conscience about as much time as he has for his new Hmong neighbours that move in next door. That is until the family's youngest son Thao Bee Vang begins to be harassed by a local gang who persuade him to steal Walt's prized Gran Torino as initiation. Saving Thao in an ensuing altercation Walt sweeps the fatherless teen away from the pressures of the criminal life and puts him to work at the request of his mother. Thao and his sister Sue Ahney Her befriend Walt in a way and for a reason none can truly explain.All of the Hmong actors in Gran Torino are pure novices who have never acted before and this is readily apparent. While a weak link the film as a whole is so satisfying it is really a moot point as it serves as no thorough determent. The arc of Walt is simple and easy to predict but then anything but would not work. Many scenes with the cultural clashes are funny and touching as with an unspoken dynamic with the elderly grandmother of the Lor family next door. A number of exchanges between the few remaining people in Walt's life who he still respects such as his barber and a construction worker who gets Thao a job are nothing short of comic genius and piece the Walt character into a true three dimensional individual.With a great song by Jamie Cullum to conclude the film which stands as a horrendous Oscar snub equalled only by the additional snub of the Bruce Springsteen Song from The Wrestler Gran Torino is a pure gem a film that both draws unexpected laughs soft smiles and tears from an audience that is happy to oblige as well as salute a screen legend in another iconic role that proves even at an old age a dark horse can still kick you in the face.";

	schema:reviewBody "My expectations coming in to see Gran Torino were very high and it certainly did not disappoint. Of course Clint Eastwood reputation has only gotten even better since his recent success as a director but this time it his performance that leads the way.Clint Eastwood had if not the best performance one of the best performances this year. His performance was vivid and magical to watch. Vivid may seem like a head scratcher of a word to use but his way of displaying his maliciousness antisocial and cynical attitude to the many people around him including his family. Yet over the course of the movie his attitude changes towards a Hmong family who are his neighbors. When one of the boys Thao from the neighbors' attempts to rob him of his Gran Torino the family sends him to work for Walt Clint Eastwood as punishment. While Thao works for Walt Walt begins to form a protective fatherly type bond over Thao. In this way as well Eastwood's performance is very vivid showing how his cold bitter attitude can transform into a very warm selfless demeanor towards one family.Gran Torino was also written and directed very well. Especially since a relatively unknown cast played to beyond anyone could have expected. Some how Clint Eastwood manages to continue to maximize the potential of the material he is given.This was a very heartwarming film in my mind throughout. The ending of the film is probably more of an ending to Eastwood's career as an actor rather than that of the movie itself. It does not leave him in the place he is looked at as a vigilante but rather in the place of the man that stands up for his morals and for the people he is loyal to.".

The steely eyed gaze gruff groveled voice full of growls grunts and innuendos serves the story of the film right to a tee. Not only does Eastwood serve as Director and Producer he gives a powerful and driven performance as a Korean War vet who for a better lack of words is stuck in those times. He believes in being a soldier the flag and hates foreigners. The story is great powerfully delivered of a man who is stuck but learns along the way to forgive and open his eyes and heart. The film delivers a sequence of teachings about friendship mentoring bullying lovehate gangs and sacrifice. It certainly gives us a direct look into race relations and the stressors that come with. This movie will make you laugh at times make you certainly think and humble you along the way. GREAT FILM".

Clint Eastwood gives a wonderful performance with also the supporting cast being brilliant. The story was excellent showing how much a person can chance when the prejudices are put aside.

The movie was directed very Eastwoodesk often just taking two or three shots like in Mystic River or Million Dollar Baby.

	schema:reviewBody "Now I understand why Clint Eastwood took over the directorial reins for Changeling from Ron Howard. Howard dropped Changeling in order to make FrostNixon instead. Eastwood did an excellent job on Changeling with a genuine feel for the dark subject matter and guided Angelina Jolie to one of the best performances of her career to date significantly expanding her dramatic range. The film that Eastwood really wanted to make this year GRAN TORINO was greenlit by that other deal. This is crucial since all of the Hmong cast are firsttime actors who were hand picked by Eastwood from cold auditions. Any film with a cast of unknowns can be a tough sell in Hollywood even with Eastwood helming and starring. The list of award winning Eastwood films that almost didn't get made is long and very distinguished. In casting Eastwood didn't want thespians. He wanted an honest exactness of performance. While I really like and respect Changeling I found GT to be far more satisfying. GT is probably not the best film of this year but it is one damn fine entertainment and it fully holds its own in this rich season of films that are up for awards contention. GT is an humorous and compelling meditation on the themes of ubiquitous bigotry culture clash political refugee immigrationresettlement and by way of that US foreign policy and Old School Doing the Right Thing vs today's more commonplace situational ethics. All of this rolled into two parallel coming of age stories served on platters heaping with very real slices of life. The messages crack like jabs with the sting of truth and are never too preachy. Eastwood is one of the few directors who respects the intelligence of his audience. He surprises film goers always without ever talking down. One coming of age story involves a neighbor kid Tao Vang Lor played by Bee Vang a dirtpoor son of divorced Hmong immigrants Vietnam war political refugees. Tao lives with his mother sister and grandmother next door to Walt Kowalski Eastwood. Walt insists upon calling Tao Toad initially with some good reason. Tao's sister Sue a scene stealing Ahney Her is spontaneously outgoing and engaging with Walt and confides to Walt that Tao is growing up without any proper male role models in his life. In fact Tao is in the midst of confronting the grim prospects of either being recruited into his badseed cousin's gang or becoming a permanent victim of said 'bangers. The less obvious coming of age story revolves around Walt Kowalski a recently widowed Korean War veteran. Walt's Polish ancestry seems to serve no purpose other than to establish him as ethnic white living in a dogeared neighborhood of ongoing immigration stories. Walt is a curmudgeon who lacks basic people skills with even his own family let alone the world around him. But he has managed his way though life fine enough up to the opening of the film's story. Just about every review I've read about GT describes Eastwood's Kowalski as a racist Korean War veteran which misses one of the major points raised in the film  that bigotry in the US is deeply ingrained in every niche of society. None of us is innocent or absolved of anything in this regard and the film is very frank about this point. Initially this serves as nothing more than a source for shock humor but Eastwood finds a way to subvert this into a message of toughlove hope. The gang life incursions into the story are very true to life. Gangs are always either recruiting new cannon fodder or marking new victims. If parents seeing this film had no clue about this they ought to start finding ways to open up ongoing lines of discussion with their kids about what's really happening daytoday at school in the playground and elsewhere. Most of the time kids like Tao just internalize all of these pressures hoping that they won't be picked on and otherwise feeling powerless. None of us should ever kid ourselves about all kids not just some kids being at risk. As for the nonwhite polyethnicity of Kowalski's part of town the disbelievers of the authenticity of that have only been exposed to the rarefied 'hoods of mainstream Hollywood. I can name any number of midtosmall citiestowns where the exact mix and flavors in GT are very real. You don't have to live in a 'hood to pass through andor stake out an occasional corner on which to hang. The Latino and black presence in the film never implied that they lived in that neighborhood although they were obviously trolling for victims. Perps who don't intend to be caught rarely hunt in their own backyards. Walt knows that he's dead set in his ways not all of them bad but not most of them good. Beyond the confines of his own property line Walt may be a little more effective than Tao out in the real world but he too is in many ways powerless to change the way most things are. Nevertheless in getting to know Tao Sue and the extended Hmong community to which the Lors belong Walt discovers that his Fort Apache ways don't work anymore. Walt realizes that he has yet to finally come of age too. Some will call this atonement. I call it growing up again at 78. Both are spot on. This film will make you laugh. It may even make you cry. But it might also make you think about some stuff you thought you were long ago done with thinking about. People at the screening I attended were so startled at the end that there was a significant moment of silence before applause finally broke out. GT is another lovely present from Clint Eastwood. Don't miss it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm from the industrial Midwest and I've known a lot of Walt Kowalskis. Grizzled white ethnic oldtimers who are not PC whose cars are their first love and who bemoan the loss of their neighborhoods and their city. I've also known a fair number of kids like Thao HmongAmerican kids trying to make it in a world their parents do not understand. I've known neighborhoods like Walt's neighborhoods in transition that show signs of decay but are still lived in and tended to by hard working old timers like Walt and their hardworking immigrant neighbors whom they don't understand and paint with a broad brush as the other. I was excited to watch Gran Torino because of the rave reviews and its portrayal of this world of which I am so familiar. Sadly while I appreciated the premise and was happy to see so many Hmong actors in Hmong roles rather than professional nonHmong Asian actors playing these roles the movie came up short. I found the dialogue and characters to lack credibility and the plot too clichridden to be taken seriously. The theme of death and rebirth brought to us mainly through the fraught relationship of Walt and the young priest had all the subtlety of a sledgehammerDid Walt HAVE to come to rest in a Christlike pose after the shooting in the last scene?! Puhleeeze. The deathassadandhappy thing just never really connected with the larger message of the movie of learning to love thy neighbor. I will cite one example of a relatively minor scene that illustrates this movie's larger problems In real life white boys who try to be down with the 'hood don't say it's all good bro! to some gangbanger they don't know after said gangbanger hits on their girlfriend. Maybe in a movie like Strait Outta Malibu could that scene have worked but in this context it was ridiculous and totally notbelievable. This seemingly minor miscue threw so much of the movie off because we're forced to conclude from it that Sue's boyfriend is mentally ill and if that's the case what does that say about Sue herself who is one the most important drivers of the plot? Overall this film suffers from too many clich characters and too many clich plot points to really be anything more than an average movie. Which is a shame because it could have been so much more and was a great opportunity for the wider world to get to know the Hmong people and their story.".

Again if everybody was that bad maybe no one would have noticed but they were up against a veteran actor so it was quite noticeable.The writing was a little empty and it didn't take a guru to see right through the plot.I know Clint Eastwoods movies are plain movies usually low budget with fresh new actors and simple plot lines with the exception of his latest WWII movies and Mystic River.

Clint Eastwood 200812Let me preface my comments by saying I am not here to rally against this film nor am I someone who detests the work of Clint Eastwood I count both Million Dollar Baby and Unforgiven as two masterpieces of cinema. I was expecting to love Gran Torino due to its impressive rating here on IMDb and its fairly positive critical notices however I found this film quite clumsy in its execution. Most of this is a direct result of an shoddy inept script. This is not a situation of bad dialog to the contrary Eastwood gets the occasional stinging one liner but rather of senseless construction and little care in story arcs and plotting. The film seems unsure if it wants to be a coming of age drama wherein the crusty set in his ways Eastwood learns a life changing lesson or if it wants to be Dirty Harry 6. In the end the film is neither and is instead a jumble of both and while there are some interesting moments within the two stories every time the audience settles into the film's rhythm the focus shifts top the other story. The film eschews character motivation in favor of crass sentimentality and suffers from split personality in the closing moments. At his directorial best Eastwood can bring subtle and delicate nuance to rather stereotypical situations here his work seems shoddy and just plain lazy. Revelations are rendered unrevealing and due to the lack of care taken in characterization the ending has little cumulative impact. Were it not for Eastwood's sheer magnetism as an actor the entire thing would be a disaster. As it stands this film is a wholly minor work in Eastwood's filmography and a completely unsatisfying experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie has so many problems that I'm not sure where to begin. So i'll simply mention things as they come to be rather than in chronological order. The first thing that has to go from this film is the awful scene at the barbershop where Clint is trying to teach Thao how to interact with people. Awful awful awful and it goes on and on and then it ends with the lamest joke about anal sex with some carpenters. Actually all the barbershop scenes can go because the only thing they accomplish is to show that Clint's character makes racist remarks even with his friends. But we get that from the scene with the Irish foreman. The priest should have been recast. That said the scene near the end when the priest just walks right into Clint's house is terrible. The whole movie the priest has been calling Clint's character by his first name and Clint keeps correcting him asking to be called Mr. Kowalski and then predictably in this late scene the priest calls him Mr. Kowalski and Clint says Call me Walt. Awful. And nothing is accomplished in the scene anyway. The editing is poor also. Scenes that have ended continue for a few more moments. For example the scene where Sue is being hassled by three black guys is over once Clint gets her into his truck and they drive away. But the scene continues with a crane shot of the three guys walking away and talking about Clint. What do we care what these guys think of him? The scene is over move on. Okay now for some real spoilers... The end is completely retarded. Clint's character should not die that way. After all his standing up to the gang earlier should have empowered the neighborhood to take a stand. They should have reported the names of the guys who raped and beat Sue. Instead Clint goes on a suicide mission somehow knowing that only then would people tell the police what's been going on. Someone says This time there were witnesses. Well hell there were witnesses every time but no one was willing to speak up. Why should they now? It's ridiculous. And then of course the kid inherits the stupid car. Who cares? What he should have inherited was the tools. The tools are what really brought those two characters together the tools are what will be useful to him in allowing him to get on with his life. The movie is plagued by some of the worst acting i've ever seen in a film. The bit where Thao is locked in Clint's basement and he's demanding to be let out had the whole audience laughing and it was supposed to be a serious moment. I don't understand why people love this film. My only guess is that the vast majority of filmgoers are morons. Oh well.".

	schema:reviewBody "The big movies about the Vietnam war  Apocalypse Now Deer Hunter Full Metal Jacket  didn't reach the screen until about five years after the war ended. But movies dealing with Iraq and terrorism are cropping up all over even as this war still rages.What exactly that means is hard to know but it would seem to indicate that no matter which side of the issue they come down on the filmmakers are willing to risk alienating about half the potential audience in an America more polarized today than at any point in our history.In the Valley of Elah treads lightly on the politics for most of the movie concentrating on the unfolding mystery of what happened to a young soldier who vanishes shortly after returning from a tour of duty in Iraq. Looking for answers are his father a former sergeant in the Army's Criminal Investigation Division and a young female civilian detective who gets involved in the case gets bounced off in a jurisdictional dispute but winds up back on the case when its determined the crime took place off military property.While director Paul Haggis gets uniformly good performances out of all the characters the movie belongs to Tommy Lee Jones as the grieving father and Charlize Theron as the determined detective. Both turn in outstanding performances. Jones shines playing a man who has spent his life holding in his emotions and can't change now even as his world falls apart. Theron radiates strength as a woman trying to survive in a sexist police department where all her male colleagues are certain she slept her way into her detective's job. That is somewhat important to the story because the movie provides a look into the lower class white community that provides the bulk of the recruits in the all volunteer army.None of this really deals with the politics of the war though and it is not until the very end of the film that politics come into play and even there it is handled with great care. The message is more about the kind of war America finds itself fighting today and what that type of combat does to the men who engage in it. Unlike world wars one and two Vietnam and Iraq are not wars between easily recognized enemies. We are not battling the Germans or the Japanese. In both Nam and Iraq Americans find it is difficult to tell friend from foe. That means they often must make snap decisions that sometimes determine whether they themselves live or die. Needless to say their decisions also determine the fate of the people in the sights of their weapons..In the Valley of Elah does an excellent job of showing that post traumatic stress syndrome is not an oddity but rather a growing problem in an army of young men whose job requires them to be quick on the trigger.Every American should see this movie and then think long and hard about it.".

The film's plot follows the father played by Tommy Lee Jones as he sets about trying to find out what happened. Most of the characters here are either military people or local cops.The story is heavy on mystery and investigation. The father's research skills are more potent than those of some local cops. Subtle plot twists and red herrings throughout keep the story's outcome uncertain until the end.Based very loosely on a reallife event in 2003 the film's backstory pertains to the war in Iraq. Because of the controversial nature of this war some viewers will read into the film a nefarious political agenda dismissing it as propaganda. In point of fact the motivation that led to the reallife event is to this day still shrouded in mystery.Production values are generally high. The film has terrific detailed production design. Sound quality is near perfect which when combined with the absence of background music in some scenes enhances a sense of realism. Film editing is reasonably good though a number of scenes could have been edited out as they are either unnecessary or a tad confusing. If one is not privy to the film's point of view the ending is slightly ambiguous especially with regard to motivations of certain characters. An added line or two of dialogue could have added clarification.Acting is wonderful. Tommy Lee Jones with his weatherbeaten face is convincing as a tough patriotic American military dad. Charlize Theron is satisfying as a frustrated local cop. Even minor roles are well cast. Kathy Lamkin in a small role couldn't be any more realistic as the impersonal haggard manager of a fastfood restaurant.I found In The Valley Of Elah entertaining as a mystery. The terrific casting and acting along with high production values render a film that is both realistic and highly believable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Only Roger Ebert and the reviewer for Rolling Stone seem to see the truth here this film is slow and elegiac because it deals with heavy matters but it is never boring not if you understand the situation and the depth of feelings being explored. It's as if reviewers don't get it because they didn't really feel what the film is saying. Saying that there have been dozens of films about how war ruins men so it's a clich and that this one is too dreary and slow means that a person has stopped feeling for what is really hurtful is even in denial. And that's the theme of this film what happens when we lose touch with what's painful and don't care any more. The film is restrained but powerful which is why it has such a strong effect. Jones is wonderfully grim with a face like a road map as he explores what happened to his son. Charlize Theron is beautiful even though she is playing a woman who is forced to act as nonsexy as possible to get on in her job in a male police force. Susan Sarandon is not as some critic said underused she gives a performance that is all the more powerful because it is restrained. This movie should be a must see for all who believe that the Iraq war should continue until there is an honorable time for America to leave. That time is already passed.".

	schema:headline " It's not about war it's not about murder... it's about coping.";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie uniquely dealt with the mechanism of coping with traumatic experiences. True it was a war pic. Yes it had an additional look what we're doing to our kids antiwar message which was driven home in the scene where he's finally leaving his son's barracks and this young pimply faced kid starts settling in and yes it was a murder mystery but the method in which Haggis portrays the different behaviors the characters exhibit while trying to deal with extremely stressful and traumatic experiences was the main point of the movie.Haggis drove the point home with careful camera techniques and crafting truetolife characters. I like the way he kept the camera back at the end of the hallway when Mrs. Deerfield cried into her husband's arms after viewing the mutilated body of her son. He employed a similar method when she broke down and started crying on the phone Mr. Deerfield I'm not gonna sit on the phone and listen to you cry. Mrs. Deerfield Then don't  Deakins has the camera up on the stairs looking directly down on her while she sits hunched over on the floor. It's not that Haggis is hiding these moments from the audience  I believe that it is more of a commentary on our disconnection from our own emotions during these moments.Additionally Haggis has the actors restrain themselves during the height of when one expects them to indicate the most suffering and when the camera is close enough to expose it i.e. Mr. Deerfield seeing his mutilated son for the first time also towards the end when he realizes that his own rigid personality alienated his son from himself and Cpl. Penning's almost robotic nonremorseful confession of murdering Spc. Deerfield  which was a phenomenal performance  are two good examples. You could see the mountain of emotion being suppressed behind his cold exterior. His confession was so level that it was hard for me to accept the fact that he had stabbed Pfc. Deerfield over 42 times dismembered his body then set fire to it. But this is exactly the point Haggis was trying to make  this disconnection from reality death as a video game with no consequences React or die. React or die. By the way I think Tommy Lee Jones did an amazing job as well. And that's an understatement.Further exposs on the aspects of coping include the side story of the soldier who first held down his Doberman in the tub until it drowned and subsequently repeated that action with his wife instead. Spc. Bonner hanging himself for his involvement in the murder of Deerfield. Pvt. Ortiez's full denial of the fact that their squad ran over an Iraqi child That wasn't no kid. That was a dog. As far as I'm concerned that was a dog. I don't know what that picture is.. More importantly Spc. Deerfield's own methods of coping served to act as the catalyst for the plot. The one moment he had and the only moment in the movie where tears are actually shown falling where he tried to reach out to his father Dad something happened. Can you get me out of here? he got snubbed. So his ability to cope manifested itself into destructive behavior doing drugs badmouthing the stripper torturing the Haji militant picking fights with his comrades  ultimately leading to his demise. All of these characters had their demons to deal with. The point of the movie was how to deal with those monsters. The title itself acting as a metaphor to that exact question. The Valley of Elah  where David took his stand against Goliath  was where all the characters of this movie stood in the shadows of their own Goliaths. Some fought Mrs. Deerfield Det. Sanders some stuck their heads in the sand Ortiez Mr. Deerfield and some ran away Penning Bonner. Much like the tagline states sometimes finding the truth is easier than facing it.I also thought the movie was unique in the angle it took on war its psychological impact. Excluding such crappy movies like Iron Eagles and Flight of the Intruder good war movies have more than an accomplishinganobjective plot type in mind. Saving Private Ryan although based entirely around an objective used the multitude of horrors the characters encountered to highlight their methods of dealing with it. I'd say this movie was more along the lines of Deer Hunter or Jarhead  where what you see in war plays second fiddle to how you deal with what you see in war.The only objection I had to the movie a very moderate one was originated by my girlfriend who served in Iraq  I hadn't thought about it until she brought it up. True the movie is a very small slice of life take on our involvement in Iraq granted PTSD is a MAJOR aspect of this war  but there are many other facets as well so it's not entirely unjustified to have ALL the soldiers of this movie be so fed up from their wartime experiences. However it would have been nice to see at least one soldier try to cope with his demons in a more constructive way  be it counseling or in some other nondestructive method. When I visited my girlfriend in Germany during her leave I came across pamphlets brochures and television commercials on the Armed Services Network that encouraged infantry men and women to seek counseling in helping deal with PTSD acclimating to life in the states again returning to their families and so forth. Nevertheless personally I don't feel that this is too critical of a point to make  Haggis is trying to illustrate a specific notion of the effects of war and shouldn't have to cater to any of the exceptions to the rule.".

	schema:reviewBody "There have been many films about the aftermath of war but never have I seen such a brutally honest and shocking depiction of the dehumanization of soldiers back from war. This is the underlying premise of the new crime thriller from academy award winning writerdirector Paul Haggis Crash.Hank Deerfield played by Tommy Lee Jones is a retired veteran and military police officer searching for his son who has gone AWOL. A detective Emily Sanders played by Charlize Theron becomes interested in the case and starts helping Hank outside of her job. When Hank's son's body is found the search suddenly turns into a search for the murderer.One of the many aspects I appreciated was that director Haggis did not turn this into a typical Hollywood crime thriller and also not turn it into a political propaganda piece against the war and President Bush. Instead he mixes the two plots together seamless and subtle letting you decide for your self.Tommy Lee Jones gives the best performance of his long career as he plays a quiet emotionless war vet but still shows tremendous amount of emotion. Just watching his face as he sits in a diner and listens to one of his retired friends tell him about plans to go visit his grandchildren is heartbreaking. We can almost see the internal emotional struggle as he realizes he will never be able to do that. Charlize Theron does a wonderful job as the detective and despite her small screen time Susan Surandon plays the grieving wife of Jones to perfection.This film is such a moving masterpiece on so many levels it is simply wonderful to watch. The quiet pacing of the film building up to the climax is captivatingly intense in its own way. I am sure this will be a popular film at the Oscars this year and if they gave out awards for best scene this would be sure to garner a nomination for a simple poignant yet profoundly moving scene when Frank tells the story of David and Goliath which took place in the Valley of Elah to the little son of detective Sanders.".

	schema:headline " War as Parable  IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH";
	schema:reviewBody "'War is hell' but perhaps it is the postwar that is most telling. At least that is the thesis of Paul Haggis' latest film In the Valley of Elah a story of a father's quest for his son that reveals some bitter truths about war. Not an easy film to swallow upfront it is certainly one of the best films of the year.A grizzled former military policeman Hank Deerfield Tommy Lee Jones is notified that his son Mike is AWOL after returning from the fighting in Iraq. What begins as a methodical search for his son's whereabouts becomes more tragic and clashes with local police and military brass. Where is his son and what do his soldier buddies know about one fateful night near their base? And what if anything did happen to him in Iraq? These questions are answered in small pieces and with alarming implications. Hank's skills at police work help convince local Detective Emily Sanders Charlize Theron to take charge of the case despite the doubts of her own colleagues and the military led by investigator Lt. Kirklander Jason Patric. Mike's PDA has garbled video that begins to paint a disturbing picture of the war front. Hank's search takes an emotional toll on himself and his wife Susan Sarandon. He and Emily form an uneasy alliance and amid theories and suspects what emerges is an ominous portrait of war veterans on the homefront. Ultimately Hank comes face to face with a disarming truth about his son's fate and the possible involvement of his military brethren.The story is based on actual events in 2001 in Tennessee and its title references the mythic tale of David and Goliath set at a time when the rules of engagement were different than the present. Its sparse simplistic structure of a mystery peppered with flashback video and imagery may seem on surface like an independent film but its message and execution is on a grander scale and not merely with dialogue. With effective visuals much is conveyed by silence expression or simple body language.As with other Haggis films things that seem ordinary and insignificant at the beginning have implications later on. Though not as overtly obvious with connecting a myriad of dots as in his Oscar winner Crash the threads are all there to gradually weave together. It is refreshing that the jurisdictional conflict between local police and the military does not take a stereotypic turn of heavy handed conspiracy and coverup even though the military investigators are not cast in the best light. It shares a similar feel with the recent Courage Under Fire where the truth is unearthed in small bits until a bigger picture emerges. A couple of minor plot points go nowhere such as Hank meeting an old comrade who may have connections with military intelligence.As grandiose and flamboyant as was his Oscarwinning turn in The Fugitive Tommy Lee Jones' acting here is equally underplayed he is magnificent. Through the pain and guilt that creep over his lined features you also feel his suffering his loss and understand his bitterness. His Hank is a proud man a patriot who wants the truth. The truth ultimately changes him forever. Equally up to the challenge is Theron in a strong performance whose detective is a single mother who must battle her own squad and superiors while trying to solve a mystery. Even Sarandon's brief moments are affecting as the long distance wife. The rest of the cast is very good they become real people.This is not simply the readjustment to the homefront done magnificently in The Best Years of Our Lives or the heavy use of dramatic love triangle to condemn the Vietnam War in Coming Home. Rather it takes the concept of a given war and allows it to become the ultimate villain in an increasingly sordid mystery. Its ending calls to mind The Deer Hunter but with a more pessimistic bent. It most certainly vilifies the effects of war on its men.It is significant that a passing quote We all do stupid things says something about not just the horror of warfare but what such conflict does to its soldiers and how they become soulless monsters capable of the most brutal of crimes. This is a brave imperfect film that sets a somber tone and never lets up. The final image is a statement that makes this perhaps the subtlest of antiwar films ever. Oscar nominations can start here with picture direction screenplay and the duo of Jones and Theron. While not everyone will be willing to let the story unfold with its nuanced direction and understated acting those who are patient will find a moving tale of innocence lost and corrupted.".

Where is his son and what do his soldier buddies know about one fateful night near their base? And what if anything did happen to him in Iraq? These questions are answered in small pieces and with alarming implications. Hank's skills at police work help convince local Detective Emily Sanders Charlize Theron to take charge of the case despite the doubts of her own colleagues and the military led by investigator Lt. Kirklander Jason Patric. Mike's PDA has garbled video that begins to paint a disturbing picture of the war front. Hank's search takes an emotional toll on himself and his wife Susan Sarandon. He and Emily form an uneasy alliance and amid theories and suspects what emerges is an ominous portrait of war veterans on the homefront. Ultimately Hank comes face to face with a disarming truth about his son's fate and the possible involvement of his military brethren.The story is based on actual events in 2001 in Tennessee and its title references the mythic tale of David and Goliath set at a time when the rules of engagement were different than the present. Its sparse simplistic structure of a mystery peppered with flashback video and imagery may seem on surface like an independent film but its message and execution is on a grander scale and not merely with dialogue. With effective visuals much is conveyed by silence expression or simple body language.As with other Haggis films things that seem ordinary and insignificant at the beginning have implications later on. Though not as overtly obvious with connecting a myriad of dots as in his Oscar winner Crash the threads are all there to gradually weave together. It is refreshing that the jurisdictional conflict between local police and the military does not take a stereotypic turn of heavy handed conspiracy and coverup even though the military investigators are not cast in the best light. It shares a similar feel with the recent Courage Under Fire where the truth is unearthed in small bits until a bigger picture emerges. A couple of minor plot points go nowhere such as Hank meeting an old comrade who may have connections with military intelligence.As grandiose and flamboyant as was his Oscarwinning turn in The Fugitive Tommy Lee Jones' acting here is equally underplayed he is magnificent. Through the pain and guilt that creep over his lined features you also feel his suffering his loss and understand his bitterness. His Hank is a proud man a patriot who wants the truth. The truth ultimately changes him forever. Equally up to the challenge is Theron in a strong performance whose detective is a single mother who must battle her own squad and superiors while trying to solve a mystery. Even Sarandon's brief moments are affecting as the long distance wife. The rest of the cast is very good they become real people.This is not simply the readjustment to the homefront done magnificently in The Best Years of Our Lives or the heavy use of dramatic love triangle to condemn the Vietnam War in Coming Home. Rather it takes the concept of a given war and allows it to become the ultimate villain in an increasingly sordid mystery. Its ending calls to mind The Deer Hunter but with a more pessimistic bent. It most certainly vilifies the effects of war on its men.It is significant that a passing quote We all do stupid things says something about not just the horror of warfare but what such conflict does to its soldiers and how they become soulless monsters capable of the most brutal of crimes. This is a brave imperfect film that sets a somber tone and never lets up. The final image is a statement that makes this perhaps the subtlest of antiwar films ever. Oscar nominations can start here with picture direction screenplay and the duo of Jones and Theron. While not everyone will be willing to let the story unfold with its nuanced direction and understated acting those who are patient will find a moving tale of innocence lost and corrupted.";

	schema:reviewBody "Loosely based on the story of Richard Davis who was killed by fellow soldiers in Columbus Georgia after returning from Iraq in 2003 In the Valley of Elah Paul Haggis' first feature since his Oscar winner Crash is a poignant reminder of how war robs people of their humanity. In one of the best performances of his career Tommy Lee Jones is Hank Deerfield a career military man whose son Mike Jonathan Tucker is reported as AWOL from his New Mexico base after returning from eighteen months in Iraq. What Hank discovers in searching for Mike is enough to shake his faith in an institution that had nurtured him and threaten his entire world view.Though Deerfield is an exmilitary man who knows the value of discipline and hyperefficiency he is a man who carries the scars of the death of his other son killed in a military training accident. When he learns about Mike's disappearance he tries to calm the fears of his wife Joan Susan Sarandon but one can sense in the lines of sadness etched in his worn face that he is very worried. In a very prophetic scene as he sets out for the Army base to conduct his own investigation he notices that an American flag is flying upside down a symbol of international distress and stops to teach the groundskeeper the difference.At the base Deerfield is thwarted by the stonewalling of the military and the inept local police force and cannot get anywhere with Lt. Kirklander Jason Patric who is in charge of the missing person operation. Fortunately he finds a detective Emily Sanders Charlize Theron who is assigned to the case. Taunted by chauvinist fellow detectives who think she slept her way onto the squad she is eager to prove herself as capable as her detractors. When Deerfield's body is discovered gruesomely cut up in an open field Deerfield and Sanders work together to piece together the puzzle suspecting the involvement of drugs and drug dealers. With the help of video left on Mike's cell phone however he discovers secrets that begin to shake his faith in American institutions though he never questions his son's actions.In one of the most moving sequences in the film Hank tells Sanders little boy the biblical story of David who killed the giant Goliath with a slingshot in the valley of Elah. Deerfield soon understands however that it is not enough to fight your own fears in standing up to an adversary but it is necessary to treat the enemy as a human being while still doing your job. Mike and his fellow soldiers have been unable to erase the ugly violence they perpetrated on civilians in Iraq and have brought this self hatred home. In spite of a too literal ending that robs us of the power of our imagination and borders on the polemic In the Valley of Elah is a compelling and moving film that makes certain we do not forget what the war in Iraq has done not only to our soldier's bodies but to their minds and souls as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are many people out there who hate the way Paul Haggis made his directorial debut Crash an overly soapy and stupidlytiedtogether drama at least that's what it felt like to them. Those people don't have to worry. His second major directorial outing In the Valley of Elah avoids both of the mistakes although I'd hardly call them that seeing as he won Best Picture for what he did with Crash that he made last time around. Instead of mixing together multiple stories and having them all connect at the very end this movie revolves around one main story a story that seems a lot like the modernday war version of Chinatown. Instead of going for simple emotional tugs that he did with Crash this film focuses on its understated performances namely from Tommy Lee Jones who is superb in this film. It is truly courageous of Paul Haggis to be willing to make some serious changes to the style that won him a Best Picture Academy Award and even more impressive that he pulls it off very well.The story revolves around an exmilitary officer Hank Deerfield who is told that his son a soldier returning home from Iraq has gone missing. Jones plays the character in such a quiet way that makes you feel like he thinks he shouldn't be showing emotion but has a lot of it bottled up inside of him. When he arrives at the military station people don't seem to want to tell him what happened and say that they expect he'll come to the base anytime soon this is portrayed especially well by James Franco who you may know as Harry Osbourne from the Spiderman movies.Refusing to believe that it's as simple as that Deerfield is relentless in getting information out of people as to what really happened. It's the way he functioned in the army and it benefits him greatly as he has to get any information he can out of people. Enter Detective Emily Sanders played by a very strong Charlize Theron who at first just wants to get through her job for the day but soon gets wrapped up in also discovering what really happened to Deerfield's son. The two of them have great chemistry together as their two different personalities give two different perspectives on what's happening.The movie works because although it does have quite a few negative things to say about the current war in Iraq the entire film isn't a twohour tirade against it. It only makes that message part of the story and does it in subtle ways aka the soldiers don't just go War...it...destroys...you... but take a lot more time expressing their emotion. Much of the story works like a mixture between the great film Chinatown and a much betteracted betterwritten version of a really good episode of CSI. Although there may be a few too many twists and lies circling about it comes to its conclusion very well in a satisfying way for the audience.Paul Haggis has an uncanny way of bringing out great performances from all of his actors. The performance of Tommy Lee Jones could be the best of his career he brings out a much more emotionally quiet side in Charlize Theron than we've before seen the short performance of Susan Sarandon is particularly powerful and all of the soldiers are played with a feeling of sincerity. The acting is probably the strongest element of the film and if there's any weak part it would have to be the way Haggis forced out some of the plot twists to make the film as long as he wanted it to be.Regardless of its few problems In the Valley of Elah is both a very wellmannered look at the war in Iraq and its effects on the people involved as well as a very interesting crime thriller. At the heart of it is Haggis's quietly powerful directing style and the cast's powerfully quiet performances. I don't see this picking up a Best Picture nomination as Haggis's past three Oscar hopeful screenplays Letters from Iwo Jima Crash and Million Dollar Baby but I would not be surprised to see it pick up a few acting nominations as well as possibly a screenplay nod. If it does...it would have definitely earned it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Paul Hagas's In the Valley of Elah follows carefully and closely all the long held and well affirmed standards of any good murder mystery. For anyone who really enjoys this Genre you won't be disappointed. That being said I believe the performances also strengthen this story. Tommy Lee Jones hands in a subdued yet internally complex performance the like I've never seen him do before. He is tough and yet has the sensitivity necessary to drive the character along to where it needs to go. Susan Sarandon gives a strong performance as the mother of a missing soldier. She is placed in the position of an actress having to create a great role from a small part and pulls it off by tapping what must be very heartfelt emotions.Ms. Theron is good and carries off her part well. She is once again not afraid to look bad in order to carry a role. It is a good performance...that's all. I'm not writing home to Mom over it though. The rest of the cast is very strong and gives me great hope for the future of Film making in this country. The cast works well together and makes a compelling story.The part of this film that is the Star and center piece is Paul Hagas's script. He sets up the characters and situations in a direct and fast manner. The storyline is consistent and flows well and as I mentioned he follows the correct direction that any good murder mystery should. He also makes us aware of the growing struggles of our soldiers and what is going on as a result of this war in Iraq. Please see this film and look at it for what it is...a good mystery with great performances.".

	schema:reviewBody "Maybe a reason some people are praising the actors' performance highly but not recommending to see the movie is because the actual experience of watching In the Valley of Elah is just too unsettling like a mirror of our actual experience in Iraq whatever your political views may be.Notice that although the movie's crime story is solved by the end it turns out not to involve any conspiracy the exact reverse of what the story has led us to anticipate we misread the army official's behavior assuming the military must be trying to cover up something. We're pulled into the whodunit but we don't get the satisfying twist that crime stories like this usually give us. The young soldier wasn't killed while heroically trying to uncover a dark secret. Instead he dies senselessly and for nothing.But isn't this experience this let down while watching the movie a lot like our real life experience of the past 4 years? We wanted to believe Iraq was somehow linked to the terrible crime inflicted on us but our early hoped for retribution has instead come up against a completely different reality no weapons of mass destruction and a lengthening war no one wants. The David of our hopes marched into Iraq but the lengthening shadow of Goliath still stands before us.Terrific movie. Works on so many levels at once never preachy never obvious completely real. I didn't leave the theater feeling great but I felt fully engaged and I felt like it mattered again to be an American. The people in this movie are almost every single one so likable at least sooner or later they are and the places are so recognizably American in ways I care about that the movie was an affirmation. Except of course the people in this movie  like all of us  are trapped in a war with awful unforeseen consequences hitting where we live even if the bombs don't. So the wouldbe affirmation leads only to sad disappointment and remorse the more heartfelt for its reallife applicability.In the movie it's pretty clear that Mike Deerfield is destroyed exactly because he starts out as such a good and decent young man. Besides being brave getting out of the Humvee to take the photo he has a heart and a conscience and therefore couldn't rationalize away his part in killing the Iraqi boy no matter how unintended. In one sense Mike tries to be like a David who faces the monster Goliath of war.But that's the conventional view. The much more disturbing one is that Mike's downfall is rooted in the fact that he himself has become a monster no matter how unintended. And sadly isn't Mike really a stand in for us? In the Valley of Elah the roles have been reversed and America has become the bad guy in some crazy unintended way. Notice that America is clearly the Goliath in power compared to a bunch of ragtag Iraqis no matter how murderous some of their intent. Yet we are felled by a small Iraqi boy's fearless stand why didn't he just run out of the road?! the boy's implied recrimination shooting for Goliath's heart instead of his head  no less deadly for that.A fine and decent people are brought low their best motives twisted around and perverted until they find themselves inflicting barbarity they never thought was possible just like the father in the movie who can't believe until the end that his son's comrades could be culpable. That's why the father hangs the US flag upsidedown making the universal distress call something's gone seriously wrong and we need any help we can find to get out of our Valley of Elah.The powerful thing about this movie is that we are propelled seamlessly if uncomfortably back and forth across these two understandings of who is David and who is Goliath. The reverberations continue for a long time.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have no idea what to say about this film. No that's not true. I have so much to say I just can't organize my thoughts. It's an astoundingly good film about an appallingly depressing subject. After watching this at Santa Cruz CA's delightful Art Deco Del Mar Theater my spouse and I drove home in silence and poured a stiff drink before either of us could even begin deconstructing such an astonishing piece of cinema. What to say? What to review? I mean do I talk about the movie or the subject? Movies don't get much better than this but it was a harrowing experience watching it. Don't go when you want an evening of escapist fun. This is not a Friday Night movie. This is a Wet Monday Afternoon movie. Is it only possible to make great movies out of such depressing material? Let's start with the actual movie directed by Oscar winner Paul Haggis. I'm sure this will be his next nomination. Maybe his next win. It works both as a detective story and a social piece. Every word of the script is perfect not a word too many not a word too few. It's perfectly edited and perfectly shot. Synopsis Soldier returning from tour in Iraq goes AWOL. His father  ex army and ex military police  turns up at his son's base wanting to know what has happened and the soldier then turns up dead in small pieces and apparently cooked. There is a gray area as to whether this is a military or civilian matter and the father Tommy Lee Jones finds himself stuck between an incompetent civilian police force and an edgy and defensive military police force neither of whom really gives a toss about the truth the first because truth is too demanding the second because it's too embarrassing. Why did his son die? Through deciphered cell phone images and gradually disintegrating platoon buddies father discovers that his son was not the nice guy he thought he was that he had nasty secrets to hide from mom and dad like drugs and a habit of torturing Iraqi prisoners and running over kids.Tommy Lee Jones gives the performance that will certainly earn him a nomination and could well get him the Best Actor Oscar. He's an actor I've admired since Men in Black really! It's on my All Time Favourites list and in Elah his craggy character matches his craggy face. We feel every ounce of his despair and disillusionment without any histrionics because the script is spare and the acting superb. Charlize Theron co stars as the police detective who finds herself dragged into the investigation almost against her will. Despised by her male colleagues who feel she has slept her way to detective status she goes from traffic patrol to Truth Fairy while juggling life as a single mom. This is certainly far and away the best thing I've ever seen Charlize Theron do. She looks raw and unglamorous and spends a large part of the movie with a Band Aid over her nose after TL Jones inadvertently lands a punch in her face. Susan Sarandon's part is fairly small as TL Jones' wife but I can see why she wanted to take the role and her scenes though few are stunning and stark. Almost set aside as merely the mother whose job after all as a mere girly was just to give birth to and raise her sons. Couldn't you leave me one of my boys? she cries in anguish to her husband at one point she is not allowed into the room where her son's gruesome remains lie father was and is expected to be stalwart and supportive even though dad TL Jones set the macho tone for the home by encouraging both sons to go into the military where both died. Everyone is good in this movie the well known and the lesser known. I have seen reviews which suggest it is too long but personally I don't see a thing which could have been cut.Now the film's subject matter America's presence in Iraq this is far more thorny and maybe IMDb is not the correct forum for an indepth analysis. But personally I'd be happy to see Elah made compulsory viewing in every home. Here's a thought as a society becomes 'softer' and its sons and daughters are taught equality diversity emotional intelligence and political correctness all through their formative years how does that society then train the killers its military wing needs for war? Apparently by hammering into them some kind of totally over the top hyper machoness which not only melds them into a fighting unit but inures some to normal standards of human behaviour and possibly turns a few into sadists of the nastiest variety. Or were these guys sadists before they joined the army and got shipped to Iraq? Then shoving them into a totally unnecessary and unwarranted war where it is impossible to tell who is a friend and who a foe. How do you come from a society that purports to believe every life is valuable and find yourself running over children playing in the street in case they are the enemy? This movie is said to be based on a real story. If it is and that doesn't sober us up nothing will. The only real surprise is that more of them don't go nuts.One very slight criticism. The murder site looks exactly the same as the murder site in Paul Haggis' Oscar winner Crash. It jarred. I found it a distraction to be saying to myself Hey isn't that where they found the body in Crash too? He needs to find a new location scout.".

	schema:reviewBody "Indeed a very touching and captivating film!At first thought this film flashes out like a 'who dun it' thriller but it gradually dawns on me that the smoking out of the murderer is of lesser importance than the implied warning its story has to unfold. Nope don't make hasty judgment t and associate this film to some liberal antiwar hogwash until you have seen it! Frankly I find this film interesting. It intrigues and boggles my mind from start to finish. Does this film serve up any biblical significance? Does it have a connection to that Valley of Elah which was guarded by Azekah and where Joshua defeated the Amorite kings whose army was further destroyed by a hailstorm? And Azekah was supposed to be the last city that fell to the Babylonians  not forgetting that the city of Babylon was once located in the region known this day as Iraq. Or could this film have anything to do with the Valley of Elah in which David battled Goliath during the occupation of Sochoh and Azekah by the Philistines? Sure I was at oft times reminded of the very young Shepherd  very much the same age as Emily's son David  using a slingshot and five stones and credibly far from being a good match against the wellequipped Giant! Tommy Lee Jones fits his role to a tee. As Hank Deerfield a proud and meticulously organized retired army veteran and patriot his presence fills screen after screen with emotional persuasion to lead the audience through an astonishingly thoughtprovoking journey. Hank in his persistence to find his missing son commands the audience to look at the realities and repercussions of the contemporary war. As Hank salvages through his dead son's possessions and through his interviews with his son's peers the story gradually unfolds the situational consequences confronting young soldiers. A scene  with Zoe Karzan's Angie pleading for help from Charlize Theron's Emily while Hank awaits his turn to speak to Emily. is ever so heartwrenchingly memorable. The final plight of Angie is also worthy of remembering. War zones are populated by civilians who could be friends or foes making soldiers easy targets for the kill! Brave and good soldiers are perpetually faced with having to kill or be killed. And that's the reality each one of them has to live with. But what if fallen victims are simply innocent civilians at the wrong place at the wrong time? This film paints a very credible picture of good brave soldiers tortured by selfguilt and trauma. But do they ever find solace and comfort from their superiors for overcoming their traumatic experiences psychological problems and mental illness? It is not difficult to relate all courageous soldiers to the biblical David left on the battlefields to fight the enemies who seem to have greater advantages. But is their story like the biblical tale of David vs. Goliath in which victory is sung but failures are being perhaps swept under the rug. Doesn't this film make one wonder if there were other youths sent before David to face the Giant at the Valley of Elah and who did die or become maimed without their stories revealed? This film lists several 'David' characters. Are we supposed to think of the many Davids who fought wars but whose heroic deeds are never individually recorded in history? The awkward scene of Hank telling the bedtime story of David and Goliath tends to support several of my thoughts about this film. Hank's journey does draw my attention to the importance of recognizing every soldier's welfare over those who egoistically and selfishly honor victories without much ado about the human cost of war and over those who cover up failures. Oh I do love the character Emily. Theron presents her character beautifully surging up my hope and optimism of seeing those who do still abide by their moral conscience and make wise choices and decisions. Susan Sarandon's Joan comes across the screen well to remind the audience of the many unspoken and suffering mothers who have lost sons and daughters to the wars. All the supporting actors too have given terrific performances despite their brief yet very relevant appearances. They superbly fit into the scenes without overshadowing the performance of the film's antagonist but to allow him to drive home his messages to the audience. Yep it's impossible not to give full attention to Hank with every step he undertakes. It is not hard to capture Hank's disillusion with the War as he uncovers the facts revolving around the distressed or psychologically affected survivors. Has he the right to shove the blame of his son's murder on to others than those who actually commit the acts of murdering? This film succeeds in raising questions on the causes and effects of wars triggering implied caution and reminder to those harboring hasty wars in heavily populated nations where soldiers risk their lives only to become displaced persons. Will warmongers be willing to weigh morally and ethically the human costs of wars over the hope for glory and victory? Is victory only associated with those unscathed and unblemished by wars while the maimed the dead and the mentally displaced are being swept under the carpets? This powerful film serves up food for thought. Two thumbs up for WriterDirector Haggis. Once again he has cleverly created a film that tests the audience's thinking process!".

	schema:headline " Powerful Film Helmed by an Outstanding OscarWorthy Performance by Tommy Lee Jones";
	schema:reviewBody "In what is easily the best film of the year thus far multitalented upandcoming Oscarwinning writerdirector Paul Haggis Crash Flags of Our Fathers Million Dollar Baby brings us this intense intelligent and subtle drama wrapped around a murder mystery. In what may be his finest performance yet underrated actor Tommy Lee Jones plays an old grizzled and retired military police sergeant who receives word his youngest son Jonathon Tucker  Hostage The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is missing after being back in the states from fighting in Iraq just two days ago. Jones hightails it to the military base to get answers but what he ends up discovering is his son's dismembered body. With the help of a smarty young female police detective Charlize Theron Jones starts unraveling the truth behind his son's death. The film although written and directed by Paul Haggis doesn't feel like a Paul Haggis film. Million Dollar Baby which he wrote Crash and Flags of Our Fathers were all showy films but In the Valley of Elah is remarkably subtle. By downplaying the emotions of the actors Haggis achieves something far more powerful than if he had gone the easy melodramatic route most films centering around our current conflict in Iraq do. Haggis' directing skills have improved and his screenplay features exceptional dialogue. The acting is all topnotch. Charlize Theron is excellent in her role and Susan Sarandon does the most she can with a tiny role as Jones' wife. The rest of the cast is solid but it's Jones who steals the show with a complex brooding and brilliant performance that should absolutely earn him a Best Actor Academy Award Nomination come Oscar time. All in all 'In the Valley of Elah' was great minus a few flaws. Many people say the film is too heavyhanded and I have to agree. The ending was the worst part of the movie not because of the writingdirectingacting aspect. All three of those components were powerful and moving the only thing that stunk about the ending was the song choice. We get a heartwrenching and relevant message at the end to the tune of fcking whiny ProAmerica country music?! Ehh what's the use in complaining about these small details. For the most part 'In the Valley of Elah' is an outstanding motion picture that might be on a couple of top 10 lists come the end of the year. You don't want to miss it. Grade A".

ELAH is a powerful film from the brilliant Director Paul Haggis that drives home on the screen in a magnificent performance from Tommy Lee Jones the fear a father may have in the loss of his son and how this war is being played out in the small towns of America where a family wonders if a man or woman might return home safe or in a body bag. Charlize Theron and Susan Sarandon with a solid cast bring home the horror of Iraq in a film that is today's war in the Middle East. I can only hope that at Kudo time this well directed and written film will find itself on the list of nominated films. Bravo Paul Haggis for giving us another film to root for as we did with CRASH.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found this movie a letdown. The acting was pale at best. The plot was not sound. The overt political themes weighed the whole thing to a standstill. The last quarter of the movie was just agonizingly drawn out. After four different characters are fingered for the murder one begins to recall old whodunit films and wonder when Mrs. Marple will be announced.TLJ portrayal as a retired Army career man was sad. Jones attempts to walk the walk with the stiff behavior and several buzz phrases. Just doesn't pull it off. Active duty military personnel don't fix their beds compulsively! perhaps it is hard to believe but most are just every day folks. It was a bad prop used to attempt to craft a character. And it was a silly one to use. Sad I say because I honestly believe TLJ is a much better actor than that. Sometimes you can't put enough talent into a bad script I guess.Theron's role of the detective is noteworthy. I liked the stance she seemed to make not calling out her coworkers for obvious sexism but measuring her disdain for their behavior by the bucket load. But overboard in my opinion was the tension developed between the law enforcement officers and the military. There is always some degree of friction but to have some long standing resentment as seen in the movie would require a long established history of issues. We don't see that or even get hints at it here.Lastly disgusting is the portrayal of practically every soldier in the movie as some drugged out burned out stressed out product of the war. I've served in the military and been to the places mentioned in the movie. Less than one half of one half of a percent of the soldiers I've served and worked with would fit as characters in this movie. Could there not be a single redeeming figure among them? Why did every one of them have to be criminal in some way? Finally when the end did come like some tooth extraction visit to a low rate dentist we are inflicted with the image of TLJ raising a flag upside down and duct taping the lanyard to the staff. The line if I recall right was Oh that makes it easy. Flabbergasting....".

Are you crazy? Stereotypes Let's explore the stereotypes put forth in this movie. Army Soldiers are little kid killers Soldiers all do drugs Soldiers are dim wits Soldiers are so desensitized that they would kill their buddies then go out for a chicken dinner. Women can only advance by sexual favors local law enforcement are inept...on and on and on every scene has a bad stereotype in it not worth the money. Acting Tommy Lee was the only redeeming value in this movie his performance was excellent but was tainted by Sarandon's over acting and Theron's nonconvincing attempt at her role and the directors attempt to make the movie interesting on Lee's acting ability. Theron is much better but not sure what could be done with this material. Directing This guy has done some great work but this is not it. It was impossible to track the Theron's character one minute she is admiring the investigative abilities of Lee and in the next breath berating him the scene where Lee and Sarandon where hugging in the hall of the hospital was so long it invoked groans from the audience in the theaterwe got it! How about the Army investigative official I believe they were supposed to be an officer who never was in uniform. So the script never came to life and the dramatic components were completely over acteddirected. Visuals I guess the attempt at something interesting was editing in grainy cell phone movies supposedly from Iraq. This technique was overly used the attempt was good but the absolutely poorly executed and again the story pulled down every other aspect.This movie just shows the complete ignorance of Hollywood the writer producer and director of this film.So a poor story filled with stereotypes poorly executed with contradictions in virtually every scene spells F for me.".

If I were more of a word smith I would smith the equivalent of misogynistic as the word for the world view of people like Paul Haggis and Susan Sarandon...their palpable hatred of the United States and its institutions guides all of their art. The movie 'inspired by true events' allows a familiar Hollywood trope war is always evil and warriors always turned into monsters by their experiences fighting in a war. No more the heroism of Audie Murphy or the quiet duty of Jimmy Stewart no this is the first of the neoViet Nam veteran movies we are sure to be offered. Change the uniforms and equipment use a young Susan Sarandon toss in an early seventies male lead and I bet if you are of a certain age you have already seen this movie in a non multiplex without surround sound thirty years ago.Very loosely and very falsely based on a real murder victim whose murderers were caught tried and sentenced to long terms in prison Paul Haggis's labored screenplay of war crime torture and murder goes beyond the pale in wallowing in his sentiments about the Iraq war. And because he had to fill two hours he touches on the in crowd themes of 2007 America complete lose of faith in any institution single motherhood sexual harassment did I miss anything? Oh of course the always corrupt army...racism...military brutality...saintly immigrants...Haggis reaches out and touches them one and all. The beautiful police detective available only Hollywood movies teaming with the curmudgeonly old white guy against the system to find justice to discover as all of these movies do that there is no justice in America.Susan Sarandon useless as an actress after achieving sainthood as a political symbol in a role she must have lobbied for showing no emotional tie to movie husband granite faced Tommy Lee Jones. Screaming over the phone on behalf one guesses of hard cores in the audience that her husband has killed their sons by his devotion to duty and belief in country...that their deaths were his fault. Because in Paul Haggis's world boys never become men. They are never portrayed as being capable of their own decisions or commitments. Jones' sons in the movie may have been brave or patriotic independent spirits adventuresome affected by 911 or just guys who felt a sense of duty but we are never allowed to think that for a minute...they are victims. Victims of the beast called the USA. Victims of an overbearing father. They are not allowed to be men. Michael a volunteer soldier calls his father from Iraq and tearfully pleads with his father to get him out of there.Sons will always be children in Paul's view or more to the point plot devices to move his world view along.The director never lets up. He adds and adds to the 'based on true events' with sledge hammer blows to reassure his fellow travelers. A dog killer who drowns his wife a veteran of course we see his picture in uniform on the way to the murder scene. There are saved videos on the murdered son's cell phone. An aside who uses his cell phone for videos in combat? Well in the interests of this screen play he does. Oh the suspense in the theater was palpable...what sort of videos? Ah the mystery as the 'fried' videos get unfried...what sort of videos would he take and carry all the way home? Zut alors don't tell me...an atrocity? Torture of helpless prisoners? Are we covering something up here? Are these videos the casus belli I beg pardon of the pun of the plot? No the plot is IRAQ NO writ large as screen sized bumper sticker.All soldiers are equally guilty...all are perpetrators of war crimes...laughers at cruelty...the crazed demented child soldiers of Haggis's imagination. Because...get this in case you didn't know war is hell and this war is more hell than previous ones and these soldiers victims to a man are more screwed up than their Viet Nam dads...and by god I Paul Haggis am going to prove it if I have to drive the point home in scene after scene of soldiers confessing how bad grotesque indescribable you other than Paul Haggis can't imagine what we did there I don't want to talk about it...things are 'over there.' An 'over there' pasted in a detective procedural invented in the inventive mind of PH who knows his core audience can't get enough of this sort of world view.Oh by the way Paul in your quest for absolute truth and justice...a woman with a broken nose does not scrunch it up with her thumb as she thinks Army soldiers are quartered on posts not bases and flying an American flag upside down at the end of your movie is a much overkill as turning a solved murder into a Hollywood polemic.".

Her cries as a mother facing the death of her last son are heart wrenching.The movie's political message comes at you like a ton of bricks in the last few minutes of the movie. It is a movie that says this war ... and they mean Iraq ... turns men into monsters.I have to give the movie a 5 but it is totally out of respect to the actors and the direction. The writers and producers deserve to be whacked for turning the movie into a cheap and absurd sermon at the end.Our boys and soldiers are way better than this and I was angry and insulted at the end of the movie because someone had a story about something here and the Hollywood writers decided to make it all about them. All about how bad this war is and with snippets of some of George Bush's rambling comments sprinkled through the background noise.Tommy Lee Jones will just hold up forever and Charlise Theron is the quintessential American woman with brains heart and beauty  even with a broken nose.

	schema:headline " What war can do to young men";
	schema:reviewBody "Released in 2007 and directed  written by Paul Haggis In the Valley of Elah is a crime dramamystery inspired by the reallife case of Richard T. Davis. The story revolves around an elderly Tennessee couple Tommy Lee Jones  Susan Sarandon who get word that their son has gone missing from his base in New Mexico shortly after his return from Iraq. A retired military investigator Hank Deerfield Jones goes to the base to find out the awful truth. Charlize Theron plays the civilian detective near the base who tries to help Hank while Jason Patric plays the Army counterpart. Josh Brolin is on hand as the town police chief. This is a slowburn mystery highlighted by great acting by the principles especially Jones and a thoroughly realistic story which isn't surprising seeing as how it's based on true events. Speaking of which I was surprised to find out that the basic details of the story are all accurate. The actual events took place in the Fort Benning area of Georgia rather than the fictitious Fort Rudd NM.The movie's not antiIraq War but rather antiPTSD it merely reveals the awful truth about war in general When we send our young men off to faroff lands where brutal warfare is normal they can bring that desensitized mentality back with them where the barbaric behavior that might be acceptable in war is anything but normal or conducive to a successful life to say the least. Add the idiocy of alcohol abuse to the mix of PTSD and the results almost certainly WON'T be good. The title refers to the valley where David as a teen fought and defeated the utterly intimidating Goliath from 1 Samuel 17. ADDITIONAL ACTORS James Franco Wes Chatham Jake McLaughlin Mehcad Brooks and Roman Arabia play soldiers who knew Deerfield's son while Frances Fisher has a curious cameo you'll know what I mean.The film runs 121 minutes and was shot in Whiteville Tennessee and Albuquerque New Mexico with Morocco substituting for Iraq.GRADE B".

Every man vanishes without a trace leaving behind only a log book and a deadly warning of the legend of the bloodthursty Talos. Fifty years later the log book ends up in the hands of the granddaughter of the head archaeologist and she defiantly sets out to retrace his steps. Discovering the forbidden treasure she recovers a sacred amulet and once again unleashes the savage power of the tomb. Racing through the streets of London and against the force of a rare interplanetary lineup she along with the help of her original dig team and an American detective desperately try to turn back the inhuman curse and to keep Talos from destroying all in his path in an attempt to gain immortal power.";

That is the biggest problem of the film. The rest of the cast isn't bad at all Jack Davenport does a great job. Talos is not your usual mummy but he's quiet original. The film has a great plot with some surprising moments.

Putting it on display a strange series of deaths around London being in Detective Riley Jason Scott Lee from the US Embassy to help solve the case as each victim was found to have a specific organ removed after death. Discovering that it is the work of Prince Talos Enzo claimed to be one of the most ravenous men in Egyptian history trying to collect the body parts required to resurrect himself they race to stop him and put an end to his plans.The Good News this wasn't all that bad and had some good moments to it. One of the good things here is that the mummy is pretty interesting. Rather than being the slowly lumbering type as this one can move about fairly quickly it has two additional powers that are fun and really sets him apart. This one can fly about which is a clever concept and visually impressive since it's something new. The other new factor is the ability to use it's bandages as tentacles using them to ensnare it's victims and trap them like a cocoon. Even more impressive is the ability to unravel itself and reform using the tentacles to do that. It's a fun trick that looks impressive and is a real treat to watch. Another big plus is that there's a couple of rather welldone attacks in here as the sequence at the police station is really nice a pretty decent chase comes out of an encounter in the motel as the mummy really shows off some nice powers and there's a couple kills as well. Even the encounters in the subway and parking garage are really good and much better than expected. The best though is the film's opening with there being a couple great things about it. The atmosphere is great the setting is perfect and creepy with the usual business about a curse and the decorations used around the chamber. Once the curse is mentioned it's all pretty fun watching the brutality emerge. Then segueing into the recovery scenes of the later expedition being just as creepy is a big plus. The last positive here is the rather sizable body count. While there's only a few that are worthwhile there's a lot that actually do get knocked off and it does deliver the gore nicely on some of them. These here are what make the film somewhat entertaining and enjoyable.The Bad News This one didn't have a whole lot of problems going for it. The main one here is that there's a decided lack of gore to many of the kills. Despite the big body count not a whole lot of the kills are all that graphic mainly by design since it oddly uses the offscreen method for a lot of the kills or just dragged the victim away and leaving the sounds as the only clue that something is happening. There's a few of them which are done onscreen which is enough to get them over but it really could've had much more in here by simply using it's kills a little better. The other area that this doesn't work is the rather odd and confusing ending. There's hardly anything about it that makes any sense between the twist that doesn't seem logical or even makes sense to the actions of the ceremony and the specific guidelines which are required the whole thing is just confusing and doesn't really have anything all that logical about it. These here are what lower the film and keep it down.The Final Verdict Some good stuff in here and a couple of somewhat troubling flaws lower this one somewhat but not all that much. Give it a shot if you're into the genre or have an interest in the film while those who aren't that big on the genre will probably find this one to be more problematic.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language and Brief Nudity".

	schema:reviewBody "I took a chance on this based on the cast Christopher Lee Honor Blackman Sean Pertwee Lysette Anthony etc. and because I liked some of the director's previous films HIGHLANDER THE SHADOW.  But this was definitely a film where the parts were greater than the whole.  It had some good moments and like many mummy movies the early scenes in Egypt were among the highlights but overall the film's plot unraveled faster than the mummy's wrappings.  I would recommend one of Hammer's classics be it the 1959 MUMMY or 1971's BLOOD FROM THE MUMMY'S TOMB over this.  I have to admit I have only seen the version released here in the U.S. which is 88 minutes compared to other running times of 115 and even 122 minutes so maybe the longer cut would help.  Would like to point out something however  Throughout many of the reviewer comments made about the film on IMDB it is repeatedly stated that writerdirector Russell Mulcahy must be an American because of all the mistakes the movie made when it comes to London lifestyles...sorry folks but Mulcahy is from Melbourne Australia.".

But this was definitely a film where the parts were greater than the whole.  It had some good moments and like many mummy movies the early scenes in Egypt were among the highlights but overall the film's plot unraveled faster than the mummy's wrappings.  I would recommend one of Hammer's classics be it the 1959 MUMMY or 1971's BLOOD FROM THE MUMMY'S TOMB over this.

	schema:reviewBody "About a week ago I said that I didn't believe that a movie could be so bad it's good. Then I saw Russell Mulcahy's Tale of the Mummy. The special effects are terrible the lead actor is more wooden than a fencepost and the movie is edited down so much that the storyline struggles to remain coherent. Yet I still enjoyed it like I enjoy many movies not because of it's badness although that helped but because it's still entertaining.Admittedly the storyline is not original at all then again this is a monster movie and movies of this ilk generally have to follow a relatively rigid formula. An archaeologist Sir Richard Turkel Christopher Lee has just discovered a mummy's tomb. Not heeding an ominous warning he and his crew perish. Fifty years later his grand daughter Sam Louise Lombard follows in his footsteps determined to find out what happened. Unwittingly she and her associates unleash the spirit of an evil prince seeking to return to human form.Like I said the storyline isn't going to be associated with the word original. But the details are different which makes it less boring. In fact it's actually moderately engaging.When I put the DVD in the player I was expecting a movie that I would regret watching filled with bad acting and no plot coherency and so on I love Ancient Egypt so I sort of had to see it. Actually though the acting is pretty good. Louise Lombard may have been a last minute casting replacement but she's good in the role of Sam. She's comfortable in the role of the heroine and makes a Sam in to a surprisingly believable character. Her costar Jason Scott Lee isn't as successful. In fact he's pretty bad. Riley is supposed to be the hardboiled detective but Lee is about as malleable as concrete. Fortunately the actors with the smaller parts are better. Sean Pertwee is good as Sam's coworker on the expedition who after seeing visions when entering the tomb is now on the edge of a nervous breakdown you'll understand if you see the movie. Better known actors Michael Lerner Shelly Duvall are solid as the modern day archaeologist and the fortune teller respectively. Jack Davenport and Gerard Butler who sorry to his fans is only on screen for about 5 minutes are good as well. And Christopher Lee is good in the film's topbilled cameo.However the special effects are hideously bad. They are so bad that they make the graphics on my N64 look good. I realize that this was made eleven years ago and I'm sure no one will disagree that special effects have improved by lightyears but The Matrix was made only a year later. Still the effects are so bad that they become unintentionally funny and they turn the movie into a cheesily enjoyable experience. That being said I have to admit that there are a few mildly chilling moments in the film.The only real problem that actually hurts the movie is that it's been edited down to its bare bones. The foreign versions have an additional 30 minutes and that's obvious here. Many characters are undeveloped one of the main characters had none at all and some important plot points are missing making the storyline which as I said is somewhat interesting borderline incoherent. And I never thought I'd say this but for a movie that's rated R for violence and gore there's really no blood to speak of. A little more blood and nudity which was once a staple of these kinds of movies could have given the movie a little more edge.Tale of the Mummy surprised me. It's both entertaining because of its badness and also because it's reasonably entertaining regardless. Do I recommend it? I liked it although having a few beers in you before you start wouldn't hurt. It could be fun watch and laugh at the bad special effects this could make a great drinking game but it's also a decently made movie. It could be hard to find I got it on Netflix and although it's not for everyone certainly if you're expecting something that's actually scary it's worth a shot.".

The opening is awesome and if you expect the film to get worse  it actually just stays the same throughout  until the unexpected yet disappointing ending with a last frame that will scare even the strongest of wills like me!

	schema:reviewBody "I don't understand why this movie has such a low rating on IMDb. It has a stellar cast with a bit of an annoying bait and switch it has an interesting story characters that are actually developed and it is a UK coproduction so you know it is better than a normal US movie from the start.The film starts with an Egyptian dig how else where the likes of Christopher Lee are excavating the mysterious burial place of Talos the cursed Greek who came to Egypt and learned forbidden magic. Then Lee dies. Several years later his niece comes to check the dig out accompanied by the likes of Gerard Butler and Sean Pertwee. Butler dies immediately and Pertwee continues to appear randomly as a slightly insane person. This is annoying if you started to watch the movie because of the cast but I didn't so it didn't bother me.Present time stuff happens and two detectives played by none others than Jason Scott Lee and Jack Davenport need to investigate. Add to this the two British hotties Louise Lombard and Lysette Anthony and the movie is interesting on that alone.The film lasts for almost two hours which is a bit too long for the level of tension that the movie manages to maintain but in no way is it a bad story. While the reasoning of the Talos mummy are not revealed until the end and seem stupid they become believable at the end with the extra information.Bottom line a TV movie that appeared a year before The Mummy. If you take the special effects which were not bad but certainly were cheap in Talos out of the equation the only possible reason why The Mummy would be better is Arnold Vosloo and a slightly more fleshed out pardon the pun character for the mummy. While not really a horror film it is a good paranormal thriller even with the silly twist at the end.".

It has a stellar cast with a bit of an annoying bait and switch it has an interesting story characters that are actually developed and it is a UK coproduction so you know it is better than a normal US movie from the start.The film starts with an Egyptian dig how else where the likes of Christopher Lee are excavating the mysterious burial place of Talos the cursed Greek who came to Egypt and learned forbidden magic. Then Lee dies. Several years later his niece comes to check the dig out accompanied by the likes of Gerard Butler and Sean Pertwee. Butler dies immediately and Pertwee continues to appear randomly as a slightly insane person. This is annoying if you started to watch the movie because of the cast but I didn't so it didn't bother me.Present time stuff happens and two detectives played by none others than Jason Scott Lee and Jack Davenport need to investigate. Add to this the two British hotties Louise Lombard and Lysette Anthony and the movie is interesting on that alone.The film lasts for almost two hours which is a bit too long for the level of tension that the movie manages to maintain but in no way is it a bad story. While the reasoning of the Talos mummy are not revealed until the end and seem stupid they become believable at the end with the extra information.Bottom line a TV movie that appeared a year before The Mummy. If you take the special effects which were not bad but certainly were cheap in Talos out of the equation the only possible reason why The Mummy would be better is Arnold Vosloo and a slightly more fleshed out pardon the pun character for the mummy. While not really a horror film it is a good paranormal thriller even with the silly twist at the end.";

I've rarely seen such poor incoherent embarrassing lines of dialogue it's like it takes some of the worst american adventurehorror movie clichs and makes them even more laughable. It is full of plot holes and almost every scene contains quite irritating continuity errors. The visual effects were not good at all awful CGI in too many scenes but that's really a minor issue within the movie. And it's not like I don't like trash movies for example I really enjoyed Sam Raimi's Evil Dead II because he managed to achieve a visually interesting and humorous film even with a trivial and meager plot as a basis. This movie however even if it is unintentionally funny during the dialogues and killing sequences that's why I gave the three stars rating it's not as entertaing as many other BMoviesTrash movies out there. Also the allstar cast didn't change my opinion on this movie at all for obvious reasons. An 8 million dollars budget is useless without other elements.I suggest watching this movie for a laugh it has two or three almost funny moments that you may enjoy and that's it.".

	schema:headline " A confusing mess of a mummy film with an allstar cast";
	schema:reviewBody "A US production filmed in the UK for a change and with a UK cast this still isn't very good. Basically it's a variation on the old mummy story with the idea now that the killer mummy isn't actually humanshaped  instead it's a pile of old bandages which can animated itself and strangle or crush people to death. The CGI effects used for the bandages aren't bad but in the end it all seems a bit pointless anyway as the bandages take the form of a proper mummy after all.Things look cheesily promising in the opening scenes of a tomb excavation in Egypt. This time around Christopher Lee is one of the archaeologists back in '59 he starred in the title role in THE MUMMY. After a gust of wind comes out of the tomb the three men are turned into clay I don't know why either and die with Lee managing to blow up the cave as he does so. The sight of Lee disintegrating on the ground brings back pleasant memories of Dracula but sadly this is to be the film's finest moment. It all goes downhill from there.Things return to London where the bandages escape and begin to kill people extracting various organs liver heart eyes from each of the victims  like we haven't seen that one before. So what we have as the main plot structure is a series of gruesome deaths and a look at the police investigation into them. A typical kind of plot but it's kept alive through the interesting supporting cast and the brave  yet not exactly realistic  special effects work. However things fall totally apart at the end of the movie when Talos is reincarnated as a being that looks like an alien but which is still pretty cool I have to say and people run around a dark and gloomy factory dj vu perhaps?. Sadly by this time I didn't have a clue as to what was going on making this one of the most disjointed confusing endings ever.Imported American lead Jason Scott Lee more at home as a bad guy in SOLDIER I feel seems stiff and unsuited to this type of film especially in his growing romance with Louise Lombard. Lombard herself is fine as the gorgeous archaeologist but you get the feeling that somehow she's better than all this and doesn't deserve to be in it. Sean Pertwee plays a skinhead psychopath who's into astrology and his overthetop performance would no doubt make his dad spin in the grave. Frankly it's pretty embarrassing especially when Pertwee tries to act scary.Lysette Anthony has a nothing role as a doctor who ends up getting possessed by the spirit at the end of the film  like we could care. Jack Davenport  a familiar face to British television fans  is an investigating copper and his death comes as one of the film's few real surprises. Honor Blackman has a bit part as Lee's superior while a surprisingly ageless Shelley Duvall is a mystic who helps the cops out. One more item of note to British readers  watch carefully and you'll be rewarded by the sight of Bill Treacher  Arthur from EASTENDERS  getting his neck snapped by the mummy.At the end of this film you can sort of see what they were aiming for with the plot but all that is spoiled by dodgy editing and confusing narrative. It's like a good idea is hiding inside the film and struggling to get out. It's a shame that this movie is a failure because there aren't a lot of UKbased movies around these days. Russell Mulcahy proves again that HIGHLANDER was a fluke. Still even after all this it would appear that we lucky Europeans are better off than the Americans who had half an hour chopped out of this before the film was released over there! I hate to think what the finished movie looked like especially when this full version is pretty confusing as it is.".

	schema:headline " Poor Version of a Classic Horror Tale";
	schema:reviewBody "This review definitely contains spoilers. I had high hopes for Tale of the Mummy and for awhile it looked like those hopes might be fulfilled. The movie gets off to a good start with a strong prologue featuring the great Christopher Lee who of course once played one of the most impressive mummies in movie history during the heyday of Hammer Films. From there the movie goes on to establish an interesting variation on the basic idea of the usual mummy's curse. The eponymous Mummy itself doesn't merely shamble about strangling unwary victims but is a minimaelstrom of bandages and wrappings which only assumes a more tangible form at the right moment.The cast is impressive as well. Not only do we have a brief but important turn by Christopher Lee but there's also Lysette Anthony Shelly Duvall Sean Pertwee Jason Scott Lee and even Gerard Butler though Mr. Butler's character meets his demise just a few minutes into the proceedings.Though nothing really breaks with established mummymovie formula at first at least the first act of the film lays what appears to be a solid foundation for things to come. Sadly in the second and third acts the film gets progressively worse and worse. The filmmakers try to play around with viewer expectations and then try to subvert the same with a number of unforeseen twists but those twists are so far out of left field that they all fail without exception. One of the problems is that for things to work out the way they do certain characters simply cannot do and say some of the things that occur as the movie progresses. The big reveals that happenand there are a lot of themblatantly contradict plot points that have already been established within the dramatic progression. The ultimate revelations regarding the identify of the Mummy his Princess and his followers aren't merely unexpected but thematically impossible given what has already happened. In short the script is a cheat and in the end everything unravels like a badly embalmed corpse. Which I suppose is appropriate.In other respects the production is generally hit or miss. A few of the on screen murders are creatively handled but others are painfully ridiculous. An example of the latter occurs in a men's bathroom stall where the Mummy wraps its prey up in its fluttering folds and...jumps into the toilet with him resulting in a fountain of blood as the victim is pulled bodily through the works. I don't remember if the poor guy screamed in his death throes or not as it would have been drowned out by my own laughter anyway. I mean death by toilet? That's sure not how Christopher Lee did it back in the day. Thankfully.Special effects don't always work out either. The Mummy eventually emerges as a rather pitiful unfinished humanoid which for some reason the other characters find so impressive they want to fall down on their knees and worship. The climactic action scenes are weak and unconvincing in the extreme and the movie's only real strong pointinteresting characters played by wellknown performersfails in the end because so many of the characters inexplicably become entirely different people and also because one of them happens to be an extremely annoying psychic who I dearly wish had gotten killed much earlier.Ultimately Tale of the Mummy is a tale of futility. The story falls apart the closer it gets to the finale and in the end nothing of value is left. Even worse Evil triumphs...the heroine sacrifices herself for nothing and the hero turns out to be an avatar for the Mummy who attains immortality and walks out into the world to do as he will with his rejuvenated powers. Perhaps there was supposed to be a sequel. If so somebody must have severely overestimated this particular Mummy's powers of telepathic influence because to my knowledge no such followup ever appeared. Either way it's a poor finish that is totally unsatisfying on any level whatsoever.There have been a number of good films in the Mummy subgenre but this isn't even close to being one of them. Tale of the Mummy starts off well enough and has a good cast but one poor storytelling decision after another coupled with a poor FX budget means the overall production is doomed to failure.".

Dimension Films you made a big big mistake not releasing this to theaters. You guys probably thought that you could use this to cash in on the success of The Mummy with Brandon Fraser. Well it would have been a good idea if this had ANYTHING whatsoever to do with that movie but it's completely different and stands alone. You guys were acting foolishly.I actually found this film to be much better than The Mummy. While I immensely enjoyed the summer movie I feel that it was more of an actionadventure than horror. This movie goes back to its roots pure horror and that's what really makes it work.Set in London the film follows an American detective and an assortment of other characters as they battle Talos a banished Egyptian sorcerer who whose body was never found in the days of Pharaohs. His wrappings must collect body parts and the heart of his reincarnated love in order to create it's body and begin the Armageddon. He has to do it before the first five planets all align and it's a desperate race to stop him before he can.First of all how can anyone say the special effects in this film is disappointing? They are absolutely incredible.... The wrappings come to life and attack people shaping into humam form sometimes and other times crawling on the ceiling like an overgrown spider. They are some of the finest special effects I think I've ever seen in a horror thriller. How in the world can someone say that these fx are bad? They are absolutely real and astounding....much more real than in the Brandon Fraser flick. And unlike the former film this one doesn't use them to show them off but they actually fit into the story and are not overused.The storyline is great too.... It manages to keep it down packed so it is easy to understand and at the same time it is very complex and it has many different angles to it. The ending is also a fine twist that nicely wraps the film up no pun intended. Well anyway I shuddered and that doesn't happen much.The cast and direction are also highgrade. Jason Scott Lee is good as the detective Riley who's not sure whether or not to believe in Talos. Sean Pertwee is also fantastic as the odd cultmember who walks the thin line between paranoid and psychotic. I'm thinking Best Supporting Actor nomination for him. For the direction while Fraser's The Mummy relied on heavy stunts and overthetop action stunts Russell Mulcahy focuses more on the dark style so it is a slowmoving moody thriller with slick timing. He winged this one much like he did The Shadow another greatly underrated film. Someone better keep their eyes on this guy....he's likely to hit something big one day and get a lot of recognition. But anyway that's my prediction.All in all see Tale of the Mummy. It is superb and much better then the Brandon Fraser film. And even if you might disagree....it's certainly worth spending 88 minutes of your life watching it.12 out of ".

There is some fine acting and adept direction on display here in a heady combination with all the apocalyptic terror that can be generated by a pile of bandages. The scene in which the pile of bandages hitchhikes a ride on a maid's cart and sneaks off an elevator is in particular an imaginative tour de force.The most remarkable thing to me is that this film is called Talos the Mummy yet both IMDb and Wikipedia use a different title.

Being a movie that includes a mummy and being a horror movie I naturally found it interesting and immediately decided to give it a chance without reading the synopsis or taking notice of who starred in it.The movie does start out in an adequate pace and does establish some characters pretty early on which was good for the movie.Tale of the Mummy has an adequate storyline although parts of it seemed a bit forced. The storyline is simplistic and very easy to follow making it feel like writers Keith Williams John Esposito Russell Mulcahy and writerdirector Russell Mulcahy were followed a generic blueprint of 'howtomakeamummymovie'.I must admit that I was more than genuinely impressed with the ensemble of cast that had been hired for this movie because there are some rather good names on the cast list here. It was a nice surprise to see the likes of Christopher Lee Gerard Butler Lysette Anthony Sean Pertwee Shelley Duvall Jon Polito Jason Scott Lee and Michael Lerner in a movie such as this.The effects in Tale of the Mummy were quite good and actually do to some extend still hold their ground even today. So thumbs up for the special effects team that worked on the movie.It was kind of funny how adept the awakened mummy was at speaking English and speaking it flawlessly.The movie does let off some of its momentum once it makes it past the halfway marker. Which is a bit of a shame. The movie in whole doesn't really stand out and is not a particularly memorable addition to the mummy movie genre.And the ending of the movie? Wow seriously? That had to be one of the most ridiculous endings in the history of mummy movies. It was so phenomenally bad that it has to be seen to believe.".

The Mummy morphs from one form to another a number of times and it mostly worked. Lysette Anthony looked so darn cute that little vixen. Christopher Lee was great as always it would have been nice if he had gotten a few more scenes though. He looked cool too. The guy with the shaved head and tattoos stole a lot of the scenes. He was very good as a possessed maniac. The scene where they brought him back from the dead was pretty creepy there are so scary moments in this flick unlike the Brendan Fraser Mummy movies tho I generally liked them too. This movie is sort of a different take an update on the more traditional Mummy films. I thought it was very unique and it kept me going despite the fact I thought it would probably be crappo based on how its rated here. It is very much better than its rating overall the film has a lot of good ideas and it moves along well. I think most horror fans would get a couple of thrills from this epic. give it a try.".

	schema:reviewBody "About ten years ago a group of Danish filmmakers started the Dogme school of filmmaking that inflicted a selfimposed discipline on its adherents including no artificial leaps of time and space no special effects or soundtracks that weren't actually created on set handheld cameras only no superficial plot enhancements like murders and so on. It was a reaction partly against the 'auteur' school where a director stamped his personality on a film but mostly against the excesses and decadence of Hollywood as the founders felt that filmmakers were in danger of losing sight of the craft of filmmaking in a world where a film's value was dictated by accountants marketing people big names and people and technology that was external to the process itself. The creators of Dogme never intended it as a philosophy to be put on a pedestal but simply as an experiment one of any number that could create better filmmaking. In Your Hands is reportedly the last film to be made under the strict auspices of Dogme.Our main protagonist is Anna played by Ann Eleonora Jorgenson a newly qualified pastor who takes up her first appointment in a women's prison. One of the inmates is reputed to have 'healing hands' or is maybe psychic. The emotional crises that develop are ones between faith and spirituality as well as attitudes to abortion and love versus duty.Dogme's great strength has been the way it lends itself to naturalistic almost documentarylike acting and then once the audience has completely bought in and sees the characters as totally lifelike being able to shock us with revelations that could be frivolous in any others hands  but become cause for soul searching when we are confronted with them as part of 'normal' life. There have been many failures  often due to poor acting and poor script Dogme is a discipline to avoid the excesses pitfalls of marketdriven cinema not a ready built recipe for success. But its best examples have always shocked us by making us ask how on earth a 'real' person copes. In Festen The Celebration we get to know and like a normal family that have a big reunion grand dinner . . . at the height of the joie de vivre when suddenly one of the family is accused of abusing one of the others present now an adult as a child it is difficult for the audience to cope with wondering how exactly the rest of the family should act. In Idioterne The Idiots a group of dropouts have fun or 'celebrate their inner idiot' by acting like mentally ill people. The problem the serious audience has is not whether such material is a suitable subject for a movie but whether they are able to come to terms with their own feelings about it when it is portrayed so realistically.A question posed by these films that is also posed by In Your Hands is what do we do when someone we like or respect is also a source of wrongdoing? And what of our judgement? Are we free to judge as if we were perfect  can we forgive ourselves for being only human and if so where do we draw the line on what is acceptable in our own judgements  and our own aspiration to become better? The process of 'becoming who we are' individually also draws a nice parallel to the process of filmmaking which at the level of Dogme is reduced to itself for better or worse.One of the great strengths of In Your Hands is the acting particularly Jorgenson. She just wants to be a pastor be a reasonably nice person do her job get on with her relationship etc. She is not prepared for the difficult tests of faith that come her way and neither are we. When she cries we want to as well because we feel as trapped as she is by our difficulty in finding a suitable answer to her perfectly reasonable dilemma. But it is her struggle with her problem her determination to find a decent solution even if she fails abysmally at times that make us buy into her character emotionally in the hope that she will find the right course even where we fail. The gut wrenching performances serve a purpose that goes beyond entertainment  they make us ask hypothetically how each of us as a normal human  as is the character would struggle to answer such difficult problems if they arose and it is this contribution to situational ethics by means of fictionalised analogy whether in theatre literature poetry opera or soap opera that is also one of the defining characteristics one of many by which we can identify certain types of art as art and one of many reasons that art contributes to a better society. Dogme may have served its purpose but it has served it well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fritz Lang's highly influential career as a film director began in post World War I Germany where he was a leading figure in the German Expressionist film movement and ended in the United States in 1953 with the production of The Big Heat a film noir classic. Perhaps his greatest film M Germany 1931 forms an historical bridge between expressionism and film noir. Like the former it uses strange and disturbing compositions of light and dark in order to symbolize the inner workings of the human mind like the latter it more realistically sets its story in a modern urban setting and blends in sociological issues along with the psychological and moral ones. Even though M was Lang's and Germany's first sound film many historians cite it as the initial masterpiece of cinema to appear following the introduction of sound into films in the late 1920's. While most early talkies return films to their static visually monotonous stage imitative beginnings and thus limit rather than expand the artistic possibilities of the medium M avoids the failing by skillfully balancing asynchronous offscreen sounds with the more limiting use of synchronous dialogue. The film's editing particularly its elaborate use of parallel cutting also contributes kinetic energy and fluidity to the storytelling. Of course many of the film's sound effects are also imaginative and memorable none more so than the compulsive whistling of the film's central character the stalker and serial killer of little girls Hans Beckert magnificently played by Peter Lorre. Sound is also an important contributor to M's rich and influential use of off screen space. One famous example is the scene that introduces Beckert as a shadow against his own Wanted poster creepily intoning to his next victim Elsie Beckmann You have a very pretty ball. Not only is Beckert's shadow a bow toward Lang's expressionist artistic roots but it ironically places the murderer in the implied space in front of the image  that is among us the human community of viewers of which he is an innocuousappearing albeit monstrous member. Another example of Lang's use of offscreen space is the montage of shots whose common denominator is Elsie's absence from them an empty chair at the Beckmann dinner table the vertiginous stairwell down which Elsie's mother searches compulsively and futilely for signs of her daughter's arrival the attic play area that awaits Elsie's return from school. Most memorable of all  and most often alluded to visually in other films  is the series of shots that indirectly record Beckert's assault and murder of the innocent child representing these off screen events metonymically via the entry of Elsie's ball from bushes along on the right edge of the frame and the release of her balloon from telephone wires and off the left edge of the frame. Never in the history of cinema has something so terrible been communicated through such powerfully understated images.Beyond its technical brilliance the keys to M's lasting impact are its psychologically convincing portrait of Hans Beckert's twisted compulsion and the still relevant ambivalence of his capture and trial. Unlike contemporary cinematic examples of the serial killer Beckert is not presented simply as a grotesque psychopath. Nor is the issue of how society should deal with him at all clearcut. To be sure the gutreaction of most film audiences is to root on the underworld mobsters and petty thieves who beating the established authorities to their mutual quarry capture Beckert and bring him to a mock formal trial whose conclusion is foregone. Like many in America today Beckert's accusers are disinclined to listen to insanity pleas and would just as soon be rid of the monster in the surest way possible a summary death penalty with as little fretting about legal rights as possible. Considering the heinousness of Beckert's crimes and the imperfections of a legalmedical system that could well turn him loose to kill again this emotional response is hard to resist. Yet M is by no means an endorsement of vigilantism  quite the contrary. Through the unlikely rhetorical persuasions of Beckert's unkempt court appointed defense attorney and Beckert's own impassioned monologue Lang strongly implies that impatience with democratic judicial procedure and a paranoid eagerness to scapegoat others guilty or not in the name of order are symptomatic of the social hysteria breeding Nazism in 1930s Germany. That the ruthless killer who heads the underworld looks dresses and gestures like a Gestapo officer is no accident. Moreover the letter M chalked on Beckert's back by one of his pursuers not only stands for murderer but also alludes to God's marking of Cain. While the popular misconception holds that the mark of Cain symbolizes his evil it in fact represents God's warning to Cain's flawed fellow creatures not to mete out wrathful vengeance but to leave justice in God's hands. Translated into secular terms and literally entering the shot from the top of the frame God's hands in M belong to the legitimate authorities that intervene at the last moment to arrest and try Hans Beckert in the name of the Law.".

	schema:reviewBody "M  1931  M is a cinematic masterpiece of visual drama. The stunning performances define the careers of exceptional actors such as Peter Lorre and Gustaf Grundgens. Director Fritz Lang gives depth and dimension to his production by distinctly capturing the ecstasy of the film's many characters and focusing accurately on individual situations. This is an intriguing journey into the mind of a psychotic child murderer blending terror complexity and malignity in one amazing motion picture.Screenwriters Paul Falkenburg and Adlof Jansen construct the characters of M with distinctive personalities and three dimensional emotions. Many lesser filmmakers give their characters no creativity outside the confines of the script. In this movie each individual character has a mind of their own they are free to roam the landscape of a inviting atmosphere.Fabricating such an impressive atmosphere is some of the best cinematography and lighting effects that I can remember watching. This resplendent component creates the film's terrific moody ambiance. Suspense is one thing M contains in full context. The movie's third act is sheer peakhigh tension.Shot in black and white M stars Peter Lorre as PeterHans Beckert an extremely disturbed child murderer in the process of wreaking havoc on a neighborhood. Parents everywhere are living in fear of their children being kidnapped and abruptly annihilated. This picture contains a brilliantly crafted setup. The visual setting creates a strongly developed opening. Every scene works to either complicate the initial problem or propels the story through a firm narrative through line.The film captures the chaos of the town in terror perfectly. M is more about the results of a serial killer than an actual serial killer. Never do we directly witness a murder the violent encounters are implied. This method of film making perhaps makes the movie's impact even greater. With an creative perspective through a third person point of view the filmmakers repeatedly give us examples of a solid structure through characters and occurrences. M offers a unforgettable challenging performance by Peter Lorre. This extraordinary actor is tormenting and disturbing without embracing in extreme violent conduct. He perspires with momentum and rapture. This productions closing scenes are so deeply penetrating they entirely captivate the viewer. Isn't this what movies are supposed to do?".

	schema:reviewBody "M is a monumental film and seriously should be watched by all. For a film like this to be made in 1931 is just shocking. Even if the film was released today it would still be nothing like we have seen before. In our modern age of film making there has been a considerable rise in the production of films about serial killers their complexities and particularly about pathological ones. Yet M is the first movie that comes to my mind when I think of the themes that have been in Psycho Silence of the Lambs Seven and not to mention countless more.The film is lead by Peter Lorre in a transcending performance who plays the serial killer and rapist in which the film is centered around. In this performance Lorre is successful in something that at the very least is rare to see in any kind of film compassion for a child killer and rapist. Lorre makes the viewer see that he is not a criminal by choice but by a sickness of compulsion. Too often then not is our perception of a psychotic killer having that look that puts fear into his or hers victims' eyes. Lorre doesn't do that but rather displays a frightened man a scared man. One in which his desperation leads to his hazardous behavior. His portrayal of a killer is not of a fearless one but of one consumed by fear. Something that even today we as a people cannot understand let alone in 1931.The direction and writing of Fritz Lang is beyond comprehensible as he taps into the mind of a serial killer and his complexities. He does so in such that we get an empathetic and compassionate illustration of all sides of the story. This in which by then end of the film all points of view are more then well delivered to the audience. Fritz Lang here has simply created here a timeless masterpiece. One that excels in its technical aspects and enlightens the audience on a topic that other films still have not yet to match M in.I highly recommend this film for many obvious reasons and conclusions. This film was created by one of the all time great directors in Fritz Lang Lang's command for the screen is mesmerizing and a joy to witness and so on and so forth. Yet much of this is mostly superficial and a waste of time to continuously state. M as I mentioned before takes a strong and original stance on an issue that we as a society yet have not fully resolved. This film may not give you THE answer on this issue but it may sway that moral compass of yours that lies inside of all of us.".

	schema:headline " Fritz Lang's sound masterpiece a taut and quintessentially suspenseful story and Lorre";
	schema:reviewBody "The first time I saw M by Fritz Lang I almost didn't know what to make of it. I was overwhelmed by the power of the performances the staging of the scenes the locations and the power that the simple story had with such complex circumstances. Then I saw it again and a third time and I know that this is one of the best films ever to come out of Germany it's a powerful statement about protecting our children if you're looking at it as a message movie but in reality it is just a piece of cinema heaven. Thrillers today only wish they could draw a viewer into the mystery elements and have such unconventionality of the times. Boiling down to this M is about a child Killer  the legendary character actor Peter Lorre in his first major role  who snatches children when their parents don't watch and continues on until an investigation goes underway. But as the police investigate overly thoroughly into the real criminal underworld they know something is up that this is someone far more gone than they could ever be so they join in the hunt. This all leads to one of the supreme dramatic climaxes in any thriller.On the first viewing I just went straight for the story which is able to suck one in enough to make you feel dizzy. But on the multiple viewings it becomes even more interesting as one can study the intricacy and indeed fullon artistry of Lang's camera. He puts it in unusual places at times and adds for good measure shades of dark and gray in many of the night scene this is by the way a precursor to 'filmnoir' which Lang later became an important director in the 40's and 50's. On top of this there is a very modern sense of style in the editing I remember a couple of scenes that surprised me editing wise. One is where the cops I think it was the cops have an argument about the investigation two of them get into a shouting match and we get medium closeups of them going back and forth. This is done quickly with a kind of intensity that isn't even captured in today's thrillers. There is also the hunt for Lorre in the digging of the house where Lang cuts around constantly heightening the tension between the predators the criminals and the prey Lorre until it's almost too much to take.The disturbing aspects of the story of child abduction and murder have become benchmarks of a number of today's thrillers where the cop is usually the subject and the killer left more in the shadows in cat  mouse style. This doesn't happen here and because of it by the time we get to the final scene with Lorre being interrogated and giving his I can't help it speech it becomes something poetic tragic frightening. Lang doesn't leave his message so simplistically he makes sure we know Lorre's side too however twisted it has become and the antagonist is shown as human as opposed to these presentday thriller where the killers are barely given one dimension let alone two. There were reports that during filming Lang put Lorre through torture ultimately causing the two to never work together again. But nevertheless out of this comes a towering performance of a small wildeyed criminal in the midst of an extremely welltold and unpredictable mystery story. In short if you don't know what you're in for when you hear that whistle those several infamous notes you may not at all.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very interesting film on so many levels. It's interesting to see just how far ahead German cinema was of its American counterpart at this point in time. Although there is not that much talking in this early German talking picture  Fritz Lang resisted going to sound in the first place  what conversation that does take place is well done and natural sounding. Compare it with any American film from 1931 and you can't help but see the difference.The murderer artfully played by Peter Lorre has been killing children that have no link to him personally for months. The police despite all of their efforts are unable to catch him mainly because there is no rhyme or reason in his choice of victims. At first there is a focus on the victims and the hole left in their families by their killing. Then the film shifts to two normally opposed groups  the police and the underworld. After several months of no results by the authorities the police are unhappy because it reflects badly upon them and the underworld is unhappy because their activities are being disrupted because of the police doing constant raids in their efforts to capture the killer.In a particularly welldone part of the film the scene shifts back and forth between a conference of police and one of the underworld. They discuss how they are going to catch the killer. The police settle upon the idea of looking for people with a history of past mental problems that were pronounced cured and released. The underworld decides to enlist an invisible group  the beggars  to follow every child at all times and therefore catch the killer. Both groups focus on the right suspect the question is  who gets there first? M is a fascinating film that raises many topics  the death penalty a group of criminals that are criminals by choice causing less stress on society than a lone criminal that acts out of an uncontrollable compulsion and the motivations of the authorities often being their own bureaucratic survival rather than the larger issue of ending a series of horrible acts against humanity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a huge fan of German Expressionist art I'm naturally drawn to the films of Fritz Lang.  I recently was able to see the restored version of Metropolis on the big screen and was delighted to see M on the Sundance channel  especially since it was the uncut version.  M follows the trail of a child killer Peter Lorre sought both by the police and the members of the underworld whose businesses are being effected by the investigation. This film is groundbreaking for many reasons  It is Fritz Lang's first talking picture it is one of the first in the serial killer genre and it was overtly antiNazi.  This film was banned in Germany shortly after it premiered and Fritz Lang and Peter Lorre both Jews soon fled the country. It has superb acting most notably Peter Lorre's trial scene in the catacombs and very stark yet at times gritty cinematography.  The story is indeed suspenseful and at times very creepy what whistling child killer isn't?.  The entire movie however is extremely thoughtprovoking and challenging much like the German Expressionist movement itself. This is not a movie for everyone some may find it boring some may find it too abstract. It also has one of the most bizarre shots I've ever seen in film  essentially it's a 30 second shot of the police inspector talking on the phone but you're under his desk and looking up his pants leg.  It actually kind of baffled me and made me chuckle for a second but it was avant garde if anything.To those who appreciate early cinema that truly makes you think both about the film and the subtext with which it was written and filmed it is a mustsee.

	schema:headline " L Before M";
	schema:reviewBody "In an eerie propagandist fashion the phrase in the name of the Law is repeated over the last two scenes of Fritz Lang's M as a child killer is brought to justice. If L represents the State and the Law then M is meant to represent the Individual who in this case is a Murderer. Lang boldly asked us way back in 1931 whose rights come first the State or the Individual? A master of his craft Lang leaves the question openended and let's the audience decide.M is shockingly contemporary in its psychological complexities. It explores the psychology of individualism vs. group think while showcasing how a state of fear can be inflicted upon a populace when a government fails to protect society from a single individual terrorizing the people. The story is fairly straightforward An elusive citizen begins killing innocent children in a large nameless German city. The media fuels a paranoid frenzy that incites the public. The clueless police begin to raid the underworld after the populace is turned into a raving mob because of the failure to capture the killer. The underworld comes to a screeching halt as their business is ruined by the police and starts their own manhunt for the killer.Unlike a modern period piece that attempts to evoke a certain place and time M WAS a certain place and time. Lang in an almost prophetic sense captured the state of mind of the German people in 1931 as the Weimar Republic was on the brink of collapse and the Nazi Regime was preparing to take over. When individuals live in a state of fear as they do in M society collapses and the Individual is crushed. Only the State it seems can bring order.M is a also a masterpiece for its technical aspects. The way in which Lang uses his camera to move through windows capture shadows reflections empty spaces and shift pointsofview is staggering even by today's standards. He also played with the new technology of recorded sound with extensive voiceover narration and dialogue used to overlap and transition between scenes. Didn't critics recently praise Michael Clayton for utilizing just such a technique as if it was something revolutionary? One can also see a protean style the would eventually birth the Film Noir movement with the creation of tension and suspense in the use of shadows and camera angles.Yet M is not perfect. It has some major flaws. There are no real characters in the film to speak of in the modern sense. The film is virtually all built around mood and plot. The only time Lang invites us to emotionally connect is in the opening and closing scenes with a mother of one of the victims and in the classic scene of Peter Lorre giving his writhing and primal I can't help it! speech in front of the kangaroo court of criminals. The mother's grief and Lorre's madness are presented so sparsely and in such a raw form that it becomes too painful to want to connect with them. Another flaw that is often overstated about films from this time period is the slow pace of the early police procedural scenes. These inherent flaws combined with the inherent brilliance of Lang's vision make M one of the most challenging films a modern viewer could ever sit through.What impressed me most about M was the subtlety of the symbolism Lang created with his haunting images. As harrowing as the story is none of the gruesomeness is shown on screen. It's all transmitted to the viewer through the power of suggestion. Is it any wonder Hitler wanted Fritz Lang for his propaganda machine which thankfully led to Lang fleeing to America? I'll never forget the wide shots of the kangaroo court and the looks on those people's faces as the killer is brought down the steps for trial or the vast expanse of that empty warehouse. The scene of the ball rolling in the grass with no one to catch it the balloon caught in the telephone wires and the empty domestic spaces the mother has to inhabit after her child has been murdered are the types of scenes that tape into Jungian archetypes and shared fears. The look on Lorre's face as he confesses the hand of the Law coming down to save Lorre from being lynched and the ghastly plea from the mother in the final scene will stick with me for the rest of my life. M is a communal nightmare one that from which we have yet to awake.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching Fritz Lang's M is watching the history of cinema unfold before one's eyes. Made in the transition period between the silent and sound film this 1931 masterpiece remains fascinating for several reasons.First of all the use of sound is impeccable. Suffice to say the killer in the movie is caught is through identifying his trademark whistling. But the use of voiceover narration was also new at the time and is used here very well first when a mother calls in panic for her missing child and her name echoes across several empty walls. Next in a scene in which two detectives elaborate on what they've done to apprehend the killer and everything they say is matched by an image.Secondly few times has a serial killer been treated with such complexity compassion and straightforwardness in cinema. Peter Lorre plays a child murder a man who acts by impulse possibly a schizophrenic. He simultaneously evokes horror and pity and he's too distant from the supercool and erudite serial killers of today. Lorre plays one Hans Beckert a lonely man with a history of mental illness an ordinary man without any qualities or amazing traits.Thirdly it's a powerful meditation on vigilantism and crime. The police is unable to capture the killer so Berlin's underground decides to capture the criminal. The police raids are putting them out of business and they resent the fact that a child killer is being sought amidst their ranks. The absurdity of bank robbers and card cheaters with a sense of morals is not lost on the filmmakers. In a mocktrial at the end these same criminals think they have the authority to sentence the child murder to death. But as he tells them if they wanted if they got jobs and worked honestly they could leave their lives of crime a man who's ordered by voices to kill can't just turn off him impulses.But above all M is a fascinating exciting thriller. It's an intelligent crime story that shows police and criminals working on different sides and with different means to achieve the same purpose. If one can laugh at the idea of a criminal union realism should never be a criterion for judging art one can't laugh at the policemen in this movie. Inspector Lohmann played by Otto Wernicke is one of most intelligent detectives ever to grace cinema. He's fat he's cranky he's an unlikely hero but he's shrewd he can read a person's personality at a glance he's patient. Lang must have liked him too because he used the character and actor in his following crime epic The Testament of Dr. Mabuse in which Lohmann shows even greater skills.I knew or at least highly expected that M would be an amazing movie. But I didn't imagine a 80yearold movie would hold up so well in terms of cinematography sound pacing acting structure. Few movies achieve such a synthesis of qualities. There is no doubt on my mind that M deserves the recognition it continues to receive from film historians.".

The story is OK how it is told is rather weak in some parts it's even ridiculous the acting is mostly very weak except for Lorre who you don't see much of anyway and the sound quality is horrible something you can't blame it for but I had to use HEADPHONES on full volume to even understand the words! but switching from sound to silent all the time is very distracting and has no dramatic effect at all even if some say so  the opposite is the case it seems very amateurish. The slow pacing is typical for it's time. And suspense? I don't think so. In my opinion the main reasons why this film is so critically acclaimed areA Lorre's overacting. Whenever overacting has a purpose it's critically acclaimed. And his acting as a madman is very effective. B I'd call it heavy look. The topic seems heavy and the plot and style seem all too heavy and important. You almost want the film to be successful so you search for it in Lorre's acting. As a justification so to say. I'm sure you like the film for many other reasons too. Some more important reasons maybe. But that doesn't mean I'm wrong. It's a film we want to like and where you don't want to look for the flaws. Well long story short I don't think the final result is a success. There is too much Average in it and the Great isn't all that great. Metropolis Nosferatu Caligari Sunrise I think have all a more stunning look. All silent and all made before M. Don't get me wrong the cinematography is good and also inventive in little parts but not THAT revolutionary that it deserves the reputation it has. Probably the flaws are too big for me to fully appreciate the rest. Like every time one said He doesn't leave any marks...blah blah I had to laugh. He talks with the kids in the middle of the day in the middle of the street he walks along the streets with them he goes into shops buys stuff for them he makes mad gestures in public. And then he also whistles this damn song all the time so loud you hear it from three streets away while everyone in the audience knows from beginning on that this will be his doom. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "Masterpiece is the word most film buffs and historians probably would use to describe this 1931 Fritz Lange film based loosely on the events of a reallife serial killer a few years prior to the film. In this movie the killer is Hans Beckert Peter Lorre who lures children to their deaths.Though the story is about a child killer the theme of M centers more on society's obsession with the murders. From kids playing games to adults going about their everyday lives everyone is on guard suspicious combative and very vindictive. For selfish reasons even the petty criminal underworld wants the child killer caught. But the police are ineffective and a selfrighteous mob mentality takes over. The whole film is really a study in the terrifying psychology of group think.As it turns out the killer is less monstrous than pathetic and compulsive. Beckert can't help himself. He's a short squatty bugeyed little man who can't control the devil within. Lorre was perfect for the role and his acting is flawless and mesmerizing. Yes the killings all offscreen are awful. But the militant lynchmob mentality is just as scary. Beckert is the only individualist in the film.Part silent film and part talkie the BW visual style of M is wonderfully expressionistic and baroque. There are lots of overhead camera shots. Background sounds like honking horns and whistles are precursors of major plot points.What strikes me most about this film is its tone. I can think of very few films that are so harsh so bitter so malicious so punitive. M contains not an ounce of humanism. Lang's exwife Thea von Harbou a Nazi sympathizer wrote the film just before the rise of Hitler. The film's angry militant tone thus foreshadows Hitler's Third Reich from 1933 until 1945. Lang himself fled Germany and ended up in the U.S.Your own personal preferences in films will determine whether you consider M to be a masterpiece or overrated or perhaps somewhere in between. But individual preferences aside there can be no doubt that M is an important film historically. Every person who wishes to be versed in classic films needs to see M at least once.".

	schema:reviewBody "While many of the problems of early sound pictures lampooned in Singin' in the Rain were more or less myths the early talkies did present a big challenge for filmmakers everywhere. Europe however was at an advantage over Hollywood because even though it took them a few years to gain the same access to sound technology films from the US would be screened abroad only six months or so after their first domestic release. Thus directors like Fritz Lang were able to witness Hollywood's first faltering steps with sound before giving it a go themselves.It's funny how sceptics dismissed sound as a gimmick because the best early uses of sound were those that treated it as exactly that  a gimmick. Lang demonstrates in M that a talkie need not be an entirely new kind of motion picture sound is merely another layer of technique. Rather than getting bogged down in lengthy dialogue scenes Lang keeps his storytelling primarily visual and when he needs lots of expository dialogue he intercuts multiple scenes to keep the pace going. This is not to say Lang is trying to ignore sound  in fact he uses it to enhance the picture sometimes having dialogue or other noises take place offscreen to focus us on reactions or causeandeffect. Other times he ironically uses completely silence something of course you never get with silent pictures due to the continuous musical score giving a dreadful sense of eeriness.And thankfully the best elements of Lang's method have survived the talkie revolution. His visual style is particularly effective here in provoking a chilling disturbing atmosphere. Shot compositions with large blank areas give a sense of surreal starkness. Characters often stare intensely straight at the camera aggressively drawing the audience into the film's world. Several times we are even dumped straight into the pointofview of the killer himself. The fragmented narrative with its lack of lead characters and impersonal pointbypoint plotting could easily be boring but Lang holds our interest by keeping a dynamic sense of rhythm and telling the bulk of the tale through pure wordless imagery. Lang's German pictures in common with typical German cinema of the time feature highly melodramatic acting and exaggerated almost comical characters. These figures generally suited the fantasies and comicbook stories of Lang's silent days but I'm not sure they sit so well with the closetohome setting of M. Still these characters are somewhat more effective now that they have voices probably because most German screen actors of the day were from a stage background. Peter Lorre was a shameless ham but that's what you need to play a psychopath and in any case he's a lot better here than in many of his Hollywood roles. Otto Wernicke is also incredibly entertaining in the role of Inspector Karl Fatty Lohmann again a stagy exaggeration but with some absolutely wonderful gestures and comic timing.There isn't a lot else I can say about M  it is one of those pictures that has been analysed to death  although I doubt any comment other than mine mentions Singin' in the Rain in the opening line . While not quite Lang's best picture I can think of few directors who made such a smooth transition from silents to talkies and sadly this was his penultimate German picture before the Nazis took over. There's no denying that Lang was wasted in Hollywood. He did his best to understand it but by and large it never understood him. I say by and large the renowned Irving Thalberg was reportedly bowled over by M and screened it to many of his writers and directors as inspirational material. Had that prestigious and influential producer not died in 1936 the same year Lang began working in Hollywood would things have turned out differently I wonder?".

	schema:reviewBody "Yikes. This is the second classic I'm reviewing in the same day where my opinion is almost the polar opposite of the consensus the other was Things to Come 1936. At least I do not feel that M is a complete disaster. The final third is actually quite good and there are occasional moments of artistic merit prior to that. Further you should watch M at least once for the same reason that you should head out to see the Emperor parade by in his new clothes at least oncenamely because everyone is talking about it a lot of people are being influenced by it and so on. But M is far from a masterpiece. Comparing M to classic Hitchcock is almost criminal. The hot air that's regularly emitted about this film could fill a million balloons for street vendors. The first two thirds of M are pretty badI almost couldn't make it to the ending which would have been a shame and I'm someone who is almost never tempted to bail out on a film.The crux of the story is that there is a serial killer targeting young girls in a large German City. The time period is the film's present. The police are having difficulty catching the killer who is regularly making the headlines of the local paper especially as the killer keeps writing taunting notes to be published. After the latest murder a large vigilante group of panicked citizens including a fair number of criminals decides to take action. They organize dividing up the city into quadrants for different people to patrol and they try to keep the police uninvolved.The problem with the majority of the film in a nutshell is that the storytelling is extremely sloppy. The script cowritten by director Fritz Lang is all over the map. There are way too many characters. The audience doesn't get to know any of them at least in the first hour. Instead it is scene after scene of people we've never met before mostly sitting or standing around and fretting about how they're going to catch the killer. Lang's direction is extremely flat and the editing is even worse. The pacing is horrible. There are superfluous pregnant pauses around every corner. There are a lot of superfluous insert shots. There is a lot of poorly chosen camera placement. The absence of a score except for the killer whistling a famous bit of Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt doesn't help. There are no characters to care about. There are no characters to follow into a story. The scenes have all the flow of waiting for two hours in a dentist's office. The dialogue is bland.And the plot unfolds very linearlythis is even true when the film improves in its final third. There are no surprises or twists to be had here. All of the information that the police and the vigilantes need basically falls right into their laps. They hardly run into a kink. There are a couple small problems but they're easily resolved.For a thriller M has very little tension. The first hour is more in the realm of police procedural but it's very slow at that and the police aren't in it enough or at least there's not enough procedure shown to make it work. M is also considered a film noir but residence in that genre is more superficial here. At any rate it doesn't help create an engaging film.But as I mentioned there are a few moments of value in the first hour. These mostly come by way of cinematographic symbolism. For example one shot shows a child's balloon being ensnared in power lines. That and a rolling ball are sufficient to convey that the child has fallen into the killer's trap and is now dead. Some of the interesting symbolism is a bit heavyhanded but still attractive. For example a potential child victim who ends up in front of a store's picture window beneath a large arrow pointing down at her and next to a hypnotically spinning spiral.The improvement arrives once the vigilante mob believes it has the killer cornered. This is more than an hour into the film. The sequence where they're taking the place apart is well directed and actually becomes suspenseful. We finally get to know a couple characters later including two members of the police force. The crowning scene features Peter Lorre as Hans Beckert giving an impassioned speech before a huge vigilante mobhe's defending himself before a kangaroo court. Yes Lorre is excellent here but he's not in the film enough. 15 minutes of an excellent performance with scattered moments elsewhere are surely not enough to put M on best films of all time lists.Lang has interesting things to say about vigilante justice and criminal culpability. But the vigilante justice stuff was to be much better handled by Lang elsewhere such as Fury 1936 which is very nearly a 10. Beckert's culpability speech covers some of the basic issues that one would in an ethics class but it's not very completeit doesn't delve into the ontology of choice enough and of course it doesn't answer any of the issues. The latter fact is probably for the better. There aren't really easy answers although my personal view is that choice is not strictly necessary for responsibility or culpability. This scene also at least implies a lot of the ethical issues involved with the formal justice system visvis insanity defenses the possibility of parole and so on.But why couldn't Lang have dived right into the material of the last halfhour after say a 5 or 10minute prologue? The film ends abruptly. Extend the ending and cut out all of the fiddlingabout garbage that consumes the majority of the screen time. This is just bad screen writing and it doesn't deserve the praise it has received.".

This is a very boring film one that is only somewhat redeemed by a great Peter Lorre and an interesting final scene. But the first hour was sooo slooow! Low point was a tenminute scene in which four boring men were having a roundtable about deciding what to do about the child killer. No camera movement whatsoever just blabbering and no oneliners either. He's a killer for heaven's sake  ACTION! DO SOMETHING! STOP HIM! ...Looking back maybe I was even more mesmerized by the brand M.

He selects innocent young girls and discreetly walks off with them leaving the police force baffled as to trying to apprehend him and bring him to justice. So a concerned vigilante mob consisting of average citizens and hardened criminals take matters into their own hands in trying to catch the killer without interference from the law.My basic summation above sounds far more interesting than the way this overrated film plays out. I just rewatched this for my third but final time on a Criterion DVD which offered the original German language version with English subtitles. The movie has a troubled history of having different prints at varying lengths and this one was way overlong at around 109 minutes. I first saw M at the Film Forum in NYC around the late 1990's. It may have been a shorter Englishdubbed version. At that time I recall being impressed at least with the intense ending which highlights an emotional and sympathetic performance by Peter Lorre where he is thrown at the mercy of a kangaroo court and actually pleads for the audience to consider his compulsions from his own warped perspective. It was based on that memory that I picked up the Criterion DVD release at the time it came out which I may have spun maybe only one other time after I first bought it. However I found this newest viewing to be dull and prolonged with endless scenes of police procedures and discussions. Peter Lorre's screen time was precious little and he only got to shine at the end for the last 15 minutes or so  which was a good scene but not worth enduring the rest of this tedium. There was not much in the way of directorial flourishes. There are some nice suggestive visual setups at the opening to allude to Lorre's crimes but that was about all. Just too much contemplating searching investigating talking meandering to take up the most inflated guts of this film. 12 out of ".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the several dark dramas dealing with politicalphilosophical issues that seemed to invade the big screen in the 90's. Another prime example but with less heavy drama and more fantasycomedy is Dogma starring Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. This 1995 film stars several actors that were big names in the 90's  Cameron Diaz Bill Paxton and Jason Alexander. The story is very dark and bleak indeed. A group of young collegeage liberal intellectuals meet daily to discuss the enemy that are conservative extremist and anyone they feel are full of hate. Though wellmeaning and clearly sensitive people they begin to justify a series of murders. These murders are committed as they invite individuals they despise and disagree with politically and philosophically. They poison the wine using a blue decanter. Visually and dramatically the movie is one of the few good dark movies that came out of the 90's. Art direction in the film seems to gravitate towards symbolic Diego Rivera style art especially during the opening and closing credits.I feel that some of these then unknown actors mainly Cameron Diaz and Bill Paxton were overly dramatic in their roles but then again they were struggling to get recognized as actors. This was still before Bill Paxton would enjoy success in later films such as Titanic in 1997 and also Twister which he starred opposite Helen Hunt. Cameron Diaz came on the Hollywood map with Something About Mary. Even like this their dramatic acting is logical and believable. The leader of the group of friends is the most brainwashed of the bunch nearly conducting himself as a cult leader. In a way this movie looks at how a cult can function. Also this movie is a caution tale there is possibility for evil in both the extreme conservatism and extreme liberalism. It seems quite appropriate a story for today's divided country. It's sad to say America is losing its democratic roots in favor of an elitist and partisan climate. I found to be a great and poignant movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to review politicallythemed movies without bringing out your political ideology. So here we go Like the characters in this film I am a liberal. THE LAST SUPPER deals with five idealistic leftwing college students who are also roommates. Their names? Jude Cameron Diaz Marc Jonathan Penner Luke Courtney B. Vance Paulie Annabelle Girsh and Pete Ron Eldard. Get it? Jude Marc Luke Paulie and Pete? Last Supper?Well with these elements of symbolism aside here is the concept of the film A bunch of liberals inviting conservatives for communal dinners and killing them after the slightest disagreement! How many people here can honestly say they never thought of that? When the film opens four of the friends are waiting for the last one Pete to arrive during a dark stormy night. Meanwhile they religiously watch a conservative political figure Ron Perlman on television like they usually do. When Pete finally arrives he invites Zack Bill Paxton the trucker that gave him a ride to dinner. But during the feast a political discussion starts burning up. Zack is a rightwing extremist who fought on Desert Storm Was that even a war? I always thought it was a Republican propaganda. and thinks Hitler was right about many things. When the discussion turns into a series of puns exchanged between Luke and Zack a violent struggle ensues with Zack eventually being stabbed in the back. Soon the friends start reacting to the murder on their different ways. Paulie is in hysterics Luke keeps his calm coldblooded figure and Jude remains sarcastic. People disappear all the time. Especially in Iowa we probably just saved him from an alien abduction.After covering up the body the five apostles decide to repeat the process. Luke has an interesting concept If you could go back in time and kill Hitler when he was a frustrated student would you do it? And so begins the body count Their guests usually consist of the kind of pathetic people one leftwinger usually hates. One of them is a homophobe priest Charles Durning who affirms homosexuality is the disease and AIDS is the cure. Can you really blame these people for wanting to poison the fellow? This scene is incredibly well done from the firstrate dialogue exchange from the students to Charles Durning's perfectly timed acting. Annabelle Girsh's hilarious death sentence just has to be seen. I think it's time for dessert.As the group continues to make the world a better place their victims start to become less and less threatening from a date rapist Mark Harmon to a spoiled teenager Bryn Erin who sues her school because they are making sexual education mandatory. Unfortunately none of these scenes end up having the same dramatic and comic impact as the first two because they are unbelievably brief leaving the audience gasping for more. The film soon endures the machine gunediting technique of putting up about 30 scenes in six minutes set to a carefullyselected pop tune in order to sell the soundtrack. There is a subplot involving the disappearance of a young girl who is being searched by the local police department headed by Sheriff Stanley Nora Durnn which look like they belong to a different and more serious movie. This is actually unusual since you would expect the goofier moments to come from an exSNL cast member. Or should you? The answer as to why these scenes are even in there comes much later on in the film. Frankly Nora Durnn's scenes Not counting the ones where she actually interacts with the students could have all used some cuts.Character interaction could cause another serious petpeeve to audiences who relate to the people onscreen. The only character who seriously remains constant throughout the entire picture is Luke while the others all seem to switch personalities. In one scene Paulie is extremely against the killings while Judy is totally for it. But later on In one of the film's funniest sequences the actresses seem to switch roles. A hysterical Judy ends up screaming out that they shouldn't be killing people while Paulie coldly replies They are not people they are people who hate! The Pete character is seriously undeveloped while Marc is hardly any better. The film does eventually pick up with the very last victim they choose which I won't spoil. Not counting the suspenseful showdown nothing really happens during the last 15 minutes but dialogue exchange in the dinner table bringing up usual liberal vs. conservative topics and there is where the movie truly shines like it did with the beginning. It's a shame it had to end really. Conservatives bashed this film as the ultimate proof that liberals run Hollywood not realizing the film does defend them to one extent. It doesn't matter how fun the characters' concept seems to be it's still sick and it goes against one of the major freedoms that liberals should be defending The freedom of speech. Out of the film's thenunknown lead actors the only one that really made it to be a star is obviously Cameron Diaz. But no matter how underdeveloped the characterization is all the actors are able to keep us entertaining. Courtney B. Vance and Ron Perlman seem to own the film during the last moments. As for the dinnerguests they end up being more wellknown cameos. Aside from Durning Harmon and Paxton get ready to see Jason Alexander having a short blast as an antienvironmentalist businessman.THE LAST SUPPER is still one strong freedom of speech defense argument welldirected by Stacey Tile who heads up an interesting young cast and a welldone premise. Had the film remained in the dinner table more often it could have been easily one of my favorite black comedies. Now wouldn't this be interesting as an actual thriller?3.55".

It's a shame it had to end really. Conservatives bashed this film as the ultimate proof that liberals run Hollywood not realizing the film does defend them to one extent. It doesn't matter how fun the characters' concept seems to be it's still sick and it goes against one of the major freedoms that liberals should be defending The freedom of speech. Out of the film's thenunknown lead actors the only one that really made it to be a star is obviously Cameron Diaz. But no matter how underdeveloped the characterization is all the actors are able to keep us entertaining. Courtney B. Vance and Ron Perlman seem to own the film during the last moments. As for the dinnerguests they end up being more wellknown cameos. Aside from Durning Harmon and Paxton get ready to see Jason Alexander having a short blast as an antienvironmentalist businessman.THE LAST SUPPER is still one strong freedom of speech defense argument welldirected by Stacey Tile who heads up an interesting young cast and a welldone premise. Had the film remained in the dinner table more often it could have been easily one of my favorite black comedies. Now wouldn't this be interesting as an actual thriller?3.55";

I thought I had seen every Paxton movie out there but I was pleasantly surprised that there was one that I hadn't seen.  So we rented it and even though Bill has a small cameo in the film I enjoyed this film more than I thought I would.  First the acting by the major actors is incredible and all the cameos by famous faces is fun to watch.  Luke  Courtney B. Vance  is my favourite character in the movie.  He seems to be a little more intelligent a little more sinister and a little more angry than the rest of them.  And it is his persona that I look forward to seeing in every scene.  I looked forward to see what he was going to come out with next. What sick twisted but convincing point of view that he would coerce his cronies into believing.The story is about a few friends that are liberals at heart.  They have their pretentious meals and drink their pretentious wine every night and talk about what is wrong with the world.  Then Paxton comes into the picture and he changes everything.This film didn't get a whole lot of attention when it came out but now with Paxton's star clearly on the rise after Titanic and A Simple Plan and Cameron Diaz in the upper echelon of actresses this film may appeal to more people.  And you should do yourself a favour and make yourself one of those people.  This is a great film.  And besides the entertainment value it really has something interesting to say.  Deciding whether or not you agree with it is half the fun.".

Naturally there is a clash of politics and after a violent argument the racist is accidentally killed. They decide to bury him in their garden instead of reporting the killing.

Their answer is yes and soon they are inviting other rightwingers for an evening of dinner debate and death.

The great irony is that the liberals become intolerant revealing the dangers of political correctness and the very real possibility of a leftwing police state in which alternative views are crushed in the name liberal values.A good soundtrack some sparkling cameos by the dinner guests and a knockout performance by Ron Perlman as the conservative commentator make this largely overlooked comedy well worth a gander.".

I accept it's a low budget film but that's no excuse for the leaden script the bizarre pacing and direction and basically wasting what little effort was put into it.  The guest stars were all good  indeed Ron Pearlman was the most likeable character in the film and I'm talking about his 'fascist politician' scenes too.There is nothing to recommend about this movie  the characters are obnoxious and selfassured wannabe standup comedians.  My friends and I sat stoney faced as one liner after failed one liner dropped limply from the 'clever and witty script'.There were moments when character development threatened to appear as some sort of depth was introduced to the 2D stars only for it to vanish as if it had wandered in only by accident and didn't want to cause a fuss.In fact the characterisation was possibly the reason I hated this film so much.  It seems the writers were too busy trying to show the friends enjoying each others' company so much that they forgot to include any reason why.  As best I could tell it seemed they all got together for the conversationmeal evenings purely so they could compete in witty banter and grin.And for some reason there was an odd aretheyaren'tthey sexual tension between the dark haired woman and the black guy that went nowhere and did nothing other than take up valuable story time.  Which was probably the point  the entire film could have been condensed to a five minute short and would have benefitted innumerably from the need to cut the chaff.The almost final scene in the kitchen I won't give any details away for those who want to see it. was almost farcical as the mood violently swung in directions I didn't think possible.  The conclusion was obvious inconclusive unsatisfying and ultimately reflected the movie as a whole. I guess in that sense you could call it a success.To sum up this bites.  A stellar cast and an intriguing premise result in the worst film of the nineties.  Burn it.  It must be stopped.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Last Supper has a lot going for it. It makes fun of both ultrarightwingers and of selfrighteous leftwingers. Like The Sixth Sense it uses the color red to carefully dye the house of the roommates until it appears to be dripping in blood. It shows the corruption of the mind which will inevitably occur as a result of murder and it displays the old saw about how the road to Hell is paved in good intentions.Problem? The acting is pretty dry. None of the roommates are remotely likable and their inevitable comeuppance loses some of its punch as a result. All of the characters both the executioners and their prey are excessively onesided and flat and no one is making the slightest effort to give any of their characters depth. The result makes the film a bit hard to sit through.".

Like The Sixth Sense it uses the color red to carefully dye the house of the roommates until it appears to be dripping in blood. It shows the corruption of the mind which will inevitably occur as a result of murder and it displays the old saw about how the road to Hell is paved in good intentions.Problem?

	schema:reviewBody "The dark and slippery satire THE LAST SUPPER is an Orwellian farce which whether or not it intends to be represents the distasteful course that American liberalism has taken over the past few decades. As a meal THE LAST SUPPER hopes to serve up food for thought but proves to be more fast food than grand cuisine. And before we end the lame and obvious food metaphors let's just say the film has a meaty premise but is hard to swallow because it is halfbaked  okay threequarters baked.The plot is simple five rather smug and pretentiously liberal graduate students in Iowa the heartland of American conservatism have a weekly ritual of inviting a guest to Sunday dinner so that they can have philosophical conversations about politics. Apparently meant to be selfindulgent and selfcongratulating chatter more than real debate the intellectual hour goes astray when an unexpected guest proves to be a far right lunatic who expresses his sympathy for Adolph Hitler. Before the dessert gets served it is the guest who gets carved up and the new Sunday night ritual becomes supper and a homicide. After some superficial debate the housemates decide that they would be doing the world a favor by disposing of potential Hitlers before they became real life Hitlers. It is liberal activism taken to its notnecessarilylogical extreme.Their guest list of cameo guest stars begins with the lunatic war vet Bill Paxton a homophobic priest Charles Durning a male chauvinist Mark Harmon and an antienvironmentalist Jason Alexander but quickly degenerates to lesser villains played by lesser actors that include an antiabortion activist a librarian who dares to object to The Catcher in the Rye and a virginal teenage girl who doesn't approve of sex education in school. The checklist of villains in rapidly declining order is obviously meant to show how easily the power to destroy can become indiscriminate and indeed addictive.The film has been deemed anticonservative by some because the supposed heroes are lefties and their victims are from the right and at least at first espouse only the most extreme notions of conservatism. But the point is that the various dinner guests do not represent typical conservative thought but are grotesque caricatures of right wingers. The war vet  seen through far left eyes  can't be just patriotic he has to be a crazed fascist. The priest can't merely see homosexuality as a sin he has to be virulent in his hatred. The antifeminist has to be a proponent of rape. Etc. etc. etc. The quintet of killers are not heroes or even antiheroes or even psychopaths but cleancut welleducated wellintentioned typical liberals who become drunk with their own sense of selfrighteousness. Their hunt to destroy future Hitlers blinds them to the reality that they are the future Hitlers. For what was Hitler but a man who thought he could build a better society by eliminating the undesirables? The rightwing victims are such obvious caricatures that they do not inspire anger or hate but uncomfortable humor not unlike guest stars doing a skit on Saturday Night Live. The weakness  or perhaps the point  of the left wing assassins is that they are so blandly uninteresting as individuals. This preppy death squad  Ron Eldard Cameron Diaz Annabeth Gish Jonathan Penner and Courtney B. Vance  are so homogenized and banal as individuals that they only can be moved to action as a group. The message is that Hitler alone couldn't accomplish much but a group willing to rationalize any atrocity as a means to a just end is the real danger to society.It is as a critique of modern liberalism in the era of political correctness that the film is boldly almost brazenly sly. The groundbreaking liberalism of the 1960s a call of dissent in the name of openness and equality has slowly faded into the background. Diversity has become the liberal buzz word but it is literally skin deep diversity not diversity of thought. It is said that we become that which we hate the most and as such liberal idealism has increasingly become a dogma of intolerance double standards and selfindulgence. Liberalism is no longer the antithesis of conservatism it is the mirror image.Of course the basic message of THE LAST SUPPER could have been told as well but differently with the political roles reversed. Indeed had the film been made in the 1960s I suspect that it would be conservatives serving the wine to liberals  and I suspect that the film would have been satirically sharper and more outrageous. Certainly in that case the film's casual religious symbolism might have made sense religion being a favored main dish to the right. But as is THE LAST SUPPER's attempts to mock religion seem like a lame afterthought  an illconsidered seasoning as it were.The film is better as a concept rather than a story and lacks a punch. Instead of being spicy or zesty or deliciously decadent THE LAST SUPPER seems to be served up as something that is good for you nutritious rather than satisfying. Especially the finale when the last Last Supper is with a conservative talk show host played by Ron Perlman who may or may not be the Hitler that the we are taunted with throughout the other meals. Just desserts are served up with an ambiguous twist that is as jiggly uncertain as JellO. THE LAST SUPPER makes the worst social faux pas of all by sending its viewers away only half filled and hungry for something more.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some very liberal grad college students have guests over to discuss politics. However after an incident with one exsoldier they start inviting over highly conservative individuals and poisoning them one by one. The movie is fun I like the premise and the graphics. However it's not serious or believable. I don't like how they put it together. For example the very first guest was a priest who was very offensive towards homosexuals. He was condescending and harsh. However he never indicated any intention to physically harm homosexual individuals. All he said was that he believed they were sinning badly he wasn't carrying out any act on them. I don't think he was an appropriate way to start the killings at all they should have started with some gun wielding farright redneck who made multiple threats about killing black people or homosexuals. They could have then progressed to some fatcat individuals destroying the environment poisoning water supplies inducing slave labour. Even though the writers missed these opportunities to highlight the real issues they do seem like liberals. The people with strong conservative viewpoints are portrayed as illiterates. I realize we are seeing things from the point of the liberal college students but there's more to it than that. A kind of dismissal of topics such as abortion as being something that should 'obviously' be allowed. I resent that abortion is a really serious matter where you are terminating something that is a little too close to being a human for comfort and not a clear issue. I think they got the idea of Courtney B. Vance as being completely for the killings and proactive with them sometimes and that idea was great. At first one of the girls was against them however she reversed it way too easy IMO. I think they should have kept her on as being the one who didn't like the idea. I think they did the ending more or less perfectly also and it redeemed some of the offence against conservatives.".

The plot goes that the group of five kill off dinner guests weekly.  With lots of colorful symbolism a slew of cameos and strong performances by 3 out of the 5 group members this movie grew on me after viewing it and thinking back on what I witnessed.  I'm not going to give away anything but the last 20 minutes of this movie more than make up for the flaws which there still are a quite a few.  The first knock I have on this movie is that Cameron Diaz's and Annebeth Gish's performances are not really that great.  Diaz is cast as one of the most important characters but her acting ability is tested greatly as she has to deliver most of her lines behind a table without her best attribute her body showing.  Her weak ability to speak her lines becomes obvious with the excellent performances of the rest of the cast.  Gish's problem is the weakness of the character because she plays the one of the five that could have easily been written out.Other problems in this movie are not as important.  One is that half way through the movie becomes repetitive.  The director shoots this part quickly and with a tongue in cheek style but it still comes across dull. The policewoman character is added to the story and is pointless and just used as a character builder and attitude change for one of the five.All criticism aside watch this movie.  If it gets to the middle and you aren't sure you want to finish it FAST FORWARD and watch the end.  The speech given is perhaps one of the best political speeches I have heard in a film.  The final 20 minutes is the 1 inch layer of icing on a partly damaged cake.".

A nice slice of Americana at its best.Kurt Russell so appealing as a child actor in Follow Me Boys returns to the screen as a nineteenyearold approximately college student. His acting range is excellent and he is accompanied by an able crew of supporting actors. Joe Flynn who many will remember as the perpetually flustered captain in McHale's Navy is perfect as the dean of a private college that ranks low academically and in terms of financial resources in comparison to other colleges in the state  especially the state university. Flynn  in a sign of his college's limited resources  drives what appears to be a Volkswagen Karman Ghia convertible. The driver'sside interior door latch is broken so he simply uses a rope to keep it closed.He complains that the state university is rolling in taxpayer money that his private college can't lay its hands on and rants and raves in a meeting of the college board of directors about the unfairness of that and about how the president of the state university is greedy. The students overhear all of this through a bug they've planted in the dean's office. The dean having declared that the school can't afford a computer that one of the professors wants goes on to mention the names of some of the students he thinks should be put on academic probation.Hearing all of this the students decide to try to get the computer themselves. What follows is a comedy of mishaps misunderstandings and odd coincidences that is very entertaining. The overall theme  that friendship is more important than money fame and prestige  is well supported by the plotting and character development in the movie.This movie in my opinion is worth watching more than once. Part of its charm is that the conception of what a computer was and could do was so different in 1969 than it is today.All in all I highly recommend The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes.".

The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes continues the Disney studio's successful run of comedies featuring goodlooking youngsters great character actors and a plot providing its star with a superhuman strength. The first followup film had Mr. Russell discovering how to become invisible. Since it's a Disney film the characters aren't too quick with the obvious like the invisible hanging out in the girls' locker room but everything is certainly likable.The film is chock full of familiar favorites like veteran Cesar Romero as A.J. Arno Joe Flynn from McHale's Navy and William Schallert from The Patty Duke Show. Getting to play in roommate Russell's top bunk is handsome blond Frank Webb as Pete Oaks who also joined Russell and Medfield College costar Jon Provost as Bradley in the pages of 16 and Tiger Beat. The teen magazines duly noted the presence of three of their own in one film. Mr. Provost had background fame as the second kid to own TV's Lassie and Mr. Webb ended his career tragically. Both feature prominently in the film's relatively fun conclusion. The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes 123169 Robert Butler  Kurt Russell Frank Webb Cesar Romero Jon Provost".

	onyx:emotionText "Squeakyclean cut collegiate Kurt Russell as Dexter Reilly downloads data from his campus computer and becomes a cause celebre by demonstrating his improved mental gymnastics. The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes continues the Disney studio's successful run of comedies featuring goodlooking youngsters great character actors and a plot providing its star with a superhuman strength. The first followup film had Mr. Russell discovering how to become invisible. Since it's a Disney film the characters aren't too quick with the obvious like the invisible hanging out in the girls' locker room but everything is certainly likable.The film is chock full of familiar favorites like veteran Cesar Romero as A.J. Arno Joe Flynn from McHale's Navy and William Schallert from The Patty Duke Show. Getting to play in roommate Russell's top bunk is handsome blond Frank Webb as Pete Oaks who also joined Russell and Medfield College costar Jon Provost as Bradley in the pages of 16 and Tiger Beat. The teen magazines duly noted the presence of three of their own in one film. Mr. Provost had background fame as the second kid to own TV's Lassie and Mr. Webb ended his career tragically. Both feature prominently in the film's relatively fun conclusion. The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes 123169 Robert Butler  Kurt Russell Frank Webb Cesar Romero Jon Provost";

	schema:reviewBody "People who are putting down this film as not good enough to 'show it's face in the theater' are showing their extreme ignorance.These movies were made for family audiences and rebroadcast on Walt Disney's television program which highlighted family oriented movies with cast members that even signed morals clauses that they wouldn't act up see Lindsey Lohan etc. in these days and trash the Disney image as being a family movie business.Early on Disney had just made shorts and TV shows. In the late fifties they started making fulllength films like 'The Shaggy Dog' with Fred MacMurray. It was so successful it started something. Fred MacMurray was asked to do more films.The AbsentMinded Professor remade later with Robin Williams in the lead role in 'Flubber' was one of the successful movies made by Disney that was then edited for their TV audience. It not only spawned a sequel Son of Flubber but many more family films and comedies that were designed to help people forget their problems while at the same time the commercials advertised Disneyland.Disney was ahead of his time in providing programming in what were essentially wellmade advertisements for families to enjoy and be reminded about visiting Disneyland his 'family fun park'. This lighthearted fun comedy featured Kurt Russell in the early days of computers preinternetgetting the computer's full knowledge into his head.In the remake with Kirk Cameron they updated it to the Internet infiltrating the student's mind and a 'superhacker' from the opposing school who's dean ironically is past Disney star Dean Jones who seeks to hack Cameron's brain and stop his 'brilliance'.The first of the three films that revolve around Dexter Riley Russell the dean Joe E. Flynn and friends is also the best done though the others are enjoyable too. 'Now You See Him Now You Don't' and 'Strongest Man In the World' are part of this three movie seriesIt also teaches the value of humility. Riley did nothing to gain his knowledge yet he became proud of how smart he was. He had to learn humility and how to treat his friends if he wanted to keep them. Good lessons to learn.The Disney television films were made for families and are much better than the stuff made today for 'families' including politically correct films sexually explicit nasty language and all the other things that supposedly makes them more 'modern'. Disney TV temporarily stopped around 1975. They have made some films since then that were still family oriented though people that followed Walt and then Roy Disney didn't have the same ideas about films and the value of good stories. Enter the Michael Eisner era...remaking classics and making part 2 stories of classics that have no basis in classic books and WERE released direct to video or DVD. Even marginal animated hits got sequels made. Actual hits like Lion King Aladdin Beauty and the Beast got several part 2 of Aladdin was a real turkey.Several of the older Disney films were remade for a 'revived' TV program. The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes was one of the better attempts. I would say only a handful were watchable in their 'updated' form. They made kids have to act like adults while the adults act like kids this might be a clever plot line in 'Freaky Friday' but when it enters into other stories it's hard to make out who is supposed to be adult and who are kids.No wonder kids today are forced to face problems beyond their years. They can't even escape it in the socalled 'escape films' on TV or in the movies these days with rare exceptions.It takes exceptions like Pirates of the Caribbean or The Chronicles of Narnia to remind Disney that people still like wellmade escape films that are wholesome and uplifting for the whole family.".

But after the computer comes and it's a large machine and Russell gets shocked from it everybody wants a piece of him with his retentive memory. Including the guy who owned the computer gangster Cesar Romero. He forgot to erase the files of his business and when Russell starts blurting out his private information on a college bowl show on television Romero decides he's got to be eliminated.I won't say more other than Russell finds out who is friends really are.

	schema:reviewBody "This film comes from an era when Disney made good live action movies for the whole family to watch I remember these movies fondly from my childhood so I was delighted to get a copy of this film to reminisce. Starring Kurt Russell as a college student this film boasts a massive cast of film and TV legends including Cesar Romero The Joker from the Batman TV series Joe Flynn The Love Bug William Schallert practically every TV series  check out his bio and even Pat Harrington Jr appeared in loads and loads. At this time in the studios history Kurt Russell was the all American kid that they wanted in everything and this is one of 3 films where he plays Dexter Riley Now you see him Now you don't 1972 The Strongest Man in the World 1975. Before I tell you about the film bear in mind that this film was put out in 1969 when computers where the size of HGV's telephones where all landlines and kid's with spirit could accomplish anything. By today's standards this film is extremely dated but if you are able to suspend your disbelief for 91 minutes and not question the inaccuracies and goofs then you might find yourself enjoying this probably more so than the 1995 TV Movie remake!!! Dexter attends Medfield College which isn't as lavish as other colleges in the state. Dexter and his gang persuade a local business man  A.J. Arno Cesar Romero to donate a computer to the college. Unfortunately not everything is as it seems as A.J. is a crook in his sparetime and he used to use the computer to handle his gambling houses. One night at college Dexter is involved in an accident with the computer which results with him getting the brain of a computer the scientific tests performed on him to prove this are hilariously camp. Soon enough everyone wants a piece of the amazing Dexter he practically tours the country doing everything from presidential tours to watching space rockets take flight. A.J. Arno wants a piece of this and tries to get Dexter for himself as do the dean's of various colleges including his own. A.J. kidnaps Dexter the night before a University Challenge style quiz which carries a purse of 100000 this means it's up to Dexter's friends to rescue him. Can they rescue him in time will the police believe them will Dexter be able to win the quiz show? OK so maybe some of the general knowledge questionsanswers aren't accurate nor is the medical exam but who cares this was made in the swinging 60's it's full of colour it's cheesy and it's totally harmless while being entertaining. If a VW beetle can have feelings and friends 'Herby' The Love Bug then Kurt Russell can play a kid who gets the brain of a computer after being electrocuted when in reality he should have died. 6 out of 10 from me fun colourful and cheesy.".

The director doesn't try new plots or topics but opts to stick on to his old story ideas only. You feel restless watching the movie as it becomes bore and slow most of the times.The only lighter moment comes with Juhi Chawla who plays a fortune teller and who guides Shahid for his future and about his luck factor. This part of the script makes you remember an English flick Just My Luck which has a similar plot where good luck gets transferred from one person to another. But even this interesting part is not handled well enough and it completely fails to entertain the viewer.Shahid tries to do his best but he doesn't have an author backed role. Vidya Balan is not convincing at all. At times she looks overconfident in what she is doing. Boman Irani as the last minute saviour entertains to some extent. Music department has only one foot tapping song from Pritam and all the other songs are just OK.Even when the promos of this movie started they failed to create any excitement and the same was the result after its release.

	schema:reviewBody "Aziz Mirza makes a comeback with 'Kismat Konnection'. I've always liked his films especially those starring Shahrukh Khan and Juhi Chawla because they have a unique charm and quirkiness and I love the fact that the story of his films usually revolve around the common man and his problems. 'Kismat Konnection' isn't exactly an original idea. The script draws inspiration from Hollywood films like 'Three To Tango' and 'Two Weeks Notice' but it's not a scene by scene ripoff.This time Mirza introduces a refreshing pair Shahid Kapur and Vidya Balan. Kapur's Raj Malhotra has Shahrukh Khan written all over it and the actor acts almost exactly like Khan minus the raw energy and natural spontaneity. If Shahid is copying Shahrukh's acting style he's doing quite a passable job of it but a copy will always be a copy. I almost gave up on Vidya Balan after seeing her ghastly performances in 'Bhool Bulaiyaa' 'Lage Raho Munnabhai' and 'Eklavya'. However here she's a lovely surprise. She plays Priya quite well. Aside from her wardrobe she looks good too. The two share a good chemistry.Of the supporting cast pretty much everyone does a good job. Juhi Chawla clearly stands out. Her scenes provide some of the best LMAO moments. I still can't get that scene out of my head where she as the semistoned psychic Haseena Bano Jaan tells Shahid's Raj 'Shake those booties babe'. I usually find Om Puri terrible in comedy but here he and Himani Shivpuri are fun to watch. Vishal Malhotra gets a decent role this time and does an adequate job but sometimes he's a little over the top.As a whole 'Kismat Konnection' works to an extent but unfortunately it does not reach the levels of Mirza's earlier films like 'Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman' 'Yes Boss' and even 'Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani' because of the following reasons 1. It's shot in Canada. What made Mirza's previous works likable was that they were set in India and concerned common problems of the ordinary man but in this film it is presented like just another NRI story when it could have easily been set in India. Thus some of the charm is lost.2. Not to put down their performances but even though Shahid and Vidya share a good onscreen rapport it's no match for the on screen magic between Shahrukh and Juhi. Perhaps the two newer actors will improve with time if they work together more often.3. Mirza's films were also known for their awesome soundtracks and the lovely visualization of the songs. However he's picked one of the worst music directors for this film and as a result 'Kismat Konnection' suffers. Not only are most of the songs horrendous their picturization is unimpressive and they really slow down the pace.4. Dialogues were another strength in his movies and 'Kismat Konnection' has plenty of those. But Shahid's monologue in the end gets too political and a little out of touch when he starts talking about global warming and corruption. I understand that the writer's intentions weren't ill but it just looks out of place and a crucial scene like that needed strong but tothepoint lines.Yet even with the flaws 'Kismat Konnection' is quite an alright flick. For me even a bad Aziz Mirza film would be worth watching and this one ain't so bad.".

And was drawn by stories I read about Juhi's role.Well Juhi was just great. Boman Irani had a cameo role and was appealing. Om Puri did his role flawlessly. Shahid and Vidya do make a dandy couple maybe not QUITE Shahid and Amrita but very good.My problems were really with the screenplay. It was very uneven to me. In a few moments I thought it very good. But in a lot of moments I thought it was not well written. They were trying for zany comedy and didn't quite make it.So its hard to give it a rating. I felt the cast tried very hard to make an inferior screenplay great. But I just didn't come away feeling the way I did after other recent movies like Jab We Met. So 610.".

The first being that Jab We Met was better and second being that the movie is all over the place.In general they are right. That doesn't mean the movie is badly made. Nor does it mean the movie is not entertaining. It is not a great movie but certainly one that has the ability to stay in your minds for a while.I am glad I did not read the criticisms on this site. I am glad I saw it and enjoyed it thoroughly and I hope that folks who read my review are actually encouraged into watching this movie.Since I don't really care for SRK's acting I don't go by the comments that SRK would have done better justice to the role of Raj Malhotra. Shahid Kapoor has done a fine job. His ability to get into a character is in full evidence.To put a long story short Vidya Balan's Priya is Raj's lucky charm and the narration builds it up in the first quarter very well. The second quarter is Raj finding himself falling in love with Priya. The third quarter is about Raj getting the kabab mein haddi out of the way and the fourth is when he must convince Priya that he loves her more than his Kismat. The denouement is superb where we find Raj getting Priya and his new found Kismat remains intact. In fact Priya's realization that she is very important to Raj's cause gives her a new meaning to her life.Where is the script weak? When Priya tells Raj Thee na main tumhaare saath. Hone dete jo hota. The truth is she wasn't really with Raj all the way at the time. Getting rid of the Kabab mein haddi Priya's love interest is not all that well done. Those are aspects when you feel the film is a bit all over the place.When is the script at its strongest? When Priya gets in the way of Raj on his important billiard's shot no doubt. Vishal Malhotra as Hiten and Raj's faithful sidekick is simply outstanding. Om Puri is great and so is Ms Shivpuri. Give this movie a try you will not be disappointed.".

But that's where you are wrong. The film is shot all over Toronto parts of Niagara India and a city or two I'm sure. Firstly any single person in Toronto does not live in a two story house by him or herself. And if you are going to design a house why not even get a glimpse of what a house in Toronto looks like. The staircase was so Indian the lamps were Indian and the fact that you showed a one story house from outside and two stories inside was SO Indian! Moreover Adelaide street where Mr. Shahid Kapoor lived does not have houses. It is highly commercial and totally packed with no rooms for houses. Secondly Vidya Balan is sitting at Sheldon Lookout and her waving friend sits across the lake to her. This is not possible because the rocks she's sitting on face a huge lake and the sky line of Toronto. And if someone Is sitting on the other side unless you have bionic eyes you cannot see them. Lastly the two love birds go for a walk in Toronto at Harbour front then walking around King Street then Bay street but when the song is nearly ending they are actually at Niagara falls which is two hours away from Toronto! But the audience is made to believe its all still Toronto! If you are going to use an outside location at least get its geography right. Toronto is flooded with Indians Pakistanis and Bangladeshi's and Srilankan's all of whom are big on Bollywood. But this much error in presentation of a movie by such a well known director is just sad. The movie is okay. If you have time to spare watch Jab We Met again. This one is a pass by.".

	schema:headline " The connection of lady luck";
	schema:reviewBody "Lady luck is the personification of luck in the form of a lady bringing good or bad fortune for a person mostly a male as it's the males who think this way. Males look upon the females they love or like as lucky for them and it's just a wild thought that their association brings good luck to them. Well such phenomena may not exist but several people believe in its existence. And as they say man's thoughts only reveal themselves to him in tangible form such things do happen also may be out of pure coincidence or due to the famous Law of Attraction. Kismat Connection 2008 tells such a story only.Set in Toronto the story of Kismat Connection the connection of luck is the story of two young architects  Raj Shahid Kapoor and Hiten Vishal Malhotra. They are talented and sincere but their luck does not favour them and they are struggling hard to get work. While continuously approaching Mr. Gill Om Puri a director of a construction firm  Batra and Gill in their bid to get a contract they stumble upon Priya Vidya Baalan who runs a community centre meant for the modestly earning people. Soon Raj starts feeling that Priya is his lucky charm. Love blossoms in his heart for Priya and he expects better days for him when two significant developments take place.Raj comes to know that Priya is engaged to Karan Behl and they are going to tie the sacred knot soon. On the other hand the coveted contract sought after by Raj and Hiten turns out to be the one which will result in the demolition of the community centre Priya is associated with. After a good dose of comedy in the first half and a good dose of sentiments in the second half the movie ends in the Bollywoodish 'All's well that ends well' style.The director of this movie is Aziz Mirza and it is the signature movie of this director who had earlier directed movies like Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman 1992 and Yes Boss 1997 having a similar tone. The movie is entertaining no doubt. And the theory of lucky charm may not be a scientific one but it may appeal to a sizable chunk of Indian audience including myself. It's a weak movie all the same with the director trying to pack too many things in the climax when the hero delivers his emotional speech and gets what he wants.The first half of the movie which focuses on comedy is more interesting and makes the viewer sit through it. However the later part follows the tried and tested formulastudded path and starts boring. Wellidentified scenes appear first to bring the members of the lead pair closer then to separate them and then to reunite them rendering a feeling that the filmmaker has nothing new to offer. The later reels have a clear hangover of Lage Raho Munna Bhai 2006 also when the issue of the dismantling of the community centre for the sake of the project of the mall creates a twist in the story. However everything remains quite predictable and the audience knows the end beforehand.It's difficult to understand why the filmmaker has set the story in Canada whereas the same could have been narrated with an Indian backdrop in a much better way especially when all the characters of the story are Indian only. Setting the story on a foreign land has diluted its impact for the Indian audience because it becomes difficult to relate to it on account of this very reason.Vidya Baalan has replicated her Lage Raho Munna Bhai act because she has got a similar role and similar script as well. However while she was perfect for Sanjay Dutt who's much older to her she is quite a mismatch for Shahid who is younger to her. She appears to be her aunt from all the angles and their on screen chemistry is quite unappealing. Shahid Kapoor Vishal Malhotra Om Puri Boman Irani and others including Juhi Chawla in a cameo have done their respective parts well. More than the chemistry between Shahid and Vidya it's the chemistry between Vidya and her peculiar friend Boman which impresses the audience.Technically this movie is good and the beautiful locations of Canada have been captured very well by the cinematographer. The movie is lengthy and should have been made crispier through proper scripting and editing. Pritam's music is good.I recommend Kismat Connection as a decent entertaining watch to the regular movie buffs. Well whether you consider someone special as your lucky charm or not is up to you but you can enjoy this movie which is more or less a fun movie.".

However the later part follows the tried and tested formulastudded path and starts boring. Wellidentified scenes appear first to bring the members of the lead pair closer then to separate them and then to reunite them rendering a feeling that the filmmaker has nothing new to offer. The later reels have a clear hangover of Lage Raho Munna Bhai 2006 also when the issue of the dismantling of the community centre for the sake of the project of the mall creates a twist in the story. However everything remains quite predictable and the audience knows the end beforehand.It's difficult to understand why the filmmaker has set the story in Canada whereas the same could have been narrated with an Indian backdrop in a much better way especially when all the characters of the story are Indian only. Setting the story on a foreign land has diluted its impact for the Indian audience because it becomes difficult to relate to it on account of this very reason.Vidya Baalan has replicated her Lage Raho Munna Bhai act because she has got a similar role and similar script as well. However while she was perfect for Sanjay Dutt who's much older to her she is quite a mismatch for Shahid who is younger to her. She appears to be her aunt from all the angles and their on screen chemistry is quite unappealing. Shahid Kapoor Vishal Malhotra Om Puri Boman Irani and others including Juhi Chawla in a cameo have done their respective parts well. More than the chemistry between Shahid and Vidya it's the chemistry between Vidya and her peculiar friend Boman which impresses the audience.Technically this movie is good and the beautiful locations of Canada have been captured very well by the cinematographer. The movie is lengthy and should have been made crispier through proper scripting and editing. Pritam's music is good.I recommend Kismat Connection as a decent entertaining watch to the regular movie buffs. Well whether you consider someone special as your lucky charm or not is up to you but you can enjoy this movie which is more or less a fun movie.";

And where did you find Juhi Chawla who went over the top in almost all her scenes. May be you thought that we would laugh at some of the predictable jokes. Maybe you thought that we would be happy to believe that Priya finds true love in you. Maybe you thought that we would like the way your luck flip flops predictably. Maybe you thought that your speech in the movie was inspiring for the audience. Whatever it was you made a wrong decision for your Kismat as this movie didn't Konnect at all with us.Anyways Id like to gift these two stars to you. Keep them safe as a lucky charm.

	schema:reviewBody "Kismat Konnection is the kind of film you might truly enjoy if the last film you watched was Yes Boss all the way back in 1997. Like most of director Aziz Mirza's films this one too is at its core an oldfashioned tale about a guynextdoor and the clash between his ambition and his middleclass values. Problem is that kind of premise doesn't quite hold anymore. It's a formula that's been flogged to death many times over and also because let's face it it's hard to relate with that kind of nave idealism in today's real world. Kismat Konnection is simply a rehash of Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman and Yes Boss but it doesn't have the charm of either of those films because it's constructed from a script that's ridden with flaws.Shahid Kapur plays Raj a struggling architect in Toronto who hasn't earned a dime in five years but still manages to turn out in the trendiest of clothes day after day. Raj seems convinced that all he needs is a bit of luck to set him on the road to success. His lucky charm turns up in the form of Vidya Balan who plays Priya an honesttogoodness girl who when she isn't busy ramming her car into Raj every other day bides her time protesting against the construction of a mall where a community centre currently stands. As luck would have it the contract for the construction of this mall is exactly what Raj is hoping to land with a little help from his lucky charm.Director Aziz Mirza pulls out every other plot point from his old hat and applies it in this film  guy uses girl to further his career guy falls for girl but she's already engaged guy suffers from bout of good conscience and decides to give up everything in exchange for girl's love girl feels betrayed when she finds out guy had been lying all along guy admits his mistakes in a gathering filled with too many extras and wins girl's heart eventually. You see you've heard this story before.Intended as a breezy entertainer Kismat Konnection  like Mirza's previous films  banks heavily on the audience's ability to relate to its characters and their simple everyday concerns. But it's impossible to relate to Mirza's cardboard characters who come with no backstory no explanations whatsoever. Because there's little to count on in terms of story the fate of this film depends almost entirely on the likability of its leads. Shahid and Vidya deliver earnest performances but they fail to rise above the flawed script. Saddest of all they fail to ignite the kind of combustible chemistry one expects in a film of this nature. It doesn't help that the director himself shies away from giving them any intimate moments. The closest you get in terms of romance here are two hugs between the couple  both moments seriously lacking in any sparks.The rest of the cast overacts beyond imagination and a word here for Juhi Chawla who is dumped with the most annoying role she's ever played on screen. How could you do this to such a fine actress Mr Mirza? Kismat Konnection doesn't work for many reasons but perhaps its most fatal flaw lies in its snailpaced screenplay which includes so many boring scenes where nothing much happens. It's not entirely unwatchable because the music's alright and the film's shot in a manner that's easy on the eye. But walking out of the cinema once the lights come back on you're just glad it's finally over.Believe me the best thing about this film is Himani Shivpuri and her fabulous comic moments. That should tell you all you needed to know about this film.".

A stranger comes to town and challenges her to a foosball duel on her own table. Her father meanwhile is preparing for his exit from the 20th century which he considers to be 'overrated'. Caught between the two men and her collaborator Bella Marina investigates the wondrous mystery of the human fauna.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'd heard nothing about ATTENBERG until I picked up a review booklet in the local indie cinema in my town and was intrigued by the premise. It's difficult to explain the story as such because this isn't really a story piece but more of a study in character and relationships and the human condition.As a character study the filmmakers perhaps deliberately draw parallels with nature documentaries which observe animal behaviour without really making any emotional connection between man and beast. The film draws attention to this  as the main character Marina played here by Ariana Labed watches Sir David Attenborough on TV describing his experience of coming face to face with a gorilla. He sees it as a connection with nature like no other he has experienced. Marina herself realises that there is no emotional content in her life no connection with those around her. Her candid questioning of her father's sexuality and the offhand conversation about the process of cremation after his death lays bare the emotional desert that she exists in. Her cold relationship with best friend Bella and Bella's clumsy attempts to set alight the fires of sexual yearning in Marina further show that she Marina is spiritually emotionally empty.Even her attempts  ultimately successful  to lose her virginity to the nameless engineer she drives to and from work each day in her job as a taxi driver are emotionless cold stark. She describes each stage of their tenderness each aspect of lovemaking stripping it of any feeling warmth humanity.Marina is played brilliantly by Ariana Labed who hides behind a stillness in both her face and eyes barely revealing anything except in the strange dances with Bella. Evangelia Randou succeeds in bringing darkness to Bella. She is unhindered by thoughts of feeling and emotion tenderness and love and in every respect she plays the darker animalistic side to Marina. It was easy to think for the first act that Bella was not a real character but a shadow side to Marina satisfying the hidden fantasises Marina has about sex and even in a Freudian twist about her own father.Marina almost gets there but the death of her father the functional process of packing him off to Germany to be cremated cremation is legal in Greece and has been since 2006 but is still frowned upon by the Orthodox Christian church there pulls her back into a world that is hard and cold and stark. She stands and watches his coffin packaged xrayed for the flight marked with THIS WAY UP stickers like some Amazon or eBay parcel. There is a moment of feeling as she chases briefly after the pick up that takes him to the plane but in the end the film pulls back from allowing the character the emotional epiphany it has been building to. She scatters his ashes into the sea driven there by Bella clothed in a functional visibility jacket and struggling to prise off the lid from the urn. There seems to be no feeling except maybe disappointment that there is no deeper feeling as the waves wash him away. Marina has not opened the door to love feeling loss emotion.And it's this that I struggled with in the film. What it said to me was that humans can be really no different from animals going through the day by day business of survival. It shows people in all their functional purpose  working eating dying. It doesn't hold back from showing it's characters naked like the apes in the jungle. There is a notion in this that we have a reservoir of compassion and love and a whole glut of deeper emotions to give but that it remains untapped and that we are perhaps trapped by our circumstance and surroundings and past and thus prevented from expressing our true selves. Our characters live in a rundown industrial town and the story itself was written against the backdrop of riots in Greece at austerity measures and economic crisis. The filmmakers and writers are asking Is this all we are? Industry? Economy? Money? Simple black and white things? Or is there something else.But they never answer the question for Marina and her plight is left unresolved unsatisfied.The cinematography in the film  by Thimios Bakatakis  is beautiful still. It is a series of tableau into which movement sometimes intrudes the emotions stirring the mind. But ultimately it is the failure to resolve Marina's dilemma that leaves the film missing that final piece of the jigsaw that would have made it an arthouse classic.".

All the talking in other reviews about Marina being emotionally 'dead' is total nonsense. You have to try to understand this character but not many men are willing or able to. To me she was the shining light in this portrayal of a depressed bankrupt and humiliated country. This movie worked like a magnet to me. After I finished watching it I was almost certain the director had to be a woman of about my age. I was right. I suppose Ariane has a great filming future ahead of her but I hope she will perform in movies like this one. But it could just as well be her best role already.".

I think I've seen quite a bit of various films but this was a real cinema extraordinaire Like Dogtooth which Tsangari coproduced Attenberg is a clear criticism of contemporary Greece and the decay of values on a sample so precious to the Greek culture  a family.Inspired by the BBC series studying the behavior of animals by David Attenborough the film tries to do something similar only the with people. Mispronunciation of the biologist's name provides the title to the film.The plot is quite simple and easy to get. Marina a 23 year old is only just starting to experiment with her sexuality at the background of a deserted factory a remnant of industrial Greece of the last century. Her father who's dying of cancer only speaks of the procedure of having his body cremated elsewhere as this is apparently a taboo in Greece. Marina's experimenting her first sexual experience with her best friend Bella who has apparently had her share already. Enter Engineer a nameless character who serves Marina almost like a human figurine for her first sexual experience.Let the story begin. Hold on but there's no story here. Tsangari is not interested in her characters and their journey of how they got being what they are or where they're going. Rather she studies their character and she does so mercilessly.She doesn't stop before anything including stripping her characters and their protagonists naked literary. Its not just their bodies we see naked but also all their secret thoughts and feelings lets them express everything on the screen for the voyeurpredator sitting in the audience serving them blooddripping raw.To even deepen the animallike impression the audience gets when seeing the four lead characters Tsangari lets them act like real animals and uses these sequences as intermission sort of in her film giving it an even more bizarre impression.The colors are very simple as well the general greyness interrupted only by images of the monstrous factory nearby. Camera bets everything on stills having the pattern interrupted only by a moment when Marina and Bella play tennis and tensions between them escalate.Overall a very interesting film more likely to shock and make your head spin rather than bore you.".

The protagonist of Marina is not only asexual she is completely unemotional even around her father and her supposed best and only friend. There is neither joy nor tragedy only complete indifference to everything that happens. Occasionally you get an interesting remark about how Greece skipped modernity but that is not really enough to make it interesting or thoughtful. Even during her sex scene Marina keeps talking trivia nonstop during the first half then is quiet as a mouse during the second half. I have never met or even seen people this deprived of emotion so I cannot relate in any meaningful way to it.In short this is the kind of film that most people will get bored with quickly then get told by somebody else why they are supposed to like it. Symbolism really only works when it is sufficiently obvious to all. In my opinion this should never have been nominated for any awards much less won them. If you know somebody that stares blankly with no emotion when heshe is with friends having sex and when their father dies then maybe you can relate to this film more than I did. If you don't well there are much better Greek films out there.".

It just seems they were token efforts to give this exercise in absurdity some kind of meaning. They fail badly. Maybe i miss the point and the point is there is no point  in which case why bother? Its not particularly entertaining with the odd moments of black humour being far too sparse to make it worthwhile. The little dances between Marina and the other female lead were just too ridiculous to assert anything and didn't make me laugh cry or think or feel anything. Even when the inevitable death of the father comes little emotion is evoked essentially because neither he or his daughter is particularly likable perhaps due to the overthetop eccentricity they exhibit.

This movie is a preposterously pretentious collage of thoroughly insipid scenes fit for a postlobotomy daylong blank staring session. I found the movie utterly unenjoyable and its parallel to reallife documentaries revolting and absurd seeing as how Attenborough manages to be a lot closer to his animals than this confounded director ever was to her actors. Tsangari is so adept at chasing the last traces of sincere expression out of the actors' performances that I feel like there was more humanity and life in the few shots of gorillas than there was from the entire cast of this excruciatingly dry film. The only memorable thing about this movie is how many yawns one could squeeze into 90 minutes.

That means 75 minutes of NOTHING have been added in between what actually means something. I am sure the director had a vision and the symbolism would be apparent but NO it's NOT apparent. What we're subjected to is scenes of no meaning and essentially zero emotion. None. I will say this  it is an interesting view of Greece quite unreminiscent of the postcardpretty beautifully sunny white washed Mediterranean scenes most people have seen a thousand times. This is a bleak Greece with bleak life wrapped up in a bleak film. I watched in a state of perplexation then at the end I wanted to run outside and scream in horror at what a terrible movie this is... but it was 4 a.m. and I'd wake up my neighbors. I'd rather watch 90 minutes of just my facial expressions while watching this film. Or I'd rather set myself on fire because that would be more entertaining than this socalled movie.

Marina Ariane Labed is a sexually inexperienced 23 year old who lives with her dying architect father Spyros Vangelis Mourilas in a Greek mining town. She shares her existence with her best and only friend Bella Evangelina Randou and for some unexplained reason they enjoy holding arms and doing silly walks together. Bella also brushes Marina up on the art of kissing. Bella works in a diner while Marina also has a job but we never really learn what she does. Marina's father is dying and she takes him to and from doctors appointments and the clinic and they eventually live together in a motel room close to the hospital. Marina and her father like to watch David Attenbourough nature documentaries where she and her father mimic the animals featured in them. She mispronounces Attenbourough's name as Attenberg thus the name of the film. Marina finds a boyfriend in an engineer Giorgios Lanthimos whom she does not want to share with Bella. Athima Rachel Tsangari directs this original story written by her. Not much of a story here. Not much of a film here either. Good soundtrack to this film with music by Suicide Franois Hardy Daniel Johnston J.J. Johnson's Beboppers and Marilena Orfanu. Lanthimos who plays Marina's boyfriend is best know as the director of the critically acclaimed film Dogtooth. Attenberg is Greece's official submission for consideration as Best Foreign Language Film to this years Academy Awards. Surely there were better films to come out of Greece so why they chose this one perplexes me. I would give this a 5.0 out of 10.".

To my surprise it did not disappoint.Now several years later after having watched all three of these Rings films twice each I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good to be sure but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the Fellowship film.Anyway Fellowship stunned me for the visuals alone. I can't recall any film that has so many jawdropping scenes one after the other for three straight hours. Some are beyond description and I don't care if they are computer generated. So what? The fact is they are awesome to view both in beauty and in staggering action scenes that feature incrediblelooking monsters and other mythical characters.The story covers all kinds of terrain too from the lush Shire of the Hobbits to the harsh neighboring landscapes. Each couple of minutes as in the two movies that followed scenes radically change from calmness to action adventure to romance sweet lovable characters to hideous monsters on and on and on. It's an incredible movie experience.".

As I've read many many times in other reviews McKellen doesn't play Gandalf he IS Gandalf. Wood Mortensen Holm Astin everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.The special effects were incredible the cave troll the balrog Gollum and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.What's wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect.

	schema:reviewBody "It is with no surprise that Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring film has received such mixed critics. Many viewers refer to it as being childish boring and uninteresting. Seems to me that it is bound to the same fate of Tolkien's books destined to be a target for the same type of misunderstandings that keep attacking this literary masterpiece many decades after it's first publication.Having read the books several years ago I went to see this impossible' film when it came out with many doubts on my mind. I really liked it but left the theater with as many doubts as I had before. Was it perfect? Well maybe not but what an achievement. After watching it a few times on DVD and thinking about it for some time now I find myself loving this film more and more. Let me tell you why...The Lord of the Rings is a fairytale of myth and fantasy. Peter Jackson directed a film that was considered for a very long time impossible to make and not only for technical reasons. The narrative roots are incredibly long and detailed and the storyline is deeply connected with the creation of a fantastic continent from a time unknown called Middle Earth'. It's author Tolkien dedicated a considerable part of his life developing this continent's background it's mythology and origins it's different kinds of people cultures and languages and therefore it's geographic references are determinant to the unfolding of the story of the One Ring.Peter Jackson went out to achieve the impossible and came out with a recreation of the original that is pure and true to the story in every detail. The first time the four hobbits meet a black rider on the road for example is absolutely faithful to the feeling of the book. The assault of the riders at Weathertop is another great example and it captures that feeling of danger density and atmosphere that are the main characteristics of the tale. Jackson also took some liberties with the story and made some right choices along the way. If the so called purists' may not approve the removal of Tom Bombadil altogether it should be comprehensible that the travel from Hobbiton to Rivendel is a very long and detailed one and could easily make a movie on it's own. I felt more uneasy with how short the Council of Elrond was. In the book the council is where the whole story of the rings is first explained and many passages from the past ages of Middle Earth are unveiled. It is a fascinating moment of the story that had to be shortened for obvious reasons. Still after some consideration I now agree with the options made by Peter Jackson and think that the movie prologue narrated by Galadriel was the wisest choice. The magic is all there when Gandalf shuts his eyes the moment Frodo stands in the council and says I will take the ring'. It is there at Moria's Gate and at the fall of Boromir. It is a powerful film that doesn't fit the rhythm of the standard Hollywood action movie. It is a film that breeds that takes time to unfold it's tale branching in every direction.I could go on and on talking about all the different elements that bring this film close to perfection but I'll end saying that deep down this is not about action beards and big monsters. The greatest thing about this film to me is that it brought me back to a time when I was in love with a different world where everything was possible. Reading The Lord of the Rings night after night I came to understand what this thing of mankind' really was all about. The corruption of absolute power the importance and value of friendship the inevitability of growing up the strength of hope... That this film could capture that magic and be a new bearer to it's message of humanism is a statement to it's greatness. Gandalf's words that even the smallest person may change the course of the world and have a part to play in the destiny of all are immortal.In the end this is a wonderful film but that doesn't mean you are going to like it. I cannot tell you what it is like to see this film if you don't know or love the book. But I hope it may plant a seed on your heart to discover a great world of fantasy beauty and humanity. I believe Tolkien would have liked that.".

	schema:headline " Never before in my life were my cheeks more aching...";
	schema:reviewBody "...but oh was I thankful for it!!! All through the movie I kept on having this big large smile sculpted into my face. For the record I'm 25 years old and I've read The Lord of the Rings in three times for the first time when I was six or seven years old. Ever since then I read it at least once or twice a year  therefore you can count me as a fan for I follow the same cult fan procedure with The Hobbit and The Silmarillion as well. Now onto the movie... Gosh I saw it more than one time and I keep wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for fans of the books the map on Bilbo's table in his house comes to mind it is exactly as the one in The Hobbit book that I own and I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence with the retelling of the battle against Sauron from the Silmarillion never has an ultimate evil being been so well depicted on the screen. It truly is Sauron. Those who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety  keep in mind that the audiobook version of 'Fellowship of the Ring' lasts well over ten hours making a movie this long would well make it way too long and besides how would you financially sustain such a project? I've read a reviewer saying he'd make all three books with the time allowed for the first movie alone. I think it would be a very fastforwarding experience of a movie with 'Alvin and the Chimpmunks' kind of voices incredibly stupid to say the least.Ok so there are changes in the movie  well this is Jackson's vision of it. All of us have our own visions of the books which may or may not be compatible with that of Jackson's but I can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as Tolkien that's the thing with books each reader has a different vision of it. As for me I was blown away. Never before have I felt so much at home in a movie it is as if I had taken a walk in the town where I grew up the Shire Rivendell Moria Lorien everything felt so much like home I was moved. I cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen.As for the changes well I found good reasons behind all of them and let me tell you right away I was happy that Arwen saved Frodo yes maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy but I enjoyed the scene a lot. I did not enjoy it because it was supposedly politicallycorrect to do so or that I find Liv Tyler to be absolutely attractive it was just because I felt like even though it was a big change from the book it was a very good one indeed it makes you discover the power determination and courage of elves and the fact that even elven women although great in their beauty and seemingly fragile in appearance do not have anything to envy to their male counterparts. And beside as Arwen is to become a Queen later on it was pretty good to see her have a great first appearance.The actors were great they were a lot into their characters and for the first time I saw elves as they were quick agile terrifyingly effective in battle  just look at how Legolas dealed with the hordes of enemies without a single hint of fear in his eyes  these are elves as they should be. Gimli was great too I know people seem to think many characters were not developed enough but by the actions you can learn a lot. With Gimli a lot can be learned about the dwarves their pride deep sense of honor and family their mistrust of elves their love for strong beer and a good fight against anything bigger and their sheer hatred for orcs and the likes. Aragorn was totally the ranger character the ending scene as he walked toward the horde of UrukHai warriors was great his attitude his clothes everything about him just cried ranger. Boromir was very well depicted desperate to save the people of Gondor by any mean necessary robbed of all hope yet in the end he redeems himself by showing his true valour deep down he's willing to die to defeat evil and when he recognizes his king in Aragorn on his last breath I felt like watching a hero die it was moving. The hobbits were all great Frodo is deeply sad and fatalist and Sam is just the 'best friend' everyone would like to have just as it should be. Finally we have Gandalf quite frankly he looks mighty Ian IS Gandalf. The faceoff against the Balrog in the Moria is a memorable sequence and just shows how strong he really is to be able to vanquish such a foe. I can't wait for his return.Quite frankly I can't wait for the two other movies... In the meantime I'll watch this one over and over again. This movie has everything that a good movie needs to have and more. Plus it just might bring more people to actually read books that have more pages than the average little 25 novel that has no value in it which is great. Parents maybe some scenes will frighten your kids but this movie has almost NO blood even though it has a good share of battle and the foes are undeniably evil plus it has good values in it  friendship courage responsiblity sacrifice for a good cause and the belief that anyone can help to change things. This is worthy of Tolkien this is a movie that will go down in history as being one of the best ever for sure.".

	onyx:emotionText "...but oh was I thankful for it!!! All through the movie I kept on having this big large smile sculpted into my face. For the record I'm 25 years old and I've read The Lord of the Rings in three times for the first time when I was six or seven years old. Ever since then I read it at least once or twice a year  therefore you can count me as a fan for I follow the same cult fan procedure with The Hobbit and The Silmarillion as well. Now onto the movie... Gosh I saw it more than one time and I keep wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for fans of the books the map on Bilbo's table in his house comes to mind it is exactly as the one in The Hobbit book that I own and I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence with the retelling of the battle against Sauron from the Silmarillion never has an ultimate evil being been so well depicted on the screen. It truly is Sauron. Those who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety  keep in mind that the audiobook version of 'Fellowship of the Ring' lasts well over ten hours making a movie this long would well make it way too long and besides how would you financially sustain such a project? I've read a reviewer saying he'd make all three books with the time allowed for the first movie alone. I think it would be a very fastforwarding experience of a movie with 'Alvin and the Chimpmunks' kind of voices incredibly stupid to say the least.Ok so there are changes in the movie  well this is Jackson's vision of it. All of us have our own visions of the books which may or may not be compatible with that of Jackson's but I can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as Tolkien that's the thing with books each reader has a different vision of it. As for me I was blown away. Never before have I felt so much at home in a movie it is as if I had taken a walk in the town where I grew up the Shire Rivendell Moria Lorien everything felt so much like home I was moved. I cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen.As for the changes well I found good reasons behind all of them and let me tell you right away I was happy that Arwen saved Frodo yes maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy but I enjoyed the scene a lot.

	schema:reviewBody "Barely ever hearing of The Lord of the Rings I went in to see this film in theaters the consecutive Friday it was released to not only be flabbergasted at its greatness but wanting more! Since then I devoted myself to seeing the following two films on the first day of release  a promise I kept.Peter Jackson's take on Tolkien's fantasy masterpiece not only carries a great deal of the text to full film fruition but shows the power of film and proving that nothing is impossible. Jackson's vision is continuous and never seems to loose grasp of the story that is being told. Using the artistry of John Howe and Alan Lee The Fellowship of the Ring gleams with a beautiful and dark atmosphere a length of detail that makes it seem like everyone and everything has its own history and full of wondrous images one could never imagine.The acting is superb. With a complex script each actor has transformed these characters into 3D people with deep backstory and people that we feel compassion for. This is one extraordinary ensemble cast. Each actor IS that character making it seem impossible to imagine anyone else fill that person's shoe in their stead. Viggo Mortensen IS Aragorn. Sir Ian McKellen IS Gandalf the Grey. Elijah Wood IS Frodo Baggins. One could weep with our heroes should one fall or feel inspired when they achieve victory. A fantasy with this much emotion just seems surreal but it's completely believable.Never losing pace the writing and direction is flawless making for one enthralling introduction into Middleearth. The voice over prologue fills even the most uneducated audience member with all the necessary knowledge they need to know in order to understand our heroes' and villains' motives. Some things of course have been omitted for pacing reasons. While not present in the theatrical cut we do see the passing of the Grey Elves and get a brief tale of Beren and Luthien. The barrowwights and their story is no where to be seen as interesting as it is in the book there really is no place for it in this film and Tom Bombadil is absent as well but thankfully to the ingeniousness of the writers in the Extended Edition of The Two Towers a little homage is paid to the character. Omissions and changes are always part of adapting a book to film and the ones made by Peter Jackson Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh are justifiable in every way.The action scenes are spaced out thoroughly enough for breathing room plot advancement and evercontinuing character development. Each action scene is its own be it the flight to the Fjords of Bruinen the Mines of Moria or the showdown at Amon Hen near the end of the film. All are greatly choreographed each stunt member and actor is full of energy and ambition as they wield deadly weapons at each others' heads and limbs. It really is a sight to behold.The special effects are mesmerizing. The use of CGI miniaturesbigatures and even clever camera angles blend to make one ideal image after the other. The soaring images of Baraddur or Orthanc seem real when in fact they only stand so many feet high. The Argonath two figures of enormous height standing before the Anduin River seem like 300 foot creations when in fact they are about only several feet off the ground. Simply jawdropping imagery.Howard Shore's score for The Fellowship of the Ring is a beautiful epic and complex piece of work that makes one feel like they have been entranced. Even when some of the text seems omitted from the screen it can be heard through the powerful instrumentation conducted and created by this composer. The use of leitmotifs to symbolize a country race or character is stunning.Overall The Lord of the Rings  The Fellowship of the Ring is a visionary masterpiece allowing the world to see what seems like actual history with fantastic elements equaling the greatness of Hollywood's earlier classics. As the first of three one who has not seen these films can await the next several hours of their lives to be changed for ever.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think it is important to remember that Peter Jackson took up this film not in order just to make a film of The Lord of the Rings' but because he wanted to make a 'fantasy just like the The Lord of the Rings' as he himself put it.  After repeating that phrase on a number of occasions the question popped into his mind Well why not the The Lord of the Rings' itself?.  In doing this he of course set himself an enormous challenge he had to make a really good fantasy' film one which would stand on its own and be true to what he had originally wanted to do but he would also and here the task he had set himself was enormous be true to the original book and to make a film which the legions of people who have loved this book would feel happy with.  In the latter task he was certainly not helped by the author or the book Tolkein it would seem hated cinema.  The book itself is HUGE' this was not going to be the kind of task that the James Ivory team set themselves or Scorsese nor the kind of task facing Branagh with Hamlet nor was it going to be like the puny task that faced Columbus with Harry Potter' who had the bigger budget 130 million for one film as compared with Peter Jackson with 300m for three.I have just seen the first volume' and can say without hesitation that he has succeeded in both his goals.  It is not the book but a reading of the book which is inventive and fascinating.  It is the kind of experience that makes you want to go back and reread the whole thing in the light of the emphases that Jackson has brought to the story.  He focuses on the corrupting influence of the ring and through this focus the character of the chief protagonists of the story are revealed.  Clearly those most tempted by it are mortal men Boromir and even in one moment Aragorn those who already have power Elrond  The ring cannot stay here' Galadriel Gandalf and Saruman  and of course those who would not normally desire it but who by accident become ring bearers  Gollum Bilbo Frodo.  I can see why in this reading Jackson decided to leave out the Bombadil episode.  Bombadil like the Balrog is beyond the ring but the latter is important to the unfolding of the story of the fates of all the characters Bombadil isn't.It is a miracle of this reading of the first volume of the book that one can see where Jackson is going and one can get a feel of how the reading is going to unfold.  In a sense Jackson's real trial  as far as those who know the books are concerned  will come with the second film in the series. He has lived up to our expectation by creating even bigger ones how can he handle the story of the chase andrescue of Merry and Pippin the storming of Isengard etc  stories which don't really add much to the core theme that is emerging.  Or is he now going to add the theme of the great contest of good versus evil to the unfolding reading?All of this points to the fact that the film even though it is a feast of special effects focuses on character.  And this also explains why Jackson chose the actors he did for their roles they are not big' names  no Sean Connery' no Alan Rickman' no Brad Pitt' no Sam Neill'etc.  He didn't want them getting in the way of the story of character.  Ian McKellan's talents in particular are used to tell a large proportion of the story an enormous amount is conveyed simply through his facial expressions and even by the language of his body. The other miracle in all of this is Elijah Wood.  Like many others when I first heard of Jackson's choice I groaned but Wood has been extraordinary.  He brings as one friend said a strange kind of androgyny to the role and this is just perfect. McKellan has already been knighted give Wood the Oscar.And then there is Middle Earth this is as someone put it another character in the story and the New Zealand landscape digitally enhanced on occasion lives up to its role too.Enough.  See this film!  Greatest film ever made?  How can one make a claim like that! Silly really as silly as claiming that The Lord of the Rings' is the greatest book ever written.  Can't one simply love a story enjoy reading it a number of times amd lose oneself in it.  One CAN claim that it is the greatest work in its genre as is the film.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "The first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy the Fellowship of the Rings opened the door to a whole new world for me. I'd never read any of Tolkien's books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre and now that I've read them in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie experience all the more miraculous.I loved The Two Towers and Return of the King almost as much as FOTR but not quite because seeing Fellowship for the first time was like taking a journey to a fabulous new place and meeting incredible new friends that you don't want to leave. I've never felt anything quite like what this epic evoked in me. It was akin to being a child again with that tireless sense of wonder and enjoyment of each and every moment maybe because as a child you are discovering your surroundings and whatever age you are when you watch the Fellowship of the Ring you are rendered in awe upon being introduced to the purity and beauty of Middle Earth and darkly enthralled by the majesty of Eisengard Saruman Sauron and all of their mighty malice. One of the things that makes this movie so special and there are so many! is that you fall in love not only with the good characters but also with the evil ones. For example Christopher Lee was amazing as Saruman and I can't imagine the movie without him.Some films that might be comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are The Fifth Element the Star Wars Trilogy parts IV V and VI forget the newer prequels the Matrix trilogy especially the first part Interview with a Vampire the Legend of Sleepy Hollow with Johnny Depp Logan's Run and The Island. They are all excellent movies and works of art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound and entranced for the duration of their runtime.But after seeing The Fellowship of the Ring I knew I had found the movie by which I would judge all other movies. Based on J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved books Peter Jackson has set a new standard in the industry of cinema one that I honestly think has not and won't be surpassed at least not in my lifetime not even by PJ himself.It is truly an instant classic that will stand the test of time and be loved by generations to come. God Bless Tolkien and Jackson and everyone involved in the conception and making of this film for creating a world that is at my fingertips only takes the touch of a button to go to whenever I want and makes me forget everything else.The LOTR Trilogy is undoubtedly MY precious the non plus ultra of all movies!".

One of the things that makes this movie so special and there are so many! is that you fall in love not only with the good characters but also with the evil ones. For example Christopher Lee was amazing as Saruman and I can't imagine the movie without him.Some films that might be comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are The Fifth Element the Star Wars Trilogy parts IV V and VI forget the newer prequels the Matrix trilogy especially the first part Interview with a Vampire the Legend of Sleepy Hollow with Johnny Depp Logan's Run and The Island. They are all excellent movies and works of art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound and entranced for the duration of their runtime.But after seeing The Fellowship of the Ring I knew I had found the movie by which I would judge all other movies. Based on J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved books Peter Jackson has set a new standard in the industry of cinema one that I honestly think has not and won't be surpassed at least not in my lifetime not even by PJ himself.It is truly an instant classic that will stand the test of time and be loved by generations to come. God Bless Tolkien and Jackson and everyone involved in the conception and making of this film for creating a world that is at my fingertips only takes the touch of a button to go to whenever I want and makes me forget everything else.The LOTR Trilogy is undoubtedly MY precious the non plus ultra of all movies!";

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw the trailers for The Fellowship of the Ring I had never had any interest in reading the lengthy tome of a trilogy.  But seeing the possibility of the movie I immediately went out and read the whole thing insisted on receiving it for Christmas and enjoyed every minute of it. The feelings I had while reading the series were heightened seeing it come to life in the stunning movie.  I thought it was a fabulous work of art.I thought that having Galadriel tell what was basically the prologue of the book was a good idea as it helped those who had never read the story.  It also immediately involved me in the film I felt I had an insider's advantage on the rest of the audience.  Cate Blanchett has a wonderfully deep and emotional voice the way she speaks Galadriel is almost as effective as her appearence as the Elven queen.  Also showing the last battle of Isildur and Sauron helped unfog a part of the novel that had me a trifle confused.The entire movie is full of beautiful sets and landscapes.  The Shire was almost exactly as I'd pictured it.  Hobbiton is cute and very whimsical. Mordor was frighteningly well done extremely real.  Rivendell had a little bit of a Europeantouristtrap look but was beautiful all the same.  The entire backdrop of the movie the mountains Moria Isengard was perfect it's amazing that Fellowship was filmed in one country.Now to the characters.  All I can say is Wow.  I was a little apprehensive about the casting at first I'd created such real images of the characters in my imagination I almost didn't want them spoiled for me. However I was not disapointed in the least.  Elijah Wood though not one of my favorite actors was believable.  You could tell from the first glimpse that Frodo was special Wood's pale sharp features contrast sharply with the more ruddy robust look of the rest of the hobbits.  He also cries like a little girl.  But his weaknesses and strengths make his Frodo an apt choice for the starring character.  The rest of the Hobbiton gang was wellchosen too.  Sean Astin Rudy forever to me was loyal and a bit bumbling just like the Gamgee of Tolkien's telling.  Pippin and Merry were congenial slowwitted lads but very brave nonetheless.  Viggo Mortensen is outstanding.  He has the ability to make Aragorn both menacing and kind. He physically represents Strider to the nines with his strength and virility the action sequences of his are very passionate and exciting.  Some may have complained about Arwen's character being slightly expanded I thought it a good change.  In the books you have to read the whole trilogy and then rifle through the appendix in The Return of the King to learn the history between Aragorn and Arwen.  Liv Tyler is ethereal and breathtaking but at the same time displays the courage and magic that make the Elves the beings they are.  Speaking of Elves I can't help but gush over the handsome and eversotalented Orlando Bloom as noble Legolas.  Bloom captured the archer's very movements he treads lightly and fights fearlessly. Legolas's bowmanship was amazing he looked so natural loosing his arrows machinegun style.  He was my favorite character in the books and his essence transcends the film.  Gimli was pompous and brave as well.  He is wellrepresented in the movie.  Boromir was hopelessly lost but at the same time valiant and strong.  Sean Bean gave an emotionallycharged performance as the tortured warrior.  Hugo Weaving was very good as Elrond.  He was noble and cold at the same time.  And Gandalf.  What more can be said of Ian McKellan's showcase portrayal of the wizard?  He was magnificent.  He could be Gandalf the kind old conjurer who set off pyrotechnics for hobbitchildren.  Then he could turn around and stun the life out of you with Gandalf the powerful wizard facing the balrog with defiance and an iron will.  His Oscar nomination is welldeserved.Peter Jackson is a brave soul to take on a project that could have backfired in so many places.  Instead of bringing us uninspired kitsch he serves up raw emotion graphic battles of good and evil chilling and wonderful characters and enough special effects realistic mind you to make John Cameron's mouth water.  Knowing that The Two Towers was my favorite of the books I eagerly anticipate the second helping of The Lord of the Rings.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Lord of the Rings' is one of my favorite books I have read it several times and remember thinking the last time about 3 years ago that if I made a film I'd want to make it of this but wouldn't it be almost impossible. You can then imagine how strong my expectations were when I went to see the eagerly awaited first installment.This film impressed me hugely more than anything else because of how true it was to my imagination both in the characters as well as in the effects and setting a sentiment I have heard consistently from other fans of the books. Elijah Wood brought across the character of Frodo with the kind of haunted frail courage that Tolkien captures so well in the books. Nor could I find any fault at all with Ian McKellan's Gandalf Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn and Sean Bean's Boromir all of whom I thought were portrayed excellently. I could pick out instances where I did think 'no that's not right' however their seldomness in number would only serve to illustrate the excellence of the overall portrayal. One thing that did stand out for me was Cate Blanchett's performance as Galadriel the part itself became so perfunctory in the film that to me her alternation between benevolent seer and figure of potential terror seemed little more than a slightly confusing detour with no real connection into the plot other than as a vehicle for a glimpse into the future. But that was it.I thought that the points where Jackson did deviate from the text were completely the correct ones to do so. Shortening the opening Shire scenes and cutting out the whole Tom Bombadil bit was great since frankly they bored me slightly in the book anyway. Also expanding the role of Arwen was a sensible decision.However this film is by no means above criticism. The dialogue was in my opinion terrible and purely there to drive on the plot. Normally this would ruin a film for me as in The Matrix making it almost intolerable to view however fortunately here it proves little more than a minor irritation. Also the film seemed overall to be excessively plotdriven and at times a mad dash from one action scene to another the characters for all their truth to the book did seem flat and sometimes little more than stereotypical fantasy characters. This is perhaps my major quarrel with the film I would have liked these characters to have come alive as people in a way that was made impossible by the sparseness of the script and the rollercoaster nature of the plot. In general the whole film lacked the depth of context that I think distinguishes Tolkien from other fantasy writers. However to have achieved this would have required a very different movie and you can't fault an action film for being an action film.This movie is undoubtedly not for everyone. A lot of people just don't get fantasy other than Lord of the Rings I don't particularly either. However in my opinion Jackson really has made an incredible achievement his and Tolkien's vision carried through suberbly by a breathtaking setting and stunning special effects as well as by a cast clearly as enthralled as he was. He has taken on a huge task and is dealing with it with breathtaking success. Check for other user comments.".

Although George Lucas' movies are good in their own right except for the juvenile elements he puts in to sell toys to finance the franchise his scripts which borrow heavily from J.R.R.Tolkien mythology  religion can't compare with the brilliance of the literary trilogy The Lord of the Rings'.  Granted Lucas took on a herculean task in writing  directing his story himself but Tolkien's words along with Peter Jackson's faithful adaptation  inspired vision have created something no one man could equal. Of course it helps that Jackson insisted on at least a 2 picture deal  New Line Cinema was brave enough to foot the bill up front for 3 movies. They spent 180 million to film all 3 simultaneously.  With the New Zealand exchange rate that equals 360 million 90 million ea. but since they used many of the same sets and FX development costs were spread throughout we're seeing 120150 million on the screen.  This will ensure consistency in plot casting tone etc.In 3 hours Jackson has crammed everything essential from the first novel  then some into the film rewriting some scenes  dialogue with lesser characters for the leads leaving out only what there wasn't enough time for.  Basically you have two 90 min. movies running back to back.  There are no slow spots just one climax after another.  From the opening 10 min. backstory where the Dark Lord Sauron is shown on the battlefield wiping out men  elves 10 at a time with each swing of his mace I was blown away.  The romance between Aragorn king in exile and Arwen daughter of the elflord is played up for the Titanic quotient but it's well done. The story sets costumes  FX are so rich you'll have to see the film several times to absorb everything.  The unspoiled New Zealand locales are spectacular providing a variety of environments to represent the different settings on the characters' journey.  The location sets are imaginative detailed  weathered adding to their believability while the studio sets match them in meticulousness.  The costumes are at once familiar  strange drawing on both the medievil  the fantastic but more important they're also functional  practical.  The music by Howard Shore is appropriately sweeping Celtic  folky in keeping with the novel although it lacks the memorable themes of John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith but neither would commit a year or more to a 3 picture project.  The FX are as they should be unobtrusive  unnoticed most of the time there only to support the story not draw attention away from it as in most Hollywood movies which try to coverup illogical plots  bad acting. I'm particularly gratified by the casting of Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn which was a last minute stroke of luck when the actor first chosen for the part backed out due to differences with the director.  I've always thought Mortenson had an intensity  striking but not prettyboy looks that could portray a flawed dangerous hero instead of the villains Hollywood always picked him for.A stellar cast giving some of their best performances visuals that deliver beyond what I imagined a perfect mix of humor passion  tragedy and a feeling of grandeur scope  impending doom.  Perhaps as an ensemble piece with so many characters  the inability to concentrate on any one it can't be measured against some of the classic character study films but even the casual moviegoer can grasp the ideas  not get lost  As far as I'm concerned it's one of the greatest films of all time.".

But what can be reiterated is that The Fellowship of the Ring is an outstanding piece of filmmaking.Where do you start when reviewing a film the size of Lord of the Rings? J.R.R. Tolkein's seminal masterwork long considered unfilmable has made it on to the screen thanks to visionary director Peter Jackson. The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of the three books of the trilogy. Everyone has their favourite of the three and this one is probably mine. Unrivalled in its size and scale by virtually any other film with new groundbreaking special and digital effects a stunning musical score universally superb acting and most importantly a superb story.The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of the epic trilogy that tells of the quest of a hobbit to destroy an evil ring of power. He is aided in his quest by his friends and other companions who accompany him and protect him on his journey. Many threats face him on his long journey both from the world around him and from his companions who could be tempted by the power of the ring he has set out to destroy. It is a tale of magic and fantasy swords and sorcery but it is not simply for teens who enjoy dungeons and dragons games. It is accessible to everyone. By turns exciting frightening funny and sad it is a true masterpiece in terms of storytelling encompassing the full spectrum of emotions.The acting is superb from the entire cast and it is unfathomable as to how the Academy overlooked the acting entirely for all three films when dishing out awards and nominations. However the performances from Ian McKellan Viggo Mortensen Sean Astin Elijah Wood and Sean Bean are all so good it would have possibly been greatly unfair to single any one out for an award.The film also contains some groundbreaking computergenerated special effects and some positively genius scale work. Due to hobbits being only about 3 feet tall some clever scale work was needed in order to ensure that John RhysDavies a dwarf in the film but over 6 feet tall in real life did in fact look the height of a dwarf. This was done through clever use of forced perspectives scale doubles giant sets and blue screen filming. However the most impressive use of computer effects lies later in the trilogy with the appearance of Gollum  cinema's first liveaction character who is completely computer generated. The music is also beautiful and Howard Shore has created possibly the most iconic and memorable score since John Williams' Star Wars.Peter Jackson has until Lord of the Rings been seen as a director outside of the mainstream but his superb careerdefining work on the Lord of the Rings trilogy has seen him well and truly propelled him to the forefront of Hollywood. He has redefined the epic film with unparalleled success and created films that will definitely stand the test of time to one day be thought of with the same reverence as the Star Wars and Godfather trilogies.A major milestone in cinema history the trilogy would eventually gain seventeen Oscars between the three films. Lord of the Rings is a master class in storytelling and essential viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Peter Jackson set out to make movies which the author of the Lord of the Rings trilogy J.R.R. Tolkien would have endorsed. All three were resounding successes though because of the film medium they necessarily varied from Tolkien's storyline. Purists may have issues with Jackson's theatrical license but as someone who has read Tolkien's books several times and seen the films 45 times each I never felt that Jackson went too far or compromised Tolkien's story the mythology he developed or the wonderful characters he brought to life. Many have said what Jackson did could not be done. He has not only proved the naysayers wrong but lovingly crafted a set of films which will for many decades to come stand out as a great achievement. This is the first of three reviews I am publishing on IMDb for these films. I am labeling them Parts 1 2 and 3 just in case anybody wants to read them in order. The reviews will be selfcontained but will also be enhanced by a chronological reading. My reviews will focus on the extended edition DVDs though my comments are also relevant to the theatrical releases.The Fellowship of the Ring introduces the key characters and the broad story arc of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Wizard Gandalf the Grey travels to a small town for small people Hobbitsto help celebrate Bilbo Baggins' birthday. The very elderly Baggins doesn't look a day over 45 and soon it becomes apparent why. Since the great adventure of his life a quest he was sent on by Gandalf himself he has possessed the most powerful object in all of Middle Earth  The One Ring. This ring is evil incarnate with an insatiable lust for power it taints every creature who possesses it and tries to work its way back to its creator  Dark Lord Sauron. Bilbo uses the ring to disappear as he intends to spend his senescence with his friends the Elves in Rivendell. But activating the ring he draws the attention of Lord Sauron from thousands of miles away in the land of Mordor. Realizing what has occurred Gandalf scrambles to determine a course of action and recruits Bilbo's nephew Frodo and his loyal gardener Samwise to bear the ring to the Council of Elrond in Rivendell. Thusly the seeds of the fellowship are planted in the soil of the Shire.At this point we are about 16th of the way through The Fellowship. Fairly soon thereafter it becomes clear who will compose the fellowship and who and what these people are. Though the succeeding films are not entitled Fellowship they follow the adventures of the surviving central characters. Characterization is done just as Tolkien did it in the original novel  by example not discourse. For example we are given hints to the identity of Strider Mortenson earlier on in the movie than in the novel but the actual significance of this remains ambiguous until about midway through. Strong characterization is key to the success of the entire trilogy. To summarize Peter Jackson his team and cast  NAIL the characterization. The casting and acting is perfect. It is very difficult to resist the temptation to single out Mortenson and McKellen for carrying their difficult roles so well StriderAragorn and Gandalf but why risk diminishing the contributions of the rest of the cast? Nobody missteps and it is clear from the beginning that the entire cast was thoroughly and completed engaged with the task before them.Tolkien believed that no film would ever do his work justice and until this trilogy he was correct.Peter Jackson and his team have managed to do exactly what they set out to. As Jackson himself has said in reference to the film trilogy they set out to 'make Tolkien's film.' Jackson successfully drew out elements of all three books expanding and contracting rearranging and sometimes adding whole subplots which are hinted at in the books but not well explained in order to adopt the grand story to the film medium. Arwen Liv Tyler daughter of Elrond and Elven lover of Aragorn for example is introduced early in the films and plays a role in the films which is much more equal to her significance than it was in the books.The Howard Shore score is lovely and its simple themes are used to great effect throughout all three movies. The musical collaborations improvising on Shore's basic themes are great and though they feature some prominent performers  are never weighed down by starpower.Jackson made all three movies simultaneously. This technique allowed for perfect continuity and permitted much greater flexibility in editing and postproduction work than would normally be allowed. Knowing that he would need to establish and support his own fellowship to make this production work he also knew that success would make the production legendary. So he documented the creation of the films beautifully. Two complete DVDs full of documentary pieces are included in all three Special Edition Packages in the trilogy. Many are likely to be bored by the details in these documentaries but those interested in the creative process behind the films will be provided with a more comprehensive view than I can remember ever seeing in any similar DVD package. The Fellowship of the Rings is as true a representation of Tolkien's novel as can be imagined. Although some aspects of the stories in the novel were adapted to the screen the essentials the characters and the overall story are not just recognizable but ENHANCED by the film. What results is a film that is not just entertaining but an enormous fulfillment of an undying wish of millions of fans around the world.Very highly recommended.".

FOTR did everything every other fantasy film should have done it had fantastic creatures and beings that had previously only appeared in my dreams and my imagination.  Jackson did a tremendous job making tangible what I previously had to visualize by reading the books. Without getting too specific and spoiling the ending my only critique of the movie was that it was a little anticlimatic.  Then again the book was also anticlimatic because it was the first part of a trilogy.I would also like to comment about how many people have compared Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone to this film.  My advice is to see them both don't compare them and enjoy the each as the great stories they are.This is one of those movies that I will watch over and over again and never get tired of.  It wasn't boring.  It didn't lack action.  It wasn't overhyped.  The acting was good.  And those that said it had too many Scenery shots should consider Doctor Zhivago...it was 4 hours of trains and snow but still a classic! Give this movie a shot and enjoy it for what it is the visualization of a classic tale.".

I had never read the books upon seeing the film and was a little sceptical about what many people were claiming that it would change the way films were made.  Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring has become my favorite movie of all time.  And I have seen a lot of freaking movies.Every aspect of the film works.  The cast works their respective roles to perfection with Ian McKellenGandalf Elijah WoodFrodo Viggo MortensenAragorn Sean BeanBoromir and Sean AstinSam being the standouts.  From the epic prologue of the film you realize that there is a great epic journey ahead of you.  And along the way you meet and care for every single character in the film.Director Peter Jackson has really crafted a beautiful piece of work that will be remembered for ages.  It's a perfect balance of action and great character moments.  Character development is not sacrificed for more action like so many other films of its like.  There are many moments of the film that make you realize this is more than just your typical fantasy film moments that transcend filmmaking and have a profound effect on you. The last 30 minutes are particularly powerful and moving.Basically this film is an epic incredible experience.  A film that will be looked at years down the road as a great piece of filmmaking.  If you're a fan of good fantasy or if you're just a fan of great movies you'll love this film plain and simple.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Lord of the Rings' is one of my favorite books I have read it several times and remember thinking the last time about 3 years ago that if I made a film I'd want to make it of this but wouldn't it be almost impossible. You can then imagine how strong my expectations were when I went to see the eagerly awaited first installment. This film impressed me hugely more than anything else because of how true it was to my imagination both in the characters as well as in the effects and setting a sentiment I have heard consistently from other fans of the books. Elijah Wood brought across the character of Frodo with the kind of haunted frail courage that Tolkien captures so well in the books. Nor could I find any fault at all with Ian McKellan's Gandalf Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn and Sean Bean's Boromir all of whom I thought were portrayed excellently. I could pick out instances where I did think 'no that's not right' however their seldomness in number would only serve to illustrate the excellence of the overall portrayal. One thing that did stand out for me was Cate Blanchett's performance as Galadriel the part itself became so perfunctory in the film that to me her alternation between benevolent seer and figure of potential terror seemed little more than a slightly confusing detour with no real connection into the plot other than as a vehicle for a glimpse into the future. But that was it.I thought that the points where Jackson did deviate from the text were completely the correct ones to do so. Shortening the opening Shire scenes and cutting out the whole Tom Bombadil bit was great since frankly they bored me slightly in the book anyway. Also expanding the role of Arwen was a sensible decision. However this film is by no means above criticism. The dialogue was in my opinion terrible and purely there to drive on the plot. Normally this would ruin a film for me as in The Matrix making it almost intolerable to view however fortunately here it proves little more than a minor irritation. Also the film seemed overall to be excessively plotdriven and at times a mad dash from one action scene to another the characters for all their truth to the book did seem flat and sometimes little more than stereotypical fantasy characters. This is perhaps my major quarrel with the film I would have liked these characters to have come alive as people in a way that was made impossible by the sparseness of the script and the rollercoaster nature of the plot. In general the whole film lacked the depth of context that I think distinguishes Tolkien from other fantasy writers. However to have achieved this would have required a very different movie and you can't fault an action film for being an action film. This movie is undoubtedly not for everyone. A lot of people just don't get fantasy other than Lord of the Rings I don't particularly either. However in my opinion Jackson really has made an incredible achievement his and Tolkien's vision carried through suberbly by a breathtaking setting and stunning special effects as well as by a cast clearly as enthralled as he was. He has taken on a huge task and is dealing with it with breathtaking success.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've never been a fan of the sword and sorcery genre . I'm surprised film companies decide to make rubbish like THE BEASTMASTER HAWK THE SLAYER and RED SONJA but I am aware of the popularity of JRR Tolkien's massive novel LORD OF THE RINGS and of it's popularity  I remember in a survey carried out by a very well known British fantasySF magazine in 1987 Tolkien's book was voted the greatest fantasy novel of all time  THE STAND by Stephen King was a long way second   but it's a novel that has always struck me as being read by anoraks who  like fans of STAR TREK and STAR WARS  insist on reading subtexts that are just not there . When the THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS shot to number one in the IMDb top 250 films I put the popularity down to obsessed anorakish fans who were going to vote the film a classic no matter what . Stranger still I found groups as diverse as neo Nazis to gays to enviromentalists proclaiming  This is our film  so when I finally sat down to watch TFOTR I was expecting only some average entertainment for a non sad person with no political axe to grind . After seeing the film I had to admit THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a masterpiece .Much of the credit must go to the producers . I 've no idea of the politics about bringing the story to the silver screen but I can imagine the Hollywood bigwigs sitting around the commitee table saying  Give us Tom  give us Nicole  get Harrison  get Leonardo . No limeys . Limeys are slimy . No limey accents . We're Americans  this is our baby  to which the producers gave a firm and resounding  No  . Good for them because the Hollywood treatment would have ruined this film. The cast comprised of well known  but not megastar  actors and unknowns are uniformally excellent even the normally hammy Lee and Rhys Davis and the bland Tyler are good . Also great to see so many Brits playing good guys and having the American actors adopting non specific British accents .The cast do a good jobThe other production values are outstanding . Pride of place goes to Andrew Lesnie's cinematography where the camera sweeps down from the sky into the Orcs underground lair and the camera also shows off the stunning New Zealand landscapes . I'd always believed Scotland had the greatest scenery on Earth but I'm willing to change my mind . The FX are good throughout though perhaps the matte backgrounds and CGI are less impressive in places but they're still a lot better than we've been used to recently . The Orc make up is wonderful and helps them become classic cinema monsters . The only bad point about the Orcs is  Like the stormtroopers in STAR WARS  they're too easy to kill .There are some minor flaws to THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS but this is probably down to Tolkien's source novel rather than the film makers . A couple of times the heroes seem set to suffer a resounding defeat when something not obvious at first like flammable villains or a giant eagle saves the day . I guess this is cancelled out by the dangers and adversaries also appearing from nowhere and there's little female perspective in the story for the women in the audience to relate to but come on girls you've got Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean acting all hunky and macho so you can't complain.I see the IMDb reviewers have started a backlash against FOTR like they did with TITANIC and GLADIATOR . They're right about the gawd awful rubbish that is TITANIC but they're wrong about GLADIATOR which is a very good film and even further wrong about THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING which is a cinematic masterpiece. Ignore their criticisms . Any film that is praised by people as diverse as fans of the book  people who have never read the book  enviromentalists and cynics like myself is worth your time watching . I'm really looking forward to THE TWO TOWERS".

	schema:reviewBody "The reason why this first part of Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' is superior to his latter two parts is because of restraint. Jackson was restrained from over doing it with the CGI and epic battle sequences which in my opinion does not make a story epic. Part of the reason was simply because Tolkien did not have very many battles in the first part of his book which thankfully forced Jackson to focus on creating a believable world rather than a believable hacknslash action movie.I don't find much entertainment in watching people mutilate each other but I love it when a movie engages me in a world and 'The Fellowship of the Ring' does just that. Certainly the most breathtaking scenes in the movie are the moments of patient observation when the camera pans around and captures the beautiful settings of Middle Earth. I must give Jackson credit. He did hire some very extraordinary artists that have envisioned one of the grandest interpretations of Tolkien's world.There are about five particular moments that stick out in my mind and gave me that tingle of goosebumps down my spine when I saw them for the first time. The first is the introduction to Hobbiton. After the somewhat awkward prologue I was beginning to have my doubts to whether the movie would live up to the book. But the movie surprised me. Hobbiton is perfect. The houses have flower patches and old fences the roads look worn and made through decades of travel and the Old Mill spins with the laziness of a quiet town. Every color is vibrant and every moment looks as through it was taken out of a picture book. Although I still don't agree with the particular look of the Hobbits I believe everything else in Hobbiton is worthy of Tolkien's words.The second moment comes after Frodo's awakening in Rivendell and the third during the exploration of the Halls of Moria. In both moments the camera pans away from the characters and outward into a static shot of their surroundings. The moments make us feel like we're turning our heads and gazing at the world around us just as the characters do. The golden waterfalls of the elven city mark an interesting contrast with the dark halls of the dwarfish mines but each are inspiring in their own ways and add to feeling of being engaged in a living world.My other favorite moments come during the exploration of Lothlorien and the passage down the Anduin. And while I won't go into detail about the scenes since they really should be experienced without any prior expectations they are monuments in imaginative cinema. 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is one of those rare movies that I always wish I could reexperience for the first time. Unfortunately Jackson turned away from exploring Middle Earth in his next two movies and instead turned to fighting and warfare. He seems to take a lot of pride in the love story and battle sequences he created in 'The Two Towers' and 'The Return of the King' but it is was in his first movie when he really got it right. In 'The Fellowship of the Ring' it's okay if the characters are uninteresting and have silly dialogue. Middle Earth is the star and the characters are the ones seeing it for the first time.".

The film moves quickly with a few slow spotsbut that's to get in the plot and there's a lot to take in but I was never confused.  I should mention that I tried twice to read the books but found them too hard.The film looks magicalMiddle Earth looks beautifully real.  All the special effects are great the Ring Wraiths are downright terrifyingas they should be and the action sequences are among the best I've ever seenfast long and breathtaking.  The film is long 2 hrs 40 min but the time flies by.  The only problem is that there's so much plot and action going on that you're exhausted by the endbut in a good way.With the exception of Viggo Mortensen very wooden all the actors are goodtop honors go to Elijah Wood Dominic Monaghan Cate Blanchett Liv Tyler and especially Ian McKellan.But the film is VERY violent despite the PG13 rating.  It deserves an Rthis is NOT one for the kids.  Still it's the best film of 2001.  SEE IT!!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "...I wasn't sure anyone would have ever guessed except in a 2004 Fangoria magazine article written by Mexican visionary Guillermo del Toro that New Zealand native Peter Jackson the director behind the goriest movie ever made 1992's Dead Alive would have been behind the epic threefilm installment of The Lord of the Rings saga which include The Fellowship of the Ring 2001 The Two Towers 2002 and Best Picture Oscarwinner The Return of the King 2003.Note This comment applies to all three movies as it will be posted at each individual web page.Not since Star Wars has this much hype surrounded films of this magnitude. But I guess such hype exists because J.R.R. Tolkien's books have one of the largest devoted fanbases of any popular reading material. I've never read Tolkien's original books though several readers as well as fans of the movies have told me such knowledge is not required when viewing The Lord of the Rings films. The Lord of the Rings is the biggest movie I've ever seen and there's a whole lot of story 12 hours to be exact and I've spent the last two days viewing the extended versions of all three movies and they are breathtaking. There are many dazzling special effects shots over the course of the trilogy and epic battle sequences to put you in awe many of which in my view do push the limits of the PG13 rating not because it's action but because of how precise Jackson's direction is and how unflinching the camera becomes when it's time for battle. The rousing epic score by Howard Shore helps the viewer get into Jackson's vision of Middleearth and into the characters and onscreen action. Jackson has also breathtakingly transformed his New Zealand homeland into Tolkien's Middleearth and when you watch these movies you feel like you're really there with the rest of its inhabitants. It is also pretty frightening too with many jump scenes including the frequent and violent battle sequences between our heroes and The Enemy who include the brutish Orcs Moria Orcs Ringwraiths and the unreal entity Sauron. And lastly the cast does much more than bring the action to life but instead live live is italicized their parts. Of course I'm talking about the young Hobbits Frodo Elijah Wood and Sam Sean Astin who come into possession of the ancient One Ring and must journey to the hellish land Mordor to cast the talisman into a river of lava and bring its reign of evil to an end. Along the way two other Hobbits Merry Dominic Monaghan and Pippin Billy Boyd necromancer Gandalf Sir Ian McKellen warrior Aragorn Viggo Mortensen Boromir Sean Bean elf Legalos Orlando Bloom and dwarf Gimli John RhysDavies aid them in their quest  together as a fellowship of the ring. There are also plenty of other fantastic supporting roles from Cate Blanchett Ian Holm Christopher Lee Liv Tyler Hugo Weaving Agent Smith plays a good guy and Andy Serkis as the voice of the evercreepy Gollum. I think J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud of Peter Jackson's take on his material despite comments I've heard his son has made in undermining the director's vision. Someone once called The Lord of the Rings the greatest fantasy epic ever made they were right.1010".

I love the scenes where they get to fight whether Orcs or Nazgul the fighting scenes are still the climax of the movie.Another good movie to see after FOTR is TTT of course. It is the second part of this great trilogy and there are more climatic scenes. Most probably you'll enjoy that more than FOTR but don't shun this movie just because it's a bit lengthy.Overall it's a great movie to see and it is really worth spending the money to buyrent the extendedspecial DVD to watch too.

	schema:reviewBody "There's a very obvious problem when transferring any book to the big screen namely that some of us may already have seen it. It's not that the story holds no surprises save for the occasional controversies that surround the fate of characters like Hannibal Lecter it's just that many of us have already read the book and thus we've already directed our own version of the story. We've already seen it in our mind's eye. And this is the problem that plagues The Fellowship of The Ring. You'll see a lot of reviews here proclaiming it as nothing short of the second coming of cinema and a few that dare to knock its serious shortcomings. Let me clear this up right now. The first issue that many may raise is that this is not a faithful adaptation of the book. Quite right while taking pains to ensure that they stayed faithful to the novel Jackson et al have not simply been able to lift their screenplay directly from its pages without a few necessary changes. There is a great deal of mindfulness in the film about the portion of the audience and it will be large who are unfamiliar with the novels.Accordingly a great deal more emphasis has been placed upon pacing and storytelling more appropriate to a classic film narrative. Hence we need to see Gandalf's protracted bid to escape the clutches of Isenguard interspersed with the Hobbit's journey to Rivendell. It simply isn't appropriate to expect an audience to bear with the Hobbits' journey no matter how good the actors are or how enthralling the story is for upwards of an hour without constant reminders of the films other protagonists OR the threat of the evil they face. Having Gandalf just turn up at Rivendell and tell his story via CGIfilled flashbacks simply wouldn't have had the necessary effect. Secondly the omission and reworking of characters. Yes it was sad that Bakshi felt his animation didn't need Tom Bombadill and given that he features strongly in Tolkien's other works this has to be frowned upon by the diehard fanatics but introducing diverting but ultimately pointless episodes into the list of the challenges the Hobbits face is hardly going to keep you riveted to your seat is it? I mean a man who stops the Hobbits being eaten very slowly by a tree with his power of song is just quite frankly ludicrous in this day and age. The film is already stretching the audience's suspension of disbelief as far as it can go. Hence the chaff of Bombadill is cut. He isn't relevant to the rest of the story so he can be done without. It's sad for Tolkien fans for him not to be there but there's only so much celluloid available even with a film this long. And yes Arwen Undomiel never saved Frodo from the Dark Riders but please remember your girlfriend needs to have something to sink her teeth into as well not just midgets and men with beards looking mean or scared as they fight monsters. So for gender representation and a bid to prevent half the potential market please remember that like all film this is a product to be packaged and sold her character gets a drastic overhaul. Go sister! There are numerous other issues relevant to the faithfulness of the adaptation from novel to screenplay but please let's be content with what we've got here. It's a hard task to do all this well and Jackson along with the rest of the boys and girls at Wingnut and WETA should be commended for what they have achieved. That said there are some definite flaws in the film even those that can't be overlooked by justifying the needs to relate to the popcorn and nachos audience. Firstly we've got the Fellowship itself. Now Merry and Pippin while not really being established as Frodo's friends and thus not having the same kind of bond with him as they do in the novel are moderately well integrated. However at the arrival of Boromir Gimili and Legolas we just get left in the dark. None of these three characters all representing important races cultures and locations of the world of Middle Earth are given no more than token arrivalshots to introduce them and little or no backstory as to how they came to be where they are or why they feel compelled to join Frodo's quest. Offering their various weapons is noble and it sounds fantastic in the trailer but when we finally get down to it we just don't know who they are or what they're about. Accordingly we don't ever really have time to care about any of these three save for Legolas whose fighting proficiency alone makes him stand out. Sadly Sean Bean is allowed little more than to switch from foreboding bad guy to friendly companion and back again thus betraying his characters ultimate fate from the first time he opens his mouth and John Rhys Davis is left with little more to do than scowl and look short. It doesn't help that both these characters seem to get a pretty raw deal for screen time especially Gimli who is barely in the film at all. We won't even begin to go into the seemingly superficial relationship we see between Sam and Frodo. All of this is indeed a shame. The film's greatest strength after its story are its strong characters. However whereas in the book they have the space to develop and flesh themselves out here they have little more to do than look in awe at Gandalf perhaps not with a humble air so much as a wonder that he's being allowed to soak up all the screen time. And yes what you've heard is true the fight sequences are shockingly bad. Well perhaps that IS an overstatement. The fight sequences aren't exactly bad they're riddled with good ideas and clever moves but the camerawork and editing is so erratic that you'll have a hard time picking out anything to inspire awe or respect. The problem here is that the benchmarks for on screen fighting have all been established nowadays by The Matrix Crouching Tiger and The Phantom Menace and all of these films use lengthy shots to allow us to soak up the fight imaginative fight choreography rather than have us crane our necks and dart about the screen with our eyeballs trying to glimpse it like a rare bird or nippleflash at a premiere. Now these yet again are only a few of the problems. There's the geography of Middle Earth some ropey special effects moments and the clumsy ending to deal with. But you can read the books and see the film for yourself I've already typed enough about all that here. BUT now that I've just spent the main chunk of this review telling you about the shortcomings of The Fellowship of the Rings as both a movie and an adaptation let me tell you it is good exceptionally good. There is no denying that the storyline itself acting effects props sets and so on and so forth are all spot on. Visually the film is a triumph and WETA has now without question placed itself ahead of Industrial Light and Magic in terms of industry leading special effects. There are bags of style to proceedings with some sequences displaying the sheer amount of vision of the whole team to bring somewhat vague sections of the novel to life.All parts are played to perfection by the cast and the casting is literally some of the best and most appropriate seen in years none of this whohotandwho'snot Jerry Bruckheimer trash it's a case of the best possible person for the part at every stage of the film. We'll give particular credit to Sir Ian Mckellan Christopher Lee Ian Holm and Elijah Wood again here. No doubt they've had scores of favourable and loving reviews already but these performances truly are worth mentioning just once again. The film is a masterpiece from start to finish. Yes it does take perseverance no it's not entirely faithful to Tolkien's work and there are some serious flaws but in a year that has been so barren of even five decent mainstream movies I think it's safe to say that no matter when this film had been released it would have outshone its competitors.".

None of these three characters all representing important races cultures and locations of the world of Middle Earth are given no more than token arrivalshots to introduce them and little or no backstory as to how they came to be where they are or why they feel compelled to join Frodo's quest. Offering their various weapons is noble and it sounds fantastic in the trailer but when we finally get down to it we just don't know who they are or what they're about. Accordingly we don't ever really have time to care about any of these three save for Legolas whose fighting proficiency alone makes him stand out. Sadly Sean Bean is allowed little more than to switch from foreboding bad guy to friendly companion and back again thus betraying his characters ultimate fate from the first time he opens his mouth and John Rhys Davis is left with little more to do than scowl and look short. It doesn't help that both these characters seem to get a pretty raw deal for screen time especially Gimli who is barely in the film at all. We won't even begin to go into the seemingly superficial relationship we see between Sam and Frodo. All of this is indeed a shame. The film's greatest strength after its story are its strong characters. However whereas in the book they have the space to develop and flesh themselves out here they have little more to do than look in awe at Gandalf perhaps not with a humble air so much as a wonder that he's being allowed to soak up all the screen time. And yes what you've heard is true the fight sequences are shockingly bad. Well perhaps that IS an overstatement. The fight sequences aren't exactly bad they're riddled with good ideas and clever moves but the camerawork and editing is so erratic that you'll have a hard time picking out anything to inspire awe or respect. The problem here is that the benchmarks for on screen fighting have all been established nowadays by The Matrix Crouching Tiger and The Phantom Menace and all of these films use lengthy shots to allow us to soak up the fight imaginative fight choreography rather than have us crane our necks and dart about the screen with our eyeballs trying to glimpse it like a rare bird or nippleflash at a premiere. Now these yet again are only a few of the problems. There's the geography of Middle Earth some ropey special effects moments and the clumsy ending to deal with. But you can read the books and see the film for yourself I've already typed enough about all that here. BUT now that I've just spent the main chunk of this review telling you about the shortcomings of The Fellowship of the Rings as both a movie and an adaptation let me tell you it is good exceptionally good. There is no denying that the storyline itself acting effects props sets and so on and so forth are all spot on. Visually the film is a triumph and WETA has now without question placed itself ahead of Industrial Light and Magic in terms of industry leading special effects. There are bags of style to proceedings with some sequences displaying the sheer amount of vision of the whole team to bring somewhat vague sections of the novel to life.All parts are played to perfection by the cast and the casting is literally some of the best and most appropriate seen in years none of this whohotandwho'snot Jerry Bruckheimer trash it's a case of the best possible person for the part at every stage of the film. We'll give particular credit to Sir Ian Mckellan Christopher Lee Ian Holm and Elijah Wood again here. No doubt they've had scores of favourable and loving reviews already but these performances truly are worth mentioning just once again. The film is a masterpiece from start to finish. Yes it does take perseverance no it's not entirely faithful to Tolkien's work and there are some serious flaws but in a year that has been so barren of even five decent mainstream movies I think it's safe to say that no matter when this film had been released it would have outshone its competitors.";

	schema:reviewBody "For those of you like myself who are fans of the books of the same nameyou will not be disappointed by this movie. Unlike the animated versions that have previously been made where much of the story was condensed either for budgetary constraints or time limits the Fellowship of the Ring while it does take a few shortcuts there are very few. It is very exciting getting to see places that up until now have been purely figments of my imagination portrayed by someones elses imagination on the silver screen. I felt myself holding my breath waiting to see the various locations of middle earth and how others have dreamed of them. The movie does a breathtaking job in transporting the viewer to this other world and does so with magic good enough to be from the hand of Gandalf himself. Yes there are places where for dramatic reasons or to prevent a lengthy historical context that certain events from the book were either shortened modified or changed. These changes however do not change the storyline itself and makes for a very entertaining movie. I do feel however that if you are one of the uninitiated it would serve you to either read the book before going or immediately after the film pick up a copy and read it as it will provide more breadth to the story than what an almost three hour film can portray. In addition there are several scenes in the book that while not central to the main story add more to the lore of middle earth and help to explain some of the history leading up to the time of the story. The characterizations in the film were very well done and the choices of the actors to play the hobbits were perfect. While I was somewhat anxious to have Elijah Wood as Frodo and Sean Astin as Samwise after seeing how well they were portrayed on film left me no doubt that these actors did a very admirable job bringing the characters to life. The majority of the cast has some English accent which was my main concern. Both the principle American actors portrayed a passable English type accent themselves which helped prevent them standing out on their own. How the filmmakers made several average height men such as Wood and Astin and probably more so John Rhys Davies as Gimli appear much smaller than their Elvish or human companions is spellbinding. Special effects in this movie while at first don't really seem to be that obvious eventually take on a more obvious tone as the fellowship moves further into the adventure. As one would expect from a magical world many things which we take for granted from reading the books are very difficult to accurately portray in a live action presentation. The filmmakers not only did a good job they surpassed by far my expectations and truly made the experience an enjoyable and fulfilling one. As with any film where there will be sequels coming out the ending left me longing for December 2002 to follow our adventurers further on their quest.I will caution parents who are thinking of taking their children to see this movie that it is not a movie made or intended for children. Much Parental Guidance and forethought should be taken before taking children under 12 to this film. Aside from a film which lasts almost three hours in length where much of the dialogue while important to the story is not well suited to entertain small children. In addition several of the creatures created for the film will probably terrify younger audiences. If you want to take your children to see this film I might caution you to view it without them first and then decide to take them on your own judgement. Hey if you do see it first without them you can see it again right? I plan on seeing it more than once anyway. All in all this is a well developed motion picture where a great deal of thought went into it's development and execution. I am thankful to the filmmakers for having the courage to tackle such a well known well loved story with an audience that has a very well organized preconceived notion of how they view the world of Tolkien. The filmmakers did the book justice and that is the bottom line unlike Bakshi's version of 1978 which was a disappointment at best and unfinished as it's final release turned out to be.".

Certainly Cabrera's creation deserved that incredible viewer's support. His movie is a good polaroid of colombian people and their way of living. It shows us the efforts of a group of 'neighbours' trying to keep the only thing that they have got in their lives their house something that belongs to them but legally doesn't. They will have to work together despite they don't like each other in order to solve that problem. And they as usually colombians do will find a creative solution to keep that precious 'treasure'. That's what I think the movie is about. By using the intelligence cooperation and a good dose of sacarsm poor people can defeat the richpowerful guys. In this case this modest colombian film defeated the Hollywood empire for several weeks. Of course the dream was so short...!".

	schema:reviewBody "As to whether or not CARACOL is the BEST Colombian film ever made is certainly open to debate. But that it is undoubtedly far and away my personal favorite is not! It's probably safe to say that many countries celebrate their regional and class cultural differences. Colombia obsesses over them! If you are relatively unfamiliar with them there is no better way to introduce yourself than via this delicious example of late 20th Century Colombian filmmaking 1993. CARACOL is an unrivaled showcase for Colombian talent. Sergio Cabrera directs masterfully and also doubles as scriptwriter. And what a superb and nuanced work he has crafted! Those of you who speak Spanish will undoubtedly be able to savor the semantic texture and subtleties Cabrera applies so skillfully. If ever there were a film tailormade for the Lost in Translation Syndrome I'm sure this is it! To be honest I have seen it a number of times in its original Spanish so this is a supposition on my part but I'm sure CARACOL does not lend itself in the least to translation! There is an underlying Universal theme which people from every country on earth who have ever felt the overwhelming sense of frustration and impotence that is an inevitable byproduct of battling a lethargic glacierpaced bureaucracy certainly can identify with! Undoubtedly almost all of us have experienced moments such as these in our lives! The cast is composed of some of the very best Colombia had to offer in the 1990's so much so that looking through the cast credits is pretty much a Who's Who of Colombian acting talent! Fausto Cabrera Sergio's father was born in Spain and was 71 when CARACOL was shot. Frank Ramirez Condores No Entierran Todos los DiasA Man of Principle has also appeared in a few American TV Series Vicki Hernandez practically a household name in Colombia had a small role in Proof of Life 2000.In closing Just Let me say that the final scene has one of the greatest tag linesPunch lines I have ever seen in any film in Spanish. Sadly it is hard for me to envision any possible translation that would have the same impact on English speaking viewers.But Please don't let this stop you from getting your hands on a copy for viewing! CARACOL is a real Must See for all world citizens!10 Bureaucracy laden hurdle STARS.ENJOYDISFRUTELA!Any comments questions or observations in English o en Espaol are most welcome!...".

The film combines humour with a critique of social injustice whilst at the same time offering a model of how workingclass bonds can be maintained in the face of the socially disjunctive effects of capitalism.

Vera Farmiga who plays the female lead character is superb credible and bitter enough to give convincing diva acting in the Checov's Cherry orchard play which is crucial for the dynamic development of the movie itself.I left the theatre thinking I wanted to see it again.

	schema:reviewBody "Throw out your preconceptions of bank heist films and you have a good start on Henry's Crime. This one is a leftfield success. The story isn't at all remarkable other than it was imagined and realized. The thing that makes this flick fly is the fantastic performances. No one is acting they're just being really lowkey engaging. This makes the parts greater than the whole. You've seen some great movies with James Caan but did you expect another now? I've sensed Keanu Reeves could use his stiffness to great effect if something which depended on that came along and this is it. Add some rich flavor with Vera Farmiga and a slight undercurrent of comedy and director Malcolm Venille delivers just the right end result.This bank heist film is more a comedic love story than anythingAnd it works. A slacker who is actually happy married and going nowhere becomes a witless victim of circumstance. While in prison he is told he has to have a dream or his life is meaningless. Once more circumstance intervenes and he realizes what he has longed for is the meaning life has once its shared. The trouble is that he is a bit slow to come to that realization and the dream he imagined that being a bank robbery without violence really isn't his dream at all. The whole thing is juxtaposed by his becoming an actor the suitor in Chekhov's play The Orchard Thief. Again lowkey brilliance.This movie entertains first and foremost. It passes as if it is ten minutes due to the uniformly excellent performances of the cast. The direction gets out of the way and there isn't any need for any special effects or senseless action. It ends in the best possible way as to not try to tie up anything past the found love between two people. Simply put entertaining lowkey brilliant thus highly recommended.".

The very theater style of the film is obvious and the nice link to the Chekhov's play is a warm heartthawing welcome for all Russian viewers. Keanu is a very good Lopakhin and Vera is a very sweet Ranevskaya.

Both give standout performances worth of wards.The film is a funny heist story with a twist of romantic comedy. It doesn't go over the top but it is a fun ride and makes you feel all warm and fuzzy at the end. Not quite a chick flick but a good date movie as both men and women will appreciate the cast and the storyline. Other great cast mentions are Fisher Stevens as a conniving partner in crime and Bill Duke as a helpful security guard.The script is clever and the music is eclectic.

Henry shows no reaction to anything to the extent that I wondered if he was supposed to be simple minded. You never know what he is feeling or thinking and therefore what his motivations are and given the plot line this is a serious failing.

	schema:reviewBody "HENRY'S CRIME is a dark comedy that actually carries a fairly good afterburn. The story is solid the characters are unusual and the setting in Buffalo NY is appropriately dark and dank. This is a tale of how people react to their own personalities moving through the world seemingly oblivious to those around them afraid to create dreams much less go after them. Flatline Henry Torne Keanu Reeves works the night shift in a freeway tollbooth quite alone and seemingly undisturbed by his isolation. At dawn he goes home to his tiny house where he greets his wife nurse Debbie Judy Geer who wants to talk about beginning a family but as usual things distract the couple's ability to have a conversation. Friends pick up Henry to have him replace a member of the neighborhood baseball team and Henry goes along as he does with everything that comes his way only to wind up as the driver of a getaway car for his 'teammates' as they pause to rob a bank. Henry is so loopy that he is not sure what happened and is arrested by the bank cop Frank Bill Duke and without much effort in protecting his innocence Henry is convicted and imprisoned. There he meets Max Saltzman James Caan who loves being in the protection of prison low goals in life. When Henry comes up for parole Max wishes him luck in finding a dream or waking up to life and Henry wanders back to his home Debbie has married worthless Joe Danny Hoch and is pregnant  and none of this seems to bother Henry either. Henry decides to return to the bank he was convicted of 'robbing' and is struck by a cellphone carrying driving actress Julie Vera Farmiga. Henry has feelings surprise! for Julie follows her into the theater next to the bank where Julie is rehearsing Chekhov's 'The Cherry Orchard'. Things finally begin to move the theater is connected to the bank by a tunnel Henry visits Max and convinces him to get out on parole and the two men plan to actually rob the bank Henry was sent to prison for not robbing! From here the puzzle takes twists and turns but the result is Henry's finally waking up to his emotions with Julie with a 'dream' of robbing the bank to repay the fact that he was unjustly incarcerated and nothing  and everything  goes as planned with big surprises in the end. Malcolm Venville directs this plodding venture written by Sacha Gervasi David White and Stephen Hamel. Much of the plot is rather silly but that seems somehow proper for a character as bland as Henry played with appropriate flatness by Reeves. Farmiga and Caan add the sparkle that keeps the boat afloat. Just when viewers are about to groan over this story it reminds everyone of some of the people who are sleepwalking through life whether blandly or anxiously and by film's end the importance of dreams and an appreciation of the events that make our lives interesting and quirky provides some valuable food for thought.

	onyx:emotionText "HENRY'S CRIME is a dark comedy that actually carries a fairly good afterburn. The story is solid the characters are unusual and the setting in Buffalo NY is appropriately dark and dank. This is a tale of how people react to their own personalities moving through the world seemingly oblivious to those around them afraid to create dreams much less go after them. Flatline Henry Torne Keanu Reeves works the night shift in a freeway tollbooth quite alone and seemingly undisturbed by his isolation. At dawn he goes home to his tiny house where he greets his wife nurse Debbie Judy Geer who wants to talk about beginning a family but as usual things distract the couple's ability to have a conversation. Friends pick up Henry to have him replace a member of the neighborhood baseball team and Henry goes along as he does with everything that comes his way only to wind up as the driver of a getaway car for his 'teammates' as they pause to rob a bank. Henry is so loopy that he is not sure what happened and is arrested by the bank cop Frank Bill Duke and without much effort in protecting his innocence Henry is convicted and imprisoned. There he meets Max Saltzman James Caan who loves being in the protection of prison low goals in life. When Henry comes up for parole Max wishes him luck in finding a dream or waking up to life and Henry wanders back to his home Debbie has married worthless Joe Danny Hoch and is pregnant  and none of this seems to bother Henry either. Henry decides to return to the bank he was convicted of 'robbing' and is struck by a cellphone carrying driving actress Julie Vera Farmiga. Henry has feelings surprise! for Julie follows her into the theater next to the bank where Julie is rehearsing Chekhov's 'The Cherry Orchard'. Things finally begin to move the theater is connected to the bank by a tunnel Henry visits Max and convinces him to get out on parole and the two men plan to actually rob the bank Henry was sent to prison for not robbing! From here the puzzle takes twists and turns but the result is Henry's finally waking up to his emotions with Julie with a 'dream' of robbing the bank to repay the fact that he was unjustly incarcerated and nothing  and everything  goes as planned with big surprises in the end. Malcolm Venville directs this plodding venture written by Sacha Gervasi David White and Stephen Hamel. Much of the plot is rather silly but that seems somehow proper for a character as bland as Henry played with appropriate flatness by Reeves. Farmiga and Caan add the sparkle that keeps the boat afloat. Just when viewers are about to groan over this story it reminds everyone of some of the people who are sleepwalking through life whether blandly or anxiously and by film's end the importance of dreams and an appreciation of the events that make our lives interesting and quirky provides some valuable food for thought.

The acting is superb starting with a sentimental Keanu Reeves continuing with an excellent performance by Vera Farmiga and ending with the always credible James Caan. The plot in itself is very simple but that simplicity is an important feature of this film. Henry Reeves gets mixed up unknowingly in a bank robbery by an old high school buddy. After serving three years in prison he decided to change the way he handled his life by attempting to rob the same bank though this time with full intention. When casing the bank he gets run over by Julie Farmiga an actress working in a play in the theater next to the bank. From there on they got to know each other until they began a relationship. At the same time Henry asks his former cellmate Max Caan to help him out to rob the bank. The plot seems kind of unrealistic but in my opinion it is not important. The real important thing is the portrayal of each character very well done if you ask me. The writers focus on the fears the dreams and the feelings of each character to state how we may react in the different situations the movie presents. Though it has not the potential to win an Oscar Henry's Crime is an excellent movie entertaining but above all insightful which is something not very common these days.".

Keanu's character 'Henry' was quiet and thoughtful one of those people who seems shy but is mostly pensive. Which is refreshing in a sense that each time he speaks you know it's something of substance. His chemistry with Vera is perfectly suited and humorous. And of course with James Caan's con character thrown into the mix the audience is in for a treat. The film is well outlined and easy to follow yet interesting and suspenseful at times. I'd highly recommend going to see it.".

Henry's Crime is twisted funny and has a lot of melancholy in its soul. Really recommend to watch it it's worth to spend time and money.

	schema:reviewBody "keanu Reeves stars in this charming indie about a lovable loser who is sent to prison for a crime he didn't commit  he thought he was driving his friends to a baseball game but turns out they were robbing a bank  and subsequently decides that 'if he's done the time he might as well do the crime' and sets out to rob said bank following his release after a bunch of life lessons in the slammer with cellmate James Caan.In order to do this Reeves has to get a role in the production of Chekov's 'The Cherry Blossom' next door to the bank the plan is to dig through a wall in the theatre into a preexisting tunnel that connects the theatre and bank as Lopahkin and he subsequently falls in love with his leading lady played by Vera Farmiga who was so good last year opposite George Clooney in Up In The Air. As the play the romance and the robbery all progress the three strands of the plot head to an enjoyably albeit somewhat predictable culmination on opening night.This is all fairly ridiculous stuff and seems to take place in some kind of small town re Buffalo bubble where the laws of realitycommon sense have been suspended is it really this easy to steal 12 million dollars? Is is really possible nobody would hearnotice the gang tunnelling through the walls? Is Chekov's The Cherry Blossom really a sell out play?However if you can suspend your disbelief at the ridiculousness of the whole thing then the movie is an enjoyable and offbeat romantic comedy featuring great performances from Caan and Farmiga and perhaps only spoiled slightly by Reeves' trademark wooden and unemotional offering which can be summed up in this picture of him that features the facial expression he wears for pretty much the entirety of the movieTo begin with I thought that Reeves had been cast perfectly as the monosyllabic emotionally detached loser Henry possibly his best casting since the moronic Ted in the Bill and Ted movies and there's an enjoyable scene where the director of the play Peter Stormare is trying to teach him how to act. You might think that  as Reeves produced the movie too  he might be sending himself up with this scene as Jean Claude Van Damme did in JCVD but I doubt that Reeves has the intelligence or creativity to consider such a notion. However other than the final scene I felt that Reeves' attempts to act within the movie were pretty indifferent to his actual performance and claims from other cast members that Henry was 'a natural' suitably laughable.I wasn't convinced either by his chirpsing of Farmiga  although he had some pretty sick chirpses let's go get some ice cream i'm planning on robbing the bank they were delivered with a lack of any charisma and it made me question how a cool sassy woman like her would jump into bed so quickly with a loser like Henry. My friend told me it was just because he was so hot though. This kind of makes sense.The film is to be commended for focussing less on the robbery itself and more upon the relationships of all the characters who populate it which enables its quirky humour to be exploited to the maximum with several laugh out loud moments my favourite of which was the beard that Reeves is required to wear in his role as Lopahkin although i'm not sure if this was intentionalOverall Henry's Crime is an enjoyable caper and well worth watching. Although it could be argued that the real crime is Keanu Reeve's acting I found that his stiff attempt at a deadpan performance only added to the quirkiness of the humour of the whole production and probably made me enjoy it even more.".

I didn't find the chemistry between him and the actress Vera Farmiga all that great since the actress isn't likable at all. And just comes off loud and selfish in my opinion but who am I to judge when it comes to someone falling in love.

	schema:reviewBody "Henry's Crime presents itself as a comedic modern noir in the vein of films like The Ice Harvest and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. It creates a pretty solid tone and all of the parts surrounding the core are created well. James Caan and Peter Stormare do fine work and the plot could have been interesting enough but it all falls apart when it gets to that core. I've never been as hard of a hater of Keanu Reeves as most people seem to be but here he completely destroys the film.If there had been an actor with some charisma like Robert Downey Jr. or Colin Farrell sitting at the top of this film it would have been a nice little slice of modern noir. Instead we get Reeves who couldn't be more wooden if he tried. At first I thought this was part of the character the guy just being an empty man who has no motivation. But when he gets the idea to rob the bank the he was falsely imprisoned for robbing already the character talks about how he finally has a dream in his life and something to look forward to. Hell he even supposedly falls in love with Vera Farmiga's character a semifailed theater actress. Yet no matter what he is saying about how excited he is Reeves couldn't seem more bored. I can't possibly understand how the director was making this film and saw the dailies and thought Okay great job Keanu. It's impossible not see how bad and stale this performance is.In stark contrast with Reeves' disastrous work though is Vera Farmiga who once again shows that she is one of the finest actresses to grace the screen. She is superb here brimming with life from her very first scene where she hits Reeves with her car gets out and immediately starts shouting at him. The character is unique and unfortunately she has to work opposite Reeves so the relationship is impossible to buy and has no chemistry but Farmiga is on fire all the way through. She is completely full of life and charisma whether she is cackling a laugh breaking down in hysterics or snapping wildly at the theater director. A great performance in an unfortunately ruined film.".

I had a good idea what the movie was about having seen the trailers and the promo junkets. They were honest and accurately portrayed the movie's intention and scope. This is a small story that is sweet and fun to watch. A movie for grown ups without undo violence and without special effects. A movie that will translate well to the smaller screen in case you miss it at the theater. And a good TV movie once the swearing is bleeped. The cast are highly recognizable and experienced actors. The scene at Niagara Falls is charming and destined to be classic. The love story between Henry Reevesand Julie Farmiga is wonderfully enjoyable in it's quirkiness. Opposites attraction works very well in this romance. They managed to skirt some stereotypes which is always refreshing and a good direction to go with in movie making. How can you NOT like a movie where everyone gets what they believe they need in the end? I am most interested in owning this one on bluray.".

Certain Buffalo landmarks were quite recognizable on Main Street and I'm convinced that the use of the famous Shea's Theater was the main reason for the shoot. A great deal of the film is shot inside there because a production of Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard is integral to the plot. There are two crimes in Henry's Crime. The first is the one Keanu Reeves got left holding the bag for when he drove some friends to what was an ATM stop and it turned out to be a bank robbery on Buffalo's Main Street. After doing the time and spending it there with a wise old convict played by James Caan Reeves decides that maybe the state owes him one bank robbery. In the meantime Reeves gets a romance going with actress Vera Famiga who tells her director he's a natural to play in their stock company production of The Cherry Orchard. That works out real well because from Shea's Theater there is an old tunnel that runs across the street to the Buffalo Savings Bank which actually is one block down. The tunnel was from Prohibition days and it's a long tunnel.Reeves's two friends from the first robbery who suckered him Fisher Stevens and Danny Hoch cut themselves in as well as Bill Duke the security guard who nailed Reeves the first time also cut themselves in. You have to see the film for the rest.Henry's Crime for me has its moments. Reeves is a confusing mixture of disingenuousness and innocence in his character. James Caan as the worldly wise convict steals the film for me. But I wound up asking myself what have I just seen when I finished the film.By the way on Main Street in Buffalo there is no automobile traffic save for police and emergency vehicles and mail and UPS trucks.

Jump to 'Atlanta Institute Georgia Ten Years Later' where they have Kong Peter Elliott on a life support system waiting to undergo a heart transplant!. Dr. Amy Franklin Linda Hamilton is ready to perform the operation but Kong needs a steady supply of blood to survive the procedure as luck would have it diamond mercenary Hank Mitchell Brian Kerwin has found a lady Kong George Yiasoumi while trekking through the Borneo jungle. In no time whatsoever the institute has brought the female  the operation has taken place with the artificial heart going in nicely. The operation is a success  Kong lives the institute decides to keep both Gorillas but when Kong hears the female call out he uses all his strength to break free from his chains  go in search of a mate obviously the United States Army can't have giant apes running around can they so it's up to Colonel Nevitt John Ashton to capture them by whatever means necessary...Directed by John Guillermin  according to the IMDb an uncredited Charles McCracken this is the sequel to the '76 remake of King Kong which Guillermin also directed. In my humble opinion I think King Kong Lives is one of those sobadit'sgood abominations that I simply can't believe someone green lighted  trust me King Kong Lives is a bad film through  through. The script by Roland Shusett  Steven Pressfield is absolutely hilarious at times you won't know weather to laugh or cry at some of the stuff that makes it's way into this film. I think King Kong Lives is meant to be a serious film but scenes such as the heart transplant complete with massive oversized medical instruments the giant artificial heart that needs to be lowered into Kong's chest using a crane!  all filmed in complete seriousness there's a bit when Kong manages to 'sneak' up behind an entire platoon of soldiers for Christs sake Kong is a 50 foot Gorilla couldn't any of these dumb soldiers see him? The scenes in which Kong  Lady Kong romanticise with hugs 'I love you' type looks  Kong wanting to give her something so he uproots a bunch of trees  tries to give her those! The entire concept is bizarre daft  just complete total  utter nonsense while at times it becomes embarrassing to watch. But having said that it moves along like a rocket  is never dull or boring when all said  done I found King Kong Lives to be a throughly entertaining film for all the wrong reasons.Director Guillermin messes everything up there is no excitement scares tension or any action although it is quite funny on numerous occasions. The whole mood of the film is wrong considering just how stupid it is. There are a few snippets of violence  gore Kong's removed heart someone is snapped in two Kong eats someone as well as a load of crocodiles  he gets shot at the end.With a supposed budget of over 30000000 King Kong Lives is a travesty where did all the money go? The special effects are worse than the '76 version in my opinion because of the 10 year gap didn't special effects move on at all during that period? If you put King Kong '76  King Kong Lives sidebyside you would think not. It really is just a man in a rubber monkey suit from beginning to end the full size hand  arm shots are awful as they just look so stiff  unnatural. For 30 big ones King Kong Lives is a shoddily produced film  doesn't look the part at all. The acting is about as good as you would expect from such a silly film I wonder if the cast knew how bad this was going to turn out to be?King Kong Lives provides 100 odd minutes of pure entertainment for me it's a crap film but it's just so bad it's good. It's a bit like a train wreck you know you shouldn't look but you can't take your eyes off it. An absolute treat for bad film fans!".

	schema:reviewBody "I have yet to read a positive review for this extremely underrated mildly amusing sequel to the 1976 remake of King Kong which was also a great movie but not as good as the original smash fest of the 30s. A decade after our hero fell from the World Trade Center to his death the big ape receives a heart transplant from a giant female gorilla of the same species Lady Kong who he falls in love with. The first time I heard this idea I figured this movie would suck and just be two guys in gorilla suits romancing over each other. But having loved its predecessor I had to check out this truly unique film. Unlike the rest of the Kong series this is more like a popcorn film that is here strictly to entertain us and isn't as deep as the previous films. Another kool thing is that Kong doesn't fall in love with a human girl like every other Kong movie but with an equal size girl ape which is I think a tremendous idea. Linda Hamilton who I've always loved from the Terminator series almost plays the same character she played from Dante's Peak and is responsible for Kong's blood transfusion. She is a great actress and came out of this movie OK. Indiana Jones wannabe Brian Kerwin plays her love interest and is also responsible for Kong's rebirth upon capturing Lady Kong. He does a superb job as well. The army is constantly causing problems for the ape couple but our two heroes Hamilton and Kerwin successfully stop them and near the end the two big apes have a Baby Kong possibly setting up for another sequel. Yes this movie could have been called Bride of Kong and had a lot of high quality action scenes some of which are actually quite gory for a Kong film heads being bit off people being tore in half rubber alligators being chewed up and seems a lot like a Godzilla film. Sure the plot gets a little silly and having two giant gorillas cuddle each other and act like humans is a bit much but all the cheesy scenes are mediocre at best. And yes I did hate some of it mostly the army scenes and the rubber alligator scene really bad FX there but being the sixth film in the Kong series what more do you want? Seeing Kong smash stuff will make me happy. I now have this film in my Kong DVD collection along with King Kong '33 Son of Kong and King Kong '76 the two Japanese films will join them soon I even have Might Joe Young though I don't count that as part of the series. I have now reviewed all the Kong films except the brand new 2005 remake which i simply can't wait to see. Review for that coming soon! Overall I really enjoyed this film and it wasn't as bad as I expected nor as bad as people say. I give this worthy entry to the Kong series and great sequel to the 70's movie a 610.".

Its by John Scott.Its a great score.Overall King Kong Lives is great movie!".

Overall it's pretty ridiculous from the story to the special effects to the supposedly emotional moments. It's overlong the dialog could have been written by junior high kids and the characters particularly the bad guys are so onedimensional it's not even funny. But if you can accept all of that you can get at least some entertainment value out of this sequel though don't expect a sobadit'sfunny picture.".

Complete with footage of Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange from that less than successful remake this film continues on to give new meaning to the term monkeyshines.When King and Lady Kong see each other for the first time their exchange of glances is worthy of the most ambitious 'Saturday Night Live' skit.

	schema:reviewBody "It's fun! This movie got terrible reviews but I gotta say if you enjoy the other King Kong films and are a fan it's an enjoyable flick. It's brimming with intentional goofiness and gags and while not an astonishingly great piece cinema like the '33 classic at least it's fun and surpasses all the other 'Kongs' except for Peter Jackson's remake. The script is pretty tight for a sequel and there are a couple memorable action setpieces ... lots of illmeaning soldiers get crushed Kong style. The acting is fine the 80's special effects serve their purpose and the score is actually quite colorful and carries the movie well.If you were entertained at all by the '76 original this is definitely worth watching. There are only a handful of King Kong movies to choose from after all.".

King Kong is strong but a little rugged around the eyes from his fall in downtown New York. Very sexy with a female member with the gorilla bosom about to make Kong's blood boil asunder. I recommend for some late viewing while you eat pumpkin pie and nothing else is on in your parent's basement. Live on Kong.".

	schema:headline " This movie made my brain hurt.";
	schema:reviewBody "Okay before I say anything else every time an ape smiled in this movie I wanted to put a pot over my head and beat on it with a serving ladle. But no matter. The Kongs have become a family of epic grinners you just have to deal with it. The scariest thing is that that's not even the worst part of this movie. It is dangerous ground to make a sequel that involves a movie monster getting romantically involved. They did it with Child's Play and it transformed the early camp horror films into pure comedy. Child's Play was no longer even in the same genre as it started out in. King Kong Lives doesn't even deserve to be in the same GENRE even of the 1976 film which was very well made much less the 1933 classic.The movie opens with the ending of the 1976 film with Kong climbing and being shot down from the World Trade Center. This movie surprise takes place ten years later. I guess Kong has been in some sort of coma for ten years and as the movie starts a lot of scientists are in the process of performing a heart transplant on him. Next thing you know he's ripping electrodes off and jumping up for the windows in the roof then lifting himself up bodily by the bars on those windows despite just having had his rib cage sawn open and a plastic heart the size of a Volkswagen installed.Now this was hard but I managed to accept that he was able to do that. I know virtually nothing about primates much less 50 foot tall primates. Who am I to judge his healing speed? But given that I had accepted his remarkable ability to recover from a barrage of antiaircraft gunshot wounds from helicopters on all sides then a fall that would have reduced all of his organs to mush then a historic heart transplant and THEN display a miraculous mending of the sternum I found it more than a little odd how easily he was undone when he bumped his head on a rock later in the movie. One clever individual in the film tries to convince Amy Linda Hamilton to just forget about him because outside his environment he would not be able to acquire enough protein to survive.PROTEIN!!Nevermind the fact that there's a 10000pound gorilla corpse floating downriver let's just go home because he won't be able to find enough protein to survive! That's OUTSTANDING science my friend! Then again the Kongs have not only found love but they have mastered the art of invisibility so it's not surprising that he didn't want to be bothered with a search. The Kongs are like freaking ninjas!At the beginning Hank the big game hunter that some nutcase refers to as Indiana Jones lays down on some foliage to take a nap not noticing that there is a 50 foot gorilla less than 20 feet away from him until she tries to pick him up. This guy is no Indiana Jones. Later in the film some golfer hits King Kong in the face with a golf ball before he notices that there's a gigantic gorilla standing on the course. I'm guessing he wasn't looking where he was hitting the ball.Yes. It's true.King Kong.Gets hit.With a golf ball.It is odd indeed that it necessitates an entire army of troops tanks and helicopters to find King Kong and Mrs. Kong who one guy in a helicopter with a searchlight could easily find since they tower over the trees. And you guessed it Kong manages to sneak up on the entire Army too. While they're standing watch. Looking for King Kong. Nice work soldiers. These guys are dumber than the law enforcement in First Blood.At one point a lot of rednecks get into boats to go hunt down Kong and some military jerk goes What is this Deliverance? No sir. The rednecks were in the woods in Deliverance not the boats. This is far worse this is Gator Bait!And Hank the golfers and the military are not the only people suffering from vision loss in the movie. At one point Amy nearly falls over a waterfall while she and Hank are walking across a rickety wooden bridge in a sad sad homage to the Temple of Doom and when she gets back up she frantically asks Where's the heart rate monitor?? Apparently unable to see its bulky mass sitting two feet away from her. Somebody get this woman some binoculars!The movie almost gets meaningful when Kong is frantic to get out of captivity and get to the female that he can smell nearby. Forget about any stupid sex jokes any ape is going to want to mate after being held in captivity. Then it turns out that they just want to go lounge in the woods grabassing and massaging each other. At one point Mighty Jane Young starts licking a wound Kong has somehow gotten on his knee and he puts his arm around her and grins. The only thing missing is a barrel of beer in his other hand.Ultimately of course we are forced to meet Son of Kong a humansized ape which having come from Mrs. Kong makes about as much sense as a human woman giving birth to a child the size of like a grape.In the movie's defense we do get to see Linda Hamilton topless for exactly two fifteenths of a second but director John Guillermin who also directed the massively superior 1976 remake has not even managed to produce a grape.He's given birth to a raisin.A rotten one.".

	schema:reviewBody "KING KONG LIVES is a great example of a big budget yet total ineptness throughout. While schlock directors like Ed Wood Arch Hall and Al Adamson can make really bad films their budgets are minuscule. Here however with a big budget the producers show that they can produce a film every bit as bad. That's a great great return on your money folks! This is also one of those films whose concept is so bizarre and dumb you wonder how it ever got made in the first place. First considering how much of an enormous box office bomb the previous version of KING KONG was you'd be amazed to see this this is a sequel! Second the entire idea just makes no sense at all. This sequel begins as you see Kong falling to his death at the end of KING KONG 1976. But despite falling a bazillion stories AND being machine gunned repeatedly KING KONG LIVES expects us to accept that the giant ape DID NOT DIE!!! And here's the weirdest part folks some evil rich guy has been paying to keep the ape on life support in a warehouse for a decade!!! Why?!? This NEVER is explored in the least. And after the nasty simian destroys New York this guy has the idea of trying to revive this beast!?!In contrast to the evil industrialist and aren't they all in these sort of films?! you have the dedicated people the doctor who saved Kong and the man who discovered a female Kong who want to save the ape and return it to the wildsort of like that kid from ET. And when the military comes into the film you KNOW that they are evil and only want to kill. So it's the two innocent idiots who have to battle the unfeeling idiots who want to kill Kong and his new lady love yes folks there are now TWO giant apes in this film. So despite Linda Hamilton who really seems to have a thing for big hairy guys and some other jerk armed only with pluck they are able to sneak past a bazillion idiot soldiers and the forces of the evil idiot rich dude...and save the day. In the process the cars and trucks of the evil rich dude inexplicably run into each other and instantly explode in flamesthus enabling the apes and the only two who understand and care to escape. One of my favorite awful scenes was right after this when the male and female apes escape. They are now in the wild and are at a place called Honeymoon Ridgeat which place naturally the now adorable aminals start cooing and falling in love! Oh this is stupid and I couldn't help but groan...and laugh. And when the two apelovers happen upon them guy what happens next?! Yes they too are smitten and inspired by the apes' pure and innocent love! A short time later the evil military mess up this perfect love and manage to gas the female ape to sleep. This works very very well. So when Kong shows up a minute later they barely even try to put him to sleep as well but throw bombs and stuff at himand really ticking him off in the process. Why didn't they also just put Kong to sleep as well and transport them to a sanctuary or a zoo or to Disney's Animal Kingdom?! So given that the two lovers are separated is what happens next really much of a surprise?! However I was surprised to see that Kong survived by hiding out and eating alligatorsand later even people. The ape appears to be a giant gorillaand gorillas are vegetarians. Also the forest where Kong and Mrs. Kong hied out appears to be some place like Idaho or Colorado. Which begs the question what are giant rubber alligators doing in this part of the United States?!?.Now I noticed that this movie won a Razzie award for its special effects and I actually think this is unfair. The ape suits were not that bad and the special effects are actually the best thing about this terrible film. I do agree with the Razzie book which I own that it is a great movie to see because it is so laughably bad but the award seemed misplaced. To have given an award for writing directing or even acting would have seemed a lot more appropriate because of the silly lovemaking that occurred between the apesnow THAT was dumb! But the costumes weren't that bad for 1986 other than Baby Kong'swhose was truly terrible. Also in the film's defense while the film was 100 stupid it looked goodwith good camerawork and decent effects. But at heart despite this it was still incredibly dumb. And speaking of the love of two apes apparently the two apes can meet have sex and have a baby all in the space of a day or two. Wow those giant apes work fast!! And with no amniotic fluid placenta or mess whatsoever!! And oddly the baby turns out to be about the size of a normal gorillamaking me wonder who the father REALLY was!!! Apparently Mrs. Kong was quite the slut! By the way apparently the people inside the Mr. and Mrs. Kong's outfits were both guys. This makes the amazing childbirth scene all the more amazing!!!Oh and the only good scene in the entire dreadful film involves Kong ripping some dumb redneck in half and then eat another. It's dumb but kinda cool as well. Although it's pretty sad if this is the BEST thing the film has to offer! It's also interesting because the ape only appears to eat bad peopledespite man chances to eat others it only eats these rednecks who deserved it!".

This mechanical heart must have been well made because Kong Acts like normal once he comes to.The acting is pretty adequate. Linda Hamilton is a pretty good actress she is not that hot but at least she shows off one of her breasts for a split section. There are a few oddities. For one King Kong feeds on alligators in this film. Gorillas I thought were vegetarian but it is a movie and I guess that accuracy to real life is not that important. The whole Kong and lady Kong relationship is kind of fast and not seen on screen that much. At least it did not show them mate on screen. There is some action at parts but not enough. And the whole idea of bringing Kong back to life and then the army goes after him maybe I missed something. And the ending to this film is pretty sad and depressing I do not want to give it away.So yeagh this movie is not great. However it is not as bad as people say. There are some good parts but I guess not enough. But I guess be the judge for yourself. If you liked the remake of King Kong made in 1976 go see this one. If you did not like the remake you probably wont like this one.".

And soon Kong is back in fighting shape ravaging the Army demolishing cars with one stomp and sharing screen time with luminaries like Hamilton Kerwin Ashton and Hope Nunnery  okay Hope Nunnery isn't TECHNICALLY a luminary but I like her name.But everything here is so slapdash so forced and so disjointed that it falls apart LONG before we discover that Kong has found a new girlfriend. If you make it that far you deserve every scene with these two to follow especially the very last one.At least the FX are fairly decent they're headed by E.T.'s Carlo Rambaldi and are a darn sight better than what he passed off as FX in Dune.   In closing all else I can say is in seeing that Guillermin also directed this sequel to his '76 classic it doesn't matter who you are  sequelitis will get you if you don't watch out.One star.  King Kong Lives  but he doesn't live large.".

And soon Kong is back in fighting shape ravaging the Army demolishing cars with one stomp and sharing screen time with luminaries like Hamilton Kerwin Ashton and Hope Nunnery  okay Hope Nunnery isn't TECHNICALLY a luminary but I like her name.But everything here is so slapdash so forced and so disjointed that it falls apart LONG before we discover that Kong has found a new girlfriend. If you make it that far you deserve every scene with these two to follow especially the very last one.At least the FX are fairly decent they're headed by E.T.'s Carlo Rambaldi and are a darn sight better than what he passed off as FX in Dune.   In closing all else I can say is in seeing that Guillermin also directed this sequel to his '76 classic it doesn't matter who you are  sequelitis will get you if you don't watch out.One star.  King Kong Lives  but he doesn't live large.";

I was totally amazed that Linda Hamilton had anything whatsoever to do with such a disappointing jaunt into the area of camp. The critics have knocked the '76 remake of King Kong but next to this it was of Ben Hur caliber. This is one of those movies you would be far better off not seeing. Especially if you are a fan of the original OR the '76 remake. It is a farce. A joke. A very bad joke.It turns out Kong did not die at the end of the '76 remake. He was taken to the Institute where Linda Hamilton and her team of doctors and scientists primatologists and whatnot revived his heart and have tried for ten years to come up with a solution to his ten year long coma. Well it seems he needs a heart transplant and blood transfusion and the only source just happens to be available. A female Kong who is recently captured. Go figure. Upon acquiring the female they give Kong the transfusion perform the necessary operations and poof! Kong has a new heart. Trouble is from a mile away he can smell the female now that he is awake. So of course he makes trouble escapes and finds her and together they run off into the mountains to make babies. With an historically inane story line tritefilled dialog It's the other monkey! It's gone...apesht!! pure camp throughout horrid cinematography worse acting and about the most poorlydone effects I've seen since Killer Klowns from Outer Space this quondam legendary line of movies has reached its end with King Kong Lives.This is a prime example of a bad idea gone worse. This should be required viewing in any cinema course What NOT to do with Your Movie 101. sighs 1.210 from...The Fiend ..".

This gimmick is where the film's personality arrives from outside a dementedly compulsive performance by Steve Welles under some bandages and heavy makeup as the cracking Toulon. Welles is the life of the party getting plenty of screen time  where a little more is explained about his character as the rest of the cast Elizabeth Maclellan Collin Bernsen Gregory Webb Jeff Celentano and a perky Charlie Spradling are immensely onenote. Also showing up in minor but fruitful parts are Nita Talbot Sage Allen and George 'Buck' Flower. When it came to the puppets doing Toulon's dirty work while ominously nasty it just lacked the imagination found in the original's death setpieces but the meaty if dark narrative seemed a little more fuller in its angle of dementia betrayal and revenge. The pacing can have its stuffy moments too being rather slow to get going but the location for the developing macabre fits and Richard Band's brooding score is reused with that striking playful carnival arrangement.".

In one funny scene he is tormented by a little boy and the little brat says something like 'Is that all you can do? do something' and you can guess what Torch does to him. The actors did fine the acting wasnt great but this is lowbudget guys. If your'e a fan of this movie i recommend you get the DVD.

Popping up in neat secondary roles are Nita Talbot as flaky psychic Camille the ubiquitous George Buck Flower as grumpy farmer Matthew and Sage Allen as Matthew's dumpy and excitable wife Martha. The stop motion animation puppets are pretty funky and effective. Thomas F. Denove's glossy cinematography makes nifty occasional use of fancy dissolves and cool wipes. Richard Band's shivery score hits the shuddery spot. The very end is a real hoot. As a tasty extra plus the deliciously buxom Ms. Spradling bares her beautifully bountiful breasts.

It manages to get away with it the grand hotel at Bodega Bay is after all a fantastic setting so it is a joy to return there and though it may initially feel like a complete retread paranormal investigators returning to the hotel rather than psychics etc etc it does have a few interesting plot developments to draw the audience in.Toulon is brought back from the dead with his own maniacal plan that involves human sacrifices he is no longer the sweet paternal toymaker we met in the first film but a monstrosity wrapped in bandages with his own sinister desires. We get an interesting insight into the origin of the living puppets and there are also some scenes that will definitely make you smile for once in a film the annoying kid actually gets it! So overall it is for the most part an enjoyable retread of old territory. But it is territory that is still enjoyable to revisit right down to the musical score. It still manages to retain its hammy charm and is guaranteed to make you crack a smile at least a couple of times. I'm hoping though that the future chapters in this series stray a little further away from the formula that seems to be forming right now. It is still fun and endearing right now but I can imagine it growing very stale.I do have to mention the Video Zone extras found on the DVDs as well as the original VHS tapes I believe. They're essentially behind the scenes shorts that nicely compliment the movies giving you some insight into the filmmaking process. However unlike the promotional work we find for today's bigger blockbusters you do get a sense of genuine enthusiasm from the cast and crew Charlie Spralding is a lot of fun to watch especially. It just allows the audience to feel a part of things.".

The basic puppets are back in this one Blade Tunnler Pinhead and Mrs. Leach also we are given a new puppet with name of Torch.  Torch basically resembles a little Nazi with a flame thrower attached to his left hand.  We are blessed to witness his godforsaken powers as he torches an obese woman in the confines of her cabin.  However in typical Kipper fashion i must not forget the appearance of our favorite actress Charlie Spradling.  As usual Charlie gives her all in this performance reaching to the lower depths of her being to attack the numerous layers that consist of her characteroh yeah she also walks around her room with no shirt on!.  But before i bore you with my ridiculous banter i must make clear that this is a decent sequel that is well worth watching.

It is often a tie between the first film and this one and the first one for me and although I love them both I think I like this one a little better.The film has a relatively creepy and unsettling vibe to it that neither the original Puppet Master nor the ones that followed ever seemed to portray. Right away the film starts of creepily as we see the famous Toulon Puppets walking about in a scary old cemetery in the middle of the night. They use the last of the elixir which gives them life to reanimate their old master Andre' Toulon this time for the most part played excellently by Steve Welles. Even before the opening credits we're treated to the creepy undead arms of Toulon emerging from his grave. Honestly this used to give me nightmares as a kid.Then we're introduced to our main characters paranormal investigators who have arrived at the Bodega Bay Inn to document anything paranormal after hearing Alex Whitaker's bizarre tale. The main lead here is a young woman named Carolyn Elizabeth Maclellan. After her brother is murdered by Tunneler she is joined by Michael Collin Bernsen whose mother has also been killed by the puppets. They also meet a man named Eriquee Chanee' whose face is bandaged and who claims to be the owner of the hotel. However it is soon discovered that the mysterious Eriquee is really Toulon who since being revived by the puppets has turned overly evil and has been ordering his puppets to kill innocents in order to extract their brain fluid so he can transfer his soul into a mannequin doll. He also becomes obsessed with Carolyn who he believes to be the reincarnation of his beloved wife Elsa who was murdered during WWII by the Nazis. What ensures is absolute creepy craziness and comes to a head during an especially creepy finale in which Toulon's soul transfers into the scarylooking mannequin Michael Todd.Puppet Master II is a fantastic film that is so much fun to watch during those late stormy nights. I love all the homages it pays to classical horror films such as The Invisible Man. Many of my friends and fellow horror fanatics who love the Puppet Master series have always noted the second as too creepy and weird for them to enjoy. While this is true to some extent I think the overall weirdness and creepiness is what makes it one of the more enjoyable entries in the franchise. It's interesting though how after this film the puppets were often shown as gentle and kind as opposed to their murderous ways as seen in this film and the first. Puppet Master 4 and 5 were especially more lighthearted than the first film and certainly much more so than this one. Even in Puppet Master III Toulon was shown as a hero unlike the villainous creature from this movie. I think that is why I love this one so much. Nothing like it came out of the franchise again and it is certainly a rare gem in its own series of films.1010".

I had no idea just how impressive the look of the film was.The complaints about the film are rather misguided in many ways and there is some serious confusion about it. The female lead Linda Miller was dubbed by another actress so the complaints about her performance are a bit moot though the combination of nutty dialog and weird delivery actually help the film for most since it is so funny.Also this is not a sequel to King Kong Vs Godzilla Kong in this film is a myth found to be real and utilized to dig out a cavern for bizarre reasons that just get funnier the more you think about it.As a last note for anyone interested in King Kong in any of his incarnations seek out Ray Mortons book King Kong The History of a Movie Icon released recently. He actually set aside a chapter of the book detailing this film.".

	schema:headline " King Kong Escapes? Well catch him then!";
	schema:reviewBody "As it states under 'Trivia' 'King Kong Escapes' was a tiein to the RankinBass 'King Kong' cartoon series and to be honest this film is very much a children's movie featuring a cartoonish supervillain a faintly ridiculous plot and comical fight scenes. This shouldn't be taken to mean that I hate the film however. While it's not as good as Toho's previous Kong outing 'King Kong VS Godzilla' it's still okay if you're in the mood for that kind of thing. I've never seen the cartoon but the plot of this film is straightforward enough that you don't need to.The film does have a number of flaws the most notable being King Kong himself. I personally thought the ape suit from KKVG looked pretty impressive but KKE's version is more than a little silly particularly the face with its wide staring eyes and permanently open mouth which makes Kong look like he's high. Also the fights with the other monsters aren't overly impressive the battle on Mondo Island Kong had obviously moved from Skull Island after it was destroyed at the end of Son of Kong with Gorosaurus is actually quite funny particularly when Kong gets repeatedly dropkicked but the showdown with MechaKong is a bit anticlimactic particularly compared to the citydestroying smackdowns of KKVG and the best of the Godzilla series.The plot is some silly gubbins about mining a radioactive element and King Kong comes into the story after the evil Dr Who not the timetravelling character from the longrunning British T.V series builds a robot ape only for it to fail. He then kidnaps the real Kong but he escapes hence the title and the usual Kaiju action ensues. The human element is rather bland although this is probably the fault of the script rather than the actors. Linda Miller is the ersatz Fay Wray of this picture her role generally consisting of being picked up by Kong and trying to save the big ape from getting into trouble. Rhodes Reason is solid if unspectacular and Dr. Who makes a good overthetop villain.Having said that I do think it's a shame Toho never made any more Kong movies. Personally I would have loved to have seen MechaKong come back perhaps in a Godzilla movie. Given that Godzilla battled so many monsters over the years it might have been interesting if he had come up against King Kong again maybe in a scenario that forced them to work together against one or more of the many monster that big G faced.".

But in the context of Japanese giant monster kaiju King Kong Escapes is one of the better entries to be found coming in the 1960s when the focus was less tounge in cheek more actionoriented and free of the kiddie thrust that REALLY made Japanese monster movies annoyingly bad in the 1970s Gamera sequels and Godzilla vs. Gigan anyone?.   In a ways after the darkbrooding seriousness of the original Godzilla in 1954 the 1960s saw movies more in the ArmageddonMummy vein of action special effects and emptyheaded scripts.

Not much really.   And truth be told I find these kaiju movies of the 60s to have a lot more charm than their 90s American counterparts like Armageddon or the TriStar Godzilla.Eisei Ammamoto a veteran of Japanese scifi deliciously chews the scenery as the villainous Dr. Who while Bond girl veteran Mie Hama You Only Live Twice provides lovely visual distraction as Madame X and is far more appealing than the bland nonactress Linda Miller badly dubbed by cartoon voice Julie Bennett who also dubs Hama! as the object of Kong's affection and let's set the record straight this is NOT the woman of the same name who is Jackie Gleason's daughter no matter what the erroneous IMDB data base says.   The most amusing part of the script is how they almost seemingly plagiarized from Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea in their basic premise a sub commander named Nelson for goodness sake!.   No matter though.  Bad dubbing lame script notwithstanding King Kong Escapes is pleasantly mindnumbing fun from the peak period of kaiju cinema.Incidentally I'm glad to note that Rhodes Reason who by his own admission knew the film was lousy but couldn't pass up the trip to Japan to make it was able to overcome this in the longrun and earn better notices as Daddy Warbucks in numerous Broadway productions of Annie.".

Nor is it a cinema experience of note. It is entertaining and fun if you're a Kong fan like me. The props and costumes are old school and cheap! Brings back all sorts of fun memories.

For some reason the producers decided to dub Miller even though she spoke English. I recently purchased a DVD copy of this movie on eBay with the original Japanese dialogue uncut in widescreen. The script is slightly more mature and sensible and the Japanese dubbing of the English speaking actors Rhodes Reason Miller is done very well. Even the Japanese version is silly though.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a followup to 1962's King Kong vs. Godzilla. This time King Kong was kidnapped by a mad scientist who planned to use him to dig up Element X a key ingredient for a nuclear bomb. Along the way Kong battles a giant sea snake Gorosaurus Godzilla's buddy and a replica of himself called MechaKong. The directing and special effects were OK and the story was serviceable. I think that Toho intended to give this movie a James Bondish treatment since You Only Live Twice 1967 was released the same year and actress Mie Hama who appeared as bond girl Kissy in the 007 flick appeared in this movie. The movie could have used more suspense and human action. The monster scenes were OK though some scenes especially with the helicopters were really cheesy. If Kong was almost the same size as Godzilla I wouldn't think that he would be dwarfed by the Tokyo Tower and having the ability to climb it. Nonetheless I think the tower scene where the two monsters duke it out was a pretty remarkable special effect. Four major problems I have with this movie are about the characters. First of all Commander Nelson Rhodes Reason is supposed to be one of the heroes in the story but he basically didn't do anything important. He lost a little Karatefight to the main villain and then played chess with him afterward while his two friends were confined to a below 0 degree cell! Also his acting was plain. Second Lieutenant Watson Linda Miller was a very annoying character and had such an irritating voice. However her role is of some importance especially in the parts where she told Kong to stop shaking the sub she and the crew were in and where she calmed Kong down while he was on the loose in Tokyo. Third the part where Lt. Nomura Akira Takarada told an official he's Lieutenant Nomura he's not in uniform and asked to let him take command is a bit awkward. How would the official be sure he's who he claimed to be? Fourth the henchmen in the movie were just stupid. To sum it all the better acting actually goes to the two main villains! Dr. Who Eisei Anamoto gave an outrageously cruel performance. He's wildly funny with his wild white hair and long black cape and he's pretty darned skillful with the trigger. And Madame Piranha Mie Hama steals the show. She's bewitching spellbinding and beautiful. She is the true hero of the movie spoiler since it was she who destroyed MechaKong's control system thereby defeating the robot completely. I wish she would have had a better fate in the movie. The monster action was OK. City destruction was limited though and King Kong looked pretty dumb. The costume used for the monster was hideous but still better than the one used in King Kong vs. Godzilla.Above all this movie was very average  not the best from Toho. The plot lines really go all over the place. What made up for this movie was Akira Ifukube's great haunting music score and Mie Hama.Grade C".

And Madame Piranha Mie Hama steals the show. She's bewitching spellbinding and beautiful. She is the true hero of the movie spoiler since it was she who destroyed MechaKong's control system thereby defeating the robot completely. I wish she would have had a better fate in the movie. The monster action was OK. City destruction was limited though and King Kong looked pretty dumb. The costume used for the monster was hideous but still better than the one used in King Kong vs. Godzilla.Above all this movie was very average  not the best from Toho. The plot lines really go all over the place. What made up for this movie was Akira Ifukube's great haunting music score and Mie Hama.Grade C";

Before you go off accusing me of being some kinda person who hates the man in a rubber suit thing I should inform you that the men in the rubber suits are the only good parts about the special effects in this film. Other that that all the the helicopters the submarines and even the giant snake look laughably bad. The story is a SORT OF remake of the original King Kong movie. The plot is this The sinister Dr. Who plans to capture Kong from his home of Skull Island I know they call the island something else in the film but forget it it not like were going to remember that name anyways so that Kong can retrieve Element X. Unfortudentally Kong will only listen to a woman that he saved from Gororsaurus a few days prior. In the end this is an enjoyable little bad film so see it if you want some laughs.".

Also he would not climb the Empire State building he would most likely annihilate it. He is back after his fight with Godzilla to once again save the day to some extent. It has been awhile since he last grace the screen since that fight but somehow he manages to get tangled in a plot by some madman to dig up stuff in a mine. This madman already has the formidable MechaKong at his disposal but MechaKong is incapable of digging in said mine thanks to something down there that causes it to malfunction. So they capture the real monkey and somehow hypnotize it to dig for them. Still you know in the end there is going to be a showdown between Kong and his mechanical counterpart. A fairly decent movie from the company of Toho however I will always like Godzilla the best. Still they have enough monsters and some pretty good fights to keep one entertained. I do believe this was Japanese King Kong's last movie which is a bit sad I would have loved to have seen a reemergence during the Hensei Godzilla movies and had Godzilla get some revenge for that earlier loss. MechaKong is rather cool but not as cool as MechaGodzilla mainly because MechaGodzilla just had way to many cool weapons and was a way more impressive fighting machine.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE PLOT  When a mechanical replica of King Kong Mecha Kong is unable to dig for the highly radioactive Element X at the North Pole the evil Doctor Who and his sponsor Madame X decide to kidnap the real Kong. Meanwhile a team expedition arrives on Mondo Island and explores the jungles where they encounter Kong fighting off various creatures. Kong develops a crush on the Lt. Susan Miller and our beauty and the beast portion of the film starts. As an insurance policy Doctor Who kidnaps Lt. Susan as well as her boyfriend Lt. Commander Jiro Nomura and Commander Carl Nelson. They escape and free Kong who heads for Tokyo. Doctor Who and his minions follow him and activate MechaKong in order to recapture him. Susan is then grabbed by the robot and is taken to the top of Tokyo Tower and a battle ensues between Kong and his robotic replica.REVIEW  I will say this is somewhat better than King Kong VS Godzilla but not much. CHARACTERS  Susan is better than Fumiko KKvG. Her character is stronger and more independent. When Kong captures her though fearful of him first she does care but takes to her own and doesn't go for Kong's moves instead telling Kong how to act. Well she's a Lt. so that's that. Nomura again the bland main hero same with Nelson. The villain Doctor Who is a fun villain but we don't get much of a motivation on his actions only because he's evil. Then there's Madame X who gets more of a character development. She's not on the side of evil because she wants to be evil she's there as an ambassadoragent of her country which they don't explain where trying to keep it safe for some reason. Yeah not much character plot is explained in this movie.EFFECTS  The special effects are much better this time around and while Kong looks better than he did previously with a bigger more detailed head and suit it still doesn't look that great. For example when he fights the serpent in the waters of Mondo Island you can clearly see the space between the mask and the suit like an over sized mascot head. Mecha Kong looks good but sometimes the metal looks a little bouncy. However the best suit effect in the entire movie is Gorosaurs the TRex type that fights Kong. This is one of the best monster suits Toho has ever put out on film and it realty shows. The fight is really fun to watch and entertaining as hell although when Kong breaks the jaw of Gorosaurus there's bubbles? What? Did he have a seizure? TRIVIA  The film was made this time not just by Toho RKO and Universal Yeah Universal did the English dub for the Toho Kong films considering the huge court battles and challenges it would have with Kong in the future the film was also released by RankinBass the studio responsible for those infamous stop motion Christmas specials The Animated HobbitReturn Of The King and The Last Unicorn. Back in the 60s they did a King Kong cartoon show following the plot to Escapes in which the film came in later. Funny side note after King Kong Escapes Rankin Bass would return to Toho for another Kaiju like production in 1977 called The Last Dinosaur. OVERALL  The film is quite enjoyable. Though it does drag at times the story is good and the characters are bland but fun. It's a good movie to show your young kids they might get a kick outta it and hey maybe you will too.".

Meanwhile the small crew of a passing submarine stumble onto the island and into the middle of this danger.Can there be many viewers who came to this film looking for a product that could be described as good in the purely traditional sense? Well given how few of this site's users have seen this film I cannot imagine there are many who come to this without knowing what they are letting themselves in for. For me I was looking for a bit of tacky fun with big monsters punching one another. So in regards those looking to laugh at poor effects bad acting and so on suffice to say that there is plenty of all these to serve up. However this is not just what makes it fun is it? No the entertainment value of the film is not about how bad it is but rather how cheesy it is and sadly King Kong Escapes doesn't quite deliver the goods in that regard because it is not as fun as one would like. Kong himself looks far too cheap to make you feel like someone has made an effort and although the fights are reasonably good there are not enough of them.The acting is mostly poor of course with the usual bad dubbing making it worse. That said I did enjoy Amamoto's hammy turn as the silly villain of the piece  although he could not make up for the wooden annoyance of Reason Miller and Takarade. On the whole this is a poor film  the acting effects direction and story are all bad but yet it might still appeal to those accepting the genre for what it is. Even still though it is not the best in the way of cheesy fun and it will be easiest to enjoy if tackled in a ironic knowing way.".

When he comes out of the cave and looks up at an airplane or chopper I think.Also he seemed a bit smaller than in Godzilla vs. King Kong. The scalejob done on this is pretty pitiful which again makes it even more fun to watch I guess because you can't take this movie seriously like you would Green Mile Schindler's List or Silence of the Lambs. I recommend this because I think anyone's kids would love this as I did growing up watching all of the Godzilla flicks or just an old fan like myself.It is better entertainment than the newest installment done by Peter Jackson and maybe more entertaining than the 1933 version simply because it is a bit slow and depressing by the end of it. I do sort of have a closet liking to the 1976 version the best of all King Kong movies. This might be a distant second or third. I own it so should you if you like the old Godzilla movies from the 50's 60's and 70's.".

Guy Rolfe Toulon Richard Lynch Major Krauss and Ian Abercrombie Doctor Hess also deliver strong performances.I was surprised at how high budget this film looks. Due to the season in which the film was made the director settled on filming the external shots over 3 days on the Universal backlot rather than shoot on location in Europe. The results are impressively convincing.My only complaint was that on the DVD I watched the UltraStereo soundtrack mixing had a heavy bias to the left channel.Puppet Master 3 is something of a rarity thesedays but it's well worth tracking down if you're a fan of the series.".

	schema:headline " A bunch of Pinocchios killing Nazis! Sign me up! Puppet Master III was a lot of fun.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Puppet Masters film series is always been one of my guilty pleasures. It is by no means a series of puppet masterpieces but it did entertains me as a kid of the 1990s. Coming off their success off of their first two direct to video movies 1989's 'Puppet Master'  1990's 'Puppet Master II' 1991's 'Puppet Master III Toulon's Revenge' is by far the best film in the series. Directed by David DeCoteau the entire plot has puppeteer Andre Toulon Guy Rolfe somehow back in Europe and somehow still alive despite the fact that he commit suicide in Bodega Bay CA in 1939 in the opening of the first movie. While this might look like a continuous of the first movie's flashback in reality this 3rd movie is not. It's a prequel. It's just the Full Moon Entertainment Writers goofing up with the chronology and not caring about explaining it. Whether by accident or design in the end they got their WWII movie with puppets. Anyways when the members of the Nazi Party notice that the antiNazi Toulon has the ability to animate his puppets without strings. Dr. Hess Ian Abercrombie and Major Kraus Richard Lynch are ordered to bring him in by General Mueller Walter Gotell leading to Toulon going on the run while also seeking revenge for the death of his beloved wife Elsa Sarah Douglas. Without spoiling the movie too much I have to say despite the chronology timeline mistake Puppet Master III is by far the most developed movie within the Puppet Master franchise. Not only does this film essentially tells some of the origin of the puppets but the film is full of depth and emotion. You really do feel something for the human characters unlike the other films that was full of unrealistic psychics  parapsychologists. I have to say I like this version of Andre Toulon. Guy Rolfe does a decent job making the character more engaging and sympathetic character than William Hickey and Steve Welles's versions. In their defensive Hickey's scenes in the first movie were kinda short to develop anything and Welles's character was written as the bad guy however I found Hickey to be a little too old for the part  for Welles I just didn't like his 'Invisible Man' style of acting. The supporting cast was just as good as Rolfe with Richard Lynch commanding the scenes with his film presence. He really look the part. He always found a way to draw your full attention. Still his character does do a lot of stupid decisions throughout the film that will make you question if his character is really a Major and not a private. Another thing I like about this film is how this film isn't a rethread of the first 2 movies with the puppets just randomly killing innocent people. In this they had reasons to target the Nazis as many of the puppet souls were once people that were victims by them. I like the fact that they made the Puppets into good guys since after all they are appealing. Once again you got Blade whom looks like a small version of the Fisherman hook killer from 1997's 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' whom sadly in this film get little screen time. I was deeply surprised by this movie that Blade was in fact a boy. I always thought of the puppet as a female. It also get weirder when you find out that this puppet has the soul of Dr. Hess in it. Blade looks and acts nothing like Dr. Hess at all. The only thing I can see is that both like to cut people. Even with that it's a bit of a stretch. One thing I glad this movie brought back is Leech Woman. I always hate the filmmakers of Puppet Master 2 for trying to kill her character. She's by far one of the most memorable puppets Toulon has around. It's also cool to see the Conehead lookalike muscle man mixed with Addams Family Uncle Fester who punch and strangles people Pinhead and the Tunneler that has a drill on his head that drills into people. One puppet that I can care less about is Jester. He's pretty much useless for most of the series. I honestly don't know why he's there. The same goes to Djinn whom appearance is a bit jarring. He somewhat disappears after this film. Anyways this brings up another issue. This time with the new puppet the funlooking SixShooter cowboy puppet who was made just for this film. I get that he's technically instory one of the oldest puppets that Toulon's owns but what happen to him since this film. He didn't appear in the first movie nor the 2nd. Somehow in the 4th movie he reappearance. It's very odd. Anyways the action scenes with them are quite enjoyable but I never bought the struggle between man Vs puppets. I just can't see how people in these film can't overpower them. Anyways most of their stop motion movement was always fantastic and creepy however there are some scenes in this film that the effects needed some work. Director David DeCoteau does a lot with the little amount of money he got. Surprising the set design is pretty good. He manage to recreate Nazi Germany quite convincingly on the Universal backlot for a rather modest budget. Still one thing this movie really goes over the top with is the graphic nudity. Did we really need that much rather fan service breast shots? Anyways I might be a bit biased on that since big boobs are some of my favorite's things to see. Overall Puppet Master III Toulon's Revenge is a stepup from the other two films however it's also marks the highest of highs for this film franchise as the next couple of films will not get any better. In the end this is as good as it gets.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Puppet Masters film series is always been one of my guilty pleasures. It is by no means a series of puppet masterpieces but it did entertains me as a kid of the 1990s. Coming off their success off of their first two direct to video movies 1989's 'Puppet Master'  1990's 'Puppet Master II' 1991's 'Puppet Master III Toulon's Revenge' is by far the best film in the series. Directed by David DeCoteau the entire plot has puppeteer Andre Toulon Guy Rolfe somehow back in Europe and somehow still alive despite the fact that he commit suicide in Bodega Bay CA in 1939 in the opening of the first movie. While this might look like a continuous of the first movie's flashback in reality this 3rd movie is not. It's a prequel. It's just the Full Moon Entertainment Writers goofing up with the chronology and not caring about explaining it. Whether by accident or design in the end they got their WWII movie with puppets. Anyways when the members of the Nazi Party notice that the antiNazi Toulon has the ability to animate his puppets without strings. Dr. Hess Ian Abercrombie and Major Kraus Richard Lynch are ordered to bring him in by General Mueller Walter Gotell leading to Toulon going on the run while also seeking revenge for the death of his beloved wife Elsa Sarah Douglas. Without spoiling the movie too much I have to say despite the chronology timeline mistake Puppet Master III is by far the most developed movie within the Puppet Master franchise. Not only does this film essentially tells some of the origin of the puppets but the film is full of depth and emotion. You really do feel something for the human characters unlike the other films that was full of unrealistic psychics  parapsychologists. I have to say I like this version of Andre Toulon. Guy Rolfe does a decent job making the character more engaging and sympathetic character than William Hickey and Steve Welles's versions. In their defensive Hickey's scenes in the first movie were kinda short to develop anything and Welles's character was written as the bad guy however I found Hickey to be a little too old for the part  for Welles I just didn't like his 'Invisible Man' style of acting. The supporting cast was just as good as Rolfe with Richard Lynch commanding the scenes with his film presence. He really look the part. He always found a way to draw your full attention. Still his character does do a lot of stupid decisions throughout the film that will make you question if his character is really a Major and not a private. Another thing I like about this film is how this film isn't a rethread of the first 2 movies with the puppets just randomly killing innocent people. In this they had reasons to target the Nazis as many of the puppet souls were once people that were victims by them. I like the fact that they made the Puppets into good guys since after all they are appealing. Once again you got Blade whom looks like a small version of the Fisherman hook killer from 1997's 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' whom sadly in this film get little screen time. I was deeply surprised by this movie that Blade was in fact a boy. I always thought of the puppet as a female. It also get weirder when you find out that this puppet has the soul of Dr. Hess in it. Blade looks and acts nothing like Dr. Hess at all. The only thing I can see is that both like to cut people. Even with that it's a bit of a stretch. One thing I glad this movie brought back is Leech Woman. I always hate the filmmakers of Puppet Master 2 for trying to kill her character. She's by far one of the most memorable puppets Toulon has around. It's also cool to see the Conehead lookalike muscle man mixed with Addams Family Uncle Fester who punch and strangles people Pinhead and the Tunneler that has a drill on his head that drills into people. One puppet that I can care less about is Jester. He's pretty much useless for most of the series. I honestly don't know why he's there. The same goes to Djinn whom appearance is a bit jarring. He somewhat disappears after this film. Anyways this brings up another issue. This time with the new puppet the funlooking SixShooter cowboy puppet who was made just for this film. I get that he's technically instory one of the oldest puppets that Toulon's owns but what happen to him since this film. He didn't appear in the first movie nor the 2nd. Somehow in the 4th movie he reappearance. It's very odd. Anyways the action scenes with them are quite enjoyable but I never bought the struggle between man Vs puppets. I just can't see how people in these film can't overpower them. Anyways most of their stop motion movement was always fantastic and creepy however there are some scenes in this film that the effects needed some work. Director David DeCoteau does a lot with the little amount of money he got. Surprising the set design is pretty good. He manage to recreate Nazi Germany quite convincingly on the Universal backlot for a rather modest budget. Still one thing this movie really goes over the top with is the graphic nudity. Did we really need that much rather fan service breast shots? Anyways I might be a bit biased on that since big boobs are some of my favorite's things to see. Overall Puppet Master III Toulon's Revenge is a stepup from the other two films however it's also marks the highest of highs for this film franchise as the next couple of films will not get any better. In the end this is as good as it gets.";

Andre' Toulon's wife is murdered by a SS officer for some reason so he uses his creations to get revenge...hence the title. This movie still sucks but is very fun. Again cool puppets kill Nazis. As a bonus this third entry in the series introduces the first appearance of the gunslinging puppet SixShooter which doesn't make sense because this takes place during WWII and the previous SixShooterless two movies take place in present time. But whatever. What makes this movie stand out above the rest is that the cast most of all Toulon himself and the main villain seem to be actually trying to make their characters cool. The lead Nazi is an interesting enough villain for a cheap horror movie and he has a small bit of charisma to keep him going. Toulon himself...at least has an interesting look and voice. The story seems to have a much better construction than any of the other titles. By the way do NOT watch Retro Puppet Master. You will hate yourself for it. So this is my favorite. Enjoy.".

I would tag it as the best of the lot so far. There's excellent performances stemming from the likes of Guy Rolfe who sympathetically fills the role as Toulon Ian Abercrombie and a suitably nasty cold hearted villain turn by Richard Lynch as Nazi Major Krauss. Rolfe and Lynch simply standout giving it a little more professionalism and class. What also makes their acting noticeable is that they have a better than average script which is suggestively tailored and tightly projected in letting the plot evolve and giving space to provide a backstory to the puppets especially that of Leech woman and Blade. Director David DeCoteau's compact handling is quickly paced and uses the obvious backlot sets quite well where he crafts lasting tension seamless excitement and atmospheric imagery of the artistically etched puppets which once again are expertly engineered and brought across as they gleefully hand out violently nasty and bloody attacks on the Nazis. Richard Band's recycled score is still as racy but consisting of an edgy kick within the darker moments.".

Indeed Toulon's explanation of how he makes his puppets gives everything a much more poignant significance.

Everything would have been so much better if only they had used this story for the entire series.  Even more amazing is how the film manages to deliver the comedy and inventive death scenes Puppet Master fans expect without ever cheapening the time period or feeling like a different movie.  The demise of the main Nazi is easily one of the most gruesome deaths I've seen on film.

	schema:reviewBody "Puppet Master 3 is to me much better than the original two not only that it's one of my favorites in the entire franchise. Don't get me wrong though this is a Puppet Master movie so it won't be without its cheesy low budget feel just like anything else put out by Full Moon. I'm always surprised when I see other reviews say that it's the worst acted of the franchise because I always felt that that was one of the better aspects of the movie! That amongst many other things is one of the reasons I really enjoy this film.The plot is much different than that of the first two. We find ourselves going back in time to Nazi Germany where the Nazi's are trying to reanimate the dead using drugs. Eventually Andre Toulon raises suspicion with his puppet show and his secrets are then discovered. After the Nazi's cause a great personal tragedy trying to capture him and the secret to his puppets Toulon begins to seek his revenge against the Nazi's.The time change in this movie for me helps a great deal it doesn't feel quite as worn out as the first two and still holds up pretty well today. The idea to tackle Nazi Germany was a very ambitious thing that most low budget movies wouldn't even consider but I'm glad Full Moon did it's necessary for us to see these things if we are to truly understand the origins of Andre Toulon and his puppets. For around an 800000 budget and shooting in the backlot of Universal Studios Puppet Master 3 does an amazing job of putting me in the location.The puppets in this movie are awesome as always and they get a decent amount of screen time learning how each puppet came to be is engaging and watching Toulon build his most famous puppet Blade is exciting I felt my anticipation building for Blade the entire movie. Once Blade does make his way into the movie he makes his presence felt as only Blade could. He is only in the movie for a short amount of time and that is one of the down sides of it at least if you're a Blade fan. We see the introduction of the Six Shooter puppet dressed like a cowboy he is a fun character and is always giggling and smiling. He has some fun scenes especially one where he kills a despised Nazi General unfortunately before this takes place we see Six Shooter climbing a building and wires are obviously visible. I will say this movie made me care about the puppets and I really didn't want to see any of them die being a prequel I was pretty sure that wouldn't happen but a few scenes still had me worried about them. This is the first Puppet Master film in which Toulon and his Puppet creations truly make the switch from bad guys to good guys which I think was necessary for the story Toulon wasn't a likeable character in prior installments but with the prequel story shown in part 3 Guy Rolfe does a great job of making us care for him. There are a few plot holes with the continuity though it had been said prior to part 3 that Toulon committed suicide in 1939 when this movie is set in 1941. I'm no history buff but this could have been done to fit the historical timeline involving Hitler and the Nazi's or it could just be a mistake on behalf of Full Moon either way it doesn't really bother me but I have to give the film a mark down for that.  This is a Puppet Master movie you can't go into it expecting some sort of greatness and you can't expect it to be problem free this is a movie for pure horror fans and fans of the franchise. So you can't be critical of the movie in a serious way or that takes all the enjoyment out of it it's undeniable that this is a fun movie! There are obvious mistakes that just with a retake or proper editing could have easily been fixed plus 1 or 2 continuity issues but besides that there are no major problems present in this film. The Puppet Master movies ruled the direct to video market and flooded video stores around the nation I have very fond memories of renting these movies and loving them as a kid and as I have grown up my opinion hasn't changed and neither has this movie. I can only hope we continue to see the Puppet Master franchise thrive today.".

	schema:reviewBody "Puppet Master III Toulon's Revenge is set in 'Berlin  1941' where scientist Dr. Hess Ian Ambercrombie is working on a project for the Nazi's in which he is attempting to bring the dead back to life so they can be used as a human shield in battle. Meanwhile puppet master Andre Toulon Guy Rolfe makes fun of Hitler in his show's fellow puppet maker  Nazi Lt. Eric Stein Kristopher Logan becomes aware of Toulon  his political satire which pokes fun at Hitler. Stein is also suspicious of Toulon's incredibly life like puppets he reports back to his boss Major Krauss Richard Lynch who sends the Gestapo in. Dr. Hess wants Toulon alive so he can find out how he gives life to his puppets Krauss captures Toulon but in the process kills his beloved wife Elsa Sarah Douglas. Toulon is devastated  vows vengeance on those who killed his wife  he uses his puppets special skills to do so...This Full Moon production was the third entry in the Puppet Master series of films an unusually high quality couple of flicks that introduced us to the pretty damned cool killer puppets of Andre Toulon. Since Full Moon aren't exactly know for the quality of the films they produce imagine my surprise when Puppet Master III Toulon's Revenge actually turned out to be good  considering David DeCoteau is one of the worst genre filmmakers ever I was doubly surprised. The script by C. Courtney Joyner is a fun little romp  showcases Toulon  his murderous puppets to good effect in a fairly original  well thought out story which is silly but not too silly  is set before the previous two Puppet Master films. The character's are good the dialogue is fine  there are some nice setpiece scenes involving the cool killer puppets which to be honest is the only reason anyone is watching this. This may sound silly but Puppet Master III Toulon's Revenge bears a few resemblances to the recent big budget Hollywood horror flick Hannibal Rising 2007 wait a minute don't laugh straight away because if you think about it both films are the third entries in their respective series both films are prequels to the previous two both films are at least in part set against the backdrop of World War II both films feature evil  sadistic GermansNazi'sthose associated with them both films feature the main title character hunting them down  gaining revenge on them for some horrible wrongdoing  both are when it comes down to it nothing more than simplistic revenge flicks. Sure the content may be different but the themes  ideas are actually not a millions miles from each other am I right or not? However Puppet Master III Toulon's Revenge isn't an overblown bore that goes on forever  I know which one I'd rather see again  it ain't Hannibal Rising.Director DeCoteau does OK which in itself is an achievement the film moves along at a nice pace there's some decent gore a touch of nudity in a couple of scenes  the killer puppets are just great fun to watch they are totally cool  I'd rather watch them than Chucky from the Child's Play films period. This one sees the first appearance of Six Shooter while I still say Blade is my favourite the special effects aren't quite as good as in the previous instalments  there's noticeably less of them but they're still fine. The ending is good here with the main bad guy strung up like a puppet himself using huge meat hooks attached to rope.With a supposed budget of about 800000 this didn't have much money spent on it so it's surprising at how good this looks it's not going to win any awards but it's competent with reasonable special effects  decent production values. The German period setting is well realised with convincing costumes  props this was actually shot at Universal Studios apparently. I must admit to really liking the main Puppet Master theme music  I'm glad they used it again here. The acting is fine with Rolfe  Lynch both putting in a decent shift as the hero  villain respectively.Puppet Master III Toulon's Revenge is a very good prequel sure it's not as good as either the original Puppet Master 1989 or Puppet Master II 1991 but it's still an entertaining killer toy type film that I enjoyed. Followed by Puppet Master 4 1993 Puppet Master 5 The Final Chapter 1994 Curse of the Puppet Master 1998 Retro Puppet Master 1999  finally Puppet Master The Legacy 2004 before the killer puppets appeared in the spinoff travesty that was Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys 2004.".

The story has him as a puppeteer during the Nazi regime. Many of his friends have been killed and he has indeed placed their souls so to speak in his special puppets. Certain Nazi agents are aware of this and want the secret tragedy ensues and Toulon begins his quest for revenge. Once again the plot is totally different from the other puppet master movies and it works great for a Full Moon film they should have made more movies like this and they might still be around today. Of course I do not know if they are gone or not but I have not seen a movie by them in a long time now. By movies like this they do not have to have super scripts or anything just a horror movie that did not feel the need to have lots of laughs in it. I like comedy horrors when done right but you have to do them right. This one is not a horror comedy but it has good pacing and rather good acting for a low budget movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen the first two Puppet Master films I was prepared for yet another 90 minutes of selftorture when I saw this one.... but I was wrong! I guess Full Moon got lucky the third time round.The plot for this one is much more interesting than the original and its clone. It is 1941 in Berlin and puppeteer Andre Toulon played by the superb Guy Rolfe entertains innocent kids with his antiNazi puppet show. However the Gestapo discover it and shut him down and try to steal his formula for bringing his puppets to live. In an attempt to do so they kill his wife. Toulon escapes with the puppets and goes into hiding resurfacing only to seek revenge on his hated Nazi killers.Sounds a lot more exciting than the first two doesn't it? And it is. I was watching for things to pick on all the way through this film and found very few.The first major revelation to the Puppet Master series by this film is that the CAST can ACT!!!!! Yes Guy Rolfe was born to play the clever wise intelligent and mellow Andre Toulon and he does so perfectly here bringing a lot of charisma and charm to the beloved puppeteer. He treats the puppets like his children. I suppose in a way they are. Yeah Guy Rolfe kicks ass as Toulon! Richard Lynch plays the films main villain Nazi leader Major Krauss. And yeah you really hate this guy  he looks like a twisted Marlon Brando and makes an excellent and sinister villain. Kristopher Logan plays the young Nazi Lt Eric Stein and we're all glad when he's dispatched by the puppets. Also credit goes to Ian Abercrombie who plays Dr Hess  another menacing performance. The acting this time is superb  I don't know what happened I guess there must have been a Full Moon the night they shot it.......The puppets are cooler than ever this time. All the usuals are present  except Torch from the second one as he wasn't made yet. The new puppet this time is SixShooter a cowboy puppet with six arms holding six pistols... SixShooter is cool. We also see the man who became Blade.. He looks very like him which is a cool effect.The tension in this film comes from Toulon hiding out and the Nazis chasing after him. Nothing is more fun than seeing Toulon's puppets kick Nazi ass. Well nothing in Full Moon movies.This is doubtless the best Puppet Master film  They should have started the series with this and thrown the first two film reels in the fire.".

Toulon escapes with the puppets and goes into hiding resurfacing only to seek revenge on his hated Nazi killers.Sounds a lot more exciting than the first two doesn't it? And it is. I was watching for things to pick on all the way through this film and found very few.The first major revelation to the Puppet Master series by this film is that the CAST can ACT!!!!! Yes Guy Rolfe was born to play the clever wise intelligent and mellow Andre Toulon and he does so perfectly here bringing a lot of charisma and charm to the beloved puppeteer. He treats the puppets like his children. I suppose in a way they are. Yeah Guy Rolfe kicks ass as Toulon! Richard Lynch plays the films main villain Nazi leader Major Krauss. And yeah you really hate this guy  he looks like a twisted Marlon Brando and makes an excellent and sinister villain. Kristopher Logan plays the young Nazi Lt Eric Stein and we're all glad when he's dispatched by the puppets. Also credit goes to Ian Abercrombie who plays Dr Hess  another menacing performance. The acting this time is superb  I don't know what happened I guess there must have been a Full Moon the night they shot it.......The puppets are cooler than ever this time. All the usuals are present  except Torch from the second one as he wasn't made yet. The new puppet this time is SixShooter a cowboy puppet with six arms holding six pistols... SixShooter is cool. We also see the man who became Blade.. He looks very like him which is a cool effect.The tension in this film comes from Toulon hiding out and the Nazis chasing after him. Nothing is more fun than seeing Toulon's puppets kick Nazi ass. Well nothing in Full Moon movies.This is doubtless the best Puppet Master film  They should have started the series with this and thrown the first two film reels in the fire.";

The ape said to be thirtysix feet tall is just some guy in a cheap gorilla suit that the filmmakers got at a costume shop or a yard sale. This isn't even a full body ape suit. It's got sleeves with gloves. There are several instances where you can see the skin of the guy's wrists as he moves his arms about. That's the level of quality we're talking here. That's how few beeps this movie gives. He's filmed mostly from the chest up. When they do try to show you some scale for the ape's size they do it with cheap stuff like toy boats and crummy miniature buildings. The ape also moves in slow motion throughout the movie. Let me be clear they didn't slow down the film. The actor in the ape suit just moved really slowly to emulate slow motion! Like a kid playing make believe.The cast is especially bad. This is the film debut of Joanna Kerns the mom from Growing Pains. Her screams will haunt me for weeks. So unbelievably shrill. Be prepared to turn your volume down. Laughably at one point while in the palm of the ape's hand Kerns stops screaming and says Be gentle with me big guy. She returns to screaming almost immediately. Bizarre! Kerns has a romantic subplot with a very '70slooking guy named Rod Arrants. They kiss a lot. Pretty much every time they are in the same scene Arrants is all over her. Longtime character actor Alex Nicol plays a foulmouthed Army Colonel here. I have to believe his performance is intended to be funny. It makes no sense any other way. Bruce MacRae is listed as responsible for the music. He should have been arrested and charged with assault. The score is relentless and will make your ears bleed.As the helicopters approach the ape he stands there and makes these wild gestures with his arms. For the life of me it looks a lot like he's dancing. Was the guy in the ape suit inebriated? Very likely. Further evidence of this is the scene where the ape flips off the Army. Yeah. The guy in the ape suit was loaded for sure. It's so terrible. There are lots of pointless scenes. Such as when the ape pulls a snake off of a tree and throws it  hitting the camera! This goes nowhere. It just cuts away to another scene and when it returns to the ape he's moved on to something else. The only reason I'm giving this a 2 instead of a 1 is because of the unintended comedy. It's one of the worst movies ever made.".

This goes nowhere. It just cuts away to another scene and when it returns to the ape he's moved on to something else. The only reason I'm giving this a 2 instead of a 1 is because of the unintended comedy. It's one of the worst movies ever made.";

If you'd enjoy watching a 60sec slowmotion scene where a guy in a gorilla costume wrestles an obviously dead shark thrashing it around and pretending to be in the throes of death look no further. This whole movie is full of great scenes like that and if it weren't for an overly drawn out love story subplot A.P.E. would be a 5star unintentional comedy. You get a little bit of everything in this South Korean flick Godzillastyle miniature sets toy model animals and people remote control helicopters firework explosions and of course a guy in a gorilla suit. The plot is not important really and the film gets right down to brass tacks after about 2min of backstory. Just know that there is a 35ft tall ape and he is going to rampage Korea. Throw in an American actress Joanna Kerns of Growing Pains fame her reporter boyfriend and a pair of Army officers bent on killing the beast and you have A.P.E. The direction and editing are sometimes stunningly inept resulting in several great WTF moments including my favorite when a character is hanging off the outside door of a moving jeep for seemingly no reason. Anyhow I could go on forever with this one. As far as bad movies go A.P.E. is a definite keeper. You are going to get laughs out of this one.".

The cherry on top of this cake is that 'Joanna Von Savant' of the title is really Joanna Kerns from TV's Growing Pains.  Apparently the 1980s weren't a good time for her between being fondled by a fake ape in a ripoff of a Dino Laurentis film or a TV mom to a bunch of stupid kids that go to a school that calls their sports team Hooters.In short don't watch APE.

The Ape flipped off the camera! What? Last time I checked Apes don't intentionally flip off cameras or anybody else for that matter.2. At one point when the Ape was stomping a village by a mountain the Ape was wearing high top tennis shoes. Tennis shoes!!!! No I'm sorry Mr. Film director Apes don't wear tennis shoes. Please if you are going to make a movie and it involves the portrayal of a wild animal with a human in an animal suit remember wild animals don't wear clothing. That's just a little fact of life of which everyone needs to be aware.This was a terrible movie. But not too terrible in a bad way. It was more terrible in a good funny way. It was fun to watch it was easy to make fun of it was an experience to remember. Movies cannot be made this bad on purpose they are accidents. Terrible terrible accidents. Accidents like 3Mile Island or the Jimmy Carter election. They are accidents that should have been prevented through careful evaluation of all people claiming to be film makers. Please if you ever hear of a movie like this ever being made again take a bat and start beating in the head of the director. Then take a lighter and some gasoline and burn down the studio. Then go get a paper shredder and shred the film. Then take the remaining shreds and toss them into the fire at the movie studio. Nothing this bad should ever exist again. Good Day.".

In the face of these doubts Richard eventually shows the kind of aggressive and skillful play that would make him one of the greatest players of all time as The Rocket. However for all his success Richard and his fellow French Canadians face constant discrimination in a league dominated by the English speaking. Although a man of few words Richard begins to speak his own mind about the injustice which creates a organizational conflict that would culminate in his infamous 1955 season suspension that sparks an ethnic riot in protest. In the face of these challenges Richard must decide who exactly is he playing for.";

	schema:reviewBody "In one of the comments on the film the writer asks why there's no mention of Henri Richard the Pocket Rocket. The film really takes us up to it's climax the Richard Riot and Henri fifteen years younger than Maurice was starring with the Junior Canadians. Although he came up to play with his brother in the last years of Maurice's career Henri was not on the team for the period covered by this film. The line of Henri at centre Dickie Moore on left wing and Maurice on right wing was called by the Rocket's great rival Gordie Howe the best line he ever played against. In a sense the movie stops at the point when Richard was the most popular player in Qubec that is before he became the greatest star in the rest of Canada too. When he received the Stanley Cup in Toronto after the Canadians swept the Leafs in four games straight to win their fifth championship in a row everybody sensed it could be his last game and he received a standing ovation in Maple Leaf Gardens a rare honour for any visiting player especially when he'd been throughout his career the Leafs' greatest rival. The film beautifully evokes the period when players were ordinary guys working for a living. The clothing and lighting are magnificent in capturing the feel of the forties and fifties and the hockey sequences are amazing in that having seen the Rocket play so many times I lost sight that it was Roy Dupuis not the Rocket on the screen. And the sequence in which he kayos Bob Dill Sean Avery in a piece of type casting if there ever was one! is a dandy. That happened in New York and the Daily News the tabloid famous for its great headlines featured a fullpage image of the Rocket standing over his fallen rival with a huge headline DILL PICKLED. I wish they'd put that in the film. Richard had a unique skating style and was unusual in those days because there were few lefthand shots playing right wing. And they were able to recreate one of the greatest goals in detail when the Rocket after being knocked out by Boston's Leo Labine in the playoffs returned in overtime and went end to end to score the winning goal against Sugar Jim Henry. Dupuis and the film magicians capture Richard's swooping darting style beautifully. Richard may not have been the best player who ever played but he was the greatest star the game will ever see. See this film and you'll be as close to seeing the real Rocket as it's possible to be.".

	schema:headline " a humble film about a humble and great man";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an excellent film. I think that thing that I enjoyed most about this film is its humility. Despite his passion and brilliance on the ice Maurice Richard was a humble man who never wore the mantle of greatness easily. Many of his accomplishments are depicted in this movie but in a way that reflects this humble yet utterly brilliant and great man. I was fortunate to be at the last game played in the Montreal Forum almost 40 years after Richard last played for the team. The sixteen minute standing ovation and outpouring of emotion for this man when he was brought to centre ice is one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.If you're not from Quebec and more specifically from Montreal then it may be hard to understand the impact that this man had on the province. He was during his playing days literally seen as a religious icon. This movie does an amazing job at telling the story of the Rocket's lasting social impact upon Quebec and it does so in a very quiet and compelling fashion.I should also point out the incredible detail that has gone into this film. As well as being an excellent actor Roy Dupuis is a deadringer for the rocket. Mike Ricci is a carbon copy of Elmer Lach and Vincent Lecavalier is a ringer for Jean Beliveau. The cages separating standing room from the seats were an actual feature of the forum through the 40s and very much a symbol of FrenchCanadian working class discontent in Montreal at the time. The photograph sequence of Sugar Henry the Boston goalie who shakes Richard's hand after his gameseries winning goal in the playoffs is lifted right out of the hockey history booksan amazing detail.".

The attention to details is impressive it really looks like the fifties. Many actual hockey players ad a little part in this movie like Mike Ricci and did well. Richard worked hard to get to the NHL he worked in a day factory and in the evening played hockey even if he was extremely tired. A must see movie for all the hockey fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a true biopic depicting events that could be considered as corner stones of NHL's History as well as Hockey History. it exposes the life of the Rocket since he was a teenager. All facts are historical  the depression just before WW2 the social divisions as those cages that surrounded an area reserved for francophones in the Forum. Most dialogs in hockey scenes are in English as well as all those involving the team coaches and so on which is by respect of historical facts in the original french version. Actually many dialogs are recreated as they took place and can be verified in many biography about The Rocket even the coach's Irvin pep talks. Hockey scenes are true to reality as the scenarios were matched with game descriptions and old clips were reviewed by Richard himself before dying and also his wife his children as by Irvin sun's written and recorded testimonies and memories from his father he was the first Mr. Hockey Night in Canada on CBC reporters and so on.About the cast my discovery is STEPHEN McHATTIE! HE IS JUST SUPERB IN IRVIN'S ROLE. Now that's a coach!! WOW. Actually the most credible I've seen in all sports movies around. Some of you who don't know about the Rocket could find in Roy Dupuis some kind of weird acting... But actually he played his role to the perfection magnificently displaying the same kind of personality and behavior the Rocket had he had the chance to study the guy's attitude in person for several years. The movie also adds historical drama like the year when the Rocket broke Malone's record a record that most considered as impossible to surpass and which brought some sense of Victory to the people just month before DDay in Normandy feb. 1945.What you'll see in this movie is what made such a man a true Canadian Hero as it really was and took place during those days. It is also a true love story about the couple Richard.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many sports fans today recognize the nickname The Rocket and probably only think of Major League pitcher Roger Clemens. However long before Clemens was The Rocket from Montreal.This movie is a nice tribute to him  Maurice Rocket Richard  one of the greatest professional hockey players of all time. A lot of people  especially in Quebec  still think he's THE greatest of all time. Those kind of things are always up for debate and there is no answer who is the greatest but Richard's career numbers certainly rank him as a leading candidate for that honor. For many years the National Hockey Leauge had just six teams and played 50 regular season games. Richard was the first to score 50 goals in 50 games. He also was on eight Stanley Cup championship teams including five in a row.His statistics go on and on but it was Richard's heart his determination to succeed under adverse conditions and finally his stance in sticking up against the bias against FrenchCanadians in the NHL that brought him icon status in Quebec. He is truly a legend in his country and probably will be revered forever in Montreal.How much of this movie is fact and how is fiction I can't say. If you know movies you know that many times a lot of it is made up for dramatic purposes. Yet I think most of it here is pretty much on the money. I'm not sure about the riot scene because I think the movie infers that people rioted because of Maurice's big suspension.but according to the report below the riot occurred thanks to the league president attending a playoff game in Montreal following his disciplinary action.This is from the Wikopedia On March 13 1955 Richard was given a match penalty for engaging in a fight with Hal Laycoe in a game against the Boston Bruins. He flattened Linesman Cliff Thompson in the resulting mle and as that was his second attack on an official that season alone a hearing was held Richard was suspended for the balance of that season and the playoffs which was at the time the longest suspension for an onice incident in NHL history. Public outrage from Montreal soon poured in but NHL President Clarence Campbell did not budge and announced that he would be attending the Canadians' next home game against the Detroit Red Wings in four days.Midway into the first period Campbell arrived with his fiance. Outraged Canadians fans immediately began pelting them with eggs vegetables and various debris with more being thrown at him each time the Red Wings scored as they built up a 41 lead. The continuous pelting of various objects stopped when a tear gas bomb was set off inside the Forum not far from where Campbell was sitting. The Forum was ordered evacuated and Campbell ruled the game forfeited to the Red Wings. A riot ensued outside the Forum causing 500000 in damage to the neighborhood and the Forum itself. Hundreds of stores were looted and vandalized within a 15block radius of the Forum. Twelve police and 25 civilians were injured and scores of people were arrested. The riot was over at 3 a.m. and left Montreal's Rue SteCatherine a mess.Whatever the movie overall is entertaining and gives a good insight on what Richard and his peers went through in a biased NHL at that time. The film is as much about the prejudice as it is a biography of Richard. The only drawbacks I saw were wooden acting in some spots too much dumb dialog and some of the action scenes which didn't look as real as it could have been. However this wasn't a megabucks production so I didn't expect it to look as such. I was very impressed however with the wonderful photography in here. That looks bigbudget all the way. Kudos to the cinematographer.It was fun to see hockey players playing the game as they did in the old days wearing no helmets and facemasks and not a whole lot of padding. If you think hockey is a rough sport now you should have seen it back in Richard's day. You can an idea watching this movie. There are some brutal scenes on the ice. Seeing Richard punching the referee was worth the price of the rental alone! If you're a hockey fan or a sports fan who loves history you have to check this film out. Why it took several years to hit the video shelves I don't know.".

	schema:headline " A movie that lives up to the adage a picture is worth a thousand words";
	schema:reviewBody "Superb movie all around. Knowing the Rocket from only watching him as a hockey player what I found most impelling was the love story between Maurice and Lucille. Much too short. Just perfect. But at the same time would have loved to have seen more.Obviously being a Canadian old enough to remember the early years of Maurice Richard's professional life and the 6 team NHL from the late 40's this movie is a nobrainer to recommend.From the very beginning The Rocket is a scene turner. Photographed in black and white made it more realistic.Glad in part that it is in the mother language of the participants. Perhaps it would have been better if it were entirely in English but that would have taken away from the realism. Having to continually drop my eyes to read the subtitles was of course interruptive. However The Rocket is so well photographed and directed that it was able to tell its story with minimal dialogue and thus prove the old adage a picture is worth a thousand words.".

	onyx:emotionText "Superb movie all around. Knowing the Rocket from only watching him as a hockey player what I found most impelling was the love story between Maurice and Lucille. Much too short. Just perfect. But at the same time would have loved to have seen more.Obviously being a Canadian old enough to remember the early years of Maurice Richard's professional life and the 6 team NHL from the late 40's this movie is a nobrainer to recommend.From the very beginning The Rocket is a scene turner. Photographed in black and white made it more realistic.Glad in part that it is in the mother language of the participants.

	schema:reviewBody "I have been a hockey fan for almost 40 years and have collected almost every dramatic film ever made about the sport. But I'd have to say that The Rocket is far and away the best one ever made. The cinematography is stunning the acting spellbinding and the story gripping. It tells the story of a simple and tortured man who drives himself to excel at the sport he loves. It leads him to become the reluctant hero of FrenchCanadian culture selfperceived as being held back and oppressed by the anglophones.Roy Dupuis who portrayed Maurice in no less than two other cinematic projects perfectly captures the fire and intensity of the man in a most fitting if not THE crowning tribute to the legend of Maurice The Rocket Richard. Biname goes to great lengths to duplicate the look and feel of the late30s on into the mid50s and certainly captures the collective agony and anger of earlytomid 20th century French Canada.Julie LeBreton is beautiful and amazing as Richard's wife Lucille. Notable also are the cameo appearances made by NHLers Sean Avery Bob Dill Vincent Lecavalier Jean Beliveau Mike Ricci Elmer Lach Ian Laperierre Boom Boom Geoffrion and Stephane Quintal Dollard St. Laurent. What Slap Shot proved The Rocket confirms. Pro hockey players are damn good actors!I realize funding for this movie was brought up in the infamous Sponsorship Scandal that dissolved former Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin's Liberal government in 2006 but you can't fault it at any level. It was worth every cent used to make it and it will be hard for Canadian cinema to duplicate this level of quality ever again.".

Many interesting facts or ideas are not followed through  every time you think that there's finally going to be something explored in more depth the movie moves on to something else and it's a pity. For instance Maurice Richard's relationship with his brotherinlaw isn't very clear. His brotherinlaw appears quite often in the movie but it is not quite clear why that is the case. He is always asking for better tickets for the games and that's it. He never seems to get them but we are never told why or why this should be relevant to the movie. There is also a very short passage about gambling but nothing comes of that either. Same thing with Richard's children. And what is probably the most important subject of the movie the oppression of the Qubcois in their own province and in Canada in general falls completely flat. Hardly any context on this highly sensitive and political issue is given and it is not clear whether Richard's actions did anything to improve the situation it would have been nice to get a bit more information on that count. All in all it is a very superficial movie which is a pity because the subjectmatter could have been used in such a way to make a very good film.".

They also capture the roughandtumble ultracompetitive feeling of Original Six hockey where only the best of the best made it in and many players repeatedly had to fight  literally and figuratively  to keep their jobs. The hockey action is right up there with Miracle in quality. It's also kind of funny to see the modernday players making cameos in the movie struggling with the flat sticks and smaller equipment from that era. Roy Dupuis also does a fine job of portraying the slowly building frustration and ultimately rage inside the Rocket as the NHL appears to discriminate against him on the ice.The only complaint I had about the movie and maybe I'm alone here and maybe I'm just being cynical but there were little bits that felt manipulative. Some American directors and I'm not naming names but one of them is Steven Spielberg are getting into the habit of making movies specifically designed to win a lot of awards. They put these tugatyourheart moments into the movie but really they make you roll your eyes so hard you almost pull a muscle. At times the movie came close to turning into the Canadian Cinderella Man but fortunately it passed quickly. Maurice Richard was probably one of the five best hockey players of all time and this movie certainly does his story justice.And if that's not enough Sean Avery gets the crap beat out of him which drew loud applause at the screening I attended.".

The recreation of the period wartime and postwar Quebec is very good. The ice action is exciting and some of the editing is excellent. Mostly patrons will enjoy the title performance by Roy Dupuis whose tense and interiorized delivery is riveting.The film's achievement is to present the social and historical setting with restraint. The film could have been iconography since Rocket Richard was the Babe Ruth and Joe Louis of the FrenchCanadians and the fight with Dill was the Schmelling fight. But the movie does not rise to that bait We are reminded that the greatest player in history Richard had to toil over a drillpress to earn a living even while enjoying fame. The nascent pride of the FrenchCanadian and the simmering needs of the impoverished Montreal workingclass are offered without shouting which is how they'd have been offered in the period of 19401955.Elements of historical realism are good. Especially wonderful is the depiction of the press of the period and of the Frenchspeaking announcers. Radio French then was so good that it might have been called precious a condition of radio employment of the time and a bit pedantic for a Quebec audience. Also interesting was how circumspect the pride was on the French side. People in the US South and Cajun Louisiana will relate to this.On the negative side are lots of things related to production value. Basically the writing is poortopedestrian. Dialog is obvious and clumsy either needlessly echoing the sentiments of the period or conveying chunks of story that should be organic not crassly narrated. The film is poorly focused too beginning correctly with the Forum Riot but never truly coming back to that event. The entire movie should have been constructed as a series of flashbacks from one defining event it should also have been built with intimate scenes not grouptalk in the locker room. Yet the film skitters all over the map hopping from one large scoring scene to another one period to another sequentially and without any central moment. This is complicated by a confusing series of hockey games where the precise stakes of each game playoffs? regular season? final game?? are not explicit. Since Richard was so driven and efficient the entire dramatic tension then evolves into his domestic conflict where he agonized about being a young father putting himself at risk. Yet even that is fuzzy since there's no one single domestic event offered to help make it palpable. All you then see is the longsuffering wife worrying about what might happen to her husband.Because dialog is so bad major characters like Dick Irvin drone in melodramatic tones onedimensional where in fact they were more complicated. Finally the film technique might have better exploited the speed and drama of the games themselves.This is so far under Raging Bull that we won't even go there and its techniques don't match the sophisticated Quebec cinema of today. Nevertheless it's a good film especially for the Worshippers and all fans of hockey and even history. Rocket Richard was a phenomenon not just an athlete and this film helps us to understand why with some great acting and much entertaining and emotionally draining material.".

All you then see is the longsuffering wife worrying about what might happen to her husband.Because dialog is so bad major characters like Dick Irvin drone in melodramatic tones onedimensional where in fact they were more complicated. Finally the film technique might have better exploited the speed and drama of the games themselves.This is so far under Raging Bull that we won't even go there and its techniques don't match the sophisticated Quebec cinema of today. Nevertheless it's a good film especially for the Worshippers and all fans of hockey and even history. Rocket Richard was a phenomenon not just an athlete and this film helps us to understand why with some great acting and much entertaining and emotionally draining material.";

My first reaction was  sports movie? probably just another Rudi or Coach Carter. However there was much more to this movie than winning the game. In fact unlike the typical Hollywood sports movie the protagonist always saw things negatively never seeing himself as the greatest player or anything. The essence of the story too is beautifully presented. I have the feeling that there is more of a racist theme than a sports theme here. The most powerful moment is possibly the one where the coach makes a speech in terrible french but tries to connect with his players and putting himself on the same level with them.On the film making aspects there is just one thing to say  beautiful! The arts department did an amazing job at recreating Quebec in the WWII era and the cinematography was well... amazing. The different colors used for different settings the camera work it was all a little different from other movies of its kind it was truly a pleasure to watch!! So my final verdict is this...even if you don't care whatsoever about hockey if you want to see a great movie watch Maurice Richard The Rocket!".

I'm sure the man in real life had some happy moments.The hockey scenes were great and probably more realistic than any hockey movie made. The real story driving the movie though was outside of hockey as Richard tries to use his fame to better the lives of french speaking Quebeckers and also to turn the NHL establishment away from it's 'oldboy' network ways.The struggle between player and opponent suddenly becomes dwarfed by his struggle as man vs establishment. That's when the movie really takes off and yet suddenly ends leaving you feeling a bit like the movie is not quite finished. Hence my rating of only 7 when I really wanted to give it a 8.5 or 9.".

	schema:reviewBody "King Kong is the benchmark against which all the monster films for the past 70 years have been measured. Some like Gorgo and the Godzilla series have certainly exceeded Kong in terms of mayhem and carnage while others like the Jurassic Park franchise have used the latest CGI technology to technically at least surpass the painstakingly crafted models brought to animated life by Willis O'Brien. However Kong himself has defied the ages.The same unfortunately cannot be said for The Son of Kong. This film has been muchmaligned and some of the criticism is justified. Still The Son of Kong is an entertaining if not magnificent film. Son has the distinction of being the first monster movie sequel probably ironically this is the reason it could not live up to its predecessor. Since the plot has already been discussed at length in other comments I won't rehash it here.Considering the phenomenal financial success of King Kong it seems incredible RKO did not allocate a bigger budget for The Son of Kong. In this day of multiple movie franchises the opposite is often true each sequel gets a bigger and bigger budget though in most cases an inferior script. In 1933 however despite King Kong's huge profits RKO was still floundering and the front office considered Kong's success a fluke. They weren't willing to invest more money for a bigger sequel instead they believed the first film's popularity would 'sell' it no matter what the quality. Thus only about half of King Kong's budget was allotted for the sequel. To make matters worse only about eight months was allowed for its production! Under such circumstances the Son of Kong was virtually sabotaged from the start. Even so the film had elements of style and technical polish that salvaged it from being a total loss. The Son of Kong can be considered a legitimate if not auspicious heir to his mighty father.What I find interesting is that the film was promoted back when first released as a 'serio comic phantasy' though little of it was intentionally funny. Robert Armstrong once again as Carl Denham was allowed a wider range of emotion and had some humor imbued in his character even allowing the formerly hardboiled Denham to 'crack up and go sappy' for the dark haired Hilda played by Helen Mack. Likewise Frank Reicher as Captain Englehorn again and Victor Wong Charlie the cook got a lighter treatment than the original film but for the most part the actors played it 'straight.' Likewise with the prehistoric denizens of Skull Island the Styracosaurus was a definite if brief menace as were the cave bear the quadruped dinosaur that enters the treasure cave and the sea monster. In fact the only real comedian was little Kong himself and sadly that's the part that jars me the most. In a film that looked as carefully crafted as the original complete with impressive glass paintings miniature jungle sets and even improved compositing the almost cartoonish style in which Kong Jr. was animated undermines what could have been. Willis O'Brien who'd labored so hard on King Kong had reservations over the sequel and script and supposedly did not contribute that much to the overall picture. Also tragedy struck during production when Obie's estranged wife shot and killed their two sons then attempted suicide. It's small wonder Obie had little enthusiasm for the Son of Kong and for the rest of his life he was reluctant to discuss the film. Instead it was Obie's assistant Buzz Gibson who completed much of the stop motion. It's possible both Obie and Gibson animated different scenes with Kong Jr. for the ape's animation is smoother in some sequences for instance when Denham bandages Kong's oversized middle finger than in others possibly due to Obie's ability to handle more 'subtle' gesture and performance.Max Steiner King Kong's composer created an original if not quite as memorable score for the Son of Kong although during the climatic submersion of Skull Island much of King Kong's score was inserted probably due once again to budgetary restrictions. One interesting note about the score whether it was intentional on Steiner's part or not he derived a threenote motif for the conniving cowardly Helstrom portrayed by John Marston that is an exact reversal of the famous threenote theme for King Kong. Musically this unconsciously underscores the fact that indeed Helstrom is Kong's opposite while Kong was ferocious fearless and yet chivalrous and tender with Fay Wray Helstrom is full of human failings. As the bad guy of the picture Helstrom isn't a larger than life villain just an inept drunk who konks his drinking companion with a bottle of booze killing the man unintentionally. He lies incites mutiny and finally tries to abscond with the castaways' only means of escaping the doomed island. He basically represents someone nearly all viewers may have known at one time or another. In other words Helstrom is a loser.Overall the Son of Kong is something of a missed opportunity. There is much of King Kong carried over into this film due largely to most of the first film's crew from director Ernest B Schoedsack on down having worked on this sequel. Considering what little budget and time was allotted it's a wonder what sumptuous and engaging visuals they were able to deliver. On the other hand had Willis O'Brien's personal fortunes been kinder perhaps little Kong would have been given a little more dignity. Next time you decide to view King Kong try to follow it up with his nearlyforgotten offspring. You may not be as awed but as sequels go it's a fine way to spend an hour and some minutes. As a moderatelyscaled adventure and as a footnote to an enduring classic it's worth taking that extra journey back to Skull Island.".

	schema:headline " The Son also rises";
	schema:reviewBody "Of the films in what I like to call the Great Ape Trilogy King Kong The Son of Kong and Mighty Joe Young this is my pet favorite. I loved The Son of Kong as a kid but hadn't seen it in years until I rented it recently from my local public library. Was it as good as I remembered? No  it was even better!This movie generally gets a bad rap and I admit that some of the criticisms are valid It was rushed it can't compete with King Kong in terms of spectacle or horror it's a light dessert after a steak dinner. Because it's a sequel it is fair to compare it to the original and in some respects the comparisons are unfavorable. It's not exactly Bride of Frankenstein or The Godfather Part II. But it's a wonderful film in its own right.The best thing about The Son of Kong is that it makes perfect sense. Carl Denham played as in the original by Robert Armstrong is being sued by practically everyone in New York for the death and destruction caused by King Kong. That's exactly what would happen not just in 1933 but especially today which gives this old movie an unexpected freshness. Also because of severe budgetary and time restrictions the filmmakers knew they couldn't make another spectacle so they wisely went in the other direction. The result is a smaller and far more lighthearted film whose titular character is a charming innocent who acts exactly the way a young ape would act. He's curious he's playful and he's friendly but he's also suitably ferocious when attacked or when protecting his human friends as a watchdog pup would be.There's also a sweetness and compassion about this film not only in the kindly attitude toward animals Little Kong in particular but in the relationship between the remorseful Denham and the lonely Hilda touchingly played by Helen Mack a beautiful and underrated actress who gives what I think is the best performance in the picture.The Son of Kong is wonderfully atmospheric mainly in the scenes on Skull Island but also in those in Dakang and aboard the Venture. Considering they were so rushed to finish the film the animators and technicians did a superb job especially the great Willis O'Brien who reportedly didn't like the final product. That's too bad because he did some of his best work on this movie as evidenced by Little Kong's alternately thrilling and amusing fight with a giant cave bear by the cataclysmic storm and earthquake that rock the island and by some of the small touches that set O'Brien apart from everyone else in his field. Kudos also go to Max Steiner whose musical score is almost as good as it was in King Kong.Then there's the humor which is delightful contrasting nicely with the darker and sadder aspects of the film. It's provided primarily by Mickey the process server played impishly by Lee Kohlmar and of course by Little Kong himself. Yes it's slightly overdone a couple of times as when Little Kong scratches his head and anthropomorphically shrugs in a display of confusion but overall it's a welcome and essential element.In addition to Robert Armstrong and Helen Mack the actors play their parts well. Frank Reicher returning as Capt. Englehorn Victor Wong back in an expanded role as Charlie the cook whom he plays with dignity and a certain twinkle John Marston marvelously slimy as the villainous Helstrom and Ed Brady as a surly mutineer round out a good cast.Ruth Rose's script is witty gritty and realistic. It has been criticized for borrowing clichs and all from plenty of timeworn tales but I don't care. For me it works. And the finale can mist the eyes of even the strongest man.All in all The Son of Kong is a terrific if brief only an hour and 10 minutes adventure. It's also a love story as well as a tale of heroic sacrifice and ultimate redemption. I'm happy to say that one of my favorite childhood movies is now one of my favorite adulthood films too. Here's looking at you kid.".

	onyx:emotionText "Of the films in what I like to call the Great Ape Trilogy King Kong The Son of Kong and Mighty Joe Young this is my pet favorite. I loved The Son of Kong as a kid but hadn't seen it in years until I rented it recently from my local public library. Was it as good as I remembered? No  it was even better!This movie generally gets a bad rap and I admit that some of the criticisms are valid It was rushed it can't compete with King Kong in terms of spectacle or horror it's a light dessert after a steak dinner. Because it's a sequel it is fair to compare it to the original and in some respects the comparisons are unfavorable. It's not exactly Bride of Frankenstein or The Godfather Part II. But it's a wonderful film in its own right.The best thing about The Son of Kong is that it makes perfect sense. Carl Denham played as in the original by Robert Armstrong is being sued by practically everyone in New York for the death and destruction caused by King Kong. That's exactly what would happen not just in 1933 but especially today which gives this old movie an unexpected freshness. Also because of severe budgetary and time restrictions the filmmakers knew they couldn't make another spectacle so they wisely went in the other direction. The result is a smaller and far more lighthearted film whose titular character is a charming innocent who acts exactly the way a young ape would act. He's curious he's playful and he's friendly but he's also suitably ferocious when attacked or when protecting his human friends as a watchdog pup would be.There's also a sweetness and compassion about this film not only in the kindly attitude toward animals Little Kong in particular but in the relationship between the remorseful Denham and the lonely Hilda touchingly played by Helen Mack a beautiful and underrated actress who gives what I think is the best performance in the picture.The Son of Kong is wonderfully atmospheric mainly in the scenes on Skull Island but also in those in Dakang and aboard the Venture.

Well actually it was and with a grand jury about to rule against him Denham decides it's time for a long ocean voyage.Poor Denham must've done something to insult Poseidon though because no matter how much he wants to avoid it he gets blown right back to Skull Island. This time he's looking for a treasure but when the ungrateful natives force him to land on a remote part of the island he immediately stumbles upon the orphaned Son of Kong. He knows this because of the obvious family resemblance. We never do find out what happened to Mrs. Kong.The original was the greatest special effects film ever made and for reasons more than just the outstanding effects. Any attempt to duplicate this particularly in a quickly made sequel could not possibly have come close and would have been nothing more than a shameless attempt to make some quick cash. In other words a typical Hollywood sequel. The creators of Son wisely do not make this attempt. Instead using the original's subtle satire of the film industry as its starting point Son of Kong becomes a broad parody of Hollywood movies in general and of the original King Kong itself.At one hour and 10 minutes this movie is exactly the right length of time. No gag or idea is drawn out for even a moment longer than it is capable of sustaining. The special effects are still excellent but are now secondary to the antics of the characters including the comic mugging of Kong Jr. himself.

Plus the budget of this one was less than 13 the budget of the original. This is why the special effects are so few and so much less than those of the original. Still Son of Kong is some fun RKO entertainment. Robert Armstrong is back as Carl Denham and he is good although a little weary after his adventures in the first one it has been a month since Kong died. Fay Wray does not return and they have replaced her character with a stowaway girl played by Helen Mack. No she's no Fay Wray but she's cute and likable. Charlie the Chinese cook is back with a bigger part. Although he seems nothing more than a racial stereotype now for the time his role was probably seen in a better light. He may speak pigeonEnglish but he's seen as a human being by the other characters. The son of Kong is unfortunately more humanized than Kong was they tried to make him seem more like a curious animal which I think was the right decision but he's a chip off the old block at least when it comes to monster fighting. The animation is cruder but it is passable. It's a decent flick that runs at only 70 minutes. Don't expect too much more. 710".

The early part of the movie gives a gritty and realistic depiction of the squalid little fever ports of the South Seas where an old tramp steamer would have gone searching for cargoes in the early part of the 20th century. The atmosphere down and out characters and their pathetic circumstances are straight out of a Joseph Conrad novel. It should be noted that Merian C. Cooper who produced both this film and its precursor was a former World War I aviator who became a real life Carl Denham producing a number of high adventure and cannibal and jungle documentaries often a loosely applied term that were popular with movie audiences of the times.After what amounts to a Marxist mutiny led by a mate known as Red the principal players eventually reach Kong island in the boat in which they were cast adrift. There they meet up with Kong Jr. a sweet playful giant gorilla who's still no slouch when it comes to fighting other monsters to protect his human friends. The movie becomes a bit too cutesy towards the end and almost seems to be rushing to a conclusion. I usually find that movies are overly long but this one could have used more development of its denouement.I won't spoil the ending but I will say that this is one of the few movies that ever made me cry. Nothing morbid or truly depressing though. A fine family film and truly unique in many respects.".

Out of those forty minutes there's maybe ten or fifteen minutes of necessary story. The rest is filler. When Little Kong does show up it's not that impressive. He's played mostly for laughs at times resembling the Bumble from Rudolph the RedNosed Reindeer!

If that's true then it probably speaks to Mr. Armstrong's vanity since he got to be the romantic leading man and hero for this one. He's likable and his performance is fine but Carl Denham being made into the hero is one of the many problems with this movie. Denham's rough edges are what made him such a good character in the first film. Softened up he's a rather bland character and a poor fit for leading man. Helen Mack is no Fay Wray but she's very attractive and does about as well as can be expected given the weak script.

And righteously so! Who could possibly blame director Ernest B. Schoedsack and his film crew for trying to gain some more dollars out the tremendous box office hit King Kong released only 8 months earlier? Unlike the milestone his daddy starred in Son of Kong certainly isn't a mustsee film but it nonetheless remains an enjoyable lightheaded little film that still features all the nifty elements of its predecessor only to a lesser degree. The miniape is still an engaging Willis O'Brien creation but his appearance is a lot more brief and comical. The story of this sequel supposedly takes place one month after King Kong climbed up the Empire State Building and has Carl Denham Robert Armstrong reprises his role fleeing from all his New York creditors. He sails off to see and along with a whole bunch of people that aren't worth introducing he washes ashore Skull Island again where they encounter the son of King Kong. The film is never boring but it's totally pointless and it can't seem to decide whether it wants to be adventurous or simply cute. Also it's difficult to accept the character of Carl Denham as a hero all of a sudden since he was the greedy bastard responsible for King Kong's downfall.Oh and another thing I'm not a great biologist but apes don't come crawling out of eggs as far as I know. So assuming King Kong isn't a hermaphrodite there should also be a Mother Kong somewhere! Where the hell is she? Wasn't her story interesting enough to tell? Is she such an atypical female that she decided to stay out of the picture during the cinematic adventures of both her man and son? Or maybe she went back to living with MotherinLaw Kong when she noticed her husband fancied Fay Wray and followed her all the way to New York? Now that's something to think about!".

In it the adventuring entrepreneur Carl Denham flees New York after the King Kong debacle that he was responsible for and ends up back at Skull Island. Needless to say he soon encounters the son of Kong.It's quite strange for a sequel to even acknowledge the financial lawsuits that follow the mayhem caused by the monster in the previous film. But oddly and charmingly this one not only does but even goes as far as to make it a narrative springboard for the subsequent adventure. Unfortunately the filmmakers decided to replace the horror aspects of the first film with comedy. So the tone of the movie is more playful than threatening which is to its detriment ultimately. It seems pretty obvious that this film must have been squarely aimed primarily at kids. Unlike his dad the giant ape in this one seems to really like humans which kind of takes away some of the plot dynamics although in truth once we meet Kong the action doesn't really move far from the one location. This probably ties in with the quickness of the production once we finally get to Skull Island we find Kong easily and don't move once we do. It's a shame as it dilutes the adventure aspect somewhat. Nevertheless Kong does get to fight a dinosaur and a giant bear and the stopmotion animation from Willis O'Brien is still more than decent. It ends on a big scale but kind of stupid climax.Son of Kong can best be described as a charming movie. It's got a fair few shortfalls particularly in its very basic screenplay. But it is very short so plot weaknesses aren't too painful to bear and it never gets boring. It's certainly no classic but its good fun overall.".

	schema:reviewBody "If I hazarded a guess I would say that Son Of Kong came about because David O. Selznick had a lot of leftover footage from the first film and that footage from King Kong did not go to waste when King Kong became the enormous hit it was. This was a sequel that almost demanded to be made.Labor Day back in New York during my childhood could have been nicknamed Ape Day because inevitably WOR television which was the RKO station ran King Kong Son Of Kong and Mighty Joe Young. The King his offspring and Terry Moore's pet entertained a whole new generation of kids for years on that day.After all the damage that King Kong wreaked upon New York and with everybody and his mother suing Robert Armstrong all the poor guy wants to do is get away from everything especially process servers. He boards a tramp steamer back to the South Seas from whence he got King Kong. Along with him is Helen Mack who also has reasons to skip out of civilization.They come upon Frank Reicher the captain who took them to King Kong's island along with John Marston. Interestingly enough the best part of the film is the mutiny led by Ed Brady and John Marston who understandably don't want any part of that island any more. Why this became such an issue for a proletarian uprising is beyond me still I always get a great sense of satisfaction when the proletariat seaman decide they don't want a captain whether its Reicher or Marston and cast him adrift with the rest of the stranded castaways. It's one of the best examples of defending anarchism I've ever seen on the screen.Of course on the island Armstrong Mack and the rest meet up with a discontented native population who say things have gone to pot since their deity King Kong was taken away.

	onyx:emotionText "If I hazarded a guess I would say that Son Of Kong came about because David O. Selznick had a lot of leftover footage from the first film and that footage from King Kong did not go to waste when King Kong became the enormous hit it was. This was a sequel that almost demanded to be made.Labor Day back in New York during my childhood could have been nicknamed Ape Day because inevitably WOR television which was the RKO station ran King Kong Son Of Kong and Mighty Joe Young. The King his offspring and Terry Moore's pet entertained a whole new generation of kids for years on that day.After all the damage that King Kong wreaked upon New York and with everybody and his mother suing Robert Armstrong all the poor guy wants to do is get away from everything especially process servers. He boards a tramp steamer back to the South Seas from whence he got King Kong. Along with him is Helen Mack who also has reasons to skip out of civilization.They come upon Frank Reicher the captain who took them to King Kong's island along with John Marston. Interestingly enough the best part of the film is the mutiny led by Ed Brady and John Marston who understandably don't want any part of that island any more. Why this became such an issue for a proletarian uprising is beyond me still I always get a great sense of satisfaction when the proletariat seaman decide they don't want a captain whether its Reicher or Marston and cast him adrift with the rest of the stranded castaways. It's one of the best examples of defending anarchism I've ever seen on the screen.Of course on the island Armstrong Mack and the rest meet up with a discontented native population who say things have gone to pot since their deity King Kong was taken away. Armstrong meets up with a 12 foot offspring of the 50 foot father and he bonds with the baby Kong. I've often wondered where Mama Kong was in all of this.Anyway RKO made sure there would be no future Kong sequels but for those who have never seen this film I'm not saying how.

If the original had ten explosion the sequel has a hundred if the original had one big angry monster the sequel has five. In other words they take a good idea and turn it into something tedious and overblown. The producers of SON OF KONG shrewdly realized that they could never top the original so they gave us a pleasant little followup instead. As another reviewer aptly noted SON is a light dessert after a steak dinner which is just what you want. The effects and action are good the humor is excellent and I for one prefer Helen Mack's spunky gal to Fay Wray's insipid heroine. So sue me.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1933 Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack two former adventurers working in the film industry created one of the most amazing movies of all time in King Kong a grandiose spectacle of horror action and fantasy about the adventures of a filmmaker played by Robert Armstrong in a mysterious island where he finds Kong a giant ape who is captured and taken to New York in order to be exhibited as The Eight Wonder of the World. What Cooper and Schoedsack created in King Kong was something more than a movie it was pure magic as few images in the history of cinema remain as powerful as the scene of Kong standing at the top of the Empire State Building. Given the enormous success of the film the studios demanded a sequel to be produced immediately so Cooper and Schoedsack found themselves forced to repeat the hit with a lower budget and tighter shooting schedule.A month after the events of King Kong former filmmaker Carl Denham Robert Armstrong is constantly in trouble because of the numerous lawsuits following the destruction that Kong the giant ape he brought to New York made during his failed escape. Fortunately his old friend Captain Englehorn Frank Reicher invites Denham to join his new crew and sail to South Asia where they can make a living and recover from their financial problems. During one of their trips they find the man who sold Denham the map to Skull island Helstrom John Marston a former captain who convinces them that there is a treasure in Skull island secretly planning to steal their ship. Determined to find the treasure Denham decides to return to Skull island but the adventure won't be easy as he'll have to deal with a stowaway girl named Hilda Helen Mack Helstrom's evil plans and the Son of Kong.Ruth Rose who wrote the screenplay for the original King Kong is also in charge of the screenplay for this sequel and she keeps exactly the same thrilling mix of genres that made the first one so special. However there are significant changes in the tone of the film as in The Son of Kong she takes a more lighthearted approach and also makes the offspring of the famous giant ape a heroic character. As odd as it may sound there's a lot of character development in this movie mainly in the figure of Carl Denham who through the movie goes from his wellknown ambitious persona to a man who learns to respect the beasts he once considered as nothing more than living gold mines. As in the first film Rose manages to inject a notable dose of realism to the story despite its fantasy touches without a doubt the result of her own life as an adventurer along her husband Schoedsack.Director Ernest B. Schoedsack returns to the detector's seat in this sequel and once again he gives the movie that gritty realism product of his years as a documentary filmmaker. The amazing special effects by Willis H. O'Brien also return although due to budget and time limitations their appearance is tragically limited this time. It is mainly because of this reason that this time the actors receive more chances to show their talents. Schoedsack's directing of his cast is pretty effective and manages to handle his cast as good as he does his special effects. While Merian C. Cooper limits himself only to produce the film his taste for magnificent epic action sequences can still be felt in the movie particularly in the grand finale at Skull island where he delivers as many thrills as his budget and schedule allowed him.The acting in The Son of Kong is actually effective and at times even better than the one in the film granted Kong was the true star of that classic. Robert Armstrong is wonderful as Carl Denham making his character's personal transformation a very believable process as he never loses his wit and charm. Helen Mack is one of the film's highlights as Hilda as she delivers an excellent performance as the young woman who has lost everything and decides to join Denham's adventure. I'm tempted to say that Mack makes a better protagonist than Fay Wray but honestly their characters are too different to compare. As the malicious Helstrom John Marston is very good never too overthetop and surprisingly very human in his role as the film's villian. Finally Frank Reicher gives a dignified performance as the good old Captain Englehorn making the best out of his role.Despite its many good elements The Son of Kong often gets labeled as underwhelming and receives severe criticism because it fails to live up the expectations the original King Kong made. Personally I think that such criticism while certainly valid it's a bit unfair as considering the limited budget and time that Cooper Schoedsack and Rose had to complete a new film the result is of good quality and while of lesser magnificence it make a fine conclusion to Carl Denham's story. Even the fact that writer Ruth Rose decided to focus on lighthearted comedy instead of thrilling horror can be seen as a wise move as it finally gave Kong what many wanted him to receive in the original compassion. True it's sad to see a movie with great potential to suffer because of lack of time and budget O'Brien's special effects get even less screen time this time but it wasn't really as bad as its reputation says.While The Son of Kong is by all accounts a good and entertaining movie it certainly pales in comparison with its predecessor's greatness as King Kong casts a shadow that's simply too difficult to overcome. However if one is willing to forgive the film's problems one'll find a terrific tale of adventures in the same spirit as the original. This is not King Kong but it's still a fun ride. 710".

The missing footage should come between the scene of Carl Denham being rescued from the sunken little Kong's hand into the life boat to the rather abrupt cut to the lifeboat's occupants seemingly dying of dehyrationexposure before being rescued by a Dutch ship.To my recall there was a quick cut after Englehorn pulls Denham into the life boat to the natives in a couple of typical native long boats frantically almost comicallyrowing away in the turbid waters. The chief is seen in the front of one of the boats rowing quickly. To this Denham states well at least the chief made it I cannot say if thats 100 verbatium because its been a long time since I've seen it but the quote from Denham is close enough.

	schema:reviewBody "WE'VE LONG had a very skeptical view of the sequel. All too often we see what is not any true attempt to continue the spirit of the original but more of an attempt to exploit the success that was generated by the critical acclaim andor the boffo box office ucce of its popularity generated with the public.THIS WAS PARTICULARLY true in the era of the Roman Numeral Series. We really liked and enjoyed the heck out of JAWS and DEATH WISH but firmly believed that there should never have been any extensions. ROCKY was a fine little picture with a small budget but the followups always left a little to be desired. SOME NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS to this rule of ours are BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN and THE GODFATHER PART 2 both of which improved on the originals.THIS PRODUCTION OF a sequel to KING KONG is yet another story. It exists purely as a tool to make up for some cot overruns of the original DADDY KONG. There was no other series pictures planned with only this budgetary silver parachute being its only purpose.SIMPLY STATED WE join up with a now broke and depressed Carl Denham Robert Armstrong finding him sulking over the total flop on Broadway pun that his big gorilla show was. Bankrupt and dejected he meets up with another lady Helen Mack with whom he journeys back to Skull Island to recoup his losses.JOINED IN THIS new voyage we have Captain Engelhorn Frank Reicher reprising his role as the skipper of the ship. They go to the island meet up with the native leadership team Steve Clemente as Witch Doctor and Noble Johnson as Chief. Both Church and State are represented but they are separate but equal.TRAVELING AROUND THE island which seems much more docile by now the pair meets up with a small fry version of KONG who hasn't developed his appetite for female human sacrifice. He befriends the protects them from some less than spectacular beastly foes and eventually manages to hand a bag of treasure to Carl as the island as little KONGY sinks into the ocean with the island. The End.THAT'S IT AND that's all.

	onyx:emotionText "WE'VE LONG had a very skeptical view of the sequel. All too often we see what is not any true attempt to continue the spirit of the original but more of an attempt to exploit the success that was generated by the critical acclaim andor the boffo box office ucce of its popularity generated with the public.THIS WAS PARTICULARLY true in the era of the Roman Numeral Series. We really liked and enjoyed the heck out of JAWS and DEATH WISH but firmly believed that there should never have been any extensions. ROCKY was a fine little picture with a small budget but the followups always left a little to be desired. SOME NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS to this rule of ours are BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN and THE GODFATHER PART 2 both of which improved on the originals.THIS PRODUCTION OF a sequel to KING KONG is yet another story. It exists purely as a tool to make up for some cot overruns of the original DADDY KONG. There was no other series pictures planned with only this budgetary silver parachute being its only purpose.SIMPLY STATED WE join up with a now broke and depressed Carl Denham Robert Armstrong finding him sulking over the total flop on Broadway pun that his big gorilla show was. Bankrupt and dejected he meets up with another lady Helen Mack with whom he journeys back to Skull Island to recoup his losses.JOINED IN THIS new voyage we have Captain Engelhorn Frank Reicher reprising his role as the skipper of the ship. They go to the island meet up with the native leadership team Steve Clemente as Witch Doctor and Noble Johnson as Chief. Both Church and State are represented but they are separate but equal.TRAVELING AROUND THE island which seems much more docile by now the pair meets up with a small fry version of KONG who hasn't developed his appetite for female human sacrifice. He befriends the protects them from some less than spectacular beastly foes and eventually manages to hand a bag of treasure to Carl as the island as little KONGY sinks into the ocean with the island. The End.THAT'S IT AND that's all. We know that the audiences of 1933 were surely disappointed as we were in the 1950's EARLY SHOW on Channel 7 WBKB in Chicago.AND YOU NEVER have seen it being revived or featured in any of the great film magazines and journals.AND JUST WHY was this so?

	schema:reviewBody "The Son of Kong 1933  out of 4 Fun sequel to KING KONG finds Carl Denham Robert Armstrong broke and being sued by just about everyone so he heads off and plans to make a living on the shipping market. Before long he finds himself back on Skull Island when he learns that there might be a treasure there but first he finds a baby gorilla.KING KONG was released on April 7 1933 and became an instant smash. You can pretty much tell that this sequel was rushed into production by the simple fact that it was released on December 22 of the same year. Yes that's right a movie had its script written filmed put together and was on the screen in less than eight months. It should go without saying that THE SON OF KONG doesn't reach the levels of the original but at the same time it's rather amazing that it turned out as good as it did since the budget was cut in half and the filmmakers were under the gun to get it in theaters by Christmas.I think the film offers quite a bit of fun moments. I do wonder if the sympathy shown towards Kong in the original film is why the filmmakers decided to make his son a good guy. In fact most of the memorable stuff in the original is missing here including the various precode moments. The sexuality and violence is pretty much gone here and in its place are scenes of comedy and cute bits. When we first see Kong Jr. he's stuck in some quicksand and from here on out we see him fight a few prehistoric beasts and pretty much be a puppy dog as he follows Denham and Hilda Helen Mack around.These scenes are actually pretty good simply because of the charming personality they manage to give the little creature.The special effects this time out aren't nearly as impressive and you can tell that many of the creatures were rushed. Their quality level isn't nearly as great as the original film but none of them are poorly done. The baby Kong design is actually good and the facial expressions are quite flawless. Another major plus is that we get a continuation of the original film since Armstrong is back. He's certainly very good in the role as is Mack in her supporting bit and Frank Relcher is also good in the role of the captain.THE SON OF KONG is obviously rather cheap but fans of the original should still have a good time with it.".

Although this is one of the sweetest movies you'll ever see it is no beach blanket bingo for bimbos. This is an Aussie story of teen love set in 1965 heroic as only teens can play it. It is fun to watch authentic and original at the same time a coming of age flick in the English boarding school tradition of Dead Poet's Society 1989 and A Separate Peace the novel not the soso movie. Noah Taylor stars as Danny Embling an outsider who reads Sartre and Camus while satirizing the school's empty traditions. Across the lake is the girl's school where Thandiwe Adjewa Thandie Newton daughter of the Ugandan ambassador is learning to meld with the Aussie pale faces including a gifted preHollywood Nicole Kidman.Thandie Newton and Noah Taylor as beautifully directed by John Duigan are the reasons this film is so good. She has a fearless integrity about her that overcomes the prejudices of her school mates. He is wise and brave at a hundred and twenty pounds. She too is ultra sophisticated. She even met Sartre. This is a story about the love between two outsiders who with their strength of character win over not only their classmates but the audience as well. Imagine teenagers as witty and poised as say Eartha Kitt and Gore Vidal and you get a hint of how it's played.Nicole Kidman as the snobby Nicola Radcliffe the name says it all manages a subtle supporting role with a diamondintherough kind of charm and just the right touch of onscreen growth. The scene where she shares her stash of vodka or perhaps a clear fruit liquor with Thandiwe Adjewa is beautifully turned by Director John Duigan. Also excellent is the hotel scene where the adults are revealed as intrusive in the extreme. I like Danny Embling's line as he deadpans to a rerobing Thandiwe They're all funny aren't they? Yes those adults are a little peculiar.This is not unflawed however. The ending despite the rousing music seemed a bland washout leaving us with a sense of disappointment. And I thought the first love scene with the two touching was a little unreal. I mean he might have kissed her! There's a limit to how great a coming of age boarding school movie can be especially when the adults have only scarecrow parts. Nonetheless Flirting is a confectioner's delight and one of the best coming of age movies I've ever seen.".

It even has an underlying theme with incisive international political insights into events in Africa during the Sixties.

Taylor's lead role Danny is one of the most original I've seen on film  the school nerd who is really a poet with more character than the rest of the school combined including the staff. The entire film is his recollection of events much of it narrated by him as though he'd written the screenplay.When I saw it a couple of years ago I wondered where it had been all my life.

I rented the movie on video and was surprised to find that very little was cut out just a few slightly racier moments and a foul word or two plus one scene at the end was doubleshot to have Thandie Newton in a bra and panties rather than naked.

What is also truly impressive is that it deals with this topic while also touching on interracial love racism African colonialism and JeanPaul Sarte without ever once becoming condescending or maudlin. It is a film that not only respects the feelings of the two fullyinhabited main character but by doing so makes the viewer all the more involved in their world and feelings for each other. The director and the script both assume that the viewer is intelligent and the viewer is accordingly rewarded.Noah Taylor and Thandie Newton are truly exceptional and highly intelligent actors and watching both their bodies of work like Shine Max Beseiged and Crash has truly been a pleasure. I do hope the best is yet to come from these fine actors and I'm sure their futures are bright.Much has been made of Nicole Kidman in this film but really she's only a secondary character as well as the young Naomi Watts. I wish Hollywood would stop looking at this film as a Nicole Kidman vehicle when truly Taylor and Newton deserve the attention for this early work.This movie is also beautifully shot especially the scenes when Danny rows his boat over the river by moonlight or watching the two of them skim rocks over the water surface or Danny at the end reading Thandie's letter on the windy rocks and the sky suddenly clearing up on him. At the very end Danny come to the very mature realization on the transcendent nature of true love something which I don't think he understood in The Year My Voice Broke.I actually went out and got this film on DVD and never tire of watching it from time to time a sign of great film. It really reminds you of what it was once like when those first feelings of romantic love started to appear in your life all the promise the novelty and the authenticity as well as the insecurities. So it's not really just a teen movie I think just about anyone who has had these experiences can appreciate this gem of a film.Do yourself a favour and try finding a copy you won't regret it.".

Her character is very complex as we watch her try and fit in but the school system always does its job of reminding her of where she comes from and who she is. Taylor is a good actor and does a good job of blending both his awkwardness and real heart at the same time. The romance between the two comes off unexpectedly well and you can't help but root for the two in a strict environment. On a trivial note both Newton and Kidman would end up in films with Tom Cruise. I wonder how far off Naomi Watts is from being in one? Film is typical coming of age story but the unique angle is Newton's character as the daughter of an important African statesman and the result that we find out at the end of the film. Film is very nicely handled on every level.".

But there was nothing else on and this DID have at least Nicole Kidman in it.  Turned out to be surprisingly interesting.  Not gripping not shocking not disturbing not provocative but engaging.  The boy is a nerdish intellectual in a boarding school teased by many of his classmates.  The young girl is something of a rare bird too there not being that many Ugandan boarding school girls in 1965's Australia I suppose.  The two marginal people meet and are attracted to one another in an adolescent way.  One thing leads to another the duo are caught by authorities in flagrante delicto she returns to Uganda where her father has crossed both paths and swords with President for Life Idi Amin.  The nerd is expelled and goes home.  She writes him regularly but then as Ugandan political troubles crest the letters stop.  After a long period he receives another from her telling him everything is straightened out and she would like them to be together.  Fade out on his voiceover.It does sound dull but it's well done compared to its categorical peers. The acting is quite good on everyone's part.  There is a sense of place and time a feeling for the creaky fauxBritish boarding school and its faculty with their varying tempers.  It captures well the awkwardness of adolescents at formal dances and the eagerness as well.  There is some frank talk about sex including a brief but amusing exchange between the two lovers when they are embracing in a dark place and he cracks a  what's the Aussie slang for that again?  The looks of the performers are about right too.  He's a short ectomorph with oddball features while she is sensitive looking and attractive although not on the ethereal plane achieved by internationally famous African models.  She's not dropdead gorgeous she's just pleasant to see from some angles a bit like Cynda Williams rather like a girl in a boarding school.  By the end of the film after their affair has evolved in its complicated way in this particular social world we've gotten to know them and we like them.We admire their classmates too.  And this is where this comingofage movie differs from the typical Hollywood fare.  Most American movies about adolescents  and there seem to have been thousands of them in the last decade or so  are overdrawn in every way.  In its American equivalent the two lovers would look different he would have the face and the teeth of that nerdy emoticon on Yahoo!  She would look like Halli Berrie or Molly Ringwald.  And both of these kids would be 30 yearold actors.  The sex would be graphic instead of delicate.  Instead of a funny scene involving a glimpse of the girls in their whalebone undergarments the heroine would be seen emerging from a pool in slow motion and opening her top rather like Phoebe Cates.  When the couple made love instead of seeing the two side by side in the everdwindling onscreen image of a bed she would jump his bones rather like Kim Cattrall.  There would be a terrific goofball kind of like Sean Penn providing easy guffaws.  And the classmates and faculty would be clearly divided into good and evil.  She's black so she'd be subject to all sorts of racial taunts kind of like the girl in The Craft. The racists would get their comeupance in the end when they would be punished and made to suffer.  The athletic student who gets into a ring with the nerd and beats him unconscious would look and consistently act brutal and he would also be humbled and made to suffer.This movie meets none of those tedious expectations.  The kids all seem to be played by kids.  Some of the guys are funnier than others but none is entirely on his own planet.  The laughs come from subtler sources.  The athlete who pounds the hero to a pulp is not a bad kid he saves the hero's bacon towards the end and not for selfish motives.  The tall snooty beauty played by Kidman has been standoffish during most of the film but when she catches the Ugandan sneaking in after an illegally late tryst instead of squealing on her she invites her into the parlor for a drink during which she confesses her own variety of desire.  When the nerd and the Ugandan split up for what appears to be the last time neither of them weeps. And they don't fall into a hot feverish final embrace either.  They shake hands and part quietly.  When the nerd reads his letter at the close we wind up really hoping that the gods will allow them to be brought together again.Can you see what I'm getting at?  This isn't a great movie.  It's too quiet it lacks the ambition it deals with small problems.  And yet it represents a monumental improvement over the crap that we've been subjected to since the 1980s.  The dumb cliches are for the most part refreshingly absent. It's a story in which there are no artistic breakthroughs no penetrating insights into human nature no social critique only a story that catches your interest and hangs on to it gently the way these two kids might hold hands.".

Everything in the country seems set up to produce performing artists even talented writers that understand acting where Brazil produces soccer players and the US lawyers.Here you have three of our actresses in essentially their first roles. Thandie Newton already at the peak of her screen charm and Nicole Kidman and buddy Naomi Watts. Set in Australia written and directed by an Australian using what I have come to think of as the simple end of an Australian character spectrum.This is a simple coming of age story. So simple you begin with some trepidation. How many of these does one have to slog through to find something new? Well there's nothing new here but it turns adult rather quickly toward the end and allows us to leave it without feeling cheap.And isn't that part of the skill of these things to allow us to visit the insecurities of youth which we probably still have and to do so safely and finally to recall the experience fondly so we will tell our friends to see this movie.Nicole and Naomi aren't any reason to see this. They're simply standard props and rather far from the skills they'd develop. No it is just the simple arc of the thing. No particular folding as in Sirens no cheap titillation just honest innocent yearning in a hostile world. Hostile large and small.Concerning the titillation a key plot device revolves around our hero interceding to prevent a compromising photo from being taken. So a negative fold if you will a deliberate statement of flatness. This is accentuated by frequent references to booknames that would be familiar to youngsters as adult Sartre Camus Marx and Sartre's appearance at the boxing match where our hero gets pummeled. Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

It's 1965 and love fear sexual desire and wholehearted awkwardness is radiating from the bodies of the students. Headmasters stalk the hallways looking for a passerby to whip pangs are repressed in favor of mildmannered behavior. But as the students age their romances flicker into a sudden burst of unbridled flame. Sooner or later they have to leave their childhood fears behind  upcoming is adulthood.Flirting is a lyrical snapshot of the inelegant but lilting time in which innocence washes away and is replaced with uncomfortable yet exciting verisimilitude. It's a high school movie but it can hardly be compared to the wispy transparency of its many clichd rivals. It's not a one note Weird Science pile or a sassy Mean Girls it's more akin to The Breakfast Club considering the thoughts and decisions of young adults and finding the beauty in their successes in their flaws. Some teenagers are onetrackminded and beastly but more are attentive. Flirting casts the immature rascals aside and puts a spotlight on the youths that contemplate the outcome of each and every decision. In that respect the film is better because for once the youngsters once characterized by Anthony Michael Hall and Shirley Temple suddenly become introspective humans not cartoons.Danny Embling Noah Taylor is a gangly 17yearold with a stutter to get over. His head is too big for his body his body is too small for his head and the words that come out of his mouth don't sound as sophisticated as he would like. But he is a rebel knowing that real life mistakes aren't followed by an authoritative whipping and that math doesn't really matter in the long run. He idolizes Satre not only for his work but also for his poise and he longs to break free from St. Albans so he can fully realize his many potentials.Thadiwe Adjewa Thandie Newton the exotic UgandanKenyanBritish daughter of a diplomat has just arrived on the grounds inadvertently inviting unwanted scrutiny from her female classmates. She is remarkably intelligent and effortlessly beautiful  perhaps she intimates the opposite sex fuels the jealousy of her gawky roommates. When Danny and Thandiwe lock eyes at a rugby game one day a spark ignites. His perceptive aura matches her cerebral wit  infatuation thrives. It doesn't take long before a mutual adoration erupts. They've never felt love like this before and they're going to make it count for the few months they have together.The majority of teen movies believe they have to be selfdeprecatingly funny or overly simple to be successful completely unaware that purity is ultimately more winning than materialistic quotability. Teenagers are fascinating creatures phenomenons of emotion but films tend to liken them as a target of satire. A shame. A movie like Flirting vibrates with poignancy in the process I connected with its sensitive characters and eventually built enough of a relationship with them to a point where I felt the need to compare their hesitations and choices to my very own life. Duigan watches them move and applies their burgeoning ideals to even the hardest of moments scenes like the closing one in which Danny and Thandiwe spend their last night together in a local hotel in order to properly say goodbye defy expectations through their mannered receptiveness.A film like Flirting is easy to hold close to the heart because its conflicts have been felt by all. It's touching it's romantic it's witty  it ripples with pensive quiet. It doesn't just flirt with brilliance it is brilliant whether it knows it or not. It also made stars out of Newton and Nicole Kidman and kickstarted the careers of Taylor and Naomi Watts. Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com".

Set in boarding schools one all girls one all boys across the lake from each other Noah TaylorTomb Raider meets and falls in love with the new black girl from the girls school. It follows the couple as they start with kissing to heavy petting and eventually to sex however it is in the most awkward and sweet way. Of course being on opposite sides of a river in separate schools proves to be hard to start a relationship. Great movie sad and sweet and very realistic.".

Set in boarding schools one all girls one all boys across the lake from each other Noah TaylorTomb Raider meets and falls in love with the new black girl from the girls school. It follows the couple as they start with kissing to heavy petting and eventually to sex however it is in the most awkward and sweet way. Of course being on opposite sides of a river in separate schools proves to be hard to start a relationship. Great movie sad and sweet and very realistic.";

I was very impressed by the cast the acting was really good at all times. Especially the two main characters who I've never seen before impressed. Nicole Kidman did well as usual. Since spending a great year in Australia I always try to watch any Australian movie I find and I've been nicely surprised with how many good movies come from there. Often quite low key but with real feeling. Sit down and watch this movie it's definitely worth the time!".

It is a clean honest movie about typical men  women  the film itself goes into all sorts of very interesting  lighthearted thank God psychological aspects of the two main characters. Another user says it's bad enough to see the story once but then the torture is doubled when the story starts over from the woman's point of view! I am quite disappointed with this because the obvious point of repeating the whole story from a different point of view are the differences between the two. And these differences are subtle  very significant to the matter of the film. I suspect people do not want to admit that this film touched them  well actually I think people are so conditioned so as to dismiss such a film as 'cheesy' or 'piffle' because of acquired motions of being  seeming brave. In fact the people who do not respond positively to this film are very much like the male character in this film who is incapable of allowing himself true feelings for if he does he loses his bravery construct. This film is a very compelling very sweetly made film that will really change you if you allow it to. And that's the point really we have to ask ourselves how much we do or don't allow ourselves to be changed by the things around us. In my opinion everyone should watch this film and judge for themselves. Forget Maltin  the other cynics we're just ordinary people trying to lead better lives you know. And this film is very much about that and in my opinion is something like a minor classic the 'Casablanca' if you may of modernday cubicle romance.".

Elizabeth Perkins' character Lorie Bryer is successfully fighting her way to the top of her profession in a major city newspaper. There's strong competition from Kevin Bacon's character Dan Hanson for a much prized promotion.Like Tracy  Hepburn both are highly intelligent albeit in their respective ways. She's a liberal. He's more 'conservative' think of Billy Joel's hitModern Woman for the two of them and you'll get the general idea.Unlike the Tracy  Hepburn films there's deeper observation into the human psyche. And VERY well done. Their widely disparate perceptions of mutual experiences are hilarious as well as insightful.Also unlike the Tracy  Hepburn films the supporting cast here have more depth and better expression. But with people like Sharon Stone playing the sultry other love interest and Nathan 'Mousehunt' Lane as the antsy television station manager this should be expected. And it adds depth to the overall cinematic experience.All in all it's a good movie. I'll probably watch it as often as I watch the classic Tracy  Hepburn films in my library.".

They fall for each other and Dan dumps Linda Sharon Stone to go with Lorie.

The movie shows the events according to him and then it shows her side of the story.The best part of this movie is the two endearing leads. They probably make a fine romcom couple. There are some minor problematic things about the story. The biggest problem is that I don't think the concept of doing the same story twice works that well. Sometimes the duo storytelling is fun but the movie loses a bit of suspense the second time around. I wonder if they could get across the idea of two different viewpoints better without doing the story twice. They could possibly use two different narrations to work the same concept.".

Kevin Bacon too must have been furious when if he viewed the final cut and found that the movie went on for ever and Sharon Stone only appeared for maybe three minutes in total. The repeat from Elizabeth Perkins' character's point of view was totally unnecessary and actually contained straight repeats of scenes hardly necessary. So it's a shame that this pair took so incredibly long to decide to get married. If they'd done it in 85 minutes the picture might well have been a decent hit for both of them. Well I guess that's showbiz for you. Of course it's ironic that the reviewer quoted in her IMDb biography said Elizabeth Perkins was too old in 2005 to see a change in her disappointing until then career just before she appeared in the smashhit series Weeds and made millions. So you never know do you and that too is showbiz folks!".

The story then flashes back to show the birth of their relationship and what led to the throwing of the mug and just like their professional relationship we see the relationship from Dan's point of view and then see it from Lorie's and it is the differences in their versions of the personal relationship paralleled with their opposing professional views that make the movie so fun and a lot more entertaining than I expected.Directors Ken Kwapis and Marisa Silver have mounted a solid romantic comedy which I suspected is probably loosely based on their own real life relationship with the help of Brian Hohlfeld's deft screenplay that provides equal doses of laughter and warmth and surprisingly will not having you taking sides with either of the protagonists. The leads also receive strong support from Nathan Lane as their boss and Sharon Stone as an old girlfriend of Dan's who conveniently comes into his life when things get rough with Lorie.

	schema:headline " A very big flashback film";
	schema:reviewBody "Remembering what happened in a relationship is tough for some people. Majority of the time it comes down to only the guys because most of the time women remember things better. But it has to be understood that the truth is frequently stretched in both directions to help prove the testifier is in the right. Men and women see things differently on a lot of topics and the most debated about subject are relationships. He said this and she said that. Whose memory or interpretation is more accurate in telling the truth? That's the kind of story audiences' get here.The plot revolves around a couple Dan Hansen Kevin Bacon and Lorie Bryer Elizabeth Perkins who see their way of living quite differently. Hansen feels that he wants to live his life as a lone wolf and doesn't want to settle down any time soon. Bryer on the other hand is looking for that guy in her life who is like a wolf but would like to settle down at some point. To think that their eventual meeting would happen so coincidentally was far from their thoughts. When in fact that's what happened. Unfortunately the ride is very bumpy and soon there's a point to where they need a break from each other. But to understand why they need this break is where things can get tiresome.The explanation behind this break is displayed through flashback sequences. The flashbacks are done in two segments. The first segment is told through the eyes of Dan and the second segment is told through the eyes of Lorie. Flashbacks are an OK method of explanation but the idea that this movie consistently relies on it can get tiresome and feel long considering that the running time itself is close to two hours total. Plus with these two segments the viewer will be watching what they saw from the first half of the film again. The feeling will get repetitive and too familiar for the audience to want to see more of almost the exact same scene. The exchanges are varied because of the point of view but some it isn't as different as one might expect.With this leads to some comical exchanges but not anything that'll have people rolling on the floors. Kevin Bacon has a few good moments as well as Elizabeth Perkins but the laughs are too few short. Perhaps the one actor who stole each scene he was in was Nathan Lane's. For most it's because of his voice and how he reminds every viewer that he IS Timon from the Lion King 1994 even though at the time of 1991 no one saw it coming. Along with him was upcoming star Sharon Stone who plays Dan Hansen's exgirlfriend Stanley Anderson who later plays in RoboCop 3 1993 and veteran actor Phil Leeds who plays an old tenant where Dan Hansen lives.As for anything else props should still be given to the directors for at least carrying out the concept of this point of view movie. It at least gives insight to how the mechanisms of the male and female minds work. Thus maybe giving us the viewers a better idea of what the opposite sex expects from us in a relationship. Adding a little bit to the emotion is Miles Goodman's score to the film. This is also the composer to the popular film Little Shop of Horrors 1986 and a year later the beloved Muppet Christmas Carol 1992. It is a slightly above average romcom.Its actors are well chosen and the concept is very intellectual but its direction can be long and monotonous while the comedy is a hit or miss leaving the story itself carrying the emotion.".

It at least gives insight to how the mechanisms of the male and female minds work. Thus maybe giving us the viewers a better idea of what the opposite sex expects from us in a relationship. Adding a little bit to the emotion is Miles Goodman's score to the film. This is also the composer to the popular film Little Shop of Horrors 1986 and a year later the beloved Muppet Christmas Carol 1992. It is a slightly above average romcom.Its actors are well chosen and the concept is very intellectual but its direction can be long and monotonous while the comedy is a hit or miss leaving the story itself carrying the emotion.";

Many were calling this movie Gigli 2 I just couldn't believe they would put Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck together in a film again after all the innocent bystanders had to put up with but they did. But I don't know why maybe because it's already 4 years later after all that craziness I decided to go ahead and rent Jersey Girl and just see what it was about. I watched it last night and I couldn't believe my eyes I actually liked this movie. It wasn't your typical romantic comedy it was something different and really enjoyable. Kevin Smith who is more famous for Clerks made a funny and genuinely good film that anyone can enjoy.Gertie Trinke is a little girl who is telling her story about her family and how they came to be. Her father Ollie was once a successful man in New York who was the publicity for famous musicians. But when his wife Gertrude dies in childbirth with their daughter Ollie has to learn to grow up but he looses his job after calling Will Smith a no body who won't get another movie. So Ollie and his dad raise Gertie who teaches Ollie that there's more to life than just the riches.Jersey Girl is a good film I don't know why anyone would say that this is a bad film I understand people not liking it but the story was very decent and the acting was I'd say above average. One of the things I loved was that the story was very human the little girl who played Gertie Raquel Castro was perfect for the role and didn't over do anything or made her character annoying. Ben Affleck who I normally cannot watch in a movie was very good in Jersey Girl his little talk with his infant girl about loosing his wife was touching. Maybe because I'm a girl or something maybe that's why I loved the film but I just thought it was good and I do recommend it.710".

	schema:headline " This Jersey Girl Is a Great Date";
	schema:reviewBody "OK how obvious is my title?   Kevin Smith is a writer I admire tremendously. He has an uncanny ability to capture the way people speak in reality not just in movie screenplay structure.Jersey Girl is a real step forward for Kevin Smith. He returns to screens with a mature and funny film about a man learning to be a father.   The style here is more aligned with Smith's terrific Chasing Amy than Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.Ben Affleck is Ollie a hot shot New York publicist with everything going for him. As the movie opens he and his girlfriend Gertie Jennifer Lopez meet get engaged and married and expect their first child together.Then the unexpected happens Gertie dies in childbirth and Ollie is left with his infant daughter. Mired in his own grief he essentially ignores his child for the first month leaving the baby caretaking to his Pop played by George Carlin. A crisis moment comes where he's forced to handle both his career and his child at the same time and it doesn't go well.Flash forward six years and Ollie seems to have adjusted to a different life in a small New Jersey town. He absolutely adores his daughter who is named for her mother. A young woman who works at a video store Liv Tyler enters their lives in an unusual way and the movie becomes an exploration of the pushpull between what someone wants for themselves and what they should do to meet the needs of others.Two things could have happened with a movie like this. One is that it would be about how Affleck's character falls in love with the quirky video store girl and Gertie has to cope with the new woman in daddy's life. Two the movie would be filled with cutesy kid moments that are meant for nothing more than easy smiles.Neither of those things happen. Of course the little girl is cute but there is substance behind it. The way Ollie and Gertie communicate with each other is very realistic and in many moments fraught with tension that works. As far as the stuff with Tyler's character the script doesn't persue a standard 'romantic comedy' courtship between the two. Instead everything is repressed and tentative. Affleck's and Tyler's characters basically duck around their feelings for the whole thing.Both of these directions were completely refreshing and as a result the movie didn't feel so standard.I was happy to walk out of Jersey Girl feeling like the stuff that the press shoved down our throats regarding Ben Affleck is gone. This movie wipes that away even though Lopez is in the movie for the first ten minutes. Ben Affleck's career will definitely survive the overexposure he's had and this movie is the first step in ensuring that.   It reinforces that he is a good actor not just the latest dude to be dating the industry's latest hot chick.George Carlin reigns in the schtick and gets to play a really solid character. Sure he has some quips here and there but he fills the role of loving pop quite well. Also of wonderful surprise is Liv Tyler who is light and bouncy as Affleck's love interest. I found her performance really intriguing especially since she is able to speak the lines of the character through her mouth but have her eyes communicate something totally different at the same time.Smith makes excellent use of music in this film. One scene in particular where Stevie Nicks' heartbreaking Landslide plays nearly had me in tears. And who would have thought anyone would be able to use a rather dark Sondheim musical to such greatly comic and not too over the top advantage.There is also a scene in the film that contains one of the most natural exchanges of dialogue I've seen in a film. In a conversation between two fathers Smith manages to make it seem as though two actors are speaking as themselves. It's a fantastic scene.Jersey Girl is another reminder of how much I appreciate Kevin Smith. If you're looking for a sweet and charming time at the movies this spring so far Jersey Girl is a great bet.Paul Katz".

The style here is more aligned with Smith's terrific Chasing Amy than Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.Ben Affleck is Ollie a hot shot New York publicist with everything going for him. As the movie opens he and his girlfriend Gertie Jennifer Lopez meet get engaged and married and expect their first child together.Then the unexpected happens Gertie dies in childbirth and Ollie is left with his infant daughter. Mired in his own grief he essentially ignores his child for the first month leaving the baby caretaking to his Pop played by George Carlin. A crisis moment comes where he's forced to handle both his career and his child at the same time and it doesn't go well.Flash forward six years and Ollie seems to have adjusted to a different life in a small New Jersey town. He absolutely adores his daughter who is named for her mother. A young woman who works at a video store Liv Tyler enters their lives in an unusual way and the movie becomes an exploration of the pushpull between what someone wants for themselves and what they should do to meet the needs of others.Two things could have happened with a movie like this. One is that it would be about how Affleck's character falls in love with the quirky video store girl and Gertie has to cope with the new woman in daddy's life. Two the movie would be filled with cutesy kid moments that are meant for nothing more than easy smiles.Neither of those things happen. Of course the little girl is cute but there is substance behind it. The way Ollie and Gertie communicate with each other is very realistic and in many moments fraught with tension that works. As far as the stuff with Tyler's character the script doesn't persue a standard 'romantic comedy' courtship between the two. Instead everything is repressed and tentative. Affleck's and Tyler's characters basically duck around their feelings for the whole thing.Both of these directions were completely refreshing and as a result the movie didn't feel so standard.I was happy to walk out of Jersey Girl feeling like the stuff that the press shoved down our throats regarding Ben Affleck is gone. This movie wipes that away even though Lopez is in the movie for the first ten minutes. Ben Affleck's career will definitely survive the overexposure he's had and this movie is the first step in ensuring that.   It reinforces that he is a good actor not just the latest dude to be dating the industry's latest hot chick.George Carlin reigns in the schtick and gets to play a really solid character. Sure he has some quips here and there but he fills the role of loving pop quite well. Also of wonderful surprise is Liv Tyler who is light and bouncy as Affleck's love interest. I found her performance really intriguing especially since she is able to speak the lines of the character through her mouth but have her eyes communicate something totally different at the same time.Smith makes excellent use of music in this film. One scene in particular where Stevie Nicks' heartbreaking Landslide plays nearly had me in tears. And who would have thought anyone would be able to use a rather dark Sondheim musical to such greatly comic and not too over the top advantage.There is also a scene in the film that contains one of the most natural exchanges of dialogue I've seen in a film. In a conversation between two fathers Smith manages to make it seem as though two actors are speaking as themselves. It's a fantastic scene.Jersey Girl is another reminder of how much I appreciate Kevin Smith. If you're looking for a sweet and charming time at the movies this spring so far Jersey Girl is a great bet.Paul Katz";

It has a lot of warmth and pain mixed in with a complex story of a man coming to terms with his fatherhood. The fact that he dedicated the film to his late father shows this to be a film maker working through the loss of an important figure in his life. George Carlin gives a stand out performance as Ben Affleck's father and Ben Affleck gives a stellar performance of a man that comes to terms with the life he has instead of the life he thinks he wants. This film still has the same witty humor like any good Kevin Smith film does but it is undercut by the seriousness of the relationship between a child and their parent. Whether it is Ben's relationship with his father or his relationship as a father to his adorable daughter. The only criticism I had was that Ben could not bring himself to cry at a key moment in the film. Other than that his and everyone else's performances were outstanding. Kevin Smith deserves much credit for revealing so much about himself in this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm certain that if I had been Kevin Smith approached by Miramax with this idea and screenplay I would definitely have turned it down.Maybe that's exactly why he had chosen to do it. And what a wise decision it was indeed... The movie didn't promise much judging it by the trailers but in the end I was quite satisfied with it when I finally saw it. I'm sure that an average or belowtheaverage Hollywood director would have made it into a blunt silly sentimental and instantly forgettable soapbubblelike movie. But not Smith... There were many many crucial points along the storyline that just called and yelled for directors to commit fatal errors... Smith had succeeded to avoid these errors creating a really enjoyable lovable deeply emotional and yet funny piece of work. But still... this isn't the Kevin Smith that I admire so much. I believe that with Dogma he created a milestone in American filmmaking by daring to speak fiercely openly and frankly about very delicate issues. I missed this part of him from Jersey Girl  but there was no room for it because of the plot.With Jersey Girl he had showed more real emotions than he ever did in all of his works. He had proved himself an expert of human emotions. He showed the audience that he really understands about deep feelings love loss family ties ambition...The only thing this film is lacking is really great acting. None of the actors gave bad performances not by long shot but still... there could have been some more... especially from Affleck. Tyler gave a surprisingly fresh and believable performance showing some real theatrical talents in the scene when she performs in Gertie's 'musical'.The unavoidable Star Wars jokes and celebrity nosepricks are present of course maintaining the overall Smithfeel to the movie. To be adequate I quote Darth Vader Impressive... Most impressive.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jersey Girl is an average mildy entertaining romantic comedy.  Ben Affleck's performance is just fine as both a slick record executive and a sentimental single father.  Jennifer Lopez is good as Affleck's wife.  Her death is still emotional even though we all knew it was coming.  Raquel Castro is remarkably unannoying as the daughter.  Like many I tend to find supposedly cute kids more annoying than cute.  Raquel Castro manages to give a real performance even though some of her reactions are clearly forced. Even though I found the acting okay overall there was one scene I just could not stand.  Does there have to be scene in every movie with kids where they tell a parent I hate you?  As Roger Ebert pointed out Jersey Girl includes a parent rushing to a school play and a slow clap but neither are as bad a movie cliche as a kid screaming I hate you while a bad 80's ballad begins to play.  That brings me to my next point about Jersey Girl.  The songs just overtake the entire story.  There's actually one point in the movie where a song is playing...the song stops...Affleck has an emotional moment with the kid...the same song starts over again.  The dialogue gets in the way of the song.  If Kevin Smith is such a great writer then he needs to let his words explain the movie not a group of bad songs.  That being said I did enjoy this movie overall.  Affleck and George Carlin have some funny moments with and without the daughter.  The two guys who are not Gertie's uncles are funny.  I particularly enjoyed the cameo from Will Smith.  I hesitate to call it a cameo even though he is only in one scene. In this one scene The Fresh Prince sets Affleck straight and basically sets up the resolution of the movie.  After seeing Jersey Girl I tried to think of what this movie would have been without all the Bennifer hype.  I think they would have marketed the movie completely differently and it would have been downright shocking when JLo died and didn't appear again in the movie.  Imagine the heads turning in the theater as people think what she's dead?  I'm sure this was Smith's intention when they started casting and shooting the movie.  Seeing him on talk shows you can see through his joking that he was upset about being forced to edit the movie based on the media blitz.".

The plot is nothing new but the film is still pretty good. I thought this film was going to be really bad but I was surprised. Its not an Oscar quality film its just a nice to film to watch if you have nothing better to do. Ben Affleck's performance was actually not bad and its watch able. Liv Tyler performance was very good and she really showed she has some talent. Raquel Castro plays Gertie and she does an alright job but she is no Dakota Fanning. Jason Biggs has a very small role and he does a decent job. Jennifer Lopez isn't in the film for very long which is good as her performance isn't very good. Matt Damon and Jason Lee both have cameos. Kevin Smith tries a new type of film and he does a good job. The only problem I had with Jersey Girl was that it wasn't very original. Most of the dialog had been used in previous films like Kramer vs. Kramer. The story is good even if it is a little unrealistic and unoriginal. The running time is only 102 minutes long so unless you really hate Affleck its not too much of a pain to watch. The film is also very predictable so its disappointing that Kevin Smith didn't try something new. There are a lot of funny moments as well as sad moments that may get to you. In the end this is a predictable safe film to watch and one that can easily be enjoyed. Rating 710 worth checking out.".

	schema:headline " Much worse than Gigli...";
	schema:reviewBody "I am absolutely bewildered why Gigli got all this flack for being the worst movie ever and Jersey Girl got a pass. Jersey Girl is infinitely worse than Gigli which was an unfairly maligned modest comedy....not a good film but far from the worst movie I have ever seen.On the other hand Jersey Girl was saccharine and more maudlin than a Lifetime TV movie. Some of the worst acting and scriptwriting I can remember seeing and a huge disappointment coming from Kevin Smith. I loved Chasing Amy and can recall when I first saw that film thinking what great things were coming from Mr. Smith and Ben Affleck...wow that's hard to believe now. I think Ben Affleck is one of the worst most talentless actors working today and Kevin Smith has betrayed what little promise he first demonstrated. A classic example of selling out.I realize that films don't have to be absolutely literally authentic to work or to resonate with an audience but Jersey Girl feels like something created by people who have never had children had jobs or experienced a single recognizable human emotion.Ben Affleck plays Ollie Trinke pronounced TRINKIE a name that you'd think would be a liability in the professional world. Nonetheless he becomes a marketing exec making a six figure salary. He marries JLo whose character is named Gertrude Steiney implying strongly that she is a Jewish girl from New York when in fact she is obviously Hispanic....I really don't get this. And when was the last time you met a YOUNG woman named Gertrude? It's not a very common name for anyone under the age of 80.Gertie dies in childbirth a rarity these days but it can happen and Ollie becomes unhinged and neglects his newborn daughter leaving her in the care of his aging father ?.

Apparently his bosses have not a bit of sympathy for a man who lost his wife just a couple weeks earlier and is maybe having a breakdown. Ollie apparently has no savings and receives no severance pay because he goes from being a six figure executive with a Manhattan apartment to having to move in with his father.Here the film gets really confusing because seven presumably boring childcarefilled years are quickly skipped over and we see little Gertie who is now seven with Ollie who has inexplicably taken a job as a street sweeper. Yes that's right a marketing executive who probably has a master's degree is forced to take a job as a street sweeper. There is not one single job in all of New York City even in another field such as publishing sales etc. And his salary as a street sweeper a unionized city job does not pay enough for him to afford an apartment of his own even in New Jersey.This is what I mean by written by someone who has never had children or a job. This is the kind of writing that is utterly out of touch with the real world that can only be produced by hacks utilizing scriptwriting software. It's an insult to the lives of real single parents and real human beings.There is not the remotest explanation of who watched Gertie for the first five years of her life years which are skipped in the film. Child care even for a widowed parent is apparently unknown...on the other hand when does Mr. Smith think that street sweepers work? DURING THE DAY. So someone somewhere had to be taking care of Gertie for the first five years of her life. Duh.I cannot provide any spoilers because around this point I couldn't stand it anymore. And I am not even going into the tasteless sex jokes and the depressingly slutty behavior of Liv Tyler's thankless character. Because I had to turn the movie off I couldn't stand it anymore. This is only the second time in my whole life that I actually refused to watch a movie through to the end. This is the bomb of the year and Gigli has been unfairly maligned. Jersey Girl is an absolutely horrible movie and you should avoid it at all costs...an insult to human intelligence.".

	onyx:emotionText "I am absolutely bewildered why Gigli got all this flack for being the worst movie ever and Jersey Girl got a pass. Jersey Girl is infinitely worse than Gigli which was an unfairly maligned modest comedy....not a good film but far from the worst movie I have ever seen.On the other hand Jersey Girl was saccharine and more maudlin than a Lifetime TV movie. Some of the worst acting and scriptwriting I can remember seeing and a huge disappointment coming from Kevin Smith. I loved Chasing Amy and can recall when I first saw that film thinking what great things were coming from Mr. Smith and Ben Affleck...wow that's hard to believe now. I think Ben Affleck is one of the worst most talentless actors working today and Kevin Smith has betrayed what little promise he first demonstrated. A classic example of selling out.I realize that films don't have to be absolutely literally authentic to work or to resonate with an audience but Jersey Girl feels like something created by people who have never had children had jobs or experienced a single recognizable human emotion.Ben Affleck plays Ollie Trinke pronounced TRINKIE a name that you'd think would be a liability in the professional world. Nonetheless he becomes a marketing exec making a six figure salary. He marries JLo whose character is named Gertrude Steiney implying strongly that she is a Jewish girl from New York when in fact she is obviously Hispanic....I really don't get this. And when was the last time you met a YOUNG woman named Gertrude? It's not a very common name for anyone under the age of 80.Gertie dies in childbirth a rarity these days but it can happen and Ollie becomes unhinged and neglects his newborn daughter leaving her in the care of his aging father ?.

I knew it wouldn't be that and I went into the theatre just hoping to see a good film.Jersey Girl has some nice moments and some moments of genuine skillful humor especially for a musical theatre fan.  However the film as a whole is an enormous letdown for one reason  it's typical.  Rather than making another typically Kevin Smith movie Smith managed to make a typical Hollywood flick.  Instead of insight we get cloying sentimentality instead of maturity we get a series of cliche moments with a goodlooking cast that just doesn't dazzle for whatever emotional whallop Smith thought the film would pack.The situation and choices facing Ben Affleck's character are nothing new and Affleck goes dutifully through the exercises emoting when he needs to but never really getting much out.  You wind up rooting for him more or less out of the same sense of duty.  George Carlin's father is depressingly tame compared to his brilliant standup routine Jennifer Lopez is sweet but her perfunctory character never really makes any impact on the audience.  Raquel Castro plays the absolute cliche end of a film child that she's written with the appropriate sweetness.  Liv Tyler's character goes wildly from a toneddown character from one of Smith's earlier films in her first scenes building up a bit of false hope that there will be something new to this blah exercise to another cliche character in the later portions of the film.  Not much of it can be blamed on anyone except the writerdirector though.On principle I have nothing against Smith branching out into other genres of film than those he touched on in his first five that's an artist's choice and should be his and no one else's.  But Jersey Girl is simply settling for the typical and unambitious in film.  If this is an indication of where Kevin Smith's career is heading then I think he has lost it as a director who bears watching.".

Biggest laugh of the movie in the movie for by far. Was Ollie getting caught renting porn in Maya's video store.Performances. Ben Affleck has really matured over the years and he proves it once more here. His emotional scenes were credible and his character was likable and easy to sympathize with. Jennifer Lopez's role isn't as big as you may think but she pulled it off with class. Liv Tyler is cute as button and does fine in her thinly written part. George Carlin is hilarious as Ben's father. Raquel Castro gives one of the funniest and sweetest kid performances I've seen in ages. Incredible poise and maturity for her age.Bottom line.

Other than some of his trademark rapidfire dialogue and scatological humor which often doesn't work well this time around it's hard to believe that this film came from the same guy's pen as Clerks or Chasing Amy the latter of which is still his best film.Jersey Girl stars Ben Affleck as Ollie Trinke I'll address character names in a bit a selfcentered Manhattan whiz kid of the music business who after personal tragedy completely unravels in a most public way and torpedoes his own career. Blackballed and defeated in the big city Ollie is forced to return to his bluecollar roots on the Jersey side with his infant daughter in tow. Cue the cutesy and hearttugging scenes here.Already burdened with an unrealistic script Jersey Girl also suffers from some weak Ben Affleck acting particularly in an overwrought scene in which Ollie is crying next to his daughter's crib. You just don't buy it from this character or from this actor.The only true highlight in the film is George Carlin who plays an authentic and likable workingclass father complete with the clichd heart of gold who tries to teach Ollie the importance of family over material. Carlin more or less is playing himself but it fits the role nicely. His occasional Aw Jesus Christ lament and eyeroll are more amusing and genuine than much of the more elaborately written dialogue which until this film was always Smith's strong point.Now to the character names. Jennifer Lopez plays Affleck's wife insert your own joke on that one Gertrude Steiney. Does Lopez even remotely look like a woman who would have such a name? For someone of obvious Hispanic lineage it's absurd. Their daughter is subsequently named Gertrude Gertie as well. Gertie? Ollie? What year is this?!?I'm guessing that this will be Smith's last attempt at a mainstream romantic comedy. As a longtime fan I surely hope so. He's a much better filmmaker when in an edgier and unsweetened form.".

The crowd at the theater tonight might have been the oddest mix of people I have ever seen at an opening night. Stoners looking for more silent bob teen girls giggling over Ben young couples on dates and older people looking for something lighthearted and fun. The stoners were the most disappointed as the closest thing they got to Silent Bob was the new View Askew graphic at the begining of the movie.This was definately Ben Afflecks best performance to date. He was amazingly good as Ollie. He gave the character a ton of depth and Smith should be commended for this choice. The rest of the cast is also excellent. In fact they are the best part of the movie.My complaints are few but I do have a couple. Firstly the movie takes so long to setup and it has a few spots throughout that tend to drag. Liv Tylers character is also a problem. Although she does a great job with what she is given her character lacks depth and is thusly difficult to connect with as the new love interest.All in all this is charming and light hearted enough to take a date to but has enough depth to keep it from being a cookie cutter affair. 810".

Easily the worst movie I've ever seen at the theater.It was my idea to go see it. Now I have to think of a way to make it up to my wife. Maybe I'll by her one of those Lexuses with the big bow on top. Nah still not enough.Trust me Don't see this movie.".

He's clearly just guessing about his subject.The best indication of this is the way he overwrites his scripts.  His characters say things so ludicrous and baroque that it's completely impossible to take them seriously for a second even for entertainment's sake.  They never for a moment exist beyond characters written by some guy.I'll ignore the alwaysirritating Ben Affleck and simply note as Exhibit A the way Smith misuses Liv Tyler  who can be either utterly passive onscreen not making any impact at all or absolutely captivating and memorable.  All it takes for a winning but passive actress like Tyler is a strong director to make her deliver that potent charm  and the fact that she barely makes a wave onscreen in Jersey Girl speaks for itself.Fortunately eventually Smith will expend the last of his illearned 90's indie creds and he'll disappear from the industry altogether.".

This was Jersey Girl.I hadn't read anything about Jersey Girl before going in and I just assumed it was a typical Kevin Smith movie.  It totally is not.  Oh sure there're a few dick jokes and some poop and Ben Affleck but Jersey Girl is far far away from the Kevin Smith I've come to know and sort of moderately like.For me the experience of watching this film felt a lot like a time in college when I was at a Halloween party and my one tubby bearded videogameplaying footballwatching stoner friend showed up dressed as Princess Jasmine from the Disney movie Aladdin 1992.  And it turned out he was serious.  I was sort of touched and horrified at the same time.This movie confused me as well.  At first I thought maybe Kevin Smith was making fun of all those awful cynicallycalculated tweentargeted movies like Uptown Girls The Lizzie McGuire Movie and Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen.  And I thought maybe he was packing the movie full of clichs and mawkish sentimentality as a weird sort of joke.  But then as the movie wore on I grew increasingly uncomfortable as I began to realize that he probably meant it or at least was trying to mean it.I'm generally all in favor of a filmmaker branching out and trying new and different things but I'm very much unin favor of an independent and formerly semiinteresting filmmaker branching out into the worst sort of hackneyed Hollywood filmmaking without any of the wit observation and conversation that formerly made Kevin Smith semiinteresting.This film felt like a film made by a filmmaker who felt he had to make a film because he's a filmmaker and filmmakers make films though he had nothing he felt strongly about making a film about and so he just made a film about this crap.

I actually saw this movie before the first Machete so I wasn't sure what to expect and I laughed until it hurt. Seriously it was everything I wanted in a silly action movie. Machete Kills is somehow even more ridiculous than the first one this time with president Charlie Sheen ordering Machete to go after a lunatic nuclear arms dealer played to perfection by Demian Bichir and Mel Gibson wants to destroy the world and colonize space. Yeah and you thought De Niro playing George Bush was crazy. Mel Gibson is basically a Bond villain in this movie. This is another revenge story except this time it's Machete's love interest Jessica Alba who is killed in front of him. Needless to say when President Sheen asks him to go on this suicide mission Machete isn't exactly in the best frame of mind. Then again it's fcking Danny Trejo so he's awesome at it anyway. The first half of the movie focuses more on Machete going after this crazy arms dealer with random villains like Sofia Vergara with machine gun tits coming after him. There's also the shapeshifter El Cameleon played by Cuba Gooding Jr Lady Gaga and Antonio Banderas. Literally the best plot device to get as many famous people in a movie as possible. Then Mel kicks in during the second half of the movie and that's where it goes fullon ridiculous mode in the best way as if it wasn't ridiculous enough before.After seeing Machete and Machete Kills back to back I realize the only thing that makes Machete Kills slightly weaker is that the laughs aren't as consistent. Machete had me on the floor 90 percent of the time. Machete Kills is more like 70 percent hilarity and 30 percent of jokes that either don't hit or are just repeated to the point of desensitization. Still when the jokes hit they are laughoutloud funny. There are gags in this movie that make the original Machete look like a documentary. Oh and Amber Heard is the special agent helping Machete this time and she tries to do an accent every once in a while and fails miserably but who cares because she's sex on a stick. That's basically the trend in these movies. You try to analyze something and then think to yourself Who cares? It's so damn entertaining you don't have to think at all. Just lay back and enjoy the gratuitous violence TA and everything else you'd want in a ridiculous actionpacked Bmovie. I for one cannot wait for the sequel.".

	schema:reviewBody "It seems you just can't keep a good Mexican down. That goes for both Danny Trejo's character Machete and the Mexican film geek Jesus himself Robert Rodriguez. Let me start by saying that this is one of the most ridiculous movies I've seen in my entire life let alone in the last year. The concept itself is absurd the action is something out of a Baction movie and the characters play more as preposterous caricatures of established stereotypes than actual people. And I couldn't be more pleased with the results. This is easily the most fun I have had at the movie theater all year.Machete Kills is the sequel to 2010's Machete. The latter was developed from a 'fake' trailer that preceded 2007's Grindhouse a collaborative double feature consisting of Rodriguez's Planet Terror and Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof. Using the character Machete from his Spy Kids series Rodriguez made an amazing trailer for a grindhouseesque film. When the trailer served to be immensely popular he created the feature length. Now three years later we have the sequel to the movie that almost never was.What we have here is one of the greatest parody films ever made. It's not a parody on the level of Airplane! or Scary Movie but this movie is just downright hilarious. It has everything from references to current events mainly the plight of the Hispanic people and their standing in America's 21st Century to great quips about the actors' personal lives Charlie Sheen's President Rathcock is a great spoof of his personal issues and his Martin Sheen's famous role of the president on West Wing to lampoons of successful franchises. If anything Machete Kills is the best James Bond satire since Austin Powers. And even with all of this it somehow manages to hit harder with each joke. We never reach a point where the movie has spread itself too thin.Robert Rodriguez is a genius. It's that simple. Somehow more than any other filmmaker he can spread a tiny budget as far as it can possibly go. He's known for this and has baffled studios for the better part of two decades when he makes amazing films on a paltry budget. Considering the scale of this movie especially just in the cast it's amazing that Machete Kills was made with 30 million. The secret is that Rodriguez knows exactly what he wants. He doesn't need to waste money on things he can get done for cheap. For example the special effects in this film are on par with a SyFy channel movie like Sharktopus. He knows you're not there to see Avatar level CGI. You want a ridiculous story filled with even more ridiculous characters doing EVEN MORE ridiculous things. This I believe is the key to Machete Kills' quality. Every bit of Rodriguez' money and time is put into the most important aspects of the film.The cast in this film is exquisite. Let's just rattle off every big name in this movieMichelle RodriguezDanny TrejoJessica AlbaCharlie Sheen or Carlos EstevezSofia VergaraCuba Gooding Jr.Lady GaGaAntonia BanderasDemian BechirAmber HeardVanessa HudgensAlexa Vega or the girl from Spy KidsI could easily continue but let's just stop there. And the best part is not one of these characters is a cameo. Sure some of them take up just a fraction of the screen time but each actor plays a memorable character that contributes something worthwhile to the story. That is a feat that needs to be recognized. Few directors could handle a cast this large and of this caliber and still be able to make each one of them memorable.I cannot stress this enough. Go see Machete Kills. Gather up your friends and prepare to get rowdy. This is the kind of movie that thrives on a reactive audience. And prepare to have a rip roarin' blast.".

Ignore the critics  go see it at the cinema while you can  this film deserves to be seen as loud  larger than life as the characters within it.

Some people will never ever say anything bad about the guy and some will genuinely like it but to be honest.. it just didn't have that X factor the first Machete did. This time around Machete is more like a super hero. He is sent on a mission to Mexico by the President excellent choice of casting Charlie Sheen using his birth name of Carlos Esteves. But other than that and of course Danny Trejo and Michelle Rodriquez the rest of the cast just didn't fit. The schizo Mexican revolutionary didn't fit Cuba was completely out of place wasn't really feeling Lady Gaga or Amber Heard even though she is gorgeous and the gorgeous Sophia Vegara was just a little too manic. But it really wasn't that.. the film just was kind of flat even the action scenes weren't clicking. Maybe because they gave away too much in the previews. Maybe its because they made Machete inhuman.. All I know is that when I was in the theater 3 people around me fell asleep and 4 people walked out a hour after the film started... AND it wasn't that many people in the theater. Gosh I wanted it to be so much better.. This is a rental at best".

	schema:headline " A bad imitation not a parody of a genre that was already crazy to begin with";
	schema:reviewBody "Machete Kills' one redeeming clever moment is ironically a teaser trailer that opens the film previewing Machete Kills Again...In Space! the third unreleased sequel that will be set in space. Unlike the main feature the trailer is short punchy and very funny. It acknowledges and embraces the ridiculousness of the series and its own shoddiness. Comparatively Machete Kills is a long bloated unfunny cash grab lazily cobbled together to bridge itself towards another sequel. Its existence is hard proof that the evolution of this knucklehead series beginning as a fake trailer in the Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodrigeuz Grindhouse collaboration was merely bad science. The project granted action star Danny Trejo a new 80s style action vehicle to work in playing a Mexican Federal Agent who is mythical and near indestructible. The gimmick of seeing Trejo on screen again hasn't so much worn off but dropped dead. This sequel is lethargic and tedious. It's weighed down by dull scenes of exposition and repetitive battles where the main character is never in any danger. Worse is the plethora of star names that do not phone in their work but simply appear. The result is a film that sets its ambitions deliberately low proud and stupid but even on that level Machete Kills can't satisfy and ends up being an interminable bore. The director Robert Rodriguez started his career with the impressive feat of making the action film El Mariachi for just seven thousand dollars. He also took test medical drugs to fund his short films. The problem is that he's never left El Mariachi behind. All his films outside of the kids movies he's made have tried to duplicate the same manic gunplay. His most interesting film is Sin City because it origins perfectly suited Rodriguez already comic stylisations. Despite being best friends with Quentin Tarantino though Rodriguez is yet to challenge his audience with anything more than hyperstylised cartoon violence.If the direction here is any indication Rodriguez would rather be elsewhere. The dialogue sequences are long and poorly controlled. Machete Trejo has no personality and very few lines. Characters speak over him with boring monologues of exposition lumping down the next phase of the plot. There are no jokes to lighten the burden of information. Consider this scene Charlie Sheen credited as Carlos Estevez features as the American President who briefs Machete on his mission. The casting is the gag but there are no jokes to support it. Where is the punch line? There is also an unforgivable sloppiness to the film's editing too. The film jumps between sequences as though scenes were removed and they thought no one would notice. One moment Machete is on top of a car at night but then wakes up in the desert during the day. A countdown clock for a bomb leaps three hours in the space of one helicopter ride. The plot is a meaningless disjointed exercise in finding different ways to kill henchmen. Machete is asked to stop a schizophrenic lunatic named Mendez the Madman Demian Bichir from launching a missile into the US. Mendez has a device inserted into his chest so that if he dies the rocket will launch anyway. Machete is pursued by an assassin called The Chameleon who keeps changing faces and is played by Cuba Gooding Jr. Antonio Banderas and Lady Gaga who make little impression beyond small cameos. Machete's allies are Miss San Antonio Amber Heard an undercover agent and beauty queen and Luz Michelle Rodriguez who has lost one of her eyes. The strangest inclusions are shared between Mel Gibson as a madman named Voz who is a Star Wars fan and Sofia Vergara as a dominatrix. It all ends so abruptly and anticlimactically that you'll wonder why you bothered. Rodriguez's only interests seem to be in balancing casual juvenile sexism against an execution gallery. When the female characters aren't dressed down people are shot cut in half sliced up by helicopter blades burnt stabbed and any other form of decapitation you can think of. Some of this is disturbing and illtimed in the wake of real life gun violence. Other moments are tensionless like seeing Machete shot to blazes only to return injury free in the next scene. The more ludicrous elements like the girl with the machine gun breastplates are dismissed with a shrug of seenitallbefore. Remember the girl in Planet Terror with the prosthetic leg that doubled as an assault weapon? That's Machete Kills overall a bad imitation not a parody of a genre that was already crazy to begin with. Now it's just lazy and unnecessary.".

	schema:headline " Machete don't fail the fans and fans only in Machete Kills";
	schema:reviewBody "The story of Machete a tough Mexican vigilante out to settle the score has been a long one. On the set of his movie Desperado Robert Rodriguez was introduced to his cousin Danny Trejo who had a role as a hitman in the film. The writerdirector was inspired by the actor's physical appearance and so he created the character of Machete. The idea for a full feature film was given some time. In 2007 Rodriguez and his friend Quentin Tarantino created Grindhouse a doublefeature film meant to pay tribute to and spoof the cheap American films of the 1960s and the 1970s. A Rodriguezmade fake trailer for Machete which featured Trejo in the titular role as a man going out against the people who doublecrossed him was a part of the project. The trailer however received much interest from the fans and so in 2010 Rodriguez finally made his vision come true in the full feature film. Now Machete cuts his way back to the audience...Literally moments after a traumatic experience Machete Trejo is recruited by the President of the United States Rathcock portrayed by Charlie Sheen credited with his original name Carlos Estevez. Machete's mission is to go to Mexico and find Mendez The Madman Damien Bichir a revolutionary suffering from multiple personality disorder. The Madman threatens to launch a missile at Washington. Upon arrival in his homeland Machete discovers that things are much more complicated and what he was told to do might be just a part of what he is going to have to do as he is followed by hit men drug cartels a mendespising Madame Desdemona Sofia Vergara and her prostitutes and many other individuals. It all will eventually lead him however to Luther Voz Mel Gibson whose actions may have serious consequences not just for Mexico or the United States but for the entire world...Machete Kills is a corny action and humorpacked fun film  just what it is meant to be. The movie just like about every one of Rodriguez's works is not supposed to be taken seriously. The feature starts by making up for Machete's biggest deficit  a fake ? trailer for the next installment in the franchise Machete Kills Again... in Space. The trailer supposedly features Leonardo DiCaprio and Justin Bieber and is a clear spoof of Star Wars. But that's not even two minutes of craziness  and it gets so much crazier after that.There are naturally many references to pop culture. The trailer at the beginning and many scenes from the final act are throwbacks to Star Wars. Other references may include the ones to Mad Max or Moonraker. There are also tons of references to the previous films of Rodriguez such as Desperado Once Upon a Time in Mexico From Dusk till Dawn Planet Terror the director's segment of Grindhouse and obviously the first Machete. All of these provide for a great time for anyone who likes the films to which the references are made and certainly a treat to all fans of Robert Rodriguez.The acting when it's not purposefully bad is outstanding. Damien Bichir and Mel Gibson deserve a mention as the film's most prominent villains. Both of the actors appear to have had a great time on the set and portray their characters with much energy and distance. And of course Danny Trejo as the Mexican not to be messed with pulls off his character perfectly.Although the script was written by Kyle Ward based on Rodriguez's story rather than Rodriguez himself due to the tone and the humor of it it feels completely like Rodriguez's work. The director as usually was involved in many other aspects of filmmaking such as production composing the score which is as always in his works fitting and memorable editing etc.Overall Machete Kills is a fun exploitation film. It's more intentionally ridiculous funnier and more grindhousey than its predecessor. It is certainly not for everyone but Robert Rodriguez's fans should have a blast. Being one of them I definitely hope that Machete Kills Again... in Space will see the light of day. And then maybe Machete Continues to Kill Machete Still Kills Machete Kills Some More and Machete Retires from Killing... to Kill All Over Again? We'll see but as long as Rodriguez and Trejo are game so am I.".

It all will eventually lead him however to Luther Voz Mel Gibson whose actions may have serious consequences not just for Mexico or the United States but for the entire world...Machete Kills is a corny action and humorpacked fun film  just what it is meant to be. The movie just like about every one of Rodriguez's works is not supposed to be taken seriously. The feature starts by making up for Machete's biggest deficit  a fake ? trailer for the next installment in the franchise Machete Kills Again... in Space. The trailer supposedly features Leonardo DiCaprio and Justin Bieber and is a clear spoof of Star Wars. But that's not even two minutes of craziness  and it gets so much crazier after that.There are naturally many references to pop culture. The trailer at the beginning and many scenes from the final act are throwbacks to Star Wars. Other references may include the ones to Mad Max or Moonraker. There are also tons of references to the previous films of Rodriguez such as Desperado Once Upon a Time in Mexico From Dusk till Dawn Planet Terror the director's segment of Grindhouse and obviously the first Machete. All of these provide for a great time for anyone who likes the films to which the references are made and certainly a treat to all fans of Robert Rodriguez.The acting when it's not purposefully bad is outstanding. Damien Bichir and Mel Gibson deserve a mention as the film's most prominent villains. Both of the actors appear to have had a great time on the set and portray their characters with much energy and distance. And of course Danny Trejo as the Mexican not to be messed with pulls off his character perfectly.Although the script was written by Kyle Ward based on Rodriguez's story rather than Rodriguez himself due to the tone and the humor of it it feels completely like Rodriguez's work. The director as usually was involved in many other aspects of filmmaking such as production composing the score which is as always in his works fitting and memorable editing etc.Overall Machete Kills is a fun exploitation film. It's more intentionally ridiculous funnier and more grindhousey than its predecessor. It is certainly not for everyone but Robert Rodriguez's fans should have a blast. Being one of them I definitely hope that Machete Kills Again... in Space will see the light of day. And then maybe Machete Continues to Kill Machete Still Kills Machete Kills Some More and Machete Retires from Killing... to Kill All Over Again? We'll see but as long as Rodriguez and Trejo are game so am I.";

This is what happens when one segment of society is bound and determined to shrink government so small that it can be drowned in a bathtub things tend to get a bit shall we say dumbeddown. 2. People who actually pay money to see these films are as braindead as the writer director and producers of these films.  This written about people who make a great living producing movies... written by someone who based on the text of his review probably has yet to achieve one accomplishment of note that even remotely compares to the production of just one movie.3. These remind me of the old Blacksploitation films in the 70s only they are considerable lower budget and lower class.  Again DUH. Uh that was kind of the point John Baggs. These movies are an HOMAGE do the google to 70s grindhouse and blacksploitation movies. The excessive scratching on the film stock? Intentional to give the movie the feel of a 70s grindhouseexploitation film. There are many other things in the movie that directly pay homage to the 70s films and you can find these elements in many Rodriguez and Tarantino films. Since it reminded you of a 70s blacksploitation movie I would say MISSION ACCOMPLISHED and not lower budget lower class etcetera. 4. Honestly I can't think of a single good thing to say about it.  Since you didn't see EITHER of the Machete movies yet insisted on commenting about them I am not surprised that you are unable to say anything good about them. Generally to develop an opinion that matters one must EXPERIENCE the subject at hand. I guess your parents didn't teach you that if you have nothing good to say don't say anything at all. If they had perhaps you would not have commented and could be given the benefit of the doubt that you might be intelligent.5. MethHead Charlie CrackHead Danny and Brainless Jessica. What a team. The three of the together couldn't make one good brain between them as evident of their acceptance to participate in this film but then I guess when you are broke or drugged out like Charlie you'll do anything for money.   Let's do the math shall we? Charlie Danny Jessica.... many movie credits many accomplishments in life respectable bank accounts. John Baggs? Produces rambling semiliterate reviews of movies that he has never seen so that he can attack people who have actually succeeded in life. Sorry John but the math doesn't add up in your favor. In summary Machete Kills is exactly what it is advertised to be. It is an homage to 70s grindhouse and exploitation films. Why attempt apple v. orange comparisons between an intentional B movie and Oscarcaliber films that John Baggs probably hasn't seen either? Why not just get some popcorn and enjoy it? That means actually SEEING it John".

Machete Kills however is so over the top so violent so funny in a very creative Rodriguez way that I don't see how any action movie fan could resist watching it at least once. Machete Kills explores a completely different plot line from the original Machete. Personally I enjoy this movie for that reason because I'm not too big of a fan of repetition. Its also amazing how Robert Rodriguez always casts the most interesting actors together from Robert Deniro Lindsay Lohan and Jessica Alba to Mel Gibson Lady Gaga and Carlos Estavos also known as Charlie Sheen. So for anyone who loves Danny Trejo Robert Rodriguez or action movies in general I highly recommend you do yourself a favor ignore the low ratings for this movie and go buy tickets to check out Machete Kills for yourself.

The chopper blade snags the guts and hoists Machete's adversary into them cutting him to bites. In the middle of all this mayhem Mel Gibson pops up as the real villain. Danny Trejo plays everything straight as if he were in a serious movie and this goes a long way at the end of the day. Charlie Sheen is hilarious as Rathcock the President of the United States. If you're a big Jessica Alba fan you don't have to watch anything after her earlier scene where she is killed. This is just as surprising as Hitchcock's Psycho where Janet Leigh was offed in an earlier scene. Machete Kills qualifies as big dumb fun!

	schema:reviewBody "With a third film in mind Machete Kills is about setting it up I'm afraid. There are tons of decapitations and two different kinds of revamped machete weapons that do some serious damage. Needed by the President of the United States Charlie Sheen as a joke to stop a mad Mexican with multiplepersonalitydisorder Demian Bichir The Bridge Machete Danny Trejo holding a stoneface throughout will journey across the border into Mexico to find him. Machete discovers that the dangerous criminal Mendez Bichir alternating between a heroic burdened revolutionary and deranged cartel wacko has designed a device strapped to his heart that will ignite a missile aimed for The White House if he is killed. Machete must kidnap Mendez and keep him from death as a bounty is out for both of them. That and a manhating Mexican Madam with bra and strap on bulletguns !!! played with psychopathic fierceness by Modern Family's Sophia Verga a face switching hitmanwoman named Camalen the role alternates between Walter Goggins Cuba Gooding Jr. Lady Gaga and Antonio Banderas! and a sociopathic megalomaniac weaponsdesigner Mel Gibson with that psychopathic twinkle in his eye and firm grasp of how nuts his character is with a James Bond villain warehouse clones with martial arts fighting capabilities weapons that can molecularly decimate humans or shred body parts with ease and a space ship built to charter humans to a space station made specifically as a new place to live after global apocalypse this made possible by him of course. Also included is a beauty pageant agent Amber Heard fully understanding how her looks have benefited her in the film industry who may or may not can be trusted who is she actually working for it first seems like the President but her pageants are sponsored by Gibson and returning eyepatch revolutionary Luz Michelle Rodriguez looking mighty fine. The whole film is a design to absurdly present Machete as this unkillable killing machinea character right out of the 80s era of action heroeswho takes a licking and keeps on ticking. However I quickly tired of the dependence on CGI action sequencesthis is something I certainly miss from the 80s when real cars planes and boats went KABOOM! I'm not entirely sure there was some big demand for a sequel to the okay Machete and GRINDHOUSE has nearly played out as imitators some quite awesome like Hobo with a Shotgun come out of the woodwork since 2007. I think this sequel a flop at the box office should have been a sign that the audience who jived to GRINDHOUSE have perhaps moved on. Some filmmakers with far lower budgets have taken what their predecessors started and went further as far as exploitative elements go. Still seeing Trejo returning as a badass action hero was dope and Rodriguez engaging in gunfire and fisticuffs with Heard was a hoot. Lady Gaga's presence in the film the marketing campaign sure made an effort to use her name in credits might seem like a big deal but it is about as important if less so as that of Cuba Gooding Jr. Mel Gibson placing a metal comic villain mask after getting his face burnt while prior to this trying to recruit Machete was far more enjoyable than I expected it to be. Jessica Alba has the opening character from the previous film dying early part. Thankfully there's far less emphasis on immigration politik and more humor used on how illegals get across or don't the border.".

There are tons of decapitations and two different kinds of revamped machete weapons that do some serious damage. Needed by the President of the United States Charlie Sheen as a joke to stop a mad Mexican with multiplepersonalitydisorder Demian Bichir The Bridge Machete Danny Trejo holding a stoneface throughout will journey across the border into Mexico to find him. Machete discovers that the dangerous criminal Mendez Bichir alternating between a heroic burdened revolutionary and deranged cartel wacko has designed a device strapped to his heart that will ignite a missile aimed for The White House if he is killed. Machete must kidnap Mendez and keep him from death as a bounty is out for both of them. That and a manhating Mexican Madam with bra and strap on bulletguns !!! played with psychopathic fierceness by Modern Family's Sophia Verga a face switching hitmanwoman named Camalen the role alternates between Walter Goggins Cuba Gooding Jr. Lady Gaga and Antonio Banderas! and a sociopathic megalomaniac weaponsdesigner Mel Gibson with that psychopathic twinkle in his eye and firm grasp of how nuts his character is with a James Bond villain warehouse clones with martial arts fighting capabilities weapons that can molecularly decimate humans or shred body parts with ease and a space ship built to charter humans to a space station made specifically as a new place to live after global apocalypse this made possible by him of course. Also included is a beauty pageant agent Amber Heard fully understanding how her looks have benefited her in the film industry who may or may not can be trusted who is she actually working for it first seems like the President but her pageants are sponsored by Gibson and returning eyepatch revolutionary Luz Michelle Rodriguez looking mighty fine.

It has a plot  it is a gangster film  a hero his girl and villains.  There are betrayals and gunfights.  You still won't have seen anything like this before.  Imagine A BOUT DE SOUFFLE shot in the style of UNE FEMME EST UNE FEMME with a mixture of Leone Welles Melville THE AVENGERS and Fuller's HOUSE OF BAMBOO.  Not even close.The basic plot concerns the title hero a gangster trying to go straight. His boss and fatherfigure this is a very Oedipal film but the concept with its many variations is stretched to absurd breaking point also a former gangster is being pushed around by some extraordinarily attired hoods.  The hero has a girl who sings big Michel Legrandtype numbers in a huge blazingly colourful art decoBusby BerkeleyJean Cocteautype nightclub.  Because the hero is a maverick he lies low for a while i.e. drifts but is followed by a hitman.  All converges in a fairly predictable fashion.To appropriate the ad Plot is Nothing Style is Everything.  If a studio with big resources is as Welles claimed a 'toy set' then Seijun is the class freak.  The monochrome gangster world is blown apart by shocks of colour be they dazzling primary hues or deliberately effete pastels. This serves to upturn the black and white ideology of the gangster genre.  The men are all snarling and macho but the hero sings and whistles like the Duke's singing cowboy the lead villain wears loud red shirts and sports a ridiculous moustache.  There is even room in the plot for a gag about hairdryers.Like in Godard the crucial plot elements are roundly mocked the seemingly major event of the hero being captured by and subsequently evading the police is as if filmed by an inept child.  The group violence scenes are messy like brawls at a children's party.  There is even a barroom brawl in a Western saloon in a Japanese gangster movie.Mirroring Melville's heros the hero aspires to aloof selfsufficiency but he is constantly undermined by the film.  Whole chunks of story don't make sense.  The vertiginous editing is like the maniacal stringpulling of a puppeteer and there is a strong Brechtian feel to the film with frequent breaks for cheesy song impossible sets unmotivated lighting some of the most bizarre and beautiful camera movements in film.All this stylistic bravura could be monotonous if it wasn't grounded intellectually and emotionally.  There are some really beautiful oases of grace amid the violent mayhem.  The film is a firm attack on the assumptions of genre conformity sterile repetition linked to conformity in Japanese society at large and big business in particular.  Like 50s melodramas the colour schemes lighting and composition reflect the state of mind of the characters.  The lengthy snow sequence is worthy of Joyce's 'The Dead'.When it comes to Japanese cinema I know we're all supposed to bow down to Kurosawa and Ozu but I'll take the absolutely hatstand Seijun anyday. Breathtaking genius.".

Everything about this fashionably unhinged effort reeks of ultracoolness with its edgy but trendy stylish guidance painting an influential pathway for many filmmakers to experiment but also providing familiar staples of noir and western inspirations to its own brash creative juices. I admit the busily dry story is quite an unbalanced muddle with fractured editing but still for that time glamorously unconventional and erratically bewildering. The focus of the material is that of devotion of business and love but some quirky sight gags and mayhem make there way in. Mainly it's all about the majestic setpieces though and the delirious appeal of them are a wondrously enchanting sight. A trippy colour scheme infuses itself on the psychedelically warped setdesigns of moody composition lighting and the sudden bursts of exaggerated violence have a poetically tough awe surrounding it. The taut pace of the film stays pretty much on cruise control but where the energy feeds off can be linked to Kaburagi So's fierily dramatic jazz musical score and Mine Shigeyoshi's intimately snappy cinematography positioning. Even breaking up the murky narrative are odd song choices and a rhythmic theme. The colourful performances are dashing and lifelike with a brooding array of interesting characters. Testsuya Watari HidekaI Nitani Ryuji Kita Chieko Matsubara and Eiji Go are enjoyably tailored to their parts. Highly stylised fun.".

This is by far one of the most visually unique movies I have ever seen and the fact that it was made in 1966 makes it even more impressive.Tetsuya played by Tetsuya Watari is a yakuza who has joined his boss Kurato Ryuji Kita in going straight. Unfortunately for both of them a rival gang begins threatening Kurato's legitimate business. After a brief confrontation Tetsuya is forced to leave his boss that way he would hopefully relieve the pressure between Kurato and the gang. Things don't go as smoothly as Tetsuya planned and he finds himself chased by gangs all over Japan.The story is standard fare yakuza tale. With a hefty doze of betrayal inner power struggles and a bit of melodrama in the form of Tetsuya's girlfriend. We've seen it all before. Now. What really sets this movie apart from any other is it's unique visual nearly surrealistic style. Suziki employs several tricks in order to assure that the film will remain distant from any other. His use of colors creates one part of the that. More accurately his use of color contrast we see that in several scenes through the movie for example during the final shootout we see gang members dressed in primarily black suits while the location itself was in mainly white bright colors. Tetsuya himself is often dressed in colors that merge him with the backgrounds further helping in the creation of the film's extravagant look. The second aspect of the movie's uniqueness is the camera work and the overall directing. Suziki employs techniques that are reminiscene of western movies and more specifically Sergio Leone's line of work. The final shootout again serves as a great example of that.The acting is on par with the script characters are well played by their respective actors. They don't make an overly big impression but certainly don't deteriorate the quality. The film has a good music score with a particularly memorable theme song by the main actor Tetsuya Watari that is always nice to hear and fit's very well with the mood.Tokyo Drifter is a movie that offers stunning visuals and a plot that while not very deep in characterization is still able to carry the film's unique style. Mister Suzuki is able to impress sadly his production company at the time wasn't on the same opinion and soon after he was fired and blacklisted for 10 years. A real shame for a director with such talent.".

	schema:headline " A radical popart influenced slice of pure psychedelic 60's chic";
	schema:reviewBody "Much of Tokyo Drifter 1966 requires a certain sense of cultural background and historical context in order to be better appreciated otherwise it most probably seems vapid dated and entirely incoherent. You have to appreciate the fact that for the first part of his career director Seijun Suzuki was a contract player for Nikkatsu Pictures and largely obligated contractually to take any project offered to him regardless of plot concept or theme. He was also working under fairly strict conditions in order to produce the biggest financial turnover whilst simultaneously striving to give his films a certain sense of character or individuality to make them stand out against the other identikit youth films being produced by Nikkatsu at that particular time. By the mid1960's he'd already begun to push his films further into more personal idiosyncratic directions experimenting with colour on Youth of the Beast 1963 and composition in The Story of a Prostitute 1965 as well as experimenting with more theatrical uses of lighting and location design on the classic Gate of Flesh 1964.Most of these stylistic flourishes came from his interest in Kabuki theatre with Suzuki transposing the artificial ornate and entirely abstract world of those productions to the gritty and violent streets of his lowbudget Bpictures. It is important to keep in mind also that these films were incredibly cheap to make and certainly not considered to be prestige pictures. Think of the hundreds of other films being released by the same company at the same time and ask yourself why these films aren't getting the same kind of posthumous attention in the west. The real reason is the context. Suzuki transcended the limitations of what was required of his work instilling it with a personal style and a larger than life sense of exuberance that resonates with anyone who can truly appreciate the magic and power of cinema. This is apparent right from the start of Tokyo Drifter as a black and white sequence of betrayal sets up the mood of gritty violence punctuated by stark abstraction. The scene is vague and enigmatic choreographed in such a way as to suggest pastiche but still managing to remain fairly brutal. Suzuki also wastes no time throwing us into this overly complicated narrative in which the turf war between two rival Yakuza fractions spirals out of control and causes grief for a loyal young thug trying to do the right thing whilst still attempting to remain faithful to his boss.However what is most remarkable about this scene and about the film in general is Suzuki's anarchic and unconventional approach to location and production design as well as his fragmented bursts of editing and his masterful use of cinematography. The opening scene fools us into thinking that this will be another run of the mill lowbudget gangthriller in gritty black and white. However as the central character drops down on one knee to fire a succession of shots past the camera at an offscreen foe we cut briefly to a shot of bold dizzying colour. After the opening scene has played out the film cuts to that catchy title song and the film switches to colour full time. This juxtaposition is a jarring one and establishes the mood and tone that Suzuki had in mind for us as the rest of the film continues these ideas of abstraction exuberance and the utterly unconventional. The cinematography design editing and costumes are fantastic throughout with Suzuki and his team using bold primary colours that create an almost comicstrip like quality whilst the use of theatrical lighting camera movement and those epic cinemascope compositions turn a backstreet battle for power into an epic parable of almost Shakespearian proportions.If you're already familiar with Japanese Yakuza cinema from the grittier more hardhitting films of Kinji Fukasaku to the restless experimentations of Takashi Miike or indeed the unconventional gang cinema of Takeshi Kitano then you'll already know what to expect from the presentation of character and theme established by Suzuki herein. So we have loyalty betrayal power corruption brotherhood and retribution alongside the central notion of a onceviolent character attempting to remove himself from a world that he can no longer understand. Obviously given the conventions of the genre he can never quite escape this world and indeed it is here where the conflict of the film will arise. However such notions of story and character are sure to come secondary to the overwhelming power of Suzuki's images which suggest as one reviewer put it the spirit of a youthful Jean Luc Godard directing Point Blank 1967 from a script by Stan Lee.Criticisms that Suzuki can't tell a coherent story are puerile and go against every notion of what cinema is and what cinema should attain to. You simply cannot judge a filmmaker off the strengths and weaknesses of a single film especially one that already has a reputation as being one of his most radical and slyly anarchic. It's like dismissing the work of Takashi Miike after only having seen Fudoh A New Generation 1996 or Dead or Alive 1999 or even dismissing Tarantino off the back of Death Proof 2007 or Kill Bill 2003. There are plenty of films from Suzuki in which the story is a primary concern however with Tokyo Drifter he was attempting something different something more revolutionary. A pure slice of psychedelic 60's chic in the pop art tradition with shootouts fist fights fragmented editing and some truly intoxicating colours.".

It's fine when first played during the opening credits but enough is enough. It's played at least ten times throughout the entire film.

With more and more pressure being added the former gangster must turn drifter to keep the heat off of his beloved boss. I'm really not sure if that's the exact story to this thing because it seemed all over the place. Not to mention the fact that it was rather clear that the director was more interested in getting all the style on film and this style is basically the main reason to see this film. The beautiful colors certainly leap off the screen as does the terrific cinematography but the lack of story really left me cold.

With lots of vivid colours and imaginative interiors akin to a big budget Hollywood musical 'Tokyo Drifter' is an incredibly stylish film and the memorable bits and pieces are hard to shake like one scene where lead actor Tetsuya Watari plays chicken on a set of train tracks with a man trying to kill him. The virtues are however few and far between. The movie is extremely heavy on dialogue and very light on action except near the end and with it sometimes unclear who exactly certainly characters are and what exactly they hold against Watari it is little surprise to learn that many have found the film incomprehensible over time  including the studio who made the film which fired the director soon afterwards. Watari is additionally saddled with singing aloud a repetitive theme song about being a drifter not only does the tune get on the nerves there is an unintentional hilarity to a hardened gangster who sings as he goes from job to job. The film is not quite as worthless as it may sound though the basic story of a former yakuza cut off from his boss and clan brings to mind 'Yojimbo' though stylistically the film is perhaps best thought of as Godard'Breathless' attempt to quash genre conventions. It is interesting for sure for as curiosity piece but those looking for an action thriller or a drama about lost identity and loneliness would do better to look elsewhere.".

	schema:reviewBody "Machete is one of the funnest movies I've ever seen. Right from the beginning you know this movie doesn't take itself seriously. It's essentially a liveaction cartoon with Alist actors. You have Danny Trejo  the antithesis of a leading man  carrying the movie as Machete the unkillable badass Mexican James Bond. If you want to talk plot this is basically a revenge story. Steven Seagal kills his family then years later Machete gets caught up in a political scandal where Robert De Niro is playing a cross between George Bush and Donald Trump and somehow Seagal's character is pulling the strings. It's as amazing as it sounds. Then you have Don Johnson as the head of border patrol or something mowing down Mexicans all over the place and Jeff Fahey as one of Seagal's enforcers in Texas. Now you may be thinking Four villains? This sounds more convoluted than Spiderman 3! And you'd have a point if this was a traditional action movie but it's not. At all. It's a comedy more than anything with some ridiculous action sequences and gratuitous TA all over the place. These characters just serve to forward the plot and to give us some belly laughs and somehow it all works beautifully.Jessica Alba is one of the officers assigned to this scandal. Michelle Rodriguez serves as the leader of a Mexican resistance oh and there's Lindsey Lohan playing Jeff Fahey's religious daughter. There are so many characters and somehow they all fit the movie perfectly. All of the acting is great well Alba is never great but she serves her purpose and she's as hot as a supernova so who cares. But you can buy Robert De Niro as a corrupt senator Don Johnson as this racist megalomaniac Fahey as this hardass enforcer and Seagal as a Mexican drug lord. Yeah. And the best part is they're all having a blast. It's pure mayhem going on and you're not bored for a second. Danny Trejo as the title character deserves much props though. He just looks like a guy who would have a wide array of knives stashed under his vest and the guy is making out with some of the hottest women on the planet. It's the role of a lifetime.Robert Rodriguez is amazing for making this an actual movie and the cast are amazing for agreeing to be part of this project. It's so so SO entertaining. It's damn near impossible to sit through this movie with a straight face. I had a big fat grin throughout the whole thing. If you like silly action movies with fantastic actors and a surprisingly good plot then look no further than Machete.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is what it says it is. Nothing less. And perhaps a little more. Most of Machete's critics that have given overall negative reviews have fallen into a trap of their own devices. Machete is an exploitation film and was advertised as such. By definition and exploitation film will include excessive violence gore nudity and be high on intentional corny lines while low on plot devices and character development. To give low ratings to Machete because of one's distaste for the genre would be like saying The Shinning was awful because I don't like horror. This is one of Rodriguez best films to date side by side with Sin City 2005. Machete delivers on all accounts of action gore nudity and corny lines. The plot is simple but honestly that's how it should be. The thing that sets this apart from other exploitation films is that the acting is top notch. I personally found that the three main female characters to be the most intriguing and diverse.Jessica Alba plays the part of an ICE agent struggling with her loyalty to her nation and her people. She slowly begins to question her own logic on if people should follow law simply because they are laws. We see this struggle immediately when she approaches a taco stand apparently once every week to by a coffee and lunch despite her own people feeling from her site. Why does she continue this ritual? She says it is to check the papers of the character Luz but really it is to try and hold onto a sliver of identity among her people. Michelle Rodriguez plays said Luz aka She as an underground leader of illegal immigration. The character of Luz is a simple woman who believes in not bending to the broken system but fighting for her people the mirror image of Alba. She is only a myth on which Luz has built a cult following understanding that sometimes being a myth can do more damage than flesh and blood. By the end of the film Luz is reborn as the mythical She just in time for the bloody battle.Finally the actress that surprised me the most was Lindsay Lohan. Despite only receiving 1015 minutes of screen time most are which she is undressed she plays her character perfectly and flawlessly. The role seems to be written specifically for her and I applaud her for stepping up and taking on such a mature role. One of her first scenes is a tongueincheek conversation about how she needs to give the people of the internet what they want and that is more of her. Lohan played the part beautifully in all aspects and specks of talent are clearly visible. I hope that filmmakers and audiences as well as herself continue to allow her opportunities to showcase that talent. Machete is an exploitation film at its finest. And for the most part if you are the type of cinema attendee who wants to see a movie called Machete in the first place chances are you will be thoroughly entertained.".

Soak that in for a  moment.  The story for Machete as outlandish as it is goes something like  this He looked like just another day laborer from the hood and the  perfect scapegoat for a corrupt political assassination. But he turned  out to be MACHETE a legendary exFederale with a deadly attitude and  the skills to match. Left for dead after attempting to go against the  notorious Mexican drug kingpin Torrez Steven Seagal Machete has  escaped to Texas. But what he finds is a web of corruption and betrayal  that leaves a bullet in a senator Robert DeNiro and Machete a wanted  man. Machete sets out to clear his name and expose this conspiracy but  he does it. The MACHETE way. What ensues is a wildly creative tale of  carnage vengeance and a Mexican Revolution. You might have been  familiar with this film since 2007 since a fake trailer for Machete  was shown in the ambitious double feature event Grindhouse that is now  regarded as legendary trailer. Well now you have your entire film  version.  Danny Trejo is finally getting his due here. Always the most badass in  his film appearances he's never had much of a leading role except for  now. He is fantastic as Machete and at the current age of 66 the  action he does is pretty phenomenal. Machete is the type of character  that always gets the oneup on the bad guys and the love of the ladies  and you can just sense that Trejo is loving every moment of it.  Luckily so are we.  Machete is a film chockfull of truly schmaltzy performances from every  member of the cast. The big difference here is that the schmaltz is  intentional. The villains of this movie are so appropriately evil and  murderous with a samurai sword wielding Steven Seagal in his first  villainous role simply stealing the show as Torrez. Yes I just said  that Steven Seagal stole the show over a hilarious politically  incorrect politician Robert DeNiro a sleazy rogue businessman Jeff  Fahey and a sinister Mexican shooting Don Johnson. You really want to  see these foes get what they deserve. Bonus points if you spot Quentin  Tarantino in a blink and you miss it cameo! With these villains and  their humorous henchmen Machete also has his own connections and  compadres. Jessica Alba is believe it or not the main love interest  to Machete and some of her deliveries are so cringeinducing it's  squirmworthy. Yet she's alright! There's also Michelle Rodriguez as  Luz a rather attractive taco truck lady who may have a secret identity  as a Mexican patriot who plays it just fine. But it's Padre Machete's  brother played by Cheech Marin whose sequences in the film are some  of the very best. He's hysterical and can handle dual shotguns like  nobody else. And yes Lindsay Lohan is in this and she's not halfbad  for the little things she has to do. When she's not nude she's dressed  up as a pretty nifty revolver packing nun but she doesn't pack that  much of a punch.  Machete is a film that embodies all of the facets a 1970s  blaxploitation film would have but with the Hispanic culture. This is  Mexploitation with a resonant grindhouse feeling complete with film  reel scratches and fake political ads. But the violence and action in  this is so extraordinary and unapologetically gruesome with the  extremity of it all not being taken seriously at all. The things they  do in this film guaranteed you haven't seen most of them ever done  before. Corkscrews highheels weedwhackers and of course  machetes are only a very small listing of all the tools and weapons  used to dispatch characters in Machete. It's over the top absolutely  ridiculous scenes that pop up every five minutes and make for a joyous  film experience. There are too many beheadings bloodsplattering  gunshots and limb removals to count. Don't even get me started on the  stabbings. To add the cherry on top Machete is shot perfectly  fluidly and inventively.  Machete is completely for lack of a better term over the top has a  fitting heavy and groovy soundtrack and never holds back on the gore.  The dialogue is hokey and full of Mexican puns but it knows this.  Machete loves to poke fun at itself and its ridiculous concepts with  characters questioning certain events in the movie realizations that  everything is insane and an awesome Bmovie touch that graces the  opening of the end credits. Machete is Robert Rodriguez's most  enjoyable and best film to date. It's so fun so amazing and actually  provides a sort of a social political message now with racial  profiling and immigration being a controversial Americana topic. It's  why Machete is such a great film for the times and will be looked upon  as one of the culturally relevant films of the last couple years I'm  as shocked as you are.  Machete is the best action film of 2010 and is certainly one of the  best of the year. It's fantastic entertainment that I oh so highly  recommend you watch. Machete es...... Yes excelente.".

It's over the top absolutely  ridiculous scenes that pop up every five minutes and make for a joyous  film experience. There are too many beheadings bloodsplattering  gunshots and limb removals to count. Don't even get me started on the  stabbings. To add the cherry on top Machete is shot perfectly  fluidly and inventively.  Machete is completely for lack of a better term over the top has a  fitting heavy and groovy soundtrack and never holds back on the gore.  The dialogue is hokey and full of Mexican puns but it knows this.  Machete loves to poke fun at itself and its ridiculous concepts with  characters questioning certain events in the movie realizations that  everything is insane and an awesome Bmovie touch that graces the  opening of the end credits. Machete is Robert Rodriguez's most  enjoyable and best film to date. It's so fun so amazing and actually  provides a sort of a social political message now with racial  profiling and immigration being a controversial Americana topic. It's  why Machete is such a great film for the times and will be looked upon  as one of the culturally relevant films of the last couple years I'm  as shocked as you are.  Machete is the best action film of 2010 and is certainly one of the  best of the year. It's fantastic entertainment that I oh so highly  recommend you watch. Machete es...... Yes excelente.";

	schema:reviewBody "As I was in the theater watching Machete I could not help but see certain scenes and keep a list in my head of people who would hate this movie. When Machete Danny Trejo takes out the knife whose nickname he bears and cuts people's heads off people who hate violence in movie made my list. When Sartana Jessica Alba takes a shower and leans against the wall in a way that millions of men probably fantasized about most if not all women found its way onto my list. When Padre the RomanCatholic priest Cheech Marin says God has mercy. I don't. to a guy before blowing his brains out with a rifle I couldn't help but mentally pencil in two other groups of people Catholics and people who hadn't seen Grindhouse 2007 when it came out in theaters three years ago.Well I love violent action films I think Jessica Alba is gorgeous I am Catholic but am not easily offended and I was one of a surprising few who saw the aforementioned ambitious tribute to Bmovies of the 70's and 80's. Therefore I enjoyed Machete a lot but I imagine others would have to take it with a grain of salt.Machete based on a fake trailer made exclusively for Grindhouse that director Robert Rodriguez decided to expand into a featurelength film is not meant to be taken seriously. If anything it's a clever film with a lot of great action sequences intriguing characters many interesting subplots and a good story at its base. For starters it also has an impressive roster of talented actors in it. There is an interesting mix of the usual Rodriguez players Danny Trejo Cheech Marin Jeff Fahey really good actors Robert De Niro notoriously bad actors Steven Seagal Don Johnson and talented players that have made some bad film choices over the last few years Jessica Alba Lindsay Lohan. The funny thing is that good or bad most of these actors seem perfect fits for this movie and work well off each other.Trejo may have been an action star if he came to fame in 1970's cinema. Nowadays it's not unusual to see good looking celebrities like Tom Cruise and Ryan Reynolds headline action films. Thankfully Rodriguez like Quentin Tarantino who coproduced this film but for some reason remained uncredited saw something in this 66yearold exconvict because Trejo makes a great lead for an action film. Just one look at him and you may want to start running. He's rugged doesn't take any crap from anyone and it is what action stars should be. It's just too bad the villains in this movie are not aware of that fact and there are many villains.There's Torrez Steven Seagal a drug kingpin who betrayed Machete while he was a Federale in Mexico. There's Booth Jeff Fahey who hires Machete to assassinate a Republican senator De Niro who's staunchly against illegal immigration. There's also a corrupt border patrolman Don Johnson who kills illegal immigrants with no mercy. Although Jessica Alba plays an INS agent you really can't stay mad at her for long.Although Death Proof and Planet Terror found a separate following on DVD Grindhouse which combined the two films along with fake previews did not do well at the box office despite rave reviews. So the timing may have been bad for Machete had it not been for the controversial Arizona immigration law that coincidentally coincided with this film's release. Whether or not this movie can be seen as a HispanicAmerican revenge fantasy is not up to me to decide although Michelle Rodriguez's turn as Luz who is suspected of aiding illegal immigrants raises some interesting questions. The film does seem to forget that it's a parody of exploitation films of years past at times but never ceases from being fun. Just as Rodriguez brought Machete from a coming attraction to a feature film I hope Rob Zombie does the same for his Werewolf Women of the SS preview.".

BGrade superstar Danny Trejo stars as the title character. Those that have seen the mock trailer or the grindhouse films know the style of yesteryear that Machete is representing. Cheap nasty and funny is the order of the day for this kind of film. Rodriguez clearly knows his genre and audience. He goes all out with this overthetop action flick. The story is of course ridiculous. Machete is betrayed by some above the law dudes and has to get revenge by slicing and dicing whoever gets in his way. The film does what it says on the cover. Don't go in expecting a glimmer of subtlety or characterization. Go in expecting action titties action blood titties oh and action. This would be all well and good except for some slight problems. The unashamedly preachy messages against the MexicanUnited States border does get a bit tiring as does the repetitive nature of the violence after some interesting action set pieces they all become similar except towards the end. Also this kind of film needs to be much snappier and shorter. It's around twenty minutes too long so that the humor and overall style tends to drag on a bit. Machete holds it's tongue permanently in cheek and Danny Trejo milks every scene as much as he possibly can. Jessica Alba Michelle Rodriguez and Lindsay Lohan all make for good eye candy and there are some very funny moments. All in all this exercise in grindhouse excess should keep the fans of this style very happy even if it can slightly bore others.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have a question for a lot of the positive reviewers on here Did you REALLY like this movie or are you just gushing out of respect for Rodriguez??? I'm a Rodriguez fan too in case you didn't know. Tarantino and Rodriguez are the kings of bmovies. They know how to make a good bmovie and their extensive filmography has shown. With Tarantino you have Kill Bill Jackie Brown and Inglourious Basterds with Rodiriguez you have Planet Terror From Dusk Till Dawn and the king of all things Visually gorgeous Sin City. What I love about both of them is that while their films are indeed exercises in Style Over Substance they're aware of it and don't take themselves too seriously.I still stand by Grindhouse as the most fun I've had at the theatre. Two great movies from two fantastic directors with some hilarious fake trailers thrown in there for the price of one. After Hobo With A Shotgun Machete showed. I laughed so hard! And then the news broke that Machete was going to be a full movie. I was excited.Turns out some fake trailers should just stay fake trailers.As I mentioned earlier Rodriguez's films are Style Over Substance. But they are aware of it and don't take themselves too seriously and for that come off as awesome. Was this movie Style Over Substance? Yes. Did it follow its Don't take yourself too seriously rule? Well it did... for the first 20 minutes.I was liking the first 20 minutes. Even as a gore hound I was wondering if I should be eating during that scene! Then of course we get the awesome betrayal scene and the hospital scene... I especially loved when Machete cut the man's abdomen open and used his intestine as a rope to escape through a window. I laughed!!! Then it went downhill from there.First off Jessica Alba was annoying. Take her out of the movie and it wouldn't be different. All she does is just run around and scream the plot out loud. The most cringe worthy scene was near the end when she got up on the bonnet of the car and made that speech. That brought back memories of Robin Hood of earlier this year you know what scene I'm talking about. Second this film has too much plot in it and too many characters. For a movie that's supposed to be a bflick this movie shouldn't be about political mumbo jumbo.The characters are a big letdown here. Or at least the representation of characters. Let's begin. She is a great character. About halfway through the film she is killed off... then near the end she survived!!! Or the Priest. He is a likable character too. Then he gets killed off 5 minutes after his first appearance. Or what about Daryl Sabara's character? He's a funny guy and he has what feels like 30 seconds of screen time... and yet he's one of the main actors in the opening credits!!! Bigger yet what about the villain? WHO'S THE VILLAIN? Is it Segal who has a total of 6 minutes of screen time De Niro or Fahey who easily out of the three supposed villains gets the most screen time... except he dies 10 MINUTES BEFORE THE CLIMAX. Or Lindsay Lohan... why is she even in there other than the fact that she's Fahey's character's daughter??? The climax is a total anticlimax. There's no excitement in the battle at all it's incredibly dull and boring. Even the iconic bit shown in the trailer with the bike was underwhelming. And Segal's character's death even felt copped out and lazy.By the time the film was done I was so glad I was out of the theatre. The film bored me enough with its slow pace. For a movie that claims to be an ultra gory action bflick there's about 10 minutes of action 90 minutes of boring dialogue. This is supposed to be a bmovie not some political crap. I like slow paced films but not when they're supposed to be fun bmovies.Sorry Mr. Rodriguez but I think your days are numbered!".

Stringing together some cruel moments of gore with lame comedy a few bare breasts how people can rave about the copious nudity in this movie when there's hardly anything on show is beside me heavyhanded political satire which makes his sincere message come across as racist stupidity and some of the least exciting action scenes ever Machete is a complete failure. Acting performances are weak across the board and Danny Trejo is a frightening figure yet he doesn't cut it ooh look I made a pun as an interesting lead character. He doesn't have the charisma to transcend the extreme simplicity of the character. And while I know he could crush me with his bare hands he certainly doesn't convince when going up against villainous henchmen half his age. The finale is the worst part of the film. The heroic Mexicans attack the racist American vigilantes and much slaughter ensues but without any tension at all with extremely weak choreography and telegraphed 'cool' moments referencing 'classic' exploitation characters which are largely embarrassing. Nothing is quite as embarrassing as the final battle between Trejo and Steven Seagal though. No choreography to speak of shot and edited in the least effective way I've seen better fights in TVseries and with an utterly lame ending it has absolutely no redeeming features. Except that it's short barely one minute of screen time. Maybe one day Rodriguez will accept the fact that he can't write or tell stories and start working from scripts by other people who can. Until that day we'll be stuck with crap like Machete however.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Mexico the determinate federal agent Machete Cortez Danny Trejo opposes to the order of his chief and drives with his partner to the hideout of the drug lord Rogelio Torrez Steven Seagal to rescue an abducted woman Mayra Leal that is witness against the gangster. However he finds the witness naked on the bed but he is surprisingly betrayed by her and his wife and daughter are murdered by Torrez. Three years later Machete is an illegal immigrant in Texas that wanders on the streets seeking job in the Day Labor Site. He is hired by Michael Booth Jeff Fahey to assassinate the boasting rightwinged Senator John McLaughlin Robert De Niro who is against the immigrants and defends the construction of an electrified fence along the border with Mexico. Machete receives one hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the assignment but he gives the money to Luz Michelle Rodriguez a Mexican woman that sells taco in her truck and manages the underground Network that assists illegal Mexicans and helped Machete three years ago.When Machete is ready as a sniper in a tower he finds that he has been betrayed and set up by Booth who actually is McLaughlin's adviser and plotted the scheme to improve the statistics with the sympathy of the electors to McLaughlin. Once again Machete survives and discovers that Booth supports the vigilantes led by the cruel Von Jackson Don Johnson and is associated to Torrez. Now Machete seeks revenge against his enemies and becomes a myth.Machete is a funny action movie and THE FILM of Danny Trejo that perfectly fits to the antihero. The story follows the style of B movies with exploitation and ultraviolence but has a cast that is a constellation of stars. There are memorable lines my favorite is when the priest says God has mercy I don't and details like the name of the garage Machete's Chop Shop. I have just watched this film on DVD and the deleted scenes shows many details of the story that unfortunately have been deleted in the edition like the twin sister of Sartana Rivera Sis or Rose McGowan as the assassin Boots McCoy. My vote is eight.Title Brazil MacheteNote On 22 September 2015 I saw this film again.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are a number of great Mexploitation films. El Mariachi Desperado and Once Upon a Time in Mexico all come to mind. Not only were those films actionpacked and entertaining but they contained good plots which one could follow without losing interest.Then there's Machete. I'll keep things honest seeing as apparently the only submitted reviews were done by film crew members.The movie starts out well. In the first scene Machete and his partner who dies almost immediately storms into a drug cartel wreaking havoc against armed goons with nothing but his get ready machete. He kills about a dozen people rescuing a naked female hostage in the process. However as they're leaving the cartel hideout she betrays Machete to the cartel's leader a man named Torrez played by Steven Seagal. Machete being subdued Torrez tortures Machete but decides not to kill him. Instead he kills Machete's wife and child and leaves Machete alive so that he can suffer for the rest of his life.Yes it's simple but the movie actually looked quite good up until this point. Then the nightmare began.Rather than construct a decent story and continue with the main plot i.e. a man with nothing to lose trying to avenge the deaths of his wife and child the movie veers off into a tirade of politicizations and hatemongering. It portrays white conservatives get ready for some originality as racist rednecks who are hellbent on killing Mexicans for sheer enjoyment. It even shows a U.S. Senator played by Robert De Niro killing a pregnant illegal alien and her spouse saying afterward My supporters would love this paraphrase.Yes Hollywood people are not against illegal immigration because it destroys the Rule of Law hurts the economy increases unemployment increases violent crime puts financial burdens on taxpayers etc.  it's because they hate Hispanics.Before continuing I just want to mention that the writer of this review is the product of a Hispanic father. OK here we go.As already mentioned after the opening sequence the movie becomes overtly political. The aforementioned senator played by De Niro is seen campaigning for reelection his main political platform being the construction of a borderfence designed to keep out illegal aliens the horror!. However many people in power are against this and they hire Machete now a daylaborer to assassinate the senator. Of course as indicated by the coming attractions Machete is betrayed by the very people who hire him and it is revealed that they are in fact working for the very cartel leader who killed Machete's family what a startling coincidence!. It turns out that Machete was only hired to arouse public sympathy for the senator and increase the public's demand for a border fence which Torrez the cartel leader who killed Machete's family wants given that then he can control the drug trade between the MexicanU.S. border.The story gets very boring with immigration politics ascending into the forefront. The action slows down to a grinding halt and the story devolves into simple political platitudes check out Jessica Alba's call for a racewar near the end of the movie demanding that illegal immigrants incite violence in order to acquire citizenship.In conclusion this movie sucks. Mr. Rodriguez I want my money back.".

	schema:reviewBody "Machete contains a heaping dose of bloody violence a moderate amount of nudity and waaaaaay too much sledgehammer moralizing on the issue of illegal immigration. It has some trashy thrills but becomes too bloated and blurred by Robert Rodriguez' inability to decide if he's making a modern version of the 70s exploitation flick an homage to 70s exploitation flicks or a parody of the 70s exploitation flick.Machete Danny Trejo is a legendary and legendarily violent Mexican cop who tried to take down a drug lord named Torrez Steven Seagal and lost. His family slain Machete is exiled to America and spends the next three years as an illegal immigrant day laborer. Then one day he's hired by a man called Booth Jeff Fahey to assassinate a virulently antiimmigrant Texas State Senator Robert De Niro. It turns out that Machete is just a patsy in a bigger and much more elaborate plot and with the help of Immigration Agent Sartana Jessica Alba illegal immigrant underground leader Luz Michelle Rodriguez and his brother the priest Cheech Marin the squat and wattled Mexican juggernaut sets out to settle scores both old and new.This film has a lot of people getting brutally killed and several attractive women getting naked. Combine that with a bluntly effective performance by Danny Trejo and you've got the basic ingredients for some low brow fun. Unfortunately Rodriguez does a very poor job in mixing them together. You can ignore that for a while but it eventually leaves a bad taste in your mouth.To start with there's just too much of everything in this movie. In addition to loads of cannon fodder it has 4 major bad guys and three sublevel bad guys. In Star Wars terminology that's 4 Darth Vaders and 3 Boba Fetts. Yet with all of those villains running around Machete only manages to sort of kill one of them. In addition one of those bad guys doesn't get just one ironic comeuppance he gets 4 ironic comeuppances and they all happen in the last 15 minutes of the film. No I'm not exaggerating for effect. And Machete doesn't just have one badass chick on his side he's got 3. Too much of this movie is like an old school pro wrestling battle royal with 20 guys in the ring at once all trying to throw each other over the top rope. It sounds neat in theory but in reality it's just an undifferentiated mass of humanity flailing away at each other.It also doesn't help that this film has a very schizophrenic tone. At times it's played fairly seriously as though Machete were supposed to be a straight forward action flick. Then there are moments that are much more tongue in cheek winking at the audience to let them in on the joke. But then the movie sometimes goes so overthetop that it can't be seen as anything more than parody. In Schwarzenegger terms it's like combining Eraser with Kindergarten Cop and then blending that with The Last Action Hero.Lindsay Lohan is in Machete and she lookswell just horrible. If you've ever wondered how accurate the tabloid stories are about Lohan's life one look at her here will resolve all doubts. It's not only that she gives probably the worst performance in the whole cast. It's also that she appears far more haggard and world weary than the actress who plays her mother. The phrase rode hard and put away wet has never been more appropriate than to describe Lohan in this motion picture.There are some good bits to Machete but after an explosive start it loses its zest in too many mood swings and gets weighed down by too many complications. This film began as a fake trailer in Rodriguez and Tarantino's Grindhouse and that's as far as it probably should have gotten. It's not horrible but it's definitely not anything you need to pay theater prices to see.".

I am a big fan of Rodriguez's earlier film 'Desperado' and Machete is similar to that except where Desperado took itself seriously this film has its tongue firmly in cheek and from this you get a lot of the humour  and it works. From start all the way through to the finish there is something happening that keeps you glued to the screen. Perfect to watch in a group especially if some of them have a low attention span. Limits have been pushed and I love it. It is not excessive violence for random excessive violence sake it's been thought about and works extremely well in regard to the story and tone of the film. I would describe 'Planet Terror' as a practice for what Rodriguez wanted that didn't quite deliver and Machete as the masterpiece  that delivers on all cylinders. I cannot recommend this film enough as a riotous laugh out loud violent and engaging experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Interesting to see all the boilerplate 810 ratings before the film came out. Typical WhollyOdd frontloading IMDb with praise to raise a film's rating and coax people to see it.This is one of those films that combines a halfbaked political message with a thin pretense of story so that the filmmakers can bask in the glow of their supporters' praise while claiming it's just a movie when opponents point out the glaring falsehoods rationalizations dropped contexts and hyperbole. Gutless and petulant it reminded me of Captain Planet in which evil men set out to destroy for destruction's sake with no perceptible gain for their actions.On the other hand the script had to have been adapted from the diary of an 11yearold girl throwing a tantrum because she didn't make the cheerleading squad so petty and selfpitying as it is.In a nutshell ALL opposition to illegal immigration is based solelythat's right there are NO other reasonson sourceless hatred of Mexicans. That's it. The complex and farreaching ethical issues financial realities social architecture et. al. are reduced to they don't like me! Nothing about legitimate support for legal immigration nobody claiming anchor babies ZERO about the restrictive and racist policies of Mexican immigration... nada. Again it's like an overlong and hyperviolent episode of Captain Planet written by a rejected tweenager.The synopsis is something about a betrayed cop but that's not the real story. Not that it matters but the plot is a plan to restrict access to the US by electrified border fence which enjoys support from universally racist Texas citizens. But it's designed with strategically placed access points so the personal aide of a politician who opposes illegal immigration can get drug mules through. This would be pertinent if it weren't lost in the cloying miasma of race pimping.Said politician makes campaign commercials and speeches straight out of the Leni Riefenstahl handbook directly comparing Mexicans to roaches and maggots repeatedly referring to them as terrorists personally I don't know a single human being who would remain in a room with much less support such a piece of crap. Happily he magically realizes the error of his ways in a lastminute transition to Mexican identity via poncho and hat wouldn't it be great if that's all it took to change nationalities? before he's gunned down by his daughter and later by the very rednecks he's been aidingwho don't recognize his face in bright revealing floodlight. Thus completes the adolescent fantasy of revenge humiliation capitulation forgivenessbut he's still murdered by his own kind.In the film Mexicans are victims virtuous beloved of family and utterly blameless across the board. They have no significant faults but are incessantly harassed for existing.The biggest obstacle to their integration as productive members of society is the United States' refusal to treat them like human beings. At worst a priest carries guns and kills but only in selfdefense before he's tortured and murdered nailed to a cross for protecting his people against the evil whites. Plenty of symbolism there.Whites arelet's see if I can remember it allilliterate uneducated prone to vomiting at the sight of blood hypocrites sacrilegious happy to shoot pregnant women and teenage boys in cold blood for a snuff video unable to accept differences of opinion within their own communities confused about their own beliefs in the mood for sex with their own strungout daughters both mom and dad no less happy to torture and kill inside a church and apparently the true benefactors of Mexican drug cartels.Blacks and Asians happily serve whites to the detriment of their fellow minorities. Because they dislike Mexicans too. Admittedly that's the part that's NOT Captain Planet.On the other hand Michelle Rodriguez looks great with her pants almost falling off even as she slaughters those otherthanlaraza.And there will be sequels!".

They should make that into a movie. I remember saying. Well they did......yes they did.I had high hopes as I arrived in the theater expecting a total BMovie leave my brain at the door and have at it. What I got was something completely different. Machete is indeed a revenge movie as the fake trailer entailed but this is not the point of this.Sure we get to finally see the awesome tough guy Danny Trejo in his first ever starring role and yes Machete does get in a lot of killing and yes the violence is truly over the top. I did laugh and roared at some of the over the top action get to see sexy ladies in Michelle Rodriguez in some sexy hot pants Jessica Alba in a provocative shower sceneand I mean provocativethat just has to be seen by any guy Cheech Marin as a shotgun toting priest and nudity. All the Bmovie fixings.So what was the problem? The message. This was a hate filled tirade against America and antiimmigration. About 98 of the bad guys here are white guys. I saw precisely one Black man and one Mexican bad guy. Everyone else was a hate filled racist that would make a snuff film of a pregnant woman getting killed and a frightened teen onlooker. They say Welcome to America. before putting hot lead in any Mexican in a sadistic glee.They run political ads that are over the top and continue to point out the EVIL U.S.A. cause apparently we are just a bunch of bloodthirsty hate filled psychopaths. Also we are some braindead rednecks that can't stand the sight of bloodshed.Bottom line this is a big long political statement and a VERY hate filled monstrosity. Remember Whitey is EVIL America is EVIL. Mexico is GOOD. American women are GOOD. Add more insult Steven Seagal as Torrez a Mexican drug lord. Remember Whitey is EVIL. Just so you don't forget. I am Robert Rodriguez and I approve this message.Needless to say Machete is a tremendous disaster. My high hopes were blasted by a cruise missile.I had no idea that Robert hated us so much.".

I like Danny Trejo Robert Deniro and Cheech Marin but wasted in the films bad storyline. I hope Danny Trejo gets better acting roles in the future. As for the illegal immigrant political side of this flick that some folks are offended about is hilarious to me I am of Mexican heritage and whoever thinks that people are going to race riot because of this stupid embarrassing lame ass movie than you are just as stupid embarrassing and lame as this piece of crap movie is.".

I assume Robert Rodriguez was trying to parody the cheesy directing style of the 70's blaxploitation films or like the very funny Black Dynamite or even it might be he just plain sucks but whatever the case it just fails miserably to be a funny or interesting take on that subject. I like Danny Trejo Robert Deniro and Cheech Marin but wasted in the films bad storyline. I hope Danny Trejo gets better acting roles in the future. As for the illegal immigrant political side of this flick that some folks are offended about is hilarious to me I am of Mexican heritage and whoever thinks that people are going to race riot because of this stupid embarrassing lame ass movie than you are just as stupid embarrassing and lame as this piece of crap movie is.";

Give this film the time and you'll see how the director and the actors create a very simple but uplifting story about redemption and change and romance.The soundtrack covering everything from dance to the Beach Boys with an appropriate track at the end is simply to die for. The film rep said this may not have a soundtrack in the US. I hope not.If drugs and alcohol use are not for you I'd skip this film.

Within the first 10 minutes I was hooked. The opening sequence has Paul Kay Playing the famous DJ Frankie Wilde descending from the ceiling of a Ibiza club on a guide wire and then falling into a pool! The music THUMPS THUMPS THUMPS and the theater had the volume jacked so that you could feel the bass and vibrations. The plot is fairly predictable but the main actor does an amazing job. The film is well shot with beautiful colors but lots of closeups. Don't sit too close to the screen on this one. The furry Coke Badger gives us a humorous glimpse at the personification of addition.

	schema:reviewBody "I was fortunate enough to score a ticket to the 945 AM screening of this film at the Toronto Film Festival. It's not usual that I'll be anywhere at eight AM let alone standing in line but as a fan of FUBAR I simply had to see this movie. I'm not going to give anything away nor will I waste space with a synopsis but I will tell you that this is one of the best films I have ever seen. Paul Kaye does a remarkable job capturing both the humorous and painful essence of Frankie Wilde a Godlike worshiped DJ hammered with immense fame beautiful girls endless drugs and the physical toll of his role in the music scene. I'd never seen Paul in a film before but after this I'm sure he'll be everywhere and I think that's awesome because his performance was Oscar worthy. Alongside Paul is Mike Wilmot playing the part of Max Hagard and after his hilarious performance I cannot imagine anyone else in the part. Wilmot nailed it with grace for he would spit out his lines with such conviction and meticulous comictiming that he often caused gutwrenching laughs and applause from the theater crowd.Actors aside it's the brain of Michael Dowse that we have to thank for such a film. Shot on a Sony 300 I think it has a crisp vivid look that sucks you in from the first frame. For the record I hate house music but I found myself so engrossed in the film that my head was bobbing to the beat. I didn't know what to expect after FUBAR well okay funny was what I prepared myself for and it came in waves of hilarity. But it was the charming story stellar performances and clever dialogue that make this picture stand way above the crowd. Seeing It's All Gone Pete Tong was a total cinematic sensory overload. At times I felt like someone was mainlining cocaine and scotch into my forearm while at others it was as if I was getting a warm hug from a loved one. FUBAR rocked and put Micheal Dowse on the map but It's All Gone Pete Tong that can should and will take over the world. Without blinking I give this 1010 and encourage you to check it out and see what the hell I'm raving about.".

Nighty minutes after the movie ended we were still laughing and talking about this unique movie. Something to remember the alternative 'scarface' scene.

For those of you who don't know Dennis he's the original Ali G and IMHO much funnier. Search for jeff meets dennis pennis and you'll get a taste of PaulDennis and his ambush of Jeff Goldblum who I have to admit rolls with the punches.As a Paul Kaye fan I was disappointed with Blackball. This movie Pete Tong was the first big Paul Kaye movie I really was looking forward to until I read that the director was the same person who directed and wrote Fubar which I cringed through and had to leave the room. I would have turned it off but the others were having a blast. Why? I don't know.So hearing that Paul was paired up with a director whose work I wasn't entirely enthralled with wasn't confidence building. I heard it won a couple of awards Best Actor! Go Paul! at the Aspen Film Festival in February and my confidence increased.A sneak screening changed my initial impressions completely. The first half hour is really tough and I had to fight my urge to give up on the film even though Paul does an amazing job. See I told you I was biased but I'm not the only one. Ask those Aspen people. However the last two thirds of the movie completely changes from a dark comedy into a lighthearted and empowering film. The music and the colors are fabulous and shows Paul's as deejay frank wild breadth. The film is really a simple redemption film of a man who finds out what's important in his life and proves it for himself.There's a love interest as well and this works as a date movie. All the reviews and descriptions as a dance movie I don't even know what that's supposed to mean isn't entirely correct. While there is dance and rave in the film it's really a backdrop for this simple story of a complex man who has to make some tough choices in life and deal with a disability that is his worst nightmare.Paul did an extraordinary job and I have to admit that the director really surprised me with this film as it was nothing like his previous work. It's a difficult ride but one worth taking. There's no big surprise ala 6th Sense nor is the beginning entirely too painful but it's not all fun and games either. Watch it and enjoy it and it'll be worth it. All least do it for Paul!".

The producers even went so far and created a couple of web sites about Frankie Wilde to fool the audience and attract extra attention to the film. So now that we've got that Frankie Wilde is a fictional character out of the way let's get to the movie itself. After a brief word of praise for Frankie Wilde coming out of the mouths of some of the biggest DJ's and celebs we're introduced to the life of debauchery and excess of the Ibiza superstar DJ our dear Frankie. He's married to a woman leading the lifestyle much alike his has a stepson of a different race likes to swing and do drugs and alcohol in enormous quantities. But he's still on top untouchable and still a magnet to thousands of White Island's clubbers. Story is told in a form of intersects from people close to Frankie  his manager the book writer and some more celebs and DJ's they make an assertion and we get to see the segment right after. So Frankie eventually goes deaf from years of noise exposure and subsequently his marriage wrecks the club scene leaves him behind and he's forced to start a new life  free of drugs and excess learning to read lips and finding true love in a form of his  also deaf  teacher. Wilde goes out at the top of his game as he'd learned to feel the vibrations of the music through his body instead of plain hearing instrument his ears. He plays one more gig makes a killer track and....disappears from the public eye. The astonishing fact about It's all gone Pete Tong is it's gripping message. As a former DJ myself who knows what club music was before and the state of it now I can only give praise to the makers of the movie because between the lines there is a subtle message to all the clubbers and DJ's sort of going back to basics word. It's not about the drugs not about the alcohol press attention or fame but about being in a club feeling the vibe feeling the bass going through your body giving you shivers  it's a feeling of togetherness. All of those outside factors brought the scene to the today's low with dance music being ridiculed by serious music journalists reporters and fans. The acting is excellent with Pete Kaye as a lead lighting up the screen fighting his addictions and inner demons and finally finding the life's true meaning. The rest of the cast is not that important but doesn't do any wrong. Screenplay is sharp and directing floaty and impressive. If you're into dance music clubs or just like British humor with a load of cynicism don't't miss Tongy. It's not Human Traffic but is not so far from it either....".

It opens on the Ibiza club scene  a fantastic DJ who can capture the crowd and make amazing music. But 11 years in the clubs take its effects on Frankie who goes completely deaf and hits a very hard place indeed. Here the film addresses some serious issues about coping with life changing disabilities although the giant coke badger does make the scenes very funny. Frankie's struggle show the amazing acting abilities of Paul Kaye who delivers this film to the crowd. He eventually pulls himself together after a suicide attempt  another funny moment?! and meets a lip reader who he falls in love with.Dowse uses humour to show the seriousness of the film and he does it well. I was pleasantly surprised walking out of the screen to feel entertained as I expected another low budget English film with poor humour and talentless actors.

	schema:reviewBody "It's all gone Pete Tong is the story about an Ibizian DJ Frankie Wild who is a loud mouthed cocaine addicted party animal. The mockumentary tells us quickly about his rise to fame in Ibiza and how he loses it literally. Years of doing sets in the loud drug scened clubs are starting to set their toll on Frankie who is losing his hearing much to the annoyance of his agent who cant seem to get a word of him. Suddenly Frankie loses the 20 of the hearing he has left so he barricades himself away from mankind in his Ibizian villa. It's all gone Pete Tong is hilarious when it's funny and if anyone was going to play Frankie Wild it had to be Paul Kaye. The film slightly slows down in the 70 minute mark but still i'd recommend it to anyone even if they are not into the clubbing scene. The film capitulates the true meaning of a feel good summer film. 710P.S It's all gone Pete Tong means forthose of you who don't know It's all gone wrong.".

Years of doing sets in the loud drug scened clubs are starting to set their toll on Frankie who is losing his hearing much to the annoyance of his agent who cant seem to get a word of him. Suddenly Frankie loses the 20 of the hearing he has left so he barricades himself away from mankind in his Ibizian villa. It's all gone Pete Tong is hilarious when it's funny and if anyone was going to play Frankie Wild it had to be Paul Kaye. The film slightly slows down in the 70 minute mark but still i'd recommend it to anyone even if they are not into the clubbing scene. The film capitulates the true meaning of a feel good summer film. 710P.S It's all gone Pete Tong means forthose of you who don't know It's all gone wrong.";

It's fun hilarious original tongueincheek and then surprisingly touching real and even gasp! thoughtprovoking. It makes me feel good all over and I venture to say it's the most enjoyable film I've seen in several years. It's beautifully shot artfully crafted and Michael Dowse's direction is always intimate without being heavyhanded. I can't say enough about the star Paul Kaye except that I hope to see him in a lot more stateside films. He's one of the funniest people I've ever seen and infinitely likable. I got to meet him and the director at the premiere and they were really sweet people. GO SEE THIS MOVIE! It's big beautiful and has great music it needs to be seen on the big screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film sets up DJing as a hollow art form which even a cokedout slob such as Frankie Wilde could become idolized for. I believe director Michael Dowse wants us to wonder what the big deal is about clubbing and to question the validity of Frankie's fame. And I think all of these questions are paid off when Frankie now completely deaf rediscovers the meaning of music. Dowse is really saying that in order to truly appreciate sound you must first turn down all the noise around you. I thought the scene when Frankie finally matches the soundwaves on his computer and the subsequent comeback club scene were very powerful. I understood for the first time what people mean when they jabber on about an awesome DJ. Frankie is a bit of a parody in the opening of this picture very VH1 Behind the Music but his transformation is hardly standard. Dude locks himself in a padded room and kicks his coke habit but only after lighting firecrackers attached to his head. This is not how most people deal with a physical disability. Those expecting a Fbartype romp which other than an appearance by the Fbar boys will be surprised. This is a dark dark story with few laugh outloud moments. But that doesn't mean it isn't successful. In fact I think the film is more successful as a tragedy than a comedy. Much of the humour is ripped off The Office right down to the David Brentlike studio head. Also the ending is very Pollyanna with Frankie teaching deaf kids to dance marrying his teacher having a kid etc.".

There is one ludicrous scene where a blind Pacino is driving a Ferrari in Manhattan at high speeds  PLEASE. I'm willing to suspend disbelief for enjoyment of a movie but this was too much to ask. There would have been an accident! In spite of this and other flaws it is a moving film.OK I just saw  finally  the original Italian version with Vittorio Gassman. It is better way better. It makes the statement about loneliness self pity the handicap of blindness in a simpler purer way. It is just as touching but less heavyhanded. Gassman is a brilliant actor and frankly better looking and sexier than Pacino in my humble opinion. Also a lot taller! But the main difference in the films this one is FUNNY.

	onyx:emotionText "I have seen the remake with Pacino a few times and I do like it. Even though it is almost too sentimental I like it. I especially like the tango scene. There is one ludicrous scene where a blind Pacino is driving a Ferrari in Manhattan at high speeds  PLEASE. I'm willing to suspend disbelief for enjoyment of a movie but this was too much to ask. There would have been an accident! In spite of this and other flaws it is a moving film.OK I just saw  finally  the original Italian version with Vittorio Gassman. It is better way better. It makes the statement about loneliness self pity the handicap of blindness in a simpler purer way. It is just as touching but less heavyhanded. Gassman is a brilliant actor and frankly better looking and sexier than Pacino in my humble opinion. Also a lot taller! But the main difference in the films this one is FUNNY. Humor is used to make the point about the tragedy of the Captain. He is impossible in a way that is funnyoutrageous and you can't help but laugh. The version with Pacino has very little humor. See this one read the subtitles and enjoy a masterpiece.";

Generally he's recognized as one of the fathers of Italian comedy commedia all'italiana the expression doesn't mean that the movies make you laugh all the time it means that stories are a mix of happiness and bitterness as life is. And not always there's a happy ending.Dino Risi worked with the who's who of Italian cinema but he became famous also for casting frequently actors like Gassman Ugo Tognazzi Nino Manfredi and Alberto Sordi they were ideal for characterizing Italian defects and virtues above all defects...! Profumo di donna is taken from a book by Giovanni Arpino. In this 1974 movie Vittorio Gassman is a blind ex military officer who makes a trip from Genova to Naples. A young boy accompanies him. Fausto Gassman's character has to deal with the tragedy of being blind he wants to commit suicide...Fausto is a man who lost everything he can feel the presence of a woman which explains the title Profumo di donna in English Scent of a woman but doesn't want to be loved for pity.It's difficult to describe a film which has a lot of themes friendship aging the drama of being different from the others. But everything is treated in a delicate and moving way although it's not a film for making you cry.Vittorio Gassman performance is simply superb he won a prize in Cannes in 1975. The picture got that same year an Academy Award nomination.In 1992 Al Pacino starred in an American remake Scent of a woman as I said the title is the exact translation from the Italian one. The actor won an Oscar but the film is not as good as the original. Apart from the extraordinary Pacino performance everything is treated in a typical Hollywood way with a more schematic story for example the fact that the blind officer later helps his young companion is absent in the original film.I suggest the people who only saw the Al Pacino version to see the Vittorio Gassman film it's softer and more complex at the same time.".

Vittorio Gassman doesn't necessarily give a better performance than Pacino as the blind disabledand sexobsessed military man but his is a somewhat more lowkey one that involves a little less scenery chewing. Moreover Gassman's character comes off as more tragic and more realistic since this version really doesn't have misguided redemptive courtroom scene that the remake did.While largely unknown the young Italian actor Alessandro Momo is far far better than the deservedly washedup Chris O'Donnell who is the real weak link in the American film. Then there's Agostina Belli. Both Gabrielle Anwar in the remake and Belli in this are achingly beautiful girls but whereas Anwar has little more than a cameo in the Hollywood film Belli has a much meatier role not to mention some nice nude scenes. Basically where the remake relies on Pacino's considerable acting talents and dialogue to tell about the character's haunting obsession with the smell of a female sex that is forever lost to him this movie does a lot better job because it is not afraid to actually show it.Finally there is director Dino Risi who American director Martin Ritt is frankly not fit to pull focus for. Risi is one of those unfortunate Italian directors like Salvatore Samperi Pasquale Festa Massimo Dallamano and Alberto Lattuada who was not QUITE in the class of Fellini Pasolini or the Antonioni and has therefore been undeservedly condemned to obscurity. Risi made at least two other very good films I've seen both also with Gassmanthe 60's film Il Sorpasso and the later genre film Anima Persebut this is generally considered his masterpiece. Even when they have someone as talented as Pacino on board American remakes sometimes equal but rarely improve on an original film like this because its originality is inevitably lost in the rush to Americanize it. I'd actually recommend EITHER of these movies to anybody but make no mistake this is the better one.".

Being perhaps the recentlydeceased directors bestknown work though two more  THE EASY LIFE 1962 and IN THE NAME OF THE Italian PEOPLE 1971  are at least equally as good I chose it as the film with which to conclude my 7film tribute to him. Coincidentally it happened on the very day which marked the eight anniversary from the passing of its leading man  the great Vittorio Gassman! The film and its protagonist deservedly received a number of accolades back in the day it was also singled out to represent Italy in the Best ForeignLanguage Film category at the 1975 Academy Awards ceremony where another nod went to the screenplay penned by Dino Risi and Ruggero Maccari. For the record Id watched Al Pacinos Oscar triumph in the remake when it was new I recall not being enthused with either the endless film running 157 minutes against the originals 100! or the Method actors hammy performance. Anyway for anyone not familiar with the later film the plot concerns a young cadet being asked to accompany a blinded yet proud and funloving war veteran for a week together they go on a voyage with the experienced manabouttown teaching the ropes to the rookie who at first is displeased with the highhanded manners of his charge  leading them to a girl played by the luscious Agostina Belli whos devoted to Gassman. Earlier the boy had discovered a photo of her among the blind mans things as well as a gun whose purpose is revealed towards the end.Along the way the cadet nicely played by Alessandro Momo is given the task of organizing the veterans entertainment and relaxation  which given Gassmans debauched values takes him to the lowlife sectors of the cities they visit one of the prostitutes who renders service is played by of all people famous circus ownerexpeplum starlet Moira Orfei!. By the time they finally reach Belli and her entourage of willing girls waiting on another team of crippled officer and nave cadet Gassman has become oddly despondent and rejects the girls advances as it turns out he and his buddy had intended to commit suicide  with the latter ending up in hospital due to a gun wound while Gassman eventually loses his nerve and retreats with Belli and Momo to a house in the countryside! I dont recall the 1992 version well enough but here it seems that Momos role is relegated to the sidelines once Belli turns up incidentally I believe that the remake was far more chaste than this! Risis treatment of an undeniably original tale is somewhat lowkey but nonetheless impressive  earthy yet insightful and thoughtprovoking alternately funny and poignant  which is further graced with a simple but haunting melancholy score from Maestro Armando Trovajoli.".

	schema:headline " An Italian classic!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Every time someone talks about the film Scent of a Woman 1992 comes in memory the modern classic starring Al Pacino which finally received the Oscar award for Best Actor. What few people know is that this movie is a remake of an Italian film Profumo di Donna Scent of a Woman  1974 adapted from the literary novel Il Buio and Il Miele  1969 by Giovanni Arpino and directed by Dino Risi.Profumo di Donna tells the story of Captain Fausto Consolo Vittorio Gassman a retired soldier who lives alone with an old aunt in the city of Turin and decides to hold a 7day train trip to Genoa Rome and Naples. Having been blinded in an accident in a military operation the army appointed a young soldier to accompany him on the tour Giovanni Bertazzi Alessandro Momo to whom Fausto nicknames Ciccio. Ruled by women and alcoholic beverages their adventures seem innocent and fun but as the journey unfolds an obscure purpose is revealed.Gassman's interpretation is one of the highlights of the movie and he even received the award for Best Actor in Cannes. The actor manages to impeccably convey all the internal conflict of the main character Faust is a blind man and maimed left hand melancholic cynical exhausted from his life's routine behaving in a cruel and arrogant way despite having acquired notable ease of movement and precise notion of the objects location. Ironic and uninhibited he acts in a natural way as if he could see and takes advantage of his privileged condition blindness to make fun of dissimulation and pretense of society with disdain by the conventions of compassion which he is also hostage. This ambiguous feeling of admiration and disgust for a character who has a grandeur that sometimes makes us even forget his physical limitation but who is also unpleasant bitter and sarcastic reflects his conflictive personality but at the same time also charismatic. Womanizer and drinker blindness accentuated his other senses especially the sense of smell. Even from a distance the presence of attractive women is perceived by scent which leaves him ecstatic making a perfect analogy to the title of the film Profumo di Donna Scent of a Woman.The film shows the efforts that a person can do to hide their feelings and feed a false appearance of strength and security. The internal tension which Faust suffers guides his behavior and relationships with the people around him. In rejecting compassion and pity he ends up also rejecting affection and love. So the journey of the main character symbolizes a journey in search of himself selfacceptance and the consent of other's people affection.With a parallel plot the film highlights the contrast between the captain and the young soldier. While Giovanni is a mixture of inexperience naivety and insecurity Faust stands for his experience invulnerability and security that he appears to have. Rather than being a victim of a misfortune the captain shows himself as the true guide in the story reversing the roles between the blind man and his companion. As the trip goes by the young soldier learns life lessons such as how to distinguish between appearance and reality love and fraud words and actions. The interpretation of Alessandro Momo is quite convincing making him another standout in the movie. It was a shame his career being interrupted so early. The actor died in a motorcycle accident a few days after the film was completed. Sara Agostina Belli completes the trio of main characters. She is a young woman in love with Faust and does not conform to his sickness being the only one who knows all his facets. Here we must highlight the work of the director Dino Risi who manages to capture the best of each actor interweaving good comedic moments with great dramatic situations.The soundtrack is beautiful managing to convey different feelings interpreted by the actors in the scenes aside from involving the viewer in the narrative. The script builds up fine characters developing brilliant dialogues. Gassman's gesticulation Momo's selfrestraint and Agostina's sensuality are noteworthy. The movie won two seats among the Oscar nominees Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Foreign Film.With brief notes the photograph depicts a casuistry time of Italian society full of meanings. On the streets on trains in hotels terraces at parties and in their own language slowly arises a profile of a society. The Italians are cheerful and receptive talkative using a lot the hands to gesticulate speaking loudly and not sparing swearwords in their conversations. They are religious romantic and spontaneous but as all patriarchal society they have very strong male and female stereotypes. Faust is an authoritarian man who has to be seen as strong an imposing figure. Sara reflects the situation of women in which they dream to feel indispensable to the life of the men they love. All these aspects clearly translate the Mediterranean spirit.Finally as it should be a brief comparison between the American version 1992 and the original movie 1974 is inevitable. The remake of Scent of a Woman is completely different from the Italian film. Relying on Hollywood aspects such as the need to have an episode of trial the American version lengthen the story too much spending too much time with the student bad acted by Chris O'Donnell. The scenes of tango and Ferrari are some of its strengths but by opting for melodramatic twists it ends up falling in some clichs. Its great success and prominence is the exceptional performance of Al Pacino. The two main actors in each version Al Pacino and Vittorio Gassman are impeccable but the original movie has a special charm being in many ways more humane sensitive strippeddown and engaging. It's a pity that the American remake completely lost the Italian culture both of everyday life in Italy and the Italian way of doing cinema of the 70s.Originally posted in httpsvikingbyheart.blogspot.com.br".

Your performance in Scent of a Woman was very respectable. Though the beard sported by you took away some of the mischievousness of your face. The dubbing was also awful. The politically incorrect views of Captain Fausto were quite entertaining like comparing some Italian cities to Turkey. Fausto insulting the square passenger with the jasmine perfume on was also quite hilarious. A man is either born as a poet or a porter  very wise words indeed Captain Fausto. His relentless picking on the uptight and the unsuspecting were very amusing. Fausto's attitudes are not too different from some of the characters in other Dino Risi movies. I'm a real bastard ..... A unique and immense bastard ..... I am an eleven of spades  these are some of Fausto's utterances about himself. Agostina Belli makes a rather late appearance in the film. She has a very beautiful face comparable to the likes of Lee Remick. But the film becomes quite tedious after she makes an entry because Fausto turns into a real grouch. The background score was quite memorable though I might not buy it or anything. The same is the case with the movie. There are many good bits. But I might not watch it again.

	schema:reviewBody "Like many other people I'm sure I first became aware of this Oscar nominee when I read the closing credits of its Al Pacino remake. That was in 1992 and I have been trying to locate a copy of the Italian original ever since. According to the critical opinion I've encountered in the interim the Gassman original was said to be superior with the Pacino version incorporating its extraneous subplot about Chris O'Donnell's troubles at his private school.Well... I have finally managed to see the illustrious original. It certainly seems far inferior to me. Its potential is all latent and unrealized the American version takes the unusual blind officer character and does colourful and then dramatic things with him. The Italian original just walks the character through some conventional sex farce situations.The result seems so trivial and the film is as cheap and ugly to look at as any Italian film of the 1970s. Some credit naturally goes to Vittorio Gassman for originating the character for the screen but that's about it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Like many other people I'm sure I first became aware of this Oscar nominee when I read the closing credits of its Al Pacino remake. That was in 1992 and I have been trying to locate a copy of the Italian original ever since. According to the critical opinion I've encountered in the interim the Gassman original was said to be superior with the Pacino version incorporating its extraneous subplot about Chris O'Donnell's troubles at his private school.Well... I have finally managed to see the illustrious original. It certainly seems far inferior to me. Its potential is all latent and unrealized the American version takes the unusual blind officer character and does colourful and then dramatic things with him. The Italian original just walks the character through some conventional sex farce situations.The result seems so trivial and the film is as cheap and ugly to look at as any Italian film of the 1970s. Some credit naturally goes to Vittorio Gassman for originating the character for the screen but that's about it.";

They are usually shattering disappointments.So I fully anticipated that Vittorio Gassman's version would far surpass Pacino's.But Surprise Surprise. Finally. Who would have thought it. A Hollywood Remake that Ruled!!! Yay! It was not even a close contest in my opinion. This film with Vittorio Gassman was for me flawed beyond redemption. I'm bewildered to read that it was even nominated for an Academy Award and has received other very prestigious awards.True Gassman got the blind part of his role down. He had obviously done a lot of research and put in long rehearsals. And he had the potential to be great.The trouble was with the script. Gassman's character was a pig. An entertaining pig at times an interesting pig at other times but never more than a fullfledged PIG.So while the film could engage you in the spectacle sense it was really difficult to care about what happened to the characters or to root for them. The script just put them in a series of scenes the common denominator being coarseness and then more coarseness.What was most offensive about this film were the scenes near the end in the Nepalese restaurant. Apparently Gassman had been friends with this family for many years  since their daughters were children. So he was like a uncle figure.Then when this film catches up with them the girls have grown into young ladies. And the Gassman character is shown treating them very disrespectfully to put it mildly exploiting them and preying on them.Except for the one he apparently loves. But why was it OK for him to exploit the other young girls? This predatory aspect of the film was so beyond offensive that it ruined the entire film and made it irredeemable and indefensible.Go see Al Pacino's Scent of a Woman instead. Pacino is brilliant. And the remake has heart and soul  both of which are sorely absent from the original. The original has noisy drama but it is a hollow soulless drama.".

A young army cadet is assigned to a retired blind colonel who needs assistance in his cross country trip. The colonel teaches the boy a few life's lessons before reaching his final destination the cheerful sunny Naples where his dark goal awaits him. A beautiful young girl in love with the colonel since she was a child will do anything to prevent him from carrying out his plan.

Even though it has a lot of action there is a subtle elegance throughout the picture that gives it great style.  The movie flows effortlessly from scene to scene while at the same time creating wonderful intensity and nailbiting excitement.The acting in the movie more than lives up to expectations.  Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Maximus the general who became a slave who became a gladiator who defied an emperor.  Crowe's intense style is perfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus.  Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus the corrupt emperor. He plays a great villain because he is able to give Commodus depth by showing certain vulnerable or fragile sides while at the same time instantly transforming to let the ruthless nature of his volatile character shine.  It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works perfectly with his role.Connie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla.  However perhaps the two finest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans in supporting roles.  Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in what will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their careers.  Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius the aging Caesar who reflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him. And Reed especially gave my personal favorite performance in the movie as Proximo the trainer for the gladiators.  The way he spoke about the life of a gladiator the splendor of Rome and the thrill of the Coliseum really added excitement and anticipation during the viewing of the movie.Gladiator is filled with many memorable moments that one would need to see more than once to fully appreciate.  The excitement felt for me when Rome is first shown in all its wonder and marvel is my favorite scene.  But the whole movie is a rush!  Hans Zimmer provides the absolute perfect score to capture the different moods in the movie.  Ridley Scott sets the perfect tone with his artistic and creative directing.  I would recommend it to anyone who can stomach intensity and enjoy an epic story for the ages.  Next to Braveheart this movie is the greatest of alltime!".

	schema:reviewBody "Gladiator definitely is a classic film as it combines a simple but moving story with beautiful scenery filming direction and score  it is truly a complete movie.I am mostly compelled with the beautiful script which in a way reminds me of poetry though it is still everyday language. I love the acting portrayed by the late Oliver Reed and also Richard Harris. Russell Crowe Djimon Housou and Joaquin Phoenix are also superb and the parts suit them perfectly. There are also a number of less popular artists who also deserve a big bravo. Amongst them I have to mention exMr Universe Ralph Moeller who is mostly used as the comic relief of the movie. In Gladiator we can also the beautiful and popular Maltese TV Star and actress Ruth Frendo who although has a small part she is totally brilliant and outstanding.Actually I got to IMDb while I was looking for her name on the internet in fact on IMDb she has some very stunning photos. I was lucky to meet Ruth Frendo whilst she was filming in another Maltese production. Ruth Frendo is not only a gorgeous and talented actress but she is also amazingly intelligent and very downtoearth. We will definitely be seeing more of her work in the future... The scenery used for Gladiator is brilliant  and the opening battle scene is definitely one of my top favorite scenes. The modern camera technique contrasts sharply to the brutality of the gladiators actions and blood shed during the movie and I love the light contrasts thanks to the lenses which most definitely have been used to create a surreal feel to the entire movie.Gladiator deserves all the awards and great reviews it has received and for those of you who still haven't gone and watched it  I can assure you that it will be well worth your time and money. So go on and rent it now!".

	schema:reviewBody "Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film I would think that the hardiest of fans of which I'm firmly one know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story then. While some of the CGI is hardly Grade A stuff and there's a little over  mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel  overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations we are with him every step of the way urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny with Crowe superb in every pained frame winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing. Oliver Reed leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings Derek Jacobi classy David Hemmings also while Djimon Hounso gives Juba  Maximus right hand man and confidante  a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.I didn't know man could build such things.Dialogue is literate and poetic resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale the culmination of two men's destinies no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 1010".

Saved from death by slavers he is purchased for use as a gladiator by Proximo Reed and ends up in the arena of all arena's the Colloseum where he proves unbeatable under his guise as The Spaniard.And with a budget of over 100m Scott certainly delivers the goods. GLADIATOR transcends the notion of 'blockbuster' that we have become accustomed to in the age of electronic and special effects wizardry and instead offers a good old fashioned action film along the lines of Spartacus and and Ben Hur. Not only are we drawn into an archetypal story that contains all the classic elements a filmgoer could dream of love loss courage despair good triumphing over evil etc etc  also on offer is a visual feast of cinematic painting after painting  a rich tapestry of images that are breathtaking and ultimately visually satisfying. From the plains of Germania to the desert stronghold of Zuchobar and finally to great Rome herself John Mathiesion the cinematographer is to be commended highly for his general inventiveness and ability to capture so much on film. The opening  battle scene is superb as a cast of thousands erupt across the screen and provide an indication that we are about to see a film that pays incredible attention to detail throughout its entirety. In every way Scott has created a world for us that scuttles films of similar epic undertakings and budgets! and sends them to their dooms at the bottom of the murky depths of film history where they belong.The cast is generally very strong. Crowe proves himself very suitable to the task with a great emotional range and depth of character. His accent ocassionally bugged me as did the mish mash of accents on offer  but that is I guess a legacy of 'internationally casted films' but this aside he was well and truly up to the task. Phoenix is also excellent as the disturbed Commodus as is Nielson as Lucilla the daughter of Marcus who should have been a son and finds herself torn between loyalty to her brother and doing what is 'right'. The old guard thesps of Harris Reed and Jacobi Grachus are uniformly strong as supporting characters and Spencer Treat Clark Lucius does a fine job as the young heir to the throne.Add to this great cast excellent editing and post production work and an intricate soundscape including a magnificent Hans Zimmer score and you have a film that despite its length was highly palatable and had me in there from beginning to end. A must see.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie is the story of Maximus Crowe a general who leads the Roman army to victory over Germania in the beginning of the movie. The dying emperor of Rome Marcus Aurelius is watching this battle.The emperor's son Commodus then arrives with his sister Lucilla and it is discovered that Commodus fully expects to be announced the new emperor of Rome in a few days. Aurelius however has other planshe wants to make Maximus emperor and requests that of the general who wants nothing more than to go home to his family.I went into this movie having just watched BenHur in my film studies class and having watched an episode of Xena only a couple of weeks earlier that featured the story of Marc Anthony and Cleopatra. So you could say I was in the perfect mindset to watch a swordandsandal movie. I wasn't sure what to expect having somehow avoided all the hype that accompanied this movie. But I was not disappointed.Gladiator features some wonderful cinematography by John Mathieson. The battle scenes are very graphic. This movie is not for the squeamish that's for sure. There were some scenes in particular that really struck me such as when Crowe appears to be floating over the ground very fast.  The use of color and color tones added a great deal to the mood of the movie. Excellent.The script was being written and rewritten as the filming was going on yet it doesn't show that the actors had no idea how the movie was going to end when they began filming.  The acting is terrific. Russell Crowe is wonderfully cast as Maximus. Many reviewers agree that he is now officially a star. Joaquin Phoenix also proves his mettle as the emotionally troubled Commodus whose behavior and emotion toward his sister could give anyone the creeps. Connie Nielsen makes you believe that as Lucilla she really is torn between natural loyalty to her brother and doing what she knows is right. Oliver Reed in his last performance is memorable in his role of Proximo the former gladiator who is the owner of Maximus and brings him to Rome.  In short the actors were brilliant in their roles not overacting but giving subtle strong performances.The script itself is very good.  Although some elements are a little hard to believethe fact that no one recognizes Maximus when he's a slave?this film calls for a willing suspension of disbelief which one would happily comply with.  It's really no fun to nitpick such a movie.It's true that this movie does pretty much follow the Braveheart formula. However this movie includes some elements such as the cinematography and the incredibly graphic battle scenes one reviewer likened it to Saving Private Ryan only better that are spectacular in itself. Overall a great movie that I highly recommend.".

The second time I listened very closely and caught the wise yet succinct line from Maximus what we do in life... echoes in eternity.  Awesome.A simple man v. an emperor.  I just loved the resilience Maximus showed throughout the movie.  I find in most movies there is an irritatingly slow process where the character has to find himself not so with Gladiator. Maximus does what is needed.I liked how there were only two or three issues within this film.  One was the afterlife.  Aspects of the afterlife are opened but not overdone.  Love of family is given sizable focus. I liked the theme of love of country that we see as well although it may not be justly deserved it is never questioned.The visual effects were amazing.  It actually had me wanting to believe that's the way Rome actually looked in all it's glory.  The battle of Carthage reenactment was really great.The ending is just hypnotic. Intentionally or unintentionally it was simply emotional.  The music is wonderfully beautiful as if Maximus' family are telling him...you have arrived.Bottom line magnificent.

	schema:headline " Special effects and powerful acting make Gladiator an epic.";
	schema:reviewBody "I borrowed this movie on DVD but I wish I had seen it in the theater for it would have been a lot more fun and powerful there. Despite this Gladiator is one of the most powerful and moving films I've ever seen. The plot goes so smooth together as well as the acting and the terrific musical score. Director Ridley Scott puts all effort into making this film an epic and he does just that. I'd have to say that anyone who likes Ridley Scott I sure do should see this. It is a lot like Ridley's other movies Black Hawk Down was also amazing. If you can stand a little bitwell ok a LOT of blood and gore then you should see this. Russell Crowe shows an excellent performance like no other. I don't think there's one bad movie that Ridley Scott has made or that Russell Crowe has acted in. The fact that the brutal battles involving innocent slaves in this film actually happened in real life centuries ago makes it even more interesting and powerful. Emperor Commodus is a truely evil and lifelike villian who shows a lot of his wits in attempts to get his revenge against Maximus.Ridley Scott went to many different locations to shoot this film to make it real and he does. The film is set in Rome and it looks just like it. You feel as if you are there in the crowd hearing them cheer and cheer to see the death. To some of you this may sound a little barbaric and believe me the film is VERY barbaric and brutual however it teaches a very strong lesson of what happens when an economy turns as violent as Rome was. Ridley Scott goes to many lengths to make this movie real because even though the characters are fictitious all of this really did happen. Innocent people had to go through brutual fighting while thousands of people cheered for either their death or the enemy's death. If you were an inexperienced fighter chances are you would get killed. But the strange thing is that Rome LOVED this. People came from all over to see these fights and to see the blood that was shed that is why you can't blame the characters in this film for being so forlorn and saddened the whole time. The film itself is very dark. The theme is dark and the ending is dark. From beginning to end there is excessive violence for those action moviegoers this is a movie for you. But if the violence is concerning you don't let it. The special effects make the movie great but it's the acting and storyline that make it spectacular. HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED for anyone who wants a good time. Definitely makes you think.  out of .".

The plot is simple legendary general Maximus Decimus Meridius after many victorious campaigns and battles wants to return to his peaceful home in Spain However the kind fair and dying Emperor Marcus Aurelius wishes to bestow his title on him over his cruel son Commodus. Commodus is understandably annoyed and kills his father calming the title of Emperor. Maximus is sentenced to death along with the rest of his family back at his home in Spain.

He fights his way into the coliseum in Rome were he wins over the crowd and uses his celebrity status to defy the Emperor to whom he swears his vengeance for the death of his family after many battles and political backstabbing he gets his chance to fight the Emperor in the Arena.This is just such an amazing film it captures every emotion possible in only the way an expert director can achieve we can go on for whole scenes without the need for speaking everything is told through the genuine body language and expressions. And when there is conversing we get such emotion and wonderfully powerful quotes  What we do in life echoes in eternity Wow.The opening scene is spellbinding showing the true gore of battle the fight scenes are marvellously realistic discarding the popular pretty sword fighting for brutal aggressive force. The audience in the arena express every emotion surprise anger and enjoyment. The cast is brilliantly chosen we can really see Russell Crowe as a gladiator in Commodus Joaquin Phoenix gives us a man we can really hate Connie Nielson shows real emotion and passion in the role of Lucilla. So apart from the spellbinding acting scarily realistic fight scenes and the amazing script what else can we look for? The music is just stunning its exactly what we need brought in at exactly the right time truly wonderful directing. And then we have the stunning special effects we can really visualise the greatness that is Rome the fight scenes really make you believe. Some critics have condemned the lack of historical fact for instance an emperor would never fight a gladiator and these comments cannot be denied its true.But I think we can forgive them that one fault for such an amazing movie. Without hesitation I give this movie a truly deserved 1010!".

Far from the blazing sun and dazzlingly beauty of ancient Rome Ridley Scott shoots the opening sequence in a subdued light. The Roman legions are nonetheless impeccably turned out as they face the comparatively disorganised rabble that inhabits this miserable environment. Caesar's soldiers seem somewhat misplaced here. However Russell Crowe is at home in this environment of kneedeep mud and merciless snow. He commands the screen with all the virtues of his motto Strength and Honour.'The plot with its herotozerotohero nature runs through Gladiator's every vein. As General Maximus Russell Crowe is welcomed by Marcus Aurelius Caesar Richard Harris to take the Roman throne as Emperor of a new Republic. All does not run smoothly however as mislead heir to the throne Commodus Phoenix takes over Rome with illgotten domination having dispatched his own Father. Maximus is cast out to find his family murdered and his Spanish farm burnt to the ground. Taken in as a slave by Proximo Reed Maximus becomes a Gladiator and starts his journey to the Coliseum and revenge against Commodus.Scott's cast is powerful and he is not left wanting as powerful performances are delivered by all. Due to his untimely midproduction death Oliver Reed is created in some scenes by the grace of computer graphics which are as convincing as they come sometimes making it difficult to differentiate between Reed himself and his computerised counterpart.It is however the supporting actors who create many of Gladiator's best dialoguebased scenes. In an accomplished demonstration of her acting ability as Lucilla Connie Nielsen saves the occasional scene as Joaquim Phoenix shows us that he can do evil' but is less convincing when it comes to the more emotional qualities of his role.As a vehicle for the plot Scott's beautifully created and highly symbolic there is an image of fire in nearly every shot of the film dialogue scenes are of a certain merit with digitally created backgrounds that encompass the meticulous nature of the Roman Empire. However dialogue alone does not an epic movie make and it is in the film's spectacular action sequences that Gladiator come into its own. Shot on location in Malta Scott's first arena was built by an army of locals and commanded some 5000 extras a large majority of whom were of a cardboard variety. All of this pales in comparison as we arrive in a digitally created Rome which makes some scenes in Ben Hur some somewhat small scale. The Coliseum is immense both inside and out and the computerised provides the electric atmosphere in which Crowe and his feline companions four sizeable and real Bengal tigers perform.The battle sequences are perfectly choreographed and shot as iconic masks and typically Roman chariots are abundant in their power and imagery. As swords clash and heads roll Ridley Scott is triumphant in the application of special effects technology and his directorial prowess.Always one to embrace technology Scott's views over Rome's landscape are reminiscent of the beautifully created cityscape of Blade Runner. This is a film that fears so little and boasts so much even a lady archer being sliced clean in half by a spiked chariot wheel!All those involved with Gladiator should be delighted and confident with their creation for indeed this is a convincing and enthralling display with epic proportions to take the wind from James Cameron's titanic sails.".

Scott's Gladiator is build around a mythic character a man trying to find his way home... It is around someone finding inner strength in a tough time Maximus is somebody who doesn't want to be a soldier We realize this is a man who is pursuing the ultimate which is transcending death and finding love after death which completely transforms your reaction to the man a man who is very very strong but very very loving The plot familiar from Anthony Mann's  Fall of the Roman Empire had Crowe as Maximus the proud wellloved Roman general in the army of Emperor Marcus Aurelius Richard Harris. Maximus whose motto is 'Strength and Honor' is like a son to Aurelius a statement that left Aurelius' own son Commodus perturbed...Disappointed by the news that his father privately decides to name Maximus his successor and being a young ambitious son lusting for power he murders his father and orders a strike against the general... One of the best scenes of the motion picture is where Commodus is told by his father that he is not going to be the emperor Joaquin Phoenix is easy to hate in a frightening and vile character...Ridley Scott creates a lot of beautiful scenes between the characters He did some fantastic work in all of those wonderful scenes in the film But there's another moment between the emperor and his daughter Lucilla the Danish beauty Connie Nielsen that I loved very much Harris says Let's not speak of politics. Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter and I'm a good father.  They walk for a few seconds and Lucilla says This is a pleasant fiction. I felt this short scene so sophisticated It seemed to me wonderfully insightful simple in terms of amount of words but complex in terms of understanding this strange relationship One of the most successful bits of casting was Oliver Reed He's a harsh and rough businessman who makes his living off the death machine and yet inside there was some kind of ethical person that would come out at the right momentRidley Scott's epic film does not romanticize a democratic Golden Age of Rome but a decaying blood thirsty empire on the edge of its fall... Through its beautiful music through Russell's performance and through Ridley's soulfulness Gladiator brought a poetic vision in a new and very cinematically richly way that really gave the audience something different so emotional and so intimate".

	schema:headline " Both OldFashioned And Modern Gladiator Is An Intoxicating Blend Of Action Spectacle and Intimate Drama";
	schema:reviewBody "Gladiator 2000's Best Picture winner was undoubtedly one of the biggest successes of the decade. It made tons of boxoffice cash nearly swept the Oscars and revitalized the swordandsandals genre for years to come. Does the movie warrant the massive success it received? For the most part yes. Ridley Scott's Roman blockbuster doesn't have quite the overwhelming emotion of another Oscarwinning epic Braveheart but as a brawny action spectacle Gladiator soars. With a strong story a profound sense of character and action and special effects that are suitably exciting Gladiator is a special kind of swordandsandals picture One with a true dramatic core.Like the great epics of Hollywood's past Gladiator is simple in its story. Russell Crowe stars as the Roman General Maximus whose life is thrown into chaos after the jealous Emperor Commodus Joaquin Phoenix arranges for his execution. Maximus is sold into slavery where he meets Proximo a former gladiator played by Oliver Reed who shepherds him through life as a gladiator as Commodus scrambles to stop Maximus' influence among the people. The story of Gladiator is a rocksolid tale of revenge bolstered by well written characters some sly political subtext and a couple of stellar performances from Crowe and Phoenix. The two principle characters Maximus and Commodus are what separates Gladiator from the slew of swordandsandals epics that came after it. They are simply but elegantly written as characters Maximus a man singularly driven by a need to return to his family Commodus a confused young man singularly driven by a need to be loved. However it is the performances from Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix that really elevate this material. Phoenix gives a brilliant portrait of an emotionally frustrated young man. He is completely unpredictable but he never becomes campy. He is a real person with real problems and there is an underlying sadness to his character that makes him so much more interesting than your typical stock villain. As for Crowe his performance is all about physical presence. Apart from a few big emotional scenes Crowe's performance is one of quiet masculine stoicism. He adds a remarkable gravitas to this character that all but makes the movie. You feel for him you relate to him you root for him and you become inspired by him. It is a perfect heroic performance. The character stuff in Gladiator really works. Coming from a genre that made do with archetypal characters doing obligatory British accents for years it is nothing short of a revelation that Gladiator is such a fulfilling dramatic experience. Here are characters you actually care about and not simply placeholders to string up the plot in between action scenes.When it comes to general filmmaking Gladiator is rarely pedestrian and often astounding. Apart from some strange quirks in the filmmaking like the seemingly digitized zooms or the moments when the frame rate seems to cause a weird flicker effect Gladiator is a deep rich and meticulously detailed visual experience. Hollywood production values don't get much higher than this. The technical departments are tops in terms of production design and costuming. The movie looks expensive but there is something else in Gladiator's visual style that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. The look of the film with its mix of traditional large scale sets and CG enhancements is almost dreamlike. The environments of Ridley Scott's version of ancient Rome including a painstakingly crafted digital recreation of the famous Colosseum seem untethered to any kind of physical reality. It's as if what Scott has created is an environment that reflects the feeling of Ancient Rome rather than the reality of it. Just as with the deep characters and eloquent script there's a modern feeling to Ridley Scott's filmmaking in Gladiator. The reliance on CGI is sometimes overdone but in conjunction with the costumes sets and impressively grandiose score from Hans Zimmer it adds to the intoxicating atmosphere of Ridley Scott's world.The main attraction of Gladiator is its scenes of gladiatorial combat and on that front Ridley Scott aptly gets the job done. There are a few moments when Scott falls back on to standard sword clashing and disorientating shaky cam but for the most part the action scenes are exciting bloody and imaginatively staged. The best action scenes are the opening Barbarian battle and a fantastic fight scene between Maximus a veteran gladiator and a Colosseum full of bloodthirsty tigers. In those scenes Scott's emphasis on closeup sweaty brutal action is totally effective. I felt the cold of the forest mud the heat of the flaming trees the sharpness of the swords and the dusty claustrophobia of the Arena. The action of Gladiator is visceral and bloody and there is plenty of it. Those hungry for bloodsport will find more than enough manly derringdo to satiate their redblooded desire.For all its dramatic depth I can't say I came out of Gladiator heavily affected by feeling. This is still at its core a visceral experience but the small character moments and the textured performances are miraculously riveting. I was intrigued by every second of Gladiator. The action scenes are thrilling the dramatic scenes are mesmerizing and the 103 million budget is all up there on the screen in every frame. Ridley Scott's direction is superlative especially in the third act as the story action and emotions reach a fever pitch. The last few scenes including the climactic final showdown and the closing 'Elysium' scene exhibit a crescendo of the kind of daring artistry that permeates the film's best sections. Gladiator is a meaty Hollywood epic of the best kind. It's visually sumptuous and supremely thrilling but there is a beating heart within this beast. Sure there are a couple of bumps along the way but with Crowe as the sturdy hero and a simple story of returning home Gladiator stays with you long after the credits roll.92100".

Just as with the deep characters and eloquent script there's a modern feeling to Ridley Scott's filmmaking in Gladiator. The reliance on CGI is sometimes overdone but in conjunction with the costumes sets and impressively grandiose score from Hans Zimmer it adds to the intoxicating atmosphere of Ridley Scott's world.The main attraction of Gladiator is its scenes of gladiatorial combat and on that front Ridley Scott aptly gets the job done. There are a few moments when Scott falls back on to standard sword clashing and disorientating shaky cam but for the most part the action scenes are exciting bloody and imaginatively staged. The best action scenes are the opening Barbarian battle and a fantastic fight scene between Maximus a veteran gladiator and a Colosseum full of bloodthirsty tigers. In those scenes Scott's emphasis on closeup sweaty brutal action is totally effective. I felt the cold of the forest mud the heat of the flaming trees the sharpness of the swords and the dusty claustrophobia of the Arena. The action of Gladiator is visceral and bloody and there is plenty of it. Those hungry for bloodsport will find more than enough manly derringdo to satiate their redblooded desire.For all its dramatic depth I can't say I came out of Gladiator heavily affected by feeling. This is still at its core a visceral experience but the small character moments and the textured performances are miraculously riveting. I was intrigued by every second of Gladiator. The action scenes are thrilling the dramatic scenes are mesmerizing and the 103 million budget is all up there on the screen in every frame. Ridley Scott's direction is superlative especially in the third act as the story action and emotions reach a fever pitch. The last few scenes including the climactic final showdown and the closing 'Elysium' scene exhibit a crescendo of the kind of daring artistry that permeates the film's best sections. Gladiator is a meaty Hollywood epic of the best kind. It's visually sumptuous and supremely thrilling but there is a beating heart within this beast. Sure there are a couple of bumps along the way but with Crowe as the sturdy hero and a simple story of returning home Gladiator stays with you long after the credits roll.92100";

Its sweeping but simplistic heroic tale crunching fight scenes awardwinning special effects towering acting and soaring score set this film apart from all the pretenders that followed it. Ridley Scott singlehandedly reinvented the epic genre with this story of a Roman solider who is betrayed loses everything and is sold into slavery only to fight his way back as a gladiator all the while driven by vengeance for his murdered family.Russell Crowe gives quite simply the performance of a lifetime as the Gladiator Maximus one that deservedly won him Best Actor at the 2000 Academy Awards although his performance in the following year's Beautiful Mind was arguably even better even if it didn't win him his second consecutive Oscar and provided a thinking woman's alternative to the likes of Pitt Cruise and Clooney to swoon over. His gravely voice and impressive physique combine to give him a huge presence which literally fills the screen. His dialogue is sparing but his actions speak far louder adding a stoic sadness to his vengeancedriven heroic character. Before Gladiator Crowe was a good secondary actor after Gladiator he was catapulted to the top of Hollywood's Alist and remains there thanks to this careermaking performance proving him to be one of the finest actors of his generation.Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as the scheming and corrupt Emperor Commodus who betrays Maximus and has his family killed. He manages to be delightfully and totally evil without ever descending into the realms of pantomime villain which is a tricky line to walk and manages to avoid being overshadowed by Crowe's monumental performance.The fight scenes are rousing and superbly choreographed in particular a scene where Maximus marshals his fellow slaves into an army against marauding chariot archers in the Colosseum. The dialogue is kept simple and never overbearing no need to worry why all of Europe speaks the same language and culminates in one of the most memorable pieces of script that is destined to join the ranks of 'Play it Sam' and 'Are you talking' to me' as one of the most quoted and misquoted lines in movie history  although it is rather wordy. But here it is in full 'My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius. Commander of the Armies of the North General of the Felix Legions loyal servant to the true Emperor Marcus Aurelius Father to a murdered son husband to a murdered wife and I will have my vengeance in this life or the next.' As Crowe turns to the Emperor in the arena and delivers this line it proves to be one of the most electrifying moments in cinema history  hairs will stand up spines will tingle guaranteed.The action is set to some truly beautiful music and it is shameful Hans Zimmer missed out on the Oscar for Best Score. Ridley Scott was similarly unlucky in the Director category.The film is however tinged with sadness as it proved to be the final but triumphant swansong for the careers of Oliver Reed and Richard Harris both of whom died shortly after making this film. Neither could have delivered much finer performances and if any performance had to be a final one both delivered one worthy of such a status here. Reed in particular is a revelation reminding older generations and showing a new generation of his considerable talent.An inspiring film rousing exhilarating exciting and moving. Superbly acted directed scored and visualised. A tribute to how great films could be once and could be again.".

Definitely worth the money and I'm sorry that I didn't get to see it on the big screen.I was disturbed however by the historical liberties taken with the script. For those of you who don't care about this sort of thing please stop reading now.OK first of all Marcus Aurelius died of the plague which would have been pretty hard for Commodious to fake if he had killed his father. 2nd Commodius lived for 12 years 180192 A.D. so his quick rise and fall doesn't really jibe historically either he died in a wrestling match. Also he was known for his physical strength so his wimpiness in the movie really didn't make sense.These items taken alone bother me a little but then there are more disturbing factors to take into account. For one soldiers weren't allowed BY LAW to get married so all of Maximus' talk of going home to see his wife really doesn't make sense. Soldiers did keep women on nearby plots of land but they probably wouldn't talk openly about it. Also Rome was in a defensive posture most of the lands they had acquired they acquired BEFORE Marcus Aurelius came to power.I think what bothers me the most is the fact that Marcus Aurelius was no hero. He was renowned for persecuting Christians he stepped up efforts during his regime believing that Christianity would be the death of the empire. While he did do some very good things for the empire he wasn't the benevolent patriarch that the movie made him out to be. He also tried to marry his nephew to his daughter so they would produce a super emperor my guess is that he probably didn't want Rome to be a Republic again.Revisionist history is troublesome. Although this did happen nearly 2 millennia ago we still can't forget that the emperors of the day were not heroes by today's standards. I'm not one of those politically correct people who thinks that movies about despots shouldn't be made. I simply believe that historical figures should be presented honestly for what they did and didn't do and not sugarcoated for a mass audience.Having said all that I really did like the movie. I give it an 810 with the disclaimer that it's no Braveheart but it is visually stunning and hard to look away from while you're watching it but not a movie that really will affect me for months after seeing it.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is an unwritten rule in movie making that if you have an excellent script it doesn't matter how you film it. If you have a lousy script  then everything else matters the direction the cinematography the acting the music... Gladiator is an epitome of the latter half of that rule. The case where direction music acting and art direction completely redeemed a crappy story.For me it took watching it in German overdubbing. As I don't speak German there was nothing to detract me from visuals and music. And it's a new experience on another level. But more on that later. First the crappy part. The story.Make no mistake whether you care about history or not this is a horrible script. It's taking huge and quite unacceptable liberties with the period it purports to portray it's unconvincing even on its own terms the dialog is pretty much high school and in its core it's a predictable revenge story told a zillion times before. Apparently according to a documentary about Hollywood screenwriters only Russell Crowe didn't know what turd the script was so he contributed himself with the juvenile husband of the dead wife speech.Ridley Scott and his crew apparently knew what stinker they had to work with and did their best to defeat it with excellence in all areas and actually made two films in one.On the surface it's a revenge story. The hero a favorite army general turned gladiator seeks revenge against a young emperor who had general's family killed during the tumultuous succession to the throne. The military battles and the gladiatorial bouts required for this aspect of the movie are done both to tremendous detail and on a grand scale. With the help of CGI they are seen in all their glory and gore. Some accuse Scott of shying away from action but his direction shows everything one needs to see. Yes the cuts are brief the camera sometimes doesn't follow through but the editing is pure poetry and you miss nothing. Cinematographywise every frame is shot in a way that you could just hang it on a wall as a nice picture. Costumes and scenery are impeccable. A revenge story yes but well worth watching.But on another level Gladiator plays out like a remake of Fall of a Roman Empire. But it's not in the script. It's in the mood set again by production. This other story is about the decline and death of classical Rome and its ideals. There is simple yet effective symbolism to express it the play on dark and light and the sunrisesunset arc. The movie starts with a battle at dawn the way the Rome itself had once dawned fighting. There is an ideal Roman hero valiant and dutiful there's a typical Roman villain clandestine and scheming. Hero does his best in the light the villain does his worst in the dark whenever they swap environments during the movie they fail miserably. The story ends at sunset symbolizing the end of the Empire itself and although an uplifting speech is given at that point it is defeated by the setting sun.The feeling of the doom is constantly emphasized by melancholic music. The dreamlike experience of the main character who is already dead but doesn't yet know it is enhanced when he finally visits Rome and the city is an idealistic blown in proportions version of itself. The script may be a complete falsification of history but the feeling of decline one gets when watching those scenes is probably completely faithful.So forget the story and the closing speech. Watch and listen the movie. The Roman Empire is living and dying once more before your very eyes.".

If you have a lousy script  then everything else matters the direction the cinematography the acting the music... Gladiator is an epitome of the latter half of that rule. The case where direction music acting and art direction completely redeemed a crappy story.For me it took watching it in German overdubbing. As I don't speak German there was nothing to detract me from visuals and music. And it's a new experience on another level. But more on that later. First the crappy part.

I thought they were being unnecessarily 'Roman' in their ruthlessness but the result does show how disappointed so many viewers were and the extent to which this movie has polarised opinion.I diplomatically place myself somewhere in the middle.For me scepticism setin at the outset. That muchvaunted battle scene didn't sit right at all. In combat the greatest Roman strength lay in the legion. The scrupulously drilled and disciplined footsoldiers worked in unison advancing upon enemies in their orderly units and maniples.Their Shields interlocked to create a mobile wall that could formup on all flanks and even provide overhead protection. In between they used their short stabbing swords.The legions then were only at their best in the open. In dense forest their advantages would have been squandered any fight being a brawl upon the same terms as the enemy. Morover their big Shields would have been an encumbrance and the short swords inadequate. A good Roman general drew the enemy out to fight on his terms not the other way round. I'm not a scholar of Roman warfare it may be there were occasions when Romans had no choice but this is where the question marks began to popup. Check out the impeccable piece in 'Spartacus' where the Roman legions deploy by the textbook drawing their enemy down from the hill. Perhaps Mr Scott felt that a more faithful rendering would seem like too much of a ripoff. In any case this battle is quite incidental and seems to exist only to grip the viewer's attention for the next couple of flatulent hours.Neither was I aware that the Roman army employed firebombs. It's not for me to say they didn't but I have no reference to this tactic at all.I thought Ridley Scott made a futile attempt to create an 'arty' film. The frequent dreamlike flashbacks to a hand running through spears of corn reminded me of the recurrent unicorn dream from his fascinating but equally pretentious 'Blade Runner'. From time to time there's even the same highpitched warbling 'oriental' chorus intended to project mood but failing again. Some directors don't seem to realise that cinemagoers have memories.General Gruntus Maximus Russel Crowe surely got the easiest Oscar in history. He was believable as an uneducated slob in the way perhaps Spartacus should have been but cerebral enough to be a general? I don't think so. And you don't rise to be a career general in an army whilst obsessing as a farmer about your harvest. You're either one or the other.There was one particularly absurd scene in the arena when he was choppingdown competitors as quickly as they could be set against him. What then  weren't they trained gladiators too? I was halfexpecting him to begin walking sideways along the arena walls like 'Neo' from 'Matrixus'.As to the 'spectacle' of Rome well that was all just computergenerated hokum. The backroom boys can whipup anything in that way now just by tapping a few keys so what's the big deal? Checkout the 'real' thing in 'Fall Of The Roman Empire'.As with 'Titanic' and 'Pearl Harbour' a splendid opportunity was missed here to do something really wonderful but because of flawed vision and misplaced directorial selfbelief we finished up with mediocrity. Glorious mediocrity.Still bread and circuses usually please the crowds.".

	schema:reviewBody "What didn't work and things i learned 1. If you are a director or group leader don't worry about your group's health or the safety of your job because constant drinking unprofessional ism snowboarding on the back of trains are what make a director Extreme.2. If you are a gold medalistthat is not respectable or Extreme. Thus you should hang out with a bunch of amateurs to become Extreme. Also drinking and falling under peer pressure is OK if you want to be Extreme. 3. I don't know about you but if your going to set up a love story at least let it come to it's conclusion. No date or kiss scene? Weak.4. Silo's entrance and character was just ridiculous and laughable. The whole skateboarding scene on the train is the first example of how Extreme ops tries to be too Extreme. Good job dude that's one Extreme dumb ass right there. 5. Every Extreme person has rock entrance music to show he is more Extreme than others.6. A good camera man SHOULD ALWAYS hang upside down beneath a moving train for the best camera shot. 7. A snowboarder SHOULD ALWAYS grind their board on their train tracks while chanting like an Indian if they want to be Extreme. 8. Snowboarding off the top of a roof and doing back flips onto the bar was just complete BS. Why would you fill up alcohol in glasses when you know there just going to knock them down? It's either A. There's a dumb ass bartender B. There dumb ass customers who spent money to fill the glasses up to look Extreme. Take your pick.9. Snowball fight inside the resort was really misplaced especially after meeting a creepy guy10. The dog escape scene was really misplaced. It felt like a fight scene but then it didn't. Especially with the garbage can lid slide scene down the mountain. Also that's the best time to videotape. Dumb ass.11. The night time snowboardski scene was misplaced. What did it accomplish? Nothing at the end since it's accomplished in the hot tube scene.12. Director trademark Why not throw some sexy panty action at the cliff over the edge scene where Kittie is about to fall to her death?13. Always say bastard and smile when your being shot at.14. You SHOULD NOT fill a helicopter up before taking off. 15. Shotguns are the best long range weapons for killing. 16. Uzi and AK47 ammunition is rare. So use a shotgun as directed.17. Generals do not have good shooting skills. 18. Throwing rope down onto helicopter blades is not Extreme. Instead you must jump across the blades and throw the rope down. 19. Always throw hot coal into a hot tube with people in it. 20. Terrorist generals only have 4 men under the control at best. 21. Being shot in the arm by a shotgun will have no effect if you are Extreme.22. Being dropped on by a girl who weighs 105 pounds when you yourself are 6 ft about 250 will instantly knock you out. Note If you are the girl dropping on the guy you will not be hurt if you say words like totally radical narly after wards 23. What information did the helicopter pilot trade? What else was there to learn? 24. If 2 people need to ride on 1 snowboard you will still move at the same speed and your maneuverability and control will be crisp clean accurate.25. When your a inexperienced amateur listen to your buddy who tells you to cut the rope if your about to fall. 26. Cameras are now made with bullet proof covers. 27. Being shot at in the chest will also have no effect if you are Extreme. 28. Trying to plow your snowboard into a helicopter to hit someone is your best weapon.29. As an adult it's a good idea to let one of the kids sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the team. 30. As an adult leave a kid to watch someone wounded while you get help with 2 other adults. 31. When you return to the states DON'T notify the press of the ordeal you went through. Instead go get your money 32. Cell phones will have good reception in mountains when enemies are nearby but will have poor reception when there is no threat. 33. Make sure to videotape when you just got out of a life or death situation and are followed by a avalanche.Overall not a great movie but at least the casting exception of a few was alright.".

What else was there to learn? 24. If 2 people need to ride on 1 snowboard you will still move at the same speed and your maneuverability and control will be crisp clean accurate.25. When your a inexperienced amateur listen to your buddy who tells you to cut the rope if your about to fall. 26. Cameras are now made with bullet proof covers. 27. Being shot at in the chest will also have no effect if you are Extreme. 28. Trying to plow your snowboard into a helicopter to hit someone is your best weapon.29. As an adult it's a good idea to let one of the kids sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the team. 30. As an adult leave a kid to watch someone wounded while you get help with 2 other adults. 31. When you return to the states DON'T notify the press of the ordeal you went through. Instead go get your money 32. Cell phones will have good reception in mountains when enemies are nearby but will have poor reception when there is no threat. 33. Make sure to videotape when you just got out of a life or death situation and are followed by a avalanche.Overall not a great movie but at least the casting exception of a few was alright.";

I was watching Extreme Ops in the comfort of my home and suddenly the world fell silent and a wave of emptiness fell upon me as a poorly matted Bridgette Wilson escaped a fake avalanche just in time for a ski jump to take out some excruciatingly recycled terrorists who were busy being evil for no other reason than because the script says to.  I looked around to find myself in alien surroundings.  My home was no longer my home but a void of everlasting darkness in which no form of goodness nor light nor hope could ever be found.  And from the belly of this neverending realm of pain and celluloid death could be heard the sound of English actor Rufus Sewell dismantling his once promising career with lines of dialogue like Are you ready to know what it's like to ski in front of an avalanche?  Oh the pain.  Soon all this agony ceased and numbness set in.  My world shrank and suddenly I felt nothing at all and I realized that everything I had ever done was meaningless and all I had was nothing at all so long as Devon Sawa continues to hang from a cliff and ask a girl out in the middle of a terrorist attack just before feigning suicide for team sacrifice. My God my God why hast thou forsaken me?But then something happened.  The darkness parted and the shroud of peril lifted and I awoke from my numbness to find that I was in deed at home. My furniture was still here and all my things were as I had left them.  I wondered to my self What happened?  And then I looked to my television and saw credits rolling.  The deed was done.  And the darkness had gone. But only until the sequel.  Fat chanceThis movie sucks.  I hate it almost as much as it hates me. 110".

It had some good points a lot of low points as well but still some good stuff to be seen.I thought the story was actually a rather interesting idea.  It could have definitely been a great movie with the right director.  I did like some of Christian Duguay's work The Art of War and Screamers I'm not really sure what happened here.  I want to blame the writing and the editor...but I'm sure that the director is also to blame here.  Speaking of editing there was some HORRIBLE editing in this film.  There were a few scenes where I couldn't help but ask myself What the heck was that?!?!The characters in the film were all pretty good ideas just not executed correctly.  The two characters that were supposed to be super adrenaline junkies were good ideas but weren't done justice.  I'm not saying the acting was horrible or anything like that I'm just saying that some of the things they were doing didn't look cool just plain stupid!!!  There were a few stunts that they did that were really cool though so it wasn't a total bust.  I did like the snowboarding off the back of the train that was kind of cool.The action in the film was actually really good at times.  But it was very often shortlived.  I was shocked how short the chase in the film was between the terrorists and the good guys.  At the end of the film I was thinking That's it???  ...And as for the actual final moments of the film...well let's just say it could have been better.Most of the actors did a fine job.  Rufus Sewell did a fine job as always. Ever since I saw him in Dark City I've really liked his acting and tried to follow his work.  Devon Sawa did a surprisingly good job I usually don't like his acting but did a pretty good job in the film.  Bridget Wilson did a great job with her role and looks absolutely fantastic throughout the film.  She is reason enough to watch the film.  Jana Pallaske is a new face to me she did an ok job with her role.  I didn't think she was spectacular but she did pretty good job given the material and is quite the looker as well...her lips remind me of Angelina Jolie.All in all I can't in good conscience recommend you go see this film in the theater unless you just want to see some cool snowboardingskiing footage. I strongly urge you not to pay a full price ticket see this one at a matinee if you absolutely must.  Otherwise wait till video.  Thanks for readingChris".

So while xXx starring Vin Diesel was successful enough to secure a sequel Extreme Ops failed to make an impression at the box office and the notion of extreme sport action movies died out as quickly as it had begun.Extreme Ops which was filmed under the title The Extremists but swiftly retitled before release due to the events of 911 is an international coproduction with an appropriately international cast of American British and central European actors. The storyline has a film crew together with a pair of snowboarders and a female gold medalwinning downhill skier travelling to an unnamed European ski resort offseason to shoot footage for an advertising campaign. Unfortunately a wanted Serbian war criminal is using the isolated resort as a temporary hideout and the film crew eventually find themselves fleeing down the mountainside with the Serbian and his men in determined pursuit.However that particular plot development doesn't occur until twothirds of the way through the movie so for the first hour we merely see the film crew snowboarders and the skier hanging about in the empty resort occasionally filming on the slopes and bonding over bottles of beer while relaxing in a hot tub.It sounds deadly dull and considering that the characterisations in the script are tissuethin it should be. But due to the efforts of the talented cast these irresponsible risktakers the snowboarders and most of the film crew are diehard adrenalin junkies come across as surprisingly likable. As a result despite being routine in practically every aspect Extreme Ops is a remarkably engaging movie.".

Well I am happy to say they were. The film is very entertaining and actually is a very cool movie to watch. To bad it's opening up now they should have held it from coming out at least till a time when there weren't so many blockbusters opening up. But I really enjoyed this movie and you all should check it out. The story is about this commercial director who does these insane stunts like the mountain dew commercials with extreme sports. They have a chance to make it BIG so what they do is instead of making a CGI avalanche scene they decide to do it for real. So they call in the pros and they go down to the mountain ski lodge. They get jipped on there rooms and end up staying in a secluded resort. THat night 2 of them go exploring the place and follow a hot babe into a room they video tape her and her supposed father and then get chased off by dogs. Only thing is...it wasn't her father...and the guy who they video taped...faked his death on a plane and is presumed dead. Wanted by the FEDS once he finds out they have a tape of him...he will do anything to get it back! The story goes from there I was pretty impressed by the stunts and also the fact that the avalanche scene looked awesome! Unlike that lousy special effects used in Blue Crush. Bridgette Wilson is beautiful and hot in this movie as always and now I am mad cause she is married and not to me!!!  Anyway I give this movie a 710. Wasn't the greatest movie but it sure as heck isn't the worst! It will take you by surprise!!!".

They lodge on the top of a mountain where a group of Serbian terrorist is hidden. The plot of this movie is very predictable like in most of the action movies. But the proposal is not to make a movie for thinking but as an entertainment. And with this optic it is a great movie. What makes the difference are the landscape and the action scenes supported by a great soundtrack techno.

I see from the ratings that women like it more than men. I think that's because there's no gratuitous sex or violence and the females leads are strong and entertaining. Also notable is that it pokes some fun at reality TV shows with the obligatory hot tub scene and plot references to shows like Fear Factor and Big Brother.".

Despite the danger all the thrillseekers see it as a bit of fun but when they accidentally get film of a dead war criminal very much alive they find themselves in very real danger.Perhaps unfortunately also known as The Extremists this film is an European attempt to do what xXx did in regards making an action film out of extreme sports. Now to many viewers this may feel like a particularly bad overall aim but bear in mind that instead of American muscleman Vin Diesel we've got Rufus Sewell in the lead  oh sh1111111t boy....it's on now kid we bringing the CWELL etc. You get my point  from the start you cannot shake the feeling that this is a product made without a lot of money sloshing around. With that in mind I did expect it to be awful and it was a weirdly nice surprise to find that it is only not that good. The plot about terrorists in a remote location is not reached for twothirds and up till then we just have lots of noisy extreme sports action. This snowboarding stuff is all very well but without any plotting or characters to speak of you'd be better off just watching it on one of those channel 4 sports programmes instead.In the final thirty minutes we suddenly have an action movie as one would expect but this is too quick and lacking in tension or the sort of internal realism required to engage the viewer. It pootles along OK I suppose but it never shakes the feeling of being basic mainly because Duguay can't inject action and thrills into it he does his best but the material is the root of the problem and the film never did anything for me other than distract. The cast don't help the feeling of this being done on the cheap but the bigger problem is that nobody really has a lot of presence or charisma. The only exception to this is Pallaske who is cute and energetic enough to stick in the mind. Otherwise though we are left with Sewell being too bland for this film Graves doing a comedy character Wilson being blonde and tall Sawa better known as Eminem's Stan doing not that much and then lots of Eastern European boilerplates.Extreme Ops offers a mix of soso extreme sports action soso narrative soso performances and soso action. It is no surprise then that the overall film at its best is soso and other than a very lazy Friday night watching cable I don't think many viewers will find that this meets their needs. Here we go again is the final line of the film  extremely unlikely I'd say.".

On the recommendation of a friend I watched the movie in widescreen on DVD using a high resolution monitor.  The visuals are so important that I cannot imagine watching a pick and scan version on a conventional TV set.  Too much would be lost that way.The scene early in the movie where one of the Mars astronauts gets blown up made me levitate.  Also I though Tim Robbins' and Connie Nielsen's weightless dance in the spaceship on the way to Mars was lovely.  The scene with the startling all white surroundings that the astronauts faced in the faceship to coin a phrase was also well done.  I thought the performances were uniformly excellent.  That fact and the wonderful visuals overcame sometimes excruciatingly bad dialogue so that it did not really detract from my enjoyment of the film.  That being said though I loved the exchange where it was observed by one character that the mere three percent difference between the genetic makeup of men and apes gave us Einstein Mozart and a second character adds Jack the Ripper.Some reviewers complained about the similarity of the film to 2001 but that is exactly what De Palma had in mind I think.  Mission to Mars pays homage to every scifi cartoon and movie ever made from Buck Rogers to Close Encounters and does it well.  Anyway De Palma proved to me again that he really does march to his own drummer.  I was hugely entertained and highly recommend this film  but only if you watch it in widescreen on DVD or better still in a theater.  Eight out of ten.".

As with Kubrick and Greenaway you have to know what to expect going into a theater because they do not concern themselves with storytelling in the ordinary sense. De Palma doesn't make films about life and is unconcerned with the drama one normally finds there.He makes films about films and since the target is an abstraction in the first place the dramatic focus is flat the acting obvious the stories predictable  all by design. By definition we've already been wherever he goes. The value of the experience is in how he takes something that is ordinary and examines it in new ways. Its the 1890s Paris painting scene where the eye is everything.We've seen him do Hitchcock Kurosawa Antonioni and more. Here he tackles Kubrick and the results are astounding.Kubrick does an endon entrance of a spaceship with majestic passing De Palma does too and then enters a window to show Robbins and wife in an elaborate view dancing the camera around them with Robbin's face reflected just incidentally. Kubrick has a clever shot of a man walking around the gravity ring De Palma elaborates on this a hundredfold with comings and goings and ups and ins and reversals until we are dizzy. 2001's spaceships were the stuff of pulp covers but here we have even accurate rivet patterns everything scrupulously close to NASA specs. 2001 has a cheap Kaleidoscope passage and some clean room visions when the makers are encountered. M2M's makers' are encountered in an evercleaner ever more abstract room.Incidentally in the only clever element of the script those makers show images of how they seeded' Earth with an  ambiguity between the making of the image and the act itself.One doesn't go to a film like this expecting a traditional Lucaslike ride. This is intelligent selfreferential stuff targeting not the mind but the eye. I suppose a question is whether it can also be entertaining for kids. I suspect not. Kubrick himself never tried. The fault is with the marketeers who try and sell these films in the same way as simple thrill rides. Shame on them. Regrets to all the ticketbuyers expecting Spielbergisms.If you are an IMDB visitor and reading this chances are you are serious about film. If so I recommend that you see 2001 then this in one evening. Forget about story acting drama and focus on where these gents take your eye.

	schema:headline " A difficult derivative scifi film";
	schema:reviewBody "After a second viewing I can say that I am still not sure what to make of this film. Many will see this as something of a remake of 2001. And yes the film is visually almost plagiaristic of the Kubrick masterpiece. The two biggest problems are a lack in originality and thoughtfulness. From my rating you can see that I did not despise this film. It's visually nice and the performances are all good. However I am not sure I can recommend it.I'm a scifi fan and a scientist so I was initially intrigued by the notion of a bigname dramatic filmmaker doing a sci fi epic which appeared at least initially to be hardcore scifi. By hardcore scifi I mean fiction based on scientific reality not fantasy with a tiny bit of science thrown in for decoration. An example also using Mars as a vehicle is Ben Bova's novel Mars  which focuses on the very edge of plausibility only occasionally overstepping the bounds of scientific possibility. Film has rarely achieved this  a few interesting exceptions are Alien the original Outland and Silent Running. Hardcore scifi which I argue this film could and should have been is careful about that boundary. And 34ths of the way through Mission to Mars it's still a hardcore scifi flick. Then suddenly it's something else. I will leave that something else for you to discover and stay focused on what the director and screenwriter were trying to do here.What we have here is not really a single plot but a pastiche of plots that have been strung together into one long mysterious and grandiose story line. The film starts out with a couple of scenes which might have been lost in Appollo 13  providing a little bit of character development and letting us know that we are about to witness the first manned space flight to Mars. That flight ends pretty quickly as virtually everything goes wrong. And as a rescue mission begins the question then becomes why is everything going wrong? Up to the point where the rescue mission enters Martian orbit this central question is sustained and developed skillfully but then  in my opinion things start to go wrong with the film itself. There are major problems with what could have been the best aspects of this film. The spaceships are remarkably flimsy and poorly designed but they look great! The safety protocols for the mission about which we hear so much are either not followed or incredibly naive. The heroes are not particularly clever about heroism and seem to forget at times what the actual possibilities are for mobility in space why not use the tether three times  twice out to Woody and once to get back after you run out of fuel Terry?. The guy who authored the safety protocols does not appear particularly concerned with safety or even protocols. The evolutionary biologist on the crew is amazingly poorly informed about the Paleozoic period of earth history and the evolution of species. I could go on.The film is broadly derivative of 2001 A Space Oddyssey The Abyss Star Gate Event Horizon Fifth Element Contact and a few dozen other somewhat entertaining but not particularly believable space  scifi adventures but while it resembles and in fact pays homage to these films especially 2001 it never entertains quite as well. Why? Because these films do not pretend to be based on scientific ideas but rather aesthetics and humanism. While most of these films invite interpretation Mission to Mars simply repeats ideas from previous films and doesn't even bother to recast them into an interesting new light. Mission to Mars is something that has been done many times before and in more interesting entertaining and thoughtprovoking ways. Technical proficiency which is something this film exudes is no substitute for a compelling story and interesting individual characters. Unfortunately even in terms of technique the film has some flaws. Some will disagree but I found the soundtrack irritating and the pace of the film very uneven to say the least. And the characters lives are so intertwined in the few character development sequences that only Sinise Robbins and Bennings' characters develop rudimentary individualities. Despite his reputation I can not hold Brian De Palma up to standards which are different than those of other filmmakers and I can not condone creating a special vocabulary or a sophisticated argument to permit interpretation of his films as part of some overarching theme which only he and a few of his fans understand. There is a fine line between flattering imitation and shameless copying so I'd rather not get into an extrapolated metafilm discussion of this film's relationship to 2001. I don't think this film is worthy of such a sophisticated analysis. There are some truly great moments in Mission to Mars. This should not be too surprising with the wonderful cast big budget and talented production team. What did surprise me about this film was the 2001like 180 degree turn it took off of the map of scientific possibility 34ths of the way through the film and I can't say that turn and its outcome really impressed me.If you're a scifi fan or somebody with a very casual interest in science you should probably see this. But if you haven't seen 2001 first by all means wait until you have. And don't take this one too seriously when you do get around to it. This has much more to do with fiction than science fiction.".

	onyx:emotionText "After a second viewing I can say that I am still not sure what to make of this film. Many will see this as something of a remake of 2001. And yes the film is visually almost plagiaristic of the Kubrick masterpiece. The two biggest problems are a lack in originality and thoughtfulness. From my rating you can see that I did not despise this film. It's visually nice and the performances are all good. However I am not sure I can recommend it.I'm a scifi fan and a scientist so I was initially intrigued by the notion of a bigname dramatic filmmaker doing a sci fi epic which appeared at least initially to be hardcore scifi. By hardcore scifi I mean fiction based on scientific reality not fantasy with a tiny bit of science thrown in for decoration. An example also using Mars as a vehicle is Ben Bova's novel Mars  which focuses on the very edge of plausibility only occasionally overstepping the bounds of scientific possibility. Film has rarely achieved this  a few interesting exceptions are Alien the original Outland and Silent Running. Hardcore scifi which I argue this film could and should have been is careful about that boundary. And 34ths of the way through Mission to Mars it's still a hardcore scifi flick. Then suddenly it's something else. I will leave that something else for you to discover and stay focused on what the director and screenwriter were trying to do here.What we have here is not really a single plot but a pastiche of plots that have been strung together into one long mysterious and grandiose story line. The film starts out with a couple of scenes which might have been lost in Appollo 13  providing a little bit of character development and letting us know that we are about to witness the first manned space flight to Mars. That flight ends pretty quickly as virtually everything goes wrong. And as a rescue mission begins the question then becomes why is everything going wrong? Up to the point where the rescue mission enters Martian orbit this central question is sustained and developed skillfully but then  in my opinion things start to go wrong with the film itself. There are major problems with what could have been the best aspects of this film. The spaceships are remarkably flimsy and poorly designed but they look great! The safety protocols for the mission about which we hear so much are either not followed or incredibly naive. The heroes are not particularly clever about heroism and seem to forget at times what the actual possibilities are for mobility in space why not use the tether three times  twice out to Woody and once to get back after you run out of fuel Terry?. The guy who authored the safety protocols does not appear particularly concerned with safety or even protocols.

People who are great friends on earth who must face challenges to their friendships and their humanity while in space and on Mars.  They could just as easily have been in Kansas.  Brian De Palma the greatest living visual director takes us on a glorious journey with his camera.  The sets and special effects never overshadow the actors who blend in seamlessly to create a visual treat for the eyes.  This is a tender and moving film about people and their relationships.  It's a beautiful film told in a very slow deliberate manner.  It pays homage to many other films but it is its own entity unlike any other space movie you have ever seen.  The film features wonderful performances from its cast an effective score by Ennio Morricone and peerless direction from Brian De Palma.  The nature of its stunning visuals demand that this film be seen in widescreen ONLY.  Highly recommended!".

Sprinkle a touch of action and a pinch of suspense and you have yourself a scifi film for the new millennium.The film stars such veteran actors as Tim Robbins Gary Sinise Don Cheadle and Jerry O'Connell an ensemble where only firstclass acting is possible. So let us move onto the direction.  It is Brian DePalma's foray into science fiction.  And masterfully done to say the least.  His shot composition is reminiscent of  Scarface and The Untouchables mixing filmmaking from the days of yore with today's MTV aesthetic.  DePalma's talent for filming suspenseful action sequences is in full swing in this film.  The spacewalk scene will be one that will not be forgotten for quite some time.  Could possibly be one of the best spacewalk scenes in films to date.  The hidden jewel for me was the unpredictability of the film.  Each corner turned was a pleasant surprise.  I can't remember that last time I saw a movie with this quality especially coming out of the Hollywood mainstream.The cinematography was astounding.  Imagine Lawrence of Arabia lensed on Mars.  Professor Jenkins from Scientific America was correct when he said that the images from the film were identical to those photographed from the actual planet.  And that is not a small feat.".

My personal suspicion is that this movie explains life's origins outside the context of religion and in the American Puritan culture this isn't liked accepted or tolerated. The way the film portrays human origin evolution and development doesn't jibe with their biblical and religious traditional beliefs based on God and creationist stories.

	schema:reviewBody "If you're a Scifi fan like me you will find this movie competes only with the other worst Scifi title in our contemporary times War of the Worlds by Spielberg.This movie is crud from the start. First we are to believe that NASA now seeks out married couples to fly in space  ain't gonna happen in real life. Then when a rescue mission is called for on Mars the decision to launch one is not made by NASA as real life might have it its made by the starstudded cast.As the stupidity rolls on in this film you can find some parts that are just plain horrible writing. For example the crew flies this amazing hitech spaceship to Mars but just before landing they have a fuel leak. Somehow someone forgot to put a fuel pressure gage in the ship?!?!? Then we get treated to some of the WORST acting you will ever see. Up to this point in the film we are supposed to believe that Tim Robbins and Connie Neilsen  married in the plot  are deeply in love. But when Robbins 'heroically' dies trying to save the ship within 10 minutes Connies seems to be 'over it'. We see no further effects that she has lost a husband  and in fact boy did she recover quickly.You as the viewer are then treated to more insults to your intelligence when the crew finds Don Cheadle there on Mars where he has been stranded for many months. Oddly though Cheadle has no problem breathing on Mars  hmmm must have brought his own atmosphere  and shock of shocks he has plenty of electricity to run his fancy computer which answers all the technical questions even though he has been there long after batteries would have run out.Now that DePalma has you completely in his power if you're stupid enough to keep watching he then lays the biggie on you. Where did Earth's population come from? Mars. Yup years ago they seeded our planet before leaving their own decaying world. This might be a nice premise for a movie but here of course its just the vehicle to explain what to that point has been the mystery in a tedious and boring movie.But the ultimate insult awaits for us in DePalma's utterly ridiculous end of the movie. Gary Sinese will now join the longexiled Martians somewhere in another galaxy. Yup  but how does he get there? A water pipe essentially... Ya so much for writing.What I find most amazing about Mission to Mars is that fine actors like Sinese Tim Robbins Connie Neilsen Don Cheadle and many others MUST have read this script first  HOW they could have signed on to this mess is beyond me. Must have been good money.Mission to Mars is without doubt one of the worst Scifi movies in history asking you the viewer to ignore stupidity lousy writing factual blunders about space flight and a cast that seems so 'numb' to the horribly crafted mess that they just 'do the lines' to get the darn thing done.This movie along with such classic crud as Spielberg's War of the Worlds or Alien versus Predator belongs in a Sunday marathon of Scifi movies where the Director presumes his audiences are braindead. Certified garbage  from start to end.".

First we are to believe that NASA now seeks out married couples to fly in space  ain't gonna happen in real life. Then when a rescue mission is called for on Mars the decision to launch one is not made by NASA as real life might have it its made by the starstudded cast.As the stupidity rolls on in this film you can find some parts that are just plain horrible writing. For example the crew flies this amazing hitech spaceship to Mars but just before landing they have a fuel leak. Somehow someone forgot to put a fuel pressure gage in the ship?!?!? Then we get treated to some of the WORST acting you will ever see. Up to this point in the film we are supposed to believe that Tim Robbins and Connie Neilsen  married in the plot  are deeply in love. But when Robbins 'heroically' dies trying to save the ship within 10 minutes Connies seems to be 'over it'. We see no further effects that she has lost a husband  and in fact boy did she recover quickly.You as the viewer are then treated to more insults to your intelligence when the crew finds Don Cheadle there on Mars where he has been stranded for many months. Oddly though Cheadle has no problem breathing on Mars  hmmm must have brought his own atmosphere  and shock of shocks he has plenty of electricity to run his fancy computer which answers all the technical questions even though he has been there long after batteries would have run out.Now that DePalma has you completely in his power if you're stupid enough to keep watching he then lays the biggie on you. Where did Earth's population come from? Mars. Yup years ago they seeded our planet before leaving their own decaying world. This might be a nice premise for a movie but here of course its just the vehicle to explain what to that point has been the mystery in a tedious and boring movie.But the ultimate insult awaits for us in DePalma's utterly ridiculous end of the movie. Gary Sinese will now join the longexiled Martians somewhere in another galaxy. Yup  but how does he get there? A water pipe essentially... Ya so much for writing.What I find most amazing about Mission to Mars is that fine actors like Sinese Tim Robbins Connie Neilsen Don Cheadle and many others MUST have read this script first  HOW they could have signed on to this mess is beyond me. Must have been good money.Mission to Mars is without doubt one of the worst Scifi movies in history asking you the viewer to ignore stupidity lousy writing factual blunders about space flight and a cast that seems so 'numb' to the horribly crafted mess that they just 'do the lines' to get the darn thing done.This movie along with such classic crud as Spielberg's War of the Worlds or Alien versus Predator belongs in a Sunday marathon of Scifi movies where the Director presumes his audiences are braindead. Certified garbage  from start to end.";

And yes they are here but I am truly shocked that people not only liked the movie but actually are praising it so highly. Thus my summary tag line. Amazing that viewers can be drawn in to a film of such low quality.Watched it on a 65 TV with a high end surround sound and there are a couple of moments the movie utilizes the technology available to it but by and large the effects by today's standards are amateurish and very low caliber. This would have been visually stunning in 1976 but in 2000 and certainly now it's somewhat of a joke.But the effects aren't the only downfall. The dialog is equally pathetic. Acting marginal to awful. Direction atrocious. It fails at every level.And there are people that like it. That is awesome and utterly amazing.".

	schema:headline " De Palma's Odyssey";
	schema:reviewBody "Brian De Palma's Mission to Mars scorned by critics upon its release in early 2000 is not deserving of so. It has its flaws yes and it certainly can be overbearing at times but I'd take a filmmaker who goes over the top any day over a filmmaker who doesn't give a damn.Loosely based on the Disney Tomorrowland attraction De Palma utilizes his crew to their fullest extent specifically his cinematographer Stephen H. Burum and composer Ennio Morricone and delivers an exciting actionadventure with the fundamentals of true science fiction. But De Palma always the mischievous filmmaker toys with his audience both fulfilling and averting genre conventions to them. Even the film's opening act where  some thing  causes a team of astronauts to go on a rescue mission to the Red Planet completely seems out of place but knowing De Palma this is exactly what he wants.An addition to the boom of space exploration movies following the success of Apollo 13 De Palma's film doesn't concern itself with the story so much so as how De Palma wants he audience to feel the story. De Palma and Burum dance their way to elaborate hypnotic camera movements while the great movie maestro Ennio Morricone provides the symphony for said dance. The camera weaves through the interiors of the spaceships every which way it can and on the surface of the Red Planet it exudes a terrific sense of wonder and mystery something akin to the golden years of science fiction.Some of the dialog is hokey and some moments admittedly goofy but again this also could be a throwback to the Golden scifi era and besides De Palma wastes no time on those trivial script moments. He is more of an artist than a storyteller but there is a story being told here and the journey is indeed mesmerizing and a lot of fun to watch.

The effects do not just serve as pretty eye candy De Palma utilizes them to bring out an awesome exhilaration and sense of wonder from the audience. Again playing with them like a piano.What I think really divided audiences and critics alike was the climactic act of the film which some would consider it as Space Odysseylite. I do not find that an insult to Kubrick rather I find it complementary that in today's science fiction films that results in George Lucas mentality that here is a director that pays the perfect tribute to both the greatest science fiction film of all time as well as its creator.Ultimately Mission to Mars is a brave and severely underrated blockbuster that not only is it exciting and hypnotic to watch but leaves so much to the imagination long after the main story is finished. This is delicious eye candy high on nutrition. Before you set your kids on 2001 A Space Odyssey let them see this first.De Palma is a postmodern filmmaker a director who shows his love of movies by making other movies especially his love of Hitchcock in many of his earlier films like Blow Out Sisters and Body Double and allows film fans to play games with him by watching them. The main difference from other filmmakers who do the same than De Palma is that he genuinely exudes his own playful style to the film he works on no matter a low budget arthouse indie or a bigbudget studio blockbuster. If De Palma decides to return to bigbudget filmmaking as of this writing it is his last studio picture I would really love to see what this American auteur can come up next.".

	onyx:emotionText "Brian De Palma's Mission to Mars scorned by critics upon its release in early 2000 is not deserving of so. It has its flaws yes and it certainly can be overbearing at times but I'd take a filmmaker who goes over the top any day over a filmmaker who doesn't give a damn.Loosely based on the Disney Tomorrowland attraction De Palma utilizes his crew to their fullest extent specifically his cinematographer Stephen H. Burum and composer Ennio Morricone and delivers an exciting actionadventure with the fundamentals of true science fiction. But De Palma always the mischievous filmmaker toys with his audience both fulfilling and averting genre conventions to them. Even the film's opening act where  some thing  causes a team of astronauts to go on a rescue mission to the Red Planet completely seems out of place but knowing De Palma this is exactly what he wants.An addition to the boom of space exploration movies following the success of Apollo 13 De Palma's film doesn't concern itself with the story so much so as how De Palma wants he audience to feel the story. De Palma and Burum dance their way to elaborate hypnotic camera movements while the great movie maestro Ennio Morricone provides the symphony for said dance. The camera weaves through the interiors of the spaceships every which way it can and on the surface of the Red Planet it exudes a terrific sense of wonder and mystery something akin to the golden years of science fiction.Some of the dialog is hokey and some moments admittedly goofy but again this also could be a throwback to the Golden scifi era and besides De Palma wastes no time on those trivial script moments. He is more of an artist than a storyteller but there is a story being told here and the journey is indeed mesmerizing and a lot of fun to watch. De Palma and the producers also made the right choice in picking genuine talent for the characters and not the superstar of today.And then there are the effects. Both practical and computergenerated are put to heavy use here and the results are nothing short of spectacular even by today's standards. OK well maybe not a sequence near the end.

It's the year 2020 a bit optimistic I'd say and we've managed to open an orbiting multination mission control station.

Too bad he can't always get David Mamet DePalma's The Untouchables to write his scripts for him. This one seems thrown together having been either written on the fly or ignored.

When he composed this music was he watching the wrong film? The inappropriate distracting score actually ruins some wellexecuted action sequences.My conclusion about Mission To Mars is that this could have been a decent scifi film if it weren't ruined by amateurish oversights. The finished product a curious melding of two genres the realistic space mission movie ala Apollo 13 and science fiction is a mere shadow of what it could have been. The studio probably envisioned something along the lines of Cameron's The Abyss or even Kubrick's 2001 but fails.  Unfortunately this means Verhoeven's Total Recall is still the best Mars flick around.Grade D".

Such an overload of clichs is not easy to find. I have an urge to say the acting stinks too and although it is absolutely true the actors are totally excused simply because there's nothing to act on. You simply cannot utter sentences and act out story bits seen and heard so many times and have an expression apart from cartoonlike mimic and eyebrow work. EVERYTHING was so bad here from direction to acting to perhapsgoodbuttotallymisplaced score to camera i just had to comment aloud all the time although i was home alone! I don't do that usually it was really that bad. Occasionally computer graphics would appear which to my surprise looked exceptionally good although very kitchy. This made me think how the hell a director and a story this crappy got so much money for CGI??.When after the film i read that this is a Brian De Palma movie i was shocked. Something MUST have gone terribly wrong in the production of this. A badly timed deadline? Urgent need of money? I don't know. And i don't want to know. I want to forget this as soon as i write this review.Now as a youngster i was a great fan of scifi literature and even today i like to see a good SF movie alas by now i already realized there is almost no such thing with very rare exceptions. So i continue to watch the bad ones this piece of crap included. Thus as a principal SF fan i agree with all the people here who say they are sick of all the 'fight the alien monster' movies. But contrary to most of them i don't think that making aliens nice and wise makes it a good film or even story. Shtstinks whatever shade of brown it may be. Not to forget shameless ripping off also stinks especially when it is so obvious as this ripoff of 2001 Space Odissey is and even more so when the ripoff is such a simplistic version of the original. As i watched i kept thinking When this guy i.e. director was young he wished he made 2001 SO. Eventually he did and he screwed it up to last bit and he called it Mission to Mars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Throughout his career Brian De Palma's sensibilities have been at odds with mainstream audiences. He's a trickster and a formalist and those looking for realism and carefully sketched characters are often left confused by his constant homages and emphasis on technique. Mission to Mars introduces its playful intentions with its very first shot. A toy rocket accompanied by carnival music shoots up into the air and explodes. De Palma is here to play with his toys. The very next scene is an overly elaborate longtake in which all the film's characters their loves and losses are introduced. As a formalist De Palma often calls attention to the artificiality of art. Here he has two astronauts holding video cameras as a CGI beast veers toward them. We focus on Don Cheadle's eyes as he watches these two filmmakers the word synthetic stencilled in bold letters behind him. This whole action scene is fake created for the audience. De Palma wants you to focus not on story but the design and look of the thing. Likewise the aliens at the end of the film are themselves artists who've designed man. As such they demonstrate this knowledge to their audience the astronauts with a film. De Palma once said that space travel and scientific conquest are the only things that he can generate genuine optimism for and one feels this in Mission to Mars. The film has an overwhelming sense of earnestness. De Palma characters have never seemed so pure optimistic good natured and filled with humanity. There's no cynicism or bitterness here. Upon first viewing I found this all very cheesy but now coupled with Ennio Moricone's sweeping and romantic score I find the film's broad brushstrokes very moving. Mission also continues De Palma's trend of turning classic films on their side. He's done this to Hitch Fellini Anotonioni and Hawks. Now he does it to Kubrick one scene literally has 2001 A Space Odyssey's monolith on it's side. Does this make De Palma a hack? No It makes him a giddy delight if you're a film fan. Mission to Mars is a bit more straightforward than 2001 it's a little friendlier but it's practically the same movie. Just replace the monolith with the Mars face and drop Hal. Both films' spaceships also look alike and the white room used in the climactic scene strongly resembles the room at the end of 2001. And of course where Kubrick gave us spaceships dancing the waltz De Palma gives us astronauts dancing in zero gravity.But De Palma doesn't stop at Kubrick. His film has a character named Luke who spends one scene talking about a mysterious force Star Wars a spaceship commanded by a man named Jim Star Trek and many overt reference to Flash Gordon Robinson Crusoe and Teasure Island. Noticing that his tale is a virtual rehash of The Abyss De Palma also tips his hat to James Cameron by having Gary Sinese become submerged in oxygenated water like Ed Harriss during the film's finale. And of course both films have a CGI tentacle. Cameron gives us water De Palma gives us sand.Everything De Palma touches has been covered before. He acknowledges this. But it's how he touches that's magical. His entire film is elegant and fluid. Every shot is just a little bit wider or closer than usual. His camera pans and tracks with robotic precision dancing points of views shifting perspectives changing. There's a perfection in his form. Every shot is beautifully precise. But what about the trite story critics say? Yes the story is silly stupid even but it's all told with such an earnest awww shucks feeling that it sucks you in. And besides De Palma is never about story. Compare Femme Fatale to Double Indemnity. Compare Vertigo to Body Double or Obsession. He takes the core ideas of all these films and multiplies them by ten. You want Double Indemnity? De Palma gives you triple indemnity. You want Hitchcockian voyeurs? Hell De Plama's voyeurs are watching voyeurs who themselves are being watched by even more voyeurs. You want illicit Hitchcockian affairs? Screw that. De Palma gives you Vertigo with incest. You want a slowmo Hitchcock knife stab? Hell De Palma kills you with a power drill and chainsaw. Nothing in De Palma's cinema is real. He knows that all films are about other films. Everything he's done has been done before. This is what all formalists Coens Tarantino Leone are about. They're interested in the act of watching and how we catalogue what we see. After 4 viewings the only flaw I see in Mission to Mars is the film's unimaginative ending. Someone concerned with style and superficial form really should design a more imaginative ending. De Palma's silly alien hologram feels hokey though Morricone's score does lend it an emotional sweep.But this fault I think can be blamed on Touchstone. The studios had an 80 million dollar budget on the line and weren't happy with where the film was going. They wrongly thought they had another Appolo 13Gary Sinese rescue movie on their hands. And so looking to save cash they chopped the budget and gave De Palma several months less to shoot the final act. Hence the film goes nowhere after the EVA sequence. But this sort of studio meddling is typical with De Palma Snake Eyes Mission Impossible Casualties Dahlia Obsession Bonfire etc were all taken away at some point. 8.510 The film has aged well. Gorgeous visuals beautiful music and an affecting sense of optimism. The only flaw is the last act which still works thanks to Morricone's score and an emotional flashback montage. Requires several viewings.".

The film shows the adventures of the human inhabitants of the shrubland of Cecebre and how their paths cross over under the shelter of a lively forest where animals  people and plants form a harmonious system . It notably tells the misfortunes of Malvs Alfredo Landa  a farm hand sick of the shortages of his trade  who decides to become a bungling outlaw and hides in the shrubland under the alias Fendetestas  and who is joined by a kid as an apprentice  Fuco . As Malvis assaults and robs the people cross the lush wood . It also deals with Geraldo Fernando  Chato Valverde  a welldigger who lost a leg while whale hunting and is in love with Hermelinda Alejandra Grepi  who is leaving to the city fed up with her domineering  stingy aunt Juanita Encarna Paso  of the D'Abondo family  as the wealthy Sr. D'Abando who rents his mansion to two sisters Gloria Alicia Hermida and Amelia Amparo Bar  of the lost soul of Fiz De Cotobelo Miguel Relln  a spectre or ghoul who wants to go Cuba  being damned to follow the procession of spirits  and of the lords and ladies of the parish  there is also a witch Maria Isberts who gives advises  lucky charms and predicts future events  among other characters .The Enchanted Forest is a 1987 marvelous Spanish comedyfantasy film stunningly directed by Jos Luis Cuerda based on the eponymous novel written by Wenceslao Fernndez Flrez  with an enjoyable script by the prestigious Rafael Azcona . The flick is pretty well  though is marred by a direct sound and  being overlong  including lots of roles . The film has a large ensemble cast headed by the great Alfredo Landa who gives a topnotch performance as a botcher bandit . It was a critical success winning five Goya Awards including Best Film  Best Director and Best Actor  Alfredop Landa . Support cast is frankly extraordinary such as  Fernando Valverde as the worried cripple who attempts to declare his love to Hermelinda  Miguel Relln as Fiz De Cotovelo  Alicia Hermida as Gloria Roade  Amparo Bar as Amelia Roade  Fernando Rey as Sr. D'Abondo  Manuel Alexandre as Roque Freire  Encarna Paso as Juanita Arruallo  Mara Isbert as Moucha  Antonio Gomero as civil guard  Paca Gabaldn as Sra.

In addition  a spotless pictorial cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe and a willingness  almost perfect of the elements of each shot  every sequence  every space  being filmed on location in Sobrado dos Monxes A Corua Galicia Spain . Aguirresarobe subsequently would make a prestigious career in Hollywood such as Fright night  The twilight saga eclipse The road  The others and many others . Furthermore  a magic  evocative and sensitive score by Jos Nieto . El Bosque Animado English The enchanted forest was compellingly directed by Jos Luis Cuerda . Cuerda is a veteran professional  being his film debut Pares and Nones a typical Madrid comedy . He subsequently directed this El Bosque Animado also with script by notorious Rafael Azcona and based on Wenceslao Fernandez Florez's novel . In the nineties he followed directing failures as a drama titled Viuda De Capitan Contreras and more comedies as La Marrana and Tocando Fondo  a farce about the economic crisis . His greatest success corresponds as producer  as he produced hits for Alejandro Amenabar as Tesis and Abre Los Ojos among others . His highlyacclaimed and successful movie was Lengua De Mariposas  it has a rating as better than average and is a beautiful and powerful film . His most personal movies were two comedies with a peculiar and surrealist sense of humor  this Amanece Que no Es Poco and the following titled Asi en el Cielo Como en Tierra but in antireligion trending .".

	schema:headline " Smart funny and not for everyone";
	schema:reviewBody "From a study of the movie poster you might be tempted to think this is another pointless romantic movie about two lovers in France. Oui they will fight love eat croissants and find meaning. How drearily clich.But surprise of surprises Two Days in Paris is a very funny very soulful and very interesting look at a slice of the life of two quite interesting characters. On the surface Marion Julie Delpy and Jack Adam Goldberg are two irritatingly pretentious neurotics. Both 35 and childless they have been traveling Europe for 2 weeks deciding to stop in Paris for a couple days to drop in on Marion's family and friends before flying home to New York. Marion is French the child of leftwing French artists. Jack is a New Yorker a political lefty whose shallow grasp of culture he speaks only English for instance is purely American. She had aspirations to be a photographer though for reasons the film will make clear her work is strictly thirdclass. He takes pictures of everything but has no eye for form color or composition.What's fun about the film is the complexity of the relationships. To Jack's annoyance Marion keeps bumping into her old boyfriends. And her father seems intent on humiliating or offending him and his American tastes. A dinner scene in which he is offered a rabbit's head is just hilarious. When offered carrots he says So we're going to eat the bunny's food too? For her part Marion cannot understand why Jack finds her continued casual friendships with exes to be so extraordinary. And Jack utterly clueless about the nuances or even the surface content of Marion's conversations is getting paranoid that he is not being told everything. At one point Marion is holding a violent argument with a racist cabdriver. Jack knows something is going on but can't get past Marion's insistence that everything is fine.I realize as I write this that I am doing no justice to the joyful sense of voyeurism that the film affords.The film is so smartly written and fastpaced that sometimes you forget you are watching a film and think you are watching dinner with Julie's real family or attending parties with her smug and artsy friends. The film is completely convincing and has a depth of heart I didn't expect. It deal with secrets and the frustration that comes from knowing another person. The language and culture barriers then act as metaphors for the inability of two people even lovers to inhabit another's life and experience.Two Days in Paris is not for all. Marion and Jack are exemplars of the worst aspects of US and European artistic classes. Their treatment of a group of Americans on a Da Vinci Code tour tells you more than you want to know about the antagonisms between right and left. But their smug knowing put downs of Bush and Cheney supporters are less political messages by the movie makers than markers of the characters' personalities. This movie about liberals does not necessarily espouse their world view. But at heart this is a love story not a political drama. Secondly since we are talking about shallow artists there is an enormous amount of politicosexual art on display in the film. While this may be offensive to the audience its presence helps to define the characters themselves. It's not there to titillate the viewer but to describe the actors.Delpy who wrote directed produced and acted in the movie has made a master work that is complex evocative real and quite beautiful. She has captured aspects of the French national character that seem quite convincing. She has also aptly captured the emotions and dilemmas of 30something adults who under it all are still looking for meaning belonging and peace. Goldberg gave a powerful and hilarious performance. He's Ben Stiller with a soul.If you can put up with the film's politics you will be amply rewarded. Magnifique!".

Maybe that's why this has become one of my favorite films of all time. Watching Adam Goldberg deal with some of the same foreign travel problems and relationship issues that torture him throughout this movie.The movie is half in French. It is definitely to your advantage if you don't speak French because a key plot element is how Jack Adam Goldberg becomes so regularly frustrated by not understanding the language.In the end I think I loved this movie because it is one of the best love stories I've ever seen.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a somewhat romantic comedy about a frenchAmerican couple spending two turbulent days living with her parents in Paris.My expectations were fairly low when I was coerced into watching Julie Delpy's directorial debut. After the first couple of minutes and arguments between Delpy and Goldberg respectively I was still skeptical. But by the time her real life by the way parents were introduced things got really hysterical and I was holding my sides laughing throughout the rest of the movie. It has to be said that most of the jokes are sexual in nature so this is no film for the young or easily offended. There are also moments where Delpys character is a little annoying but those are thankfully far and few between. Similarly I approved the brevity of Daniel Brhls appearance. Special mention has to go to Adam Goldberg however whose antics lend the movie the lion's share of its funny moments  I certainly hope to see more of him in the future.".

She acts brilliantly as the title character in Tarantinoesque Killing Zo manages to stay convincing in the farfetched An American Werewolf in Paris and is great as a young lover in Before Sunrise and as a confident woman in the sequel Before Sunset. This brings us to 2 days in Paris which could easily be mistaken for a continuation of the SunriseSunset movies. And that would be a huge mistake 2 Days in Paris is a dialogue driven romantic comedy dissecting a couples quasidysfunctional relationships and how they have to come to terms with their individual imperfections to be able to truly coexist as a pair. Though that may not sound like compelling viewing its actually hugely entertaining as it dissects a million small mixups which can make or break a couple.Adam Goldberg is compelling as the sarcastic yet witty American boyfriend visiting Paris for the first time with his girlfriend. What follows is a series of hugely entertaining misunderstandings involving cross cultural differences hilarious conversations in broken French with family members and a series of unplanned rendezvous with former lovers all of which combine to drive him high up the paranoia ladder.It's refreshing to find out that not only does Julie Delpy act brilliantly as the naive and clumsy Marion but she also directed and wrote it heck she even composed the soundtrack.The lasting message of this movie is although you might hate 80 of the things your lover does if you just cant live without them don't lose them".

The two central performances and sharp script means the film flows along at a pretty fast pace with the one liners so frequent you could easily miss the odd one. The situations explored around relationships and family are universal and so easy for anyone to relate to there are misunderstood physical situations and language barriers which all add to the overall melodramacomedy unfolding on screen. The film is peppered with brilliant moments from the awkward to the bizarre and the laughs come thick and fast with Paris as a backdrop the lovers weave in and out of one situation to another always in love yet always on the verve of breakup. Costarring Delpy's real father as her in film father shows a sense of tightness and a labour of love that comes across in the finished product. Like a cross between something from Woody Allen and Amelie this film has a special naivety full of wonderment juxtaposed with the dark underbelly of life that is at times hard to escape. Whether you laugh or cry you can't fail to be moved by a film so simple in its execution of themes that can as displayed be so complicated. Delpy has made something she and everyone involved should be very very proud of.".

It is hard though for a nonFrench person to judge just how much of all this is meant to portray the character of the French if anything like that exists and how much is mere parody exploiting and playing with the clich that French people always think about love and sex. For example is Marion's father supposed to be a prototype or simply a caricature? Knowing this would be of great help in evaluating this movie.On the other hand the film is very balanced in its attempt to weigh Marion's delight in experiment against Jack's conservative rationalism with regard to relationships. In other respects of course Jack is not rational at all for example concerning his hypochondria. Whether one wants to call him touchy and easily offended will probably also depend on whether you think that in the first place he is being treated badly by all those slightly crazy Parisians or whether you would rather want to say that he is a bit stiff and inhibited.In any case this is a nice little film about the difficult task to lead a crossnational relationship and about the fact that thinking you know your partner is not the same as knowing her or his culture.But don't expect to see a romance like in Before Sunrise!!".

Judging by the fact that Delpy has thrown so much of herself in all aspects of creating the film she deserves my deepest respect. The problem is as much as her movie walks the same territory as Before the Sunrise and Before Sunset it takes place in Paris as the title suggests it is not as good as they were. The chemistry between two main characters the French Marion Delpy and New Yorker Jack Adam Goldberg is completely nonexistent the plot is very thin but it is not even the biggest problem. The film has no subtlety elegance wit or charm and if it does they are very well hidden. Yes few times Woody Allen's name came to my mind because Adam Goldberg seemed doing homage to Woody Allen's character neurotic unsecured and whining  and not particularly good one. He was mean often without the reason. The scene in the beginning of the movie when Jack gives the group of the Americans tourists the apparently wrong directions to Louver just because he is sure that they are conservative Bush supporters does not make him a white knight and it is just not funny. I also did not find charming Marion sending to her family via email the picture of naked Jack with the colorful balloons. I have nothing against pictures a la nude and from what I was able to notice Jack had nothing to be ashamed of but how about privacy and trust in the relationship? Whatever happens between two people in their intimacy should stay between them because it belongs to them only. How about simply asking a boyfriend if he would not mind his funny picture be sent to his girlfriend's family? Does sensitive intelligent feisty Marion ever think of it? I was so much in love and could not get enough of one afternoon in Paris few years back with Celene and Jesse. 77 minutes long Before Sunrise was so clever so romantic and so moving that it made me want to see another movie with French girl and her American love to find out what could've happened to them. Well little did I know that it would be 2 Days in Paris. It is sad for me to admit but Delpy's follow up to two of the most romantic modern screen observations of the relationships was a disappointment. I should mention that Delpy's movie has some positive sides to it. I liked how she showed HER Paris very real tough and not sentimental. I liked for the most parts her parents Albert Delpy and Marie Pillet in their roles. There is one scene that I enjoyed and every time I think of it it makes me smile. On their way to visit Jim Morrison's grave at Per Lashes Marion asks Jake Why do you want to see Jim Morrison's grave? You don't even like The Doors. And he answers It is a famous grave...I am a huge fan of Val Kilmer. Sadly all the bright points were not enough to save the movie  I never thought that two days in one of my favorite places in the world may be so unbearably long and disappointing.".

Julie Delpy's Marion often acts as the moral compass of the film despite turning a blind eye to acts of cruelty and vandalism. Adam Goldberg's Jack is immature selfish and whiny. In many ways Goldberg's performance reminded me of Woody Allen. In his day Allen seemed Avant Garde but for me the day of the neurotic self absorbed girly man is past and I found it most annoying.The highlight of the film were Marion's parents her father a cheerful man who eats rabbit heads key's poorly parked cars and hate Jim Morrison seemed like a great deal of fun. Then there's her mother former hippie who had an affair with Morrison hence the fathers distaste and was instrumental in the abortion movement now irons jeans.The film had other problems the introduction of a veggieterrorist burning down fast food restaurants seems out of place. Also there are scenes when Marion talks over the action giving us explanation using what appear to be chalk drawings on the screen. There were 2 such sequences which appeared fairly late in the film and only used twice it seemed out of place schizophrenic even. I'd have preferred they use this convention earlier and at least 3 times to generate that we're seeing this from Marion's point of view to come up where it did and only used twice made it feel incomplete. Similar conventions have been used in other films such as Ferris Bueller's Day Off where the title character often addresses the audience. Marion does narrate the film but initially does so as subtext rather than for the purpose of instruction.I suppose you might call this an art film it surely seemed like many of the films I saw in my film classes in college and it may take a certain high brow level of sophistication that I have not yet attained. On the other hand it could be just some self involved dribble so typical of films in the genre. Either way I'm glad it wasn't expensive to watch.".

As I read it it does not deliver on its promises it never develops the topics it seems to introduce and generally I didn't find the efforts at humor very funny. The film piles cultural clich and stereotype upon cultural clich and stereotype then presents this to the viewer as a comic slice of life. It seems to me that none of the topics the film addressesthe relationship between the woman and the man the cultural contrasts and relations between France and the U.S. or the questions about how women are treated in relationships developed via the mother and the emphasis on stupid male jealousy for ex.are ever developed in interesting or thoughtful ways.Ultimately is the film simply being marketed as a comedy for lack of a better generic niche or did Delpy actually think she was making a comedy? I confess I'm not sure about this.... My perception at least is that the film is less a comedy than a portrait of anxiety ignorance and ugliness in selfabsorbed yuppie types. It dramatizes sociallyprivileged people with very limited horizons adrift in a world they understand nothing about who are seemingly headed toward nothing but more of the same ignorance and smallmindedness. Everything is narcissistic petty unfulfilling repulsive etc. People who have any kind of ideas about a world outside of immediate selfconcern are complete crazies the antifast food fairy the idiotic soixanthuitard pseudoradical father and relationships are experienced on a basically adolescent level they're about little more than petty jealousy and guilty indulgences with no purpose beyond selfgratification. The only commentary beyond selfindulgence the film seems not to ironize is the Delpy character's anger at the stereotypically racist and sexist taxidrivers but here again this basically affirms the righteous yuppie over against the nasty cabdrivers and ultimately our heroine seems more concerned about her body image than about any of that....Plus the bargainbasement stereotypes of what is American and even more surprisingly of what is French for me at least were exasperating and tiresome.

True love comes about by knowing one another with honesty and acceptance.The film has a slice of life story line. There is actually no definite beginning or end. It was more a segment of living by two young people trying to relate to each other. Since it was a slice of life story line I was not able to anticipate when the movie would end. However I accepted the movie's ending when it did happen.I recommend this movie to anyone who wants insights on how to have a spiritual and nonjudgemental relationship with another person. It is the kind of truth that one discovers in AA and other twelvestep programs.2 Days In Paris is not dull or boring.

	schema:headline " About a relationship and... well... that's about it";
	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes you see and movie and think 'It's a shame that it doesn't get the wider audience it deserves...' Well that's absolutely not the case with this film. I saw it an hour ago and am still wondering why anybody would spend any money or effort making something as vacuous as this. To begin with the plot is rather flimsy boyfriend American and girlfriend goldenhaired Frenchwoman are together for two years start to get bored of their relationship and thus decide to travel to Italy and visit the girl's parents in Paris. They roam around in the City of Love and meet some weird people including a couple of former boyfriends of girlfriend. Jealousy conflict long dialogs. Oh and before you start to get excited about dramatic endings in the end they cry and decide to stay together despite their difficulties. Life as we all know it in other words. Let's be honest even I experienced more exiting things during the last two days and I am a very boring person according to some of my friends.Everyday boring events as a movie topic do not necessarily lead to boring movies at least not when the director manages to present these events in an interesting way. Think of Altman's Short Cuts. Or Lynch's The Straight Story. Unfortunately the plot of 2 days in Paris as a whole is... well how could you describe it... unexciting. Things you learned in cinematography 101. The general story is as I said above so straightforward that you could forget it exists at all. Plot turns are either trivial or contrived the characters almost reduced to stereotypesand although Paris is an exciting city architecturally the makers systematically selected the blandest of settings. Visual narrative devices well mainly the intercutting of some photographs are used in a way that will make you firmly believe that the director tried to make a cheap parody of good French cinema of the last five years. Or just copied some of the more inexpensive tricks. The cinematography in general is so basic that you will probably agree with me when I say that your 13 year old niece can make a movie like this with a bit of help from her dad. Actually even if you don't have a 13 year old niece she will do a better job.Even this would not make a bad movie if only the actors would set down some decent performances. In 2 days in Paris however Julie Delpy girlfriend Adam Goldberg boyfriend and most of the other actors are prone to overacting and hide their lack of skill or enthusiasm behind a lot of cheap yelling and blustering and gesticulating and contrived facial expressions. To express it concisely they are all quite bloody awful. And I won't waste any words on the female voiceover that from time to time randomly pops to pretend in vain psychological depth. Think Bgrade soft porn.But even with the above all being true this film could still have been saved. Some movies are so bad that they actually get funny. However the makers carefully avoided even this and created such a mediocre and bland story portraying the uninteresting lives of boring characters played by boring actors in such a mediocre fashion that one cannot but wonder whether these people really intended to make a film or were just shooting up some leftover reels because they were desperate to spend all their government subsidies before the Ministry of Culture would reclaim the money.Please do not waste any money on seeing this movie. If you got the tickets for free you might consider a trip to the cinema but you could also do something more useful and interesting like picking your nose or cleaning the toilet...".

I could not believe that there was anyway in which these two characters would have ever been in a relationship. Neither main character is remotely likable. To compensate the writer has filled the rest of the screenplay with stereotypical or should that be mono typicalcharacters.

Yes.. it is pathetic to think that she would waste peoples time on this horrible film.. my mother a fellow artist fell asleep half way thru. and she lived in Europe.This film is so stereotypical of both American and French that it just leaves you feeling like this actress is so self absorbed that she cant even tell what is comedy and what is garbage. I give my praise to Goldberg for putting up with his role and this piece of trash she put out that says it all when she goes off on her ex of 7 years in the restaurant... that moment says it all. The movie is about her moments in real life or who really cares...but surely there are so many other stories to be told out there that actually are interesting and entertaining that it makes one wonder  who the f..k put the money up for this ??? And i truly cant understand how anyone could compare this movie to Woody Allen but maybe just maybe there are more people willing to put up their votes on here to make this movie not even worth being watched for free.i rate it a 3 and that is for the scenery of Paris and bashing the pro bush folks and nice directing but once again.. it is the script that mandates the true flow of any film.".

These weapons have the capability of wiping out most of the Eastern and Southern United States in minutes if they become operational. President John F. Kennedy and his advisors must come up with a plan of action against the Soviets. Kennedy is determined to show that he is strong enough to stand up to the threat and the Pentagon advises U.S. military strikes against Cubawhich could lead the way to another U.S. invasion of the island. However Kennedy is reluctant to follow through because a U.S. invasion could cause the Soviets to retaliate in Europe. A nuclear showdown appears to be almost inevitable. Can it be prevented?";

	schema:headline " Thrilling Examination Of A Tense Moment In History";
	schema:reviewBody "The fact of JFK's assassination and especially the highly mysterious circumstances surrounding it has resulted in a very distinct historical niche being carved around him.  However the majority of written examinations have concerned his assassination.  The man's presidency short though it was was fraught with fascinating events and both in literature and in film they remain frustratingly underexamined.  Which is why Thirteen Days is such a treat.What the film essentially does is offer us a clearly partlyfictionalised but fairly true to the events account of the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.  It's a fascinating closeup on a fascinating man who might have been a truly great president if he had gotten a proper chance.  Of course the filmic portrayal of JFK may be just a tad overly sympathetic and the treatment of the military a tad overly harsh and the importance of Kenny O'Donnell played by Kevin Costner is probably exaggerated but these are minor quibbles.  What this film really does is show us just how complicated and multifaceted was the problem of Russian nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba.  Not only did the president have to face the dim and distant threat of a faceless Russian bureaucracy he had to deal with the multiple and conflicting options constantly being advanced to him the dangers posed by certain special interests in military and intelligence and the popular opinion of the American people.  The repercussions of any number of different courses of action were almost unthinkable.  Tilting the hand seemingly in the American favour in one place say in Cuba would destabilise another danger zone such as Berlin. Despite the fact that we all know how the events played out in the end it can't be denied that this film keeps adding to the tension constantly occasionally letting off a little and then piling on a whole lot more.  It's a wonderful portrayal.At its core however the film is an intelligent study of the ultimately paralysing effects of power and the stark horror of mutual destruction as made possible by the harnessing of atomic power.  The discovery of nuclear fission reactions has forever changed the face of warfare because there now exists an ultimate solution so terrible it is almost beyond contemplation. In the comparatively safer times in which we now live it is easy to forget how possible perhaps even likely the threat of nuclear war.  America was then and remains now the most powerful nation on the planet and yet a single wrong move could have ended all that and at the cost of millions of innocent lives.  Bearing the weight of decisions which could cost so much must have been a horrible burden to Kennedy and if nothing else we should thank our lucky stars that he didn't buckle under the multifarious pressures placed on him.  This film is a tribute to reason over hotheadedness and peace over war.  We should not forget the lessons that time has to impart and if this represents a way to remember then everyone ought to watch it.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1962 the world stood on the brink of World War III for Thirteen Days a 2000 film starring Kevin Costner Bruce Greenwood Steven Culp and Dylan Baker with direction by Roger Donaldson. The story concerns the Cuban Missile Crisis when the U.S. discovered that the Soviets had placed missiles aimed at the U.S. in Cuba.As someone who remembers the situation well watching this was a profound experience in more ways than one. A good deal of dialogue was taken from actual Presidential transcripts which made watching it even more impressive. Looking at it from today's eyes Thirteen Days is a knockout.Donaldson focuses the film right where it should be  in the White House and in conference rooms giving us only the subplot of Kenny O'Donnell's family life. For those posters who commented that O'Donnell was perhaps not a real person yes he was. It's impossible for me to believe that with a film that goes into so much detail and strove to be so factual someone thought there was a madeup character. Try Google next time. Ken O'Donnell headed up Kennedy's presidential campaign and was appointed his Special Assistant when Kennedy won the White House. He was the most powerful of the President's advisers.Several things become clear about the goingson at the White House in 1962 None of the military leaders thought the Kennedy administration belonged in the White House if it had been up to the military leaders the situation would have caused World War III JFK turned himself into a pretzel in order to pursue a diplomatic solution to the potential conflict. Though discouraged almost at every turn JFK still would not allow the shooting to begin pushing instead for an embargo against Cuba.There is plenty of tension and excitement in this film. One of the best scenes is Commander Eckerd Christopher Lawford and his team lowflying over Cuba taking photos and a U2 pilot trying to avoid missiles chasing him. But most of the tension and excitement takes place in the meetings as the President and RFK struggle for answers and play for time. The mix is therefore ideal drama some aerial excitement and a little humor as Adlai Stevenson gets the better of the Russians in an OAS meeting.There's also a look at the reaction of the country  also very accurate. Yes people piled into church cleared the grocery shelves of everything and stocked fallout shelters. We all watched the President on television. In fact as he talked my mother thought he was about to declare war. It was a terrifying time.Kenny O'Donnell's role in all of this may have been somewhat exaggerated to make it a palatable role for Kevin Costner. Costner does okay in the part. Boston accents are very difficult to do without them sounding put on. It's very difficult to do accents in general and make them organic to the character. A few have succeeded Anne Bancroft in The Miracle Worker Paul Newman in Somebody Up There Likes Me little Natalie Wood in Tomorrow is Forever Travolta in Saturday Night Fever and of course there are others. Jane Seymour and Joan Collins can easily pull off being Americans. All British actors can do a southern accent since the southern accent started off as a British accent. Costner lays it on too thick and it's a distraction. But he certainly isn't bad in the role.The casting people merely wanted to suggest JFK and RFK. In Steven Culp they found a young actor with similar features to RFK. He does an effective job given that it's tough going to portray such a famous person. The most successful in the film is Bruce Greenwood as JFK who tries to keep the accent from overpowering the dialogue. In the President's television speech I'm sure he imitated JFK's every single inflection and pause and it's perfect. His JFK is a listener very dependent on his brother's advice and one who takes the burdens of the country on his shoulders like a cross. One of the posters here mentioned something to the effect that we are led to believe that JFK leaned heavily on his advisors as if this is a negative. Of course he did. Of course any President does or should. The final decisions belonged to him and he had to be sure of all of the ramifications. Only an idiot doesn't hear every single opinion of value before he decides to launch World War III.The camaraderie between RFK JFK and O'Donnell is as unmistakable as their arguments and frustrations.Thirteen months after the Cuban Missile Crisis JFK would be dead and O'Donnell would be riding behind him in the Secret Service Car. After a particularly tough meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff O'Donnell insists that JFK sit for a minute and JFK finally does. Worn out and not sleeping well he laments about being President. I just thought there would be more good days. In the end we  and he  would have settled for just MORE days.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shown through the eyes of presidential aide Kenneth P. O'Donnell Kevin Costner we see the inner workings of President John F. Kennedy Bruce Greenwood and his closest advisors as they try and find the best way to end a potentially devastating showdown with the U.S.S.R. In October of 1962 the U.S. during a regular mission photographing Cuba spotted a missile buildup by the Russians. The missiles were powerful enough to kill 80 million Americans with only 5 minutes of warning time. President Kennedy had to decide quickly what action to take. With his trusted aide Kenny O'Donnell and his brother Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy Steven Culp and others such as Robert McNamara Adlai Stevenson McGeorge Bundy Dean Acheson Dean Rusk and many more Kennedy needed to figure out the best course of action. If he allowed the Russians to aim these missiles at the U.S. the United States would be placed in a potentially deadly situation. If Kennedy allowed the military to attack the missiles and destroy them what would Russia do as a response? If he waited too long would Russia simply attack the U.S.? If he backed down and agreed to take down U.S. missiles in Turkey would the U.S. then look weak to the rest of the world? For such a young President Kennedy had a lot of tough decisions to make in a short amount of time with the world hanging in the balance. I wasn't alive during the Cuban Missile Crisis as it occurred so seeing Thirteen Days was like having a history lesson at the same time as having great entertainment. Even though I knew that we didn't end up in World War III there were a lot of things I didn't know. I won't go into any of the specifics but I never fully understood how close we came to destroying the planet. The tensions of the time were brought out successfully by director Roger Donaldson. You could see and feel the sweat on all the major players as each minute ticked by. Bruce Greenwood did a tremendous job as the young President Kennedy showing how Kennedy was strong enough to stand by his morals and values even as his most trusted advisors were urging him to go to war. At the same time Greenwood was able to portray Kennedy as someone who needed help and was able to turn to his brother for guidance. Kevin Costner did a good job as Kennedy's presidential aide. I especially liked his boston accent.  Costner was a strong personality that worked well with Greenwood and Steven Culp. I believed that the three of them were friends for 15 years and that they trusted each other with their own lives. Other acting standouts to me were Dylan Baker as Robert McNamara and Michael Fairman as Adlai Stevenson. Even running at almost two and a half hours I was always at the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. Like I said before I wasn't even born yet nor was it something I ever learned about in school so I had no idea what was going to happen. It was nice being able to get deep inside the mind of these important people during this crucial time. Of course I have no idea if what was said during these meetings was actually said in real life but I'd like to believe that at least the outcomes of the meetings were true. I'm a big fan of these kinds of dramatic films based on real life events. While being entertaining they also have the ability to teach you about history. Reading about these situations in books isn't nearly as enjoyable as being able to watch them on screen. I think screenwriter David Self did a great job of bringing these real life events to life on the big screen. He made it historical but didn't bore you with too much talk or information. Along with Donaldson he gave you what you needed to know and let the actors bring you into the action.So overall I thought Thirteen Days was a great film. Well acted well directed well written nice musical score and very entertaining throughout. And if you happen to learn something along the way like I did then even better.".

	schema:headline " Almost the end of civilization as we know it.";
	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie today with a number of students from my International Politics class and from the standpoint of a politics professor this film was absolutely extraordinary. This is a movie about the development of foreign policy in a crisis it spells out with brilliant detail the decisionmaking process of JFK's inner circle the tension between the Executive Office of the President and the Departments of State and Defense and the attempts by the Military Industrial Complex namely the Joint Chiefs to undermine the diplomatic approaches favored by the president. It highlights the conflict between military standard operating procedures rules of engagement and the better judgmentcommon sense of rightthinking human beings. It hints at conspiracies to later depose and otherwise get rid of both Kennedy and Khruschev from within for what turned out to be a very unpopular resolution with the hardliners on both sides. I especially like that the movie acknowledged the humanity of the individual decisionmakers without getting too Capraesquire or preachy.I can see why this film hasn't been a great commercial success. It is not your standard big studio fare. It's quite cerebral and although it has some exciting preconflict scenes it's not a war film. It reminds me a bit of Three Kings in that regard both films were in my opinion mismarketed. They both seemed to target the younger male action crowd when both movies are really made for a more intellectual audience. I liked how the Soviets were not cartoonishly vilified as is common in a lot of Cold War era films. They were shown to be somewhat calculating and strategic but not irrational or more importantly inhuman. In fact one of the most fascinating parts of the film is the revelation that both sides lack information as to the other side's true intentions. It was this uncertainty that back in October 1962 could have led to the end of civilization as we know it.The acting was solid Steven Culp was very very good as Robert Kennedy so good in fact that I'm afraid he'll have a hard time getting cast in the future. There was audible gasp in the audience when he came on the screen and WAS Bobby. Coaster's accent was actually annoying as an earlier reviewer noted but it's forgivable in light of the moving somewhat understated performance he turns in. It is the directing that takes the cake however. From the moment the chain of events was set in motion the tension does NOT let up. It actually feels like you are back in 1962 living through the events of those two weeks honestly there was nary a moment to relax until the resolution was wrought. I recommend this film especially strongly to high school and college age students who are too young to have any Cold War memory as well as to those who lived through the era and may have forgotten what it felt like to come this close.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an outstanding retelling of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The weakest part of the movie of course is Kevin Costner who wisely cast himself in the part of presidential assistant Kenny O'Donnell rather than take on the JFK role. In order to give Costner a lot to do they make Kenny O'Donnell out to be a sort of behindthescenes kingmaker rather than the office gofer that he probably really was. But it was a clever device to get the audience into the inner workings of the Kennedy White House without making JFK or RFK the lead character. The scenes that work best are when O'Donnell is the flyonthewall sitting in at Cabinet meetings and meetings with the Joint Chiefs and letting the real decisionmakers and advisers talk.Much of the real JFK Cabinet discussions were recorded or transcribed for history and so I'm sure that much of the dialog for those scenes is what the principals really said. The movie is a tremendous look at crisis management and decisionmaking under extreme pressure.The military leaders are made out to be the semivillains in this movie pushing JFK to attack Cuba and launch WWIII and at some points seeming to even disobey or skirt his orders. When watching the movie I kept remembering that JFK was the youngest man ever elected president and that he was only 45 yrs old when this happened. Most of his Cabinet and all of the Joint Chiefs were much older than him and that tension comes across as the older men seem to barely be able to hold back their condescending attitudes towards the young president.With the exception of Costner the acting in this movie is first rate and Bruce Greenwood as JFK was certainly deserving of Oscar consideration. It is always hard for an actor to play a historical figure like JFK who is more legend now than man. Greenwood wisely does not try to mimic JFK's accent but he does get inside the character and you can see JFK thinking his way through the crisis with nothing less than future of the entire human race riding on his decisions. Steven Culp was outstanding as well as RFK perfectly mimicking RFK's mannerisms and way of speaking but again getting inside the character so we can really see the man rather than just an impersonation. The success of the entire movie depending on Greenwood and Culp nailing their parts and they did so terrifically.Viewers might be interested in finding a copy of Missiles of October which was a TVmovie in the 1970s and done much like a stage play. William Devane played JFK and Martin Sheen RFK. The movie also gave much screen time to the Kruschev character.".

	schema:reviewBody "Basically this movie is a great history lesson. If you want to know more about the cold war and the Cuba missile crisis in particular this is a perfect medium for you to start with. The movie is quite detailed and accurate even though of course some moments and characters have been 'overdramatized' for the good of the movie and its flow and emotions.Even though you already know from start till finish how this movie is going to end it still is a tense movie to watch. The story is build up well and makes the movie really interesting and compelling to follow. It perfectly captures the tension of the whole crisis and really makes you realize how close the world actually came to a WW III. It makes us aware of the fact that those 13 days in history should always be remembered and used as a lesson for the entire world now and forever. It's too bad that the movie becomes a bit too moralistic at times especially toward the ending.Bruce Greenwood doesn't really look like JFK but he's a good actor so he becomes believable enough in his role trough his acting skills. Steven Culp really does look like Robert Kennedy and on top of that he also is a great actor. I wasn't always happy with Kevin Costner performance but overall he did an acceptable job. There are some weaker moments which involves his character but I more blame those moments to the at times too moralistic written script.A bit of a disappointing aspect of the whole movie is its style. Roger Donaldson at times tries to be overartistic and mixes the movie with black  white and color images. Perhaps he tried to copy Oliver Stone's style? Who knows. The cinematography was also disappointingly standard but thankfully the good editing saved this a little. Also the musical score by Trevor Jones is surprisingly solid.Overall it's a very good political movie that has some great tense and important moments in it and also works great as a history lesson.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis seen through the eyes of President assistant Kenny O'Donnell Kevin Costner who hands perfectly the role as trusted confidante and with significance importance of Robert Kennedy  Steven Culp who bears remarkable resemblance and of course President John F . Kennedy  a solid Bruce Greenwood  . This interesting film widely develops the Cuban Missile Crisis that was a confrontation between the Soviet Union Cuba and the United States in October 1962 during the Cold War. The picture is packed with suspense  drama  historical deeds and is quite entertaining . It's correctly based on facts and the few sacrifices of accuracy are realized in the sense of of dramatic license . The motion picture is very well directed by Roger Donaldson who formerly worked with Costner in another suspenseful movie and also plenty of political intrigue titled No way out 87  .Adding more details over the widely depicted on the movie the events happened of the following manner  In September 1962 the Cuban and Soviet governments began to surreptitiously build bases in Cuba for a number of medium and intermediaterange ballistic nuclear missiles MRBMs and IRBMs with the ability to strike most of the continental United States. This action was subsequent to the 1958 deployment of Thor IRBMs in the UK and Jupiter IRBMs to Italy and Turkey in 1961 more than 100 U.S.built missiles having the capability to strike Moscow with nuclear warheads. On October 14 1962 a United States U2 photoreconnaissance plane captured photographic proof of Soviet missile bases under construction in Cuba.The ensuing crisis ranks with the Berlin Blockade as one of the major confrontations of the Cold War and is generally regarded as the moment in which the Cold War came closest to turning into a nuclear conflict .The US President  Bruce Greenwood  Attorney General Robert Kennedy Steven Culp State Secretary Robert McNamara  Dylan Baker  and his military staff  Bill Smitrovich  Ed Lauter  James Karen  Len Cariou and general Curtis LeMay Kevin Conway  considered attacking Cuba via air and sea and settled on a quarantine of Cuba. The U.S. announced that it would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba and demanded that the Soviets dismantle the missile bases already under construction or completed in Cuba and remove all offensive weapons. The Kennedy administration held a slim hope that the Kremlin would agree to their demands and expected a military confrontation. On the Soviet end Nikita Khrushchev wrote Kennedy that his quarantine of navigation in international waters and air space to constitute an act of aggression propelling humankind into the abyss of a world nuclearmissile war. Fidel Castro encouraged Khrushchev to launch a preemptive firststrike nuclear attack on the U.S. The Soviets publicly balked at the U.S. demands but in secret backchannel communications initiated a proposal to resolve the crisis. The confrontation ended on October 28 1962 when President John F. Kennedy and United Nations SecretaryGeneral U Thant reached an agreement with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to dismantle the offensive weapons and return them to the Soviet Union subject to United Nations verification in exchange for an agreement by the United States to never invade Cuba. The Soviets removed the missile systems and their support equipment loading them onto eight Soviet ships from November 59. A month later on December 5 and 6 the Soviet IL28 bombers were loaded onto three Soviet ships and shipped back to Russia. The quarantine was formally ended previously on November 20 1962. As a secret part of the agreement all USbuilt Thor and Jupiter IRBMs deployed in Europe were deactivated by September 1963.The Cuban Missile Crisis spurred the creation of the Hotline Agreement and the MoscowWashington hot line a direct communications link between Moscow and Washington .".

I was immediately sucked in and in fact the only time reality came back to me during the entire movie was when my friend who'd fallen asleep  suddenly jumped up wide awake at the roar of the jets... When the movie let out everyone was yawning and stretching and in some way or another complaining.Not me I was pumped up and ready to go talk about it to someone I didn't care who for hours and hours. Who cares if it was 'thirteen days long' or if Kevin Costner's accent was a little annoying? Admit it the movie was about as good as movie's get. The acting was perfect I believe Bruce Greenwood should at least get a Best Actor nomination possibly Culp too for Supporting Actor and the script... man did somebody put some time into that script! Not only was it historically accurate to the best of my knowledge anyway but it was heartwarming and witty and was full of those great lines that people will memorize and repeat over and over for many years to come. My favorite part however is just a shot of Kevin Costner coming home. He gets out of his car and instead of going inside his house he turns and looks at his street his neighborhood his world... I hate saying more than I should but if you've seen the movie you know what I'm talking about. The emotion that is shown in that scene... it gives me chills just thinking about it.This film is intelligent and beautiful and 'powerful.' Believe me if you see this movie you'll not soon forget it...".

This is a movie not to be missed.The President's Special Assistant Kenny O'Donnell aka Kevin Costner tells the story.

Your heart pours out for the insiders who knew how close the world came to the brink.  Then please join me in becoming a little cynical about the government's world safety' report veracity going forward.  Thirteen Days shows you why the government the press and the people need to be in constant check and balance to be effective.A football metaphor weaves effectively through the film though the teams are cliquish at best.

In a crisis loyalty and teamwork to America's quarterback JFK is the prescription for sanity.  War zealots surround and abound.  Someone needs the cooler head  to be the wiser man  in a world where warfare is being redefined with weapons of annihilation.Minutia  There's always something for a fanatic like me.  I spotted a bowl of Post's fruity Pebbles cereal at the O'Donnell breakfast table in the closing minutes.  I don't think these had been invented yet.  The thing is If I have to dig that deep' to find flaws with the film's presentation quality it's a pretty darned good.  I am sure there are historical flaws but this is close enough for government work.I'm still nave but no longer 11 years old.  Movies have to be well made  well told to satisfy.  An entertainment adventure you will enjoy no matter your age gender race religion or political persuasions.  It rates 9 out of 10 possible points.

One thing is certain America was enormously fortunate to have had as President of the United States John F. Kennedy Bruce Greenwood during those nearly fatal 13 Days. As the thinking man's president Mr. Kennedy was lucky to have in his cabinet men of intellect and reason. His main confident was his younger brother Robert Kennedy Steven Culp who proved invaluable as Attorney General. When the world learned of the Nuclear threat ninety miles away Kennedy came to rely heavily on his political adviser Kenny O'Donald Kevin Costner who displayed cautious insight and prudent judgment in critical moments which could have proved disastrous had the Joint Chiefs of Staff gotten their way. Further Kennedy was definitely fortunate to have selected as his ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson Michael Fairman who stood toe to toe with Russian's Valerian Zorin Oleg Vidov and did not back down. The film is dramatic and terrifyingly accurate with dated Black and White footage and actual verbal scripts from hidden recordings from the oval office. What we know today is had the Administration followed the prodding of the military they would have initiated the Third World War as the Russian military in Cuba actually had short range Atomic warheads at their disposal. This is a frightening film for rational people. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Having lived through the Cuban missile crisis and seen my teachers being called back into service I found this movie to be extremely realistic. It's amazing the similarity of the actors to the real people particularly Bobby Kennedy and McNamara. The underlying tension and the restrained acting reminded me of the movie Seven Days in May. The Portrayal of John F. Kennedy was remarkable in so far as one doesn't even notice that his physical appearance is off. His mannerisms and acting portrayed John F. Kennedy so well that he blends into the character perfectly. The tension exhibited by the actors in this movie reflects accurately the tension the nation felt during those awful days when we had to practice atomic bomb drills in school. Kevin Costner's portrayal of Kenny O'Donnell seemed right on the mark as did the actor who portrayed Adli Stevenson. Those scenes which took place the United Nations were particularly moving sadly they have not been repeated in present times. If only Colin Powell could have made such an impact with the UN perhaps the war in Iraq would have been unnecessary.".

	schema:reviewBody "Poor Kevin Costner. I get the feeling that he just can't win no matter what he does. He gets slammed for being in films and not using an appropriate accent. Need we look any further than 'Robin Hood Prince of Thieves'? When he does use an accurate accent as he does in 'Thirteen Days' he gets slammed for trying to elevate his game to a playing field dominated by more well liked method actors. I've heard an argument before that he should just stick to making westerns since allegedly they're the only films that he does well. Many would immediately argue that 'Wyatt Earp' cancels out 'Dances With Wolves.' I argue instead that people are just too hard on Kevin Costner and 'Thirteen Days' is a very good example of why he deserves a bit of a break.'Thirteen Days' was the fastest two and a half hours that I've sat through in a long time. The film was absolutely engrossing and very tense. Everyone knows what happens or should be able to infer it since we'd all be dead right now if things hadn't worked out so well but the writing and direction deserve great credit. They were able to transfer the tension from the historical situation and bring it to the screen with electricity. I think it works brilliantly well for two main reasons 1. The viewer may know what is going to happen but the characters don't. They are stressed terrified and at the breaking point. One wrong move and the whole world is obliterated. If that isn't good drama I don't know what is. 2. The film makers very wisely resisted the impulse to try and show things from the Soviet point of view. The strength of the film is the peril of the situation and the terror of not knowing what the other guy is trying to do. By filming from solely an American perspective and keeping both the characters and audience in the dark this character driven movie excels.A second brilliant strategy employed by the film makers was in the casting. With the exception of Costner there are no real stars. Instead there are more reliable hardworking and chameleonlike character actors. Len Cariou Dylan Baker Stephen Culp and Bruce Greenwood are just a small sampling. Greenwood plays JFK and excellently plays a man desperate for peace but surrounded by calls for swift military action. He sees the bigger picture where others don't but may not be able to navigate the smaller picture without help. Dylan Baker is a doppelganger and his performance as McNamara is spot on.Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is truly amazing the amount of tension Roger Donaldson manages to wring out of this 40 year old story of the Cuban Missile Crisis even though we already know the ending. In the theaters this film was my choice for picture of the year for 2000 and on several top ten lists. Now on video even at second viewer it remains awesome in its power to capture the moment when the world almost ended. Long time Aussie transplant Donaldson reteams with the leading man in his 1987 hit No Way Out Kevin Costner  who also serves as coproducer to deliver one of the best build political true to life thrillers of all time. The film won several second tier nominations and picked up awards for editing and its peace content from the Political Film society no less plus an award for the man who is the real star of the film Costner's broad as a baked bean Baaaaawstin accent aside. Canadian Bruce Greenwood is riveting powerful and fascinating as the man of the hour John F. Kennedy a president with the fate of the world on his hands and a cabinet full of warhawks anxious to pull the trigger on their rack full of Abombs once the Soviets started planting nukes in Cuba. Greenwood eerily channels JFK onto the screen both sounding and looking astonishingly like the 1962 Kennedy and Steven Culp as RFK is an equally impressive mimic.  At first it is almost impossible to focus on the action whenever Greenwood is on the screen the impersonation is that uncanny. Many people including Entertainment Weekly championed Greenwood for lead andor supporting Oscar nods and were surprised when he was left out.  But the success of the film is more a casting stunt. David Self's script skillfully converts anecdotes into actions and converts the sprawling events of 13 of the most documented days in world history into a comprehensible two and a half hour narrative flow. Donaldson and editor Conrad Buff who picked up a Golden Satellite Award for his work here work all the angles mixing film stocks jump and dissolve cuts rapid fire editing during high tension scenes and a cute trick of fading from black and white to color during a scene which along with the photorealism images of Greenwood and Culp often leave the viewer wondering if they're watching a movie or a newsreel real tape of Kennedy speaking is mixed in so skillfully you can't always tell whether it's Greenwood or Kennedy speaking.  Donaldson does not take the potential of thermal nuclear annihilation lightly and neither does his film. With frequent legitimate shots of blossoming mushroom clouds they blew up an awful lot of nukes in those days Donaldson constantly reminds us what the stakes were when the cold war heated up to a near inferno and our two nations stood eyeball to eyeball hoping someone would have sense enough to blink.".

	schema:reviewBody "Thirteen Days is a gripping intelligent moving political thriller of the kind which is all too rarely made in the US any more.You may be thinking Do I want to watch this? How can I get involved in the plot? After all we all know how the Cuban missile crisis ended  neither Kennedy nor Krushchev dropped the bomb. That's what I thought. I thought a movie whose suspense hinges on whether or not the bomb will be dropped would bore me given that I know how events turned out.The movie is well made though and I was gripped by it from the first scene. I really was on the edge of my seat.So yes even though these are historical events the film is highly suspenseful.It has more to offer than suspense though something very important in these waning days of George Bush Jr.'s second administration.The film depicts the most powerful men in the world struggling NOT to flex their power.They have the bomb  and they don't want to drop it. They have evidence that America's arch enemy the Soviet Union has weapons of mass destruction a few miles off America's shores in Cuba  and they don't want to invade Cuba and overthrow Castro.They could bomb the missile sites in Cuba but they don't want to because they know that that would turn world opinion against the US.They stayed up late at night worrying about any American fighting men whose lives their actions might imperil. They stayed up late at night worrying about any innocent civilians in Cuba who might be collateral damage.You get the picture. These men are depicted as the opposites of George Bush Donald Rumsfeld Dick Cheney et al who wanted to use America's power to destroy world opinion and casualties be damned.Every scene in this movie is an education in how power can be used to restrain itself.Too there is a behind the scenes look at how advisers the joint chiefs of staff and cabinet secretaries jockey for position and work by hook or by crook to advance their point of view. There are a couple of really interesting screaming matches.There are similar hints at what was going on in the Kremlin at this same time. There are spies and counter spies and analysts trying to figure out who is in charge in Russia by for example analyzing letters the White House is receiving  did Krushchev write these letters? Or has there been a coup? The film is full of eye candy. There is archival film footage of aircraft carriers submarines missiles rockets planes ... if you are an ordnance nut this is the film for you. There are of course recreations of all those hot fashions the skinny ties and pastel dresses men and women wore in those days.The cast is great. Bruce Greenwood and Steven Kulp look a bit like JFK and RFK but don't have their charisma. Who does? Dylan Baker is especially good as Robert McNamara. Kevin Costner is Kevin Costner which for those of us who like Kevin Costner is a good thing. His accent is a bit wobbly but I forgot about it after a while I was so involved with the movie.At the end of the movie one of the very powerful men whose work we have been following breaks down in tears. I did as well appreciating how much this movie stimulated me to think and moved me as well.Strongly recommended.".

I truly believe that no other two week period in the past half century has had as much societal effect.I was in 10th grade in the Norfolk Virginia area during this period. Our high school and homes were opened to the navy dependents evacuated from Gitmo. Their dads and ours were the eyeballs and fists employed in this enterprise. We were certain we would all die. We traveled with money and medical records sewn into our clothes in the event that we were instantly orphaned and survived in some horrible state.So much came out of what was distilled in this event. The hippy movement both the peace part and the reckless drug part. The U2s flew out of Area 51' and the military's obfuscating cover stories deliberately spawned a UFO culture that is still with us. So odd a militarily manufactured counterculture.The strong desire to hit the Soviets was pushed back twice! by Kennedy's levelheadedness. But the military was later able to flummox Johnson into Vietnam. Lemay had been pushing a first strike for 14 years by then and had actually arranged to steal bombs from Sandia in 1950. That is why today the weapons are under Department of Energy control supposed civilians.The point is that the story is so central to our modern existence as people that it has a rich mine to exploit  and it does so very effectively. Watching this one wonders first how we could have lost these two. And more to the point how we could produce our current President Gomer. How do you think he will deal with situations like this?

Which ended in 1959 and in turn in 1960 O'Donnell was the organizer and director of John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign schedule. The following year he became Kennedy's special assistant. SO Kevin Costner's role as Kenny O'Donnell is clearly a true role and you are quite incorrect in trying to tell people it was made up. i agree Hollywood added its personal touches which makes it a blockbuster film however the depiction of actual events and problems are quite accurate. the movie is excellent for educating about the Cuban Missile Crisis with few if any incorrect historical facts.".

	schema:reviewBody "As one with a long held interest in the life and times of JFK I had high hopes for this film. I am pleased to say I was not let down in any way. Thirteen Days is easily the best historical and political thriller to come about in a long time.The film of course centers around the events of the two weeks Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Through the eyes of Presidential aid Kenny O'Donnell JFK himself and Bobby Kennedy it takes us through the Crisis from the moment the Missiles were spotted. It's real eyeopener because you can't believe how close we came to war.Although Kevin Costner has received some flak for his New England accent I have to say that anyone who focuses in on trivial matters like that is missing the point of the film. O'Donnell serves as guide through the world of JFK and ExComm. Costner's portrayal is a perfect mix of business like and friendship. Through his eyes we see the intimate workings of government and learn a thing or two about loyalties.Personally though I think the movie belongs to Bruce Greenwood as JFK and Steven Culp as RFK. Greenwood as the put upon President is excellent. He looks the part handsome and yet all business and his accent is superb. He has Kennedy's various mannerisms and his habits of leaning a lot and sitting awkwardly to a tee. His JFK is shown as both a powerful leader and yet a vulnerable exhausted and sick man.He carries the part like a true professional and I have yet to see a better Kennedy.Poor Steven Culp tends to get overlooked as Bobby Kennedy but in fact this is one of his finest performances. Again he looks speaks and acts the part to perfection. He is youthful and energetic but yet a top politician and business man. The closeness between Bobby and Jack is also wonderfully shown through little meaningful looks and glances between Culp and Greenwood.The support cast are superb and the piece is historically accurate which is rare in film. There is suspense action humor and strong remotion throughout. Hats off to a superb piece of film.".

It is a very American product viewers unaccustomed to the clichs of standard Hollywood filmography are going to have a hard time swallowing the extremes of overdramatization saturating every single scene of the film. Everything is boosted up to keep the spectator on the edge indefinitely which may appear as a merit to the American public but easily relapses in cheapness and bad taste to those used to a more thoughtful approach.The way the story and the characters are developed is also standard Hollywood fare with the blackandwhite presentation of Kennedy as a national hero soundly rooted in the values of family motherland and hard work who regards his office as the highest duty and finally overcomes the warmongering ambitions of the generals.Looks like being cynical or simply realistic is not allowed in American mainstream productions.Even worst the director makes no attempt to convey a picture of the political situation underlying the crisis or to offer even for a moment the viewpoint of the Soviets and the Cubans. On the contrary the first half an hour suggests the idea that the United States were the victim of an unprovoked unilateral aggression. This is junk history. The reasons why the Soviets deployed the missiles in Cuba were 1 to retaliate for the US deployment of about one hundred nuclear missiles in Turkey and 2 to protect Cuba after the CIAorchestrated landing at the Bay of Pigs and while the US were practicing invasion forces as a show of strength on islands in the Caribbean. This was perfectly known to the Kennedy administration and certainly must have played a large part in the conversations on how to deal with the crisis.As a blockbuster 13 days may have its merits but as a serious historical movie it has a long way to go.".

Kennedy fought to avert war in Cuba against the determined opposition of his own military and Intelligence advisors. Dramatized in Roger Donaldson's powerful Thirteen Days the entire world teetered on the brink of nuclear Armageddon for thirteen anxietyfilled days as the internal and external pressures mounted on both the President and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to keep the world from nuclear immolation.Thirteen Days stars Kevin Costner as Presidential Aide Kenneth O'Donnell Bruce Greenwood as JFK Steven Culp as Bobby and Dylan Baker as Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and is based on the book The Kennedy Tapes Inside the White House During the Cuban Missile Crisis edited by Ernest R. May and Philip D. Zelikow. When a U2 flyover discovered two dozen SS4 nuclear missiles in Cuba pointing to the United States American leaders had a very short window of time before the missiles became operational to find a way to remove them. Kennedy who until this time had tried to placate both the right and the left was faced with severely limited options.Though different courses of action were discussed the administration never questioned the underlying assumptions of the Cold War or the premise that the weapons were offensive rather than defensive and the film does not mention or discuss previous U.S. attempts to destabilize Cuba. With the CIA and the Pentagon calling for air strikes followed by a ground invasion Kennedy knew that he could not afford to look weak or back down in face of the presumed Soviet threat. On the other hand he was profoundly aware that an invasion would be met with Russian retaliation and probable nuclear war. His ultimate decision to order a naval blockade and a quarantine of Russian ships headed toward Cuba carrying offensive weapons was opposed by virtually Kennedy's entire national security apparatus.The film shows the bluster of Joint Chiefs Chairman Maxwell Taylor Bill Smitrovich Air Force Chief of Staff Curtis LeMay Kevin Conway Chief of Naval Operations George Anderson Madison Mason and other military leaders clamoring for an aggressive response. After a meeting with the Joint Chiefs Kennedy said to O'Donnell These brass hats have one advantage in their favor. If we listen to them and do what they want us to do none of us will be alive later to tell them that they were wrong. The conflict with the military and the CIA over how to handle Cuba would continue to dog Mr. Kennedy throughout his presidency and his overtures for rapprochement with Castro may have been a determining factor in his assassination.The film describes in detail the confusing Soviet response to JFK's quarantine demands and the meeting between Bobby and Soviet Ambassador Andrei Dobrynin Elya Baskin is the dramatic high point of the film. Also vital is the crucial role played by UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson Michael Fairman in first proposing a diplomatic solution and in his strong defense of the U.S. position at the U.N. in confrontation with Soviet Ambassador Valerian Zorin Oleg Vidov much to the surprise of the Kennedy brothers who had decided he was weak.Thirteen Days unfolds through the eyes of Ken O'Donnell Costner and centers on his role in providing counsel and encouragement to Kennedy though his role is vastly overstated. Costner is adequate in the role though he is a wooden actor and his attempt at a New England accent becomes increasingly irritating. Both Greenwood and Culp have the Kennedy's manner of speech and body language down pat but give very little hint of the Kennedy charm wit strength charisma or overriding selfconfidence. Regardless of its flaws however the film is an absolutely fascinating portrayal of a pivotal time in history and an important reminder of the tenuous thread that holds our civilization together and how quickly it can be shattered.As John Kennedy reminded us in his speech at American University on June 10 1963 quoted in the film a speech that challenged Americans and Russians to rethink their attitudes toward each other We all inhabit this small planet he said We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are all mortal. It was a speech that has even more relevance today and the need to eliminate nuclear weapons is more urgent than ever.".

Open up the case and Costner is a one man wrecking crew that completely weakens an otherwise powerful film. I don't know if his Kenny ODonnell character is real or fiction but he manages to make that point irrelevant. From his Forrest Gump type omnipresence to his truly not to be believed Mayor QuimbyJFK accent Costner does more damage to the Kennedy brothers legacy than an unexpurgated Marilyn Monroe documentary. Is any reasonable person expected to believe that ODonnell's wisdom was the final word in the drama of the Cuban Missle crisis? No but Costner in his advanced stage of megalomania overlooks this slight detail in order to make a film in which HE appears to save the world. Again its a darn shame. Great subject matter naturally and it scores big on historic drama. If only he had had the courage and humility to simply produce this movie and left himself as a minor character or better still out of shot altogether this would probably go down as one of the better movies of its time. But his idiotic totally inappropriate appearances rob this film of any sense of realism and consequently relevance. The tragedy of the failing Hollywood system is well represented in this film and its defining use of error in motion at all levels.".

But his idiotic totally inappropriate appearances rob this film of any sense of realism and consequently relevance. The tragedy of the failing Hollywood system is well represented in this film and its defining use of error in motion at all levels.";

	schema:reviewBody "A shy hunter  an Alimaero Angel Ovidi Montllor  lives in a small inn or Meson in middle of woods in Valley of Cabuerniga Cantabria and dominated by his incestuous mommy  Martina Lola Gaos . Angel falls in love for a fierce  insolent girl called Milagros Alicia Snchez who has escaped from an orphanage run by nuns of Divino Consejo . Shameless Milagros is the lover of a Quinqui or delinquent called El Cuqui Felipe Solano . Meanwhile  the Civil governor  Santiago Jose Luis Borau  goes to the Martina's Meson  sets out in hunting  shoots deers and he eats tasty stews . Spanish classic drama in Neorealist style with excellent players and masterfully directed by Jose Luis Borau . This splendid drama develops a peculiar romance  a triangular love story  plenty of sadness and melancholy  between a trapper or Alimaero and a cheeky orphan . Throughout several narrative ellipsis  cowriter  producer  filmmaker Borau develops a strong retelling  including violence on animals  and being perfectly shot . The movie deals with various interesting issues such as jealousy that the old Martina has on young Milagros  including dramatic scenes as when the mother is put out her bed and room . Thoughtprovoking and thoughtful screenplay by Manuel Gutirrez Aragon  subsequently a prestigious writer and director  concerning the rural world  an ordinary theme of his films . Fine performances from Ovidi Montllor as a lonely  timid man who falls in love with a scoundrel person well played by Alicia Sanchez . Lola Gaos  recent her great interpretation for Tristana steals the show  she gives an unforgettable and deep acting . The movie displays a nice Spanish secondary cast such as Erasmo Pascual  Jose Riesgo  Beni Deus  Antonio Gamero  Simon Arriaga and Ismael Merlo as a priest . Furthermore  Jose Luis Borau as Governor  he gives an awesome acting  adding an ironical and funny touch . This character of the Governor was offered to Jos Luis Lpez Vzquez  but when he couldn't do it and with little time to start shooting the director replaced at the last minute  as Jos Luis Borau casted himself  by insistence of cowriter Manuel Gutirrez Aragn who had previously worked with Lopez Vazquez in Habla Mudita. This is a 'rara avis' film of the 70s because dealing with a strong portrait of Spanish rural society  it didn't please the proFranco authorities and was strongly censored . Borau's conceptual and political audacity as well as the social criticism result to be so evident in this film who he had to fight the censorship which didn't admit the some engaging scenes and obligated to cut some violent and terrible frames . The flick has two habitual defects  ordinaries in Spanish cinema by that time  most actors are dubbed and an inappropriate musical score by the band Vainica Doble . The movie was rejected in Festival of Cannes and Venice  however  winning the Golden Shell in Festival of San Sebastian in 1975 during a thunderous environment when took place the last death penalties and ordered by General Francisco Franco . Really censored  finally  it was exhibited with no cuts . Striking cinematography by Luis Cuadrado  including correct remastering and gorgeous outdoor sequences with leafy exteriors . Being shot on location in Montejo Madrid and Rebollo Segovia Castilla y Len Spain . This motion picture was stunningly directed by Jose Luis Borau . He managed to make a fluid  decent and enjoyable drama . Borau began as a Critic of cinema and to publish articles about cinema in newspapers . He enters the Spanish Official Cinema School where he later become a teacher and after that  he directed documentaries and films . He was President of the Spanish Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences  in addition  member of the jury at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1991 . Borau was one of the best Spanish filmmakers who alternated flops as Rio Abajo Leo  El Monosabio Tata Mia along with successes such as La Sabina  Mi Querida Seorita  Hay Que Matar a B and his greatest picture  this hit Furtivos that was one of the greatest successes of Spanish cinema .".

	schema:headline " A subtle allegory of Franco's Spain";
	schema:reviewBody "This visually outstanding film is with no doubt one of the very best made in Spain in the Seventies and I personally place it among the top ten Spanish films of all time. It is a very subtle satire of the socio political climate in the country during the last days of Franco and just as the dictator was agonising in a Madrid hospital. The first time I saw it I couldn't believe just how daring the film is with scenes of sexual nature and as an open criticism of the corrupt authorities and their hypocrisy. It is unbelievable that it fooled Franco's censors at all. Angel is a young man who lives with his mother Martina in the heart of the forest where they run a tavern. Besides that Angel also makes some occasional cash from poaching and selling the meat to the village shops. During one of his trips to the town he meets a girl Milagros who has escaped from a juvenile detention centre. He falls for her and takes her home. At the same time the police are looking all over the town for a famous petty delinquent whom as we will learn later is Milagros' boyfriend. The man leading the manhunt is the governor of the province who as we'll also learn in a moment is Angel's stepbrother. When the young couple arrive home Martina receives Milagros with great distaste and suspicion and will try anything to humiliate her and force her to leave. When the governor and his entourage also arrive looking forward having a free lunch and some gameshooting in the forest Martina gives Milagros away. In order to avoid going to prison for the abduction of a minor Angel is forced to marry the girl. After the wedding Martina's feelings remain the same and we can see she is up to something. At the same time the escaped delinquent has traced his fiance down and comes to pick her up. She agrees to go with him that night she married Angel only to avoid being sent back to the institution she never loved him  but Martina murders her before that can happen. Angel after helping the fugitive avoid being captured by the police that are combing the forest believes his mother when she tells him that Milagros ran away with her pimp because she was a slut in the first place. But later he finds some of her belongings still stashed in the bedroom and knowing that she would never have left them behind he works out the truth. The following morning he takes Martina to mass in the village and orders her to take confession with the priest. When she seems reluctant he knows for sure she killed Milagros. He pushes her to take confession and the priest's face when she comes out says it all to Angel. On their way back home he shoots her in the back and leaves her to die in the snow. At the house all locked up and now totally alone he goes through Milagros' scarce belongings just to remember her once more.Martina represents Franco's Spain Catholic conservative and narrow minded. She never leaves her isolated environment she is a staunch Catholic who nevertheless is capable of committing coldblood murder and feels no remorse publicly respects the figures of authority although inside can't stand the sight of them she won't tolerate a slut under her roof and she is a domineering mother who still treats her thirty yearold son like a little boy who needs guidance. Angel represents the young Spain who wants to be free and democratic he goes to town and mixes with other people he has no prejudices about knowing a slut and helping her because he believes she is good he defies authority by bringing her into the house poaching behind his stepbrother's back and helping a convict escape under the police's noses. And in between these two worlds there stand the corrupt authorities the governor calls at the tavern for lunch even though he knows the game he will be eating in a minute comes from poaching. He is a hypocrite who signs laws and warrants and then turns on a blind eye if he knows he will profiting from the crime that is being committed. An intense story with some moments of suspense a fantastic setting in a natural environment that makes you feel you are in the middle of nowhere a superb and very atmospheric cinematography a great musical score and a truly excellent cast character actor Ovidi Montllor as Angel who shows here what a good leading actor he could be when given the chance character actress Lola Gaos who was often typecast in old bitch roles as Martina and the director of the film himself Jose Luis Borau as the capricious and rapacious governor.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sophia Loren became the first player to win an Acting Oscar for a foreign language film in Two Women or La Ciociara in her native Italy. She plays the title role here the other woman being her daughter played in La Ciociara by Eleanora Brown.The story here is a relatively simple one Sophia and Eleanora leave Rome due to the bombing of Rome just prior to the Allied invasion of Italy. The political situation is in one state of flux to put it mildly. In a matter of days Benito Mussolini was overthrown and General Badoglio put in charge of the government. But the Nazis suspecting something was afoot sent in troops and met the Allies in a pitched 21 day battle at Salerno which like Waterloo was a close run thing.At one point JeanPaul Belmondo asks a couple of stray British paratroopers who landed way up behind enemy lines why the Allies didn't land in Rome. In fact they almost did land an army there but Eisenhower canceled the landing at the last moment and probably saved a lot of lives doing so.But this isn't about great battles it's about Two Women just trying to survive the ravages of war in the best way they can. Sophia decides their best place is in her old village south towards Naples. Before the film ends she's given plenty of reason to rethink that decision.Sophia was the Best Actress in 1961 for this film and for reasons I don't understand it was not given any other Oscar nominations including for Best Foreign Language Film and for Best Director for Vittorio DeSica. If La Ciociara has a fault it's that it's Sophia's show totally. The village characters and that of her one time lover Raf Vallone are left undeveloped. Only the daughter and young intellectual Belmondo who falls for the earthy Sophia seem to be on the verge of becoming three dimensional.The subject matter could never have been done in an American studio with the Code still firmly in place. I remember back in the day La Ciociara was shown at the art house circuit and many young juveniles considered it a mark of daring to get in and see Sophia Loren expose more than her American films had done up to that time.Sophia Loren deserved that Oscar every bit of it. And you'll agree if you see La Ciociara.".

Throughout the story she proves to be a strong woman seasoned by pain and not having lost the fire and fight in her.Like many European films of its time Two Women is all about the characters and the current on which they flow through the film a realistic capsule of a time and place. Vittorio De Sica who made the beautifully smallscale film The Bicycle Thief which is about a relationship between father and son forms a companion piece with Two Women which is about a relationship between mother and daughter. He addresses strikingly the unbearable love between a parent and their child.Truly one of the greatest Italian films this is an absorbing emotional modest journey with wonderful music coarse downtoearth cinematography from the wonderful old days of gritty film prints and old school handson editing incredible acting not only from Loren but from the young actress playing her daughter who drastically transforms and also from Jean Paul Belmondo who convincingly plays completely against type and a beautifully emotional final shot.

Sophia Loren's character is a fairly strongwilled widow who doesn't shy away from sex but doesn't seem to enjoy it either.  She has a different opinion on how her daughter should act and she tries to shelter her daughter from sex and men.  It's a classic case of Do as I say not as I do taken to an emotional peak not with the rape but with the very last scene when the two women fight about the silk stockings a young man gave the daughter after the dance.This is an incredible movie that should be available in a higher quality DVD than the Madacy version.

	schema:reviewBody "Two Women is powerful not just simply for its final half hour even if that is arguably and I'd argue on the side of yes some of the best drama Vittorio De Sica and his screenwriter Cesar Zavatinni created. It's a view into lives that at least at the time didn't get much time on cinema screens. We understand that this young mother Cesira VERY well deserved Academy Award winner Sophia Loren has a kind of hard protective shell of the fiery strong woman that today might seem to verge on being something to expect in an Italian or Spanish drama but here is meant to be just that a shell to guard off from the wretched horrors of a war which repeatedly she asks will it end soon? She also has to be strong for her thirteen year old daughter Rosetta Eleonora Brown excellent even if not considering it's a first performance who still has a little innocence and admiration for those who are more goodhearted if not as resourceful.This type as mentioned is in Michel Jean Paul Belmondo a curiously lowkey performance considering his big hype as a suave star in France who is a resistance fighter that Cesira and Rosetta come across while traveling away from Rome during bombing raids. We see them Michel and Cesira getting close maybe too close though she recognizes in him one of the only vestiges of common sense and decency even if in a slightly shrewd or just practical manner that she can't totally grasp. She's been through the war right along with her daughter and there's layers that Loren grasps that pierce through the character De Sica knows that she's capable of reaching these very real dimensions even before she has to go full tilt into the tragedy of the rape scene in the church. Loren's absolutely stunning in her gorgeous beauty but in a way that works to make a comment on how her character has to keep guarded as well. Sometimes a look is just enough to suggest something. Other times men might get a little more forceful. There's suggestion beneath some of the bigger scenes and Loren is fantastic at grabbing them for all their worth.From the start De Sica and Zavattini set the tone people walking on a street suddenly the alarms sound running bombs drop. Should be business as usual but it's still staggering for the mind to grasp. In a way Cesira and Rosetta are in the midst of a kind of apocalyptic atmosphere and we as the audience even as we know where history will lead the characters get wrapped up in the maelstrom of violence one moment that's important is when the mother and daughter walk along a quiet road a man on a bicycle passes and a plane swoops down shooting the women duck but the man is killed  the women look startled for just a moment but hide it and go on their way and with some political discourse thrown in from time to time as well these might be the only weak spots of the film but still very good scenes with a quick pace and sharp attention to mixing real actors and non actors a slightly elevated neorealism. And there are memorable scenes before that last half hour just seeing the Germans appear up in front of the Italians menacing in an almost surreal twodimensional fashion verbally abusive taking bread. Scenes precede this like a couple of brutes who threaten Cesira with a gun. But this one strikes it hard a state of mind in war cripples the mind.Finally they come to the abandoned church and the infamous scene occurs filmed with a very effective zoom lens on Rosetta's eyes at a crucial moment a kind of approximate exclamation point. It's a very careful study in the disintegration of the human spirit at this point and more than once De Sica and his writer as in times before pull sincerely and harshly at the heart strings. This time however is like seeing a Lifetime TV movie as done by the most sincere dramatist ready to gage the emotions just by presenting the devastation straight on and enhancing a theme the futility of escape in this environment. Rosetta can't stand that her mother didn't protect her more she's almost shellshocked and after a tense scene riding back with an opera singing trucker a small great scene she awakes at night to see she's run off with the trucker from before. She comes back Cesira is furious but not simply for that. A much greater tragedy has occurred and it all comes crashing down. Even the most hardened and cynical moviegoer will be hardpressed to hold back from crying as Loren brushes back her daughter's hair in the church or tries to look away in the truck. And that final shot however in sentiment as the final shots of Umberto D and Bicycle Thief drive it on home like a dagger.One of the best films of 1960 a touching masterpiece in Italian cinema from one of the masters if that's overpraising it much forgive me.".

Sophia Loren in a somewhat nonglamorous role as Cesira a shop owner in the Italian capital who's estranged from her husband and is at the time that we first meet her having an affair with local food distributor Giovanni Ralf Vallone. Taking care of her shy teenage daughter Rosetta Eleanor Brown Cesira has had enough of the almost daily and deadly bombing by the USAAF and RAF and leaves the city with her daughter by train for her home town. There's trouble almost as soon as the train leaves the city with it being derailed by an Allied air attack. Leaving the disabled train and on foot both Cesira and Rosetta make it to the village after they survive an air attack by a USAAF fighter that killed a farmer who was walking on the same road with them. After getting to the village things are more or less peaceful with the war just an old and bitter memory with Cesira meeting and falling in love with the local intellectual as well as socialist young collage student MicheleJeanPaul Belmondo who even young Rosetta takes a strong liking to. The almost forgotten war slowly catches up with Cesira and Rosetta and the people at the small village as the Allied forces break through the German lines and reach the outskirts of Rome. It soon becomes too dangerous for the village people to stay and they start to leave and go south to the Italian capital city which is now in USAllied hands. Before this happened a squad of German soldiers entered the town and took Michele with them as a guide through the dangerous hills and valleys of the Argo Pontino.On their way to Rome the two women Cesira  Rosetta stop off at a bombed out church to get some rest and are later set upon by a group of French Colonial Moroccan troops. The Moroccans brutally beat and gang raped them leaving young Rosetta almost mute with fear and shame of what happened to her and her mother. Getting back on their way to the Italian capital Cesira  Rosetta are both picked up by a local truck driver Firindo Renato Salvatore. Stoping off at a small town outside of Rome that night Rosetta who seemed to have completely lost her mind since she and her mother were raped sneaks out of the room that she sharing with Cesira and has an affair with the truck driver. This both sickened and outrages her already distraught mother. The movie ends with Cesira getting the terrible news that her lover Michele was shot and killed by the Germans as we later see both mother and daughter alone in their small room arm in arm crying and consoling each other as the movie slowly fades to black.Sophia Loren rightfully who got an Academy Award as best actress for 1961 in the role of Cesira was both feisty as well as touching as the long suffering Italian mom. The vicious rape scene in the bombed out church of Cesira and Rosetta was not only graphic and shocking. By having this outrage committed by the liberating allied troops instead of the occupying German soldiers it showed that there's nothing good that comes out of war on either side.".

The expressions and body language of Loren are heartrending and sorrowful as we see her realize what has become of her daughter what has become of their world. The scene I will remember most is where she is finally rescued her daughter begins to sing recovering from the attack. Cesira Loren turns her face outward toward the window ravaged and ruined yet finding some strength to continue on.

First as others note the print is the worst I've ever encountered sometimes turning faces into gray pudding but the problem was not so great to keep me from responding fully to the film's power and I decided to evaluate the film rather than the print. I have more serious concerns about events at the film's climax which raise issues which are resolved too quickly. In fact these issues might be the subject of a whole new film and if treated here they would require another hour of play time. The films hasty resolution of these issues makes important behaviors seem poorly motivated and unbelievable. However the issues in question are not the central issues of the movie. When Cesira apologizes to her daughter and at other points I was left sobbing in spite of the film's failure to properly address the daughter's final trauma. This is not a about recovering from trauma. Rather it is a film about human fallibility and selfdeception or as Michele puts it You can't escape not even from yourself. Cesira faults others while never examining her own behavior. Like those around her she acts only to preserve her own immediate interests. At the other extreme. Michele's idealism prevents him from realizing his own humanity. Only Rosetta demonstrates the purity to see beyond selfinterest and the instinct to truly tell right from wrong. Her downfall is the tragedy of the film. Yet through all of this the film shows us how when pushed to extremes these people are capable of forging deep human bonds. Such bonds have the power to redeem all as they finally redeem Rosetta. I can't conclude without adding my own appreciation for Sophia Loren's extraordinary performance.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is Vittorio De Sica's last great movie. And it really is good.Sophia Loren and her angelic twelveyearold daughter Eleanora Brown run a small shop in Rome during the German occupation. A nearby explosion from an Allied bomb turns the place into a shambles and Loren decides to take her daughter and live with distant relatives in a small country town.Life isn't a bed of roses there either but it's better than Rome with only the occasional handful of retreating German soldiers to deal with. The Germans are not shown as simply evil monsters. Earlier before the deposing of Mussolini a train load of soldiers is seen cheerfully whistling at Loren and chanting a song just as any soldiers would do. Later when the road is rougher the Germans become more determined and forceful again as most soldiers would since their lives are at stake.Then the Allies liberate southern Italy and the pressure on the citizens if relieved. The refugees in the small town bid one another goodbye and leave. Loren and Brown begin their trek back to Rome to rebuild the store but it's not as easy as it seems. The Americans whistle at Loren too. Who wouldn't? She's stunningly beautiful. She has the large expressive eyes of a lovable but wary cow. And her big boobs wobble with every movement she makes. The Moroccans who are fighting alongside the Americans are even more demonstrative  too much so. They trap Loren and her daughter in a wrecked abandoned church and gang rape both of them in a scene that will chill any viewer down to the bone.As inured to harsh treatment as she is Loren recovers consciousness and rushes to her daughter sobbing and trying to wipe away the virginal blood from Brown's thighs. They continue trying to reach Rome their pleas ignored by Americans who think Loren is crazy. It's impossible to know what is happening in Eleanora Brown's mind. She stares into space and barely speaks. Yet when they're picked up by a loud and affable truck driver Brown begins to flirt with him.During this scene the camera is aimed through open the window on the passenger's side where Loren is sitting slumping with fatigue. Her head sags against the door in a close up and we can see every crack and wrinkle on her lips and the tears forming behind her heavy lids. It's a tragic moment. Loren pulls it off and De Sica gets it on film. She gives a marvelous performance. She won an Oscar for it not that it matters.What a splendid movie. When it was finished after the necessary cathartic moment I found myself thinking not only of Italian refugees but of all refugees of all wars. You're not likely to forget it quickly.".

They must avoid the Allied bombs as well as the fleeing Fascist pigs who have destroyed the country.Starvation is always a concern along with stray bombs. However the movie concludes with their both being raped by some savage Moroccan troops I had no idea they were involved in WW2I learned something here. I mention this rape because it is important to the story but must be considered by parents who let their kids see the movie. I would allow my 15 yearold to see it but it is just too much for my 10 yearold to deal with right now.Although the movie is depressing it is not overly so despite the subject matter. It is well executed and deserved the fame and recognition the movie received. DeSica director and Sophia Loren received many kudos for this project. A great film that hopefully will encourage you to seek out more DeSica films I strongly recommend UMBERTO D. and especially THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US.".

	schema:headline " Italian Realism at it's Best";
	schema:reviewBody "The credit for this film rests squarely on the shoulders of Vittorio De Sica one of Italy's great post war directors. De Sica like so many others of his era used realism as the force of his films. This is not his best work but his success is that he elevated Sophia Loren to an actress.Originally Anna Magnani was to play the mother in this story with Sophia playing the daughter. Magnani supposedly objected to the casting and De Sica determined to use Loren in this film convinced Loren to play the mother. Eleanora Bron was cast as the daughter.The story chronicles the life altering events of two women as they try to survive in war torn Italy. The Italian realist film directors of this period didn't rely on the glitz that is used to dress movies today they relied on reality. Real places real people real stories. Magnani backing out was Loren's ticket to cinema history.Although now the film seems dated and in comparison to what we see on the screen today perhaps it is but so rarely do we get to see the realistic reactions to any moment in time as we do in this film. Loren is outstanding as the mother and completely believable. It's her film from beginning to end. De Sica takes her quietly from the beginnings in the mountains to the church to the confrontation with the American soldiers in their jeep. He allows her to paint a portrait of a woman who learns that survival is not only physical but emotional and mental.Eleanor Bron as the daughter is not given much to do in this film but their is one shot of her after an encounter that makes your heart ache. The scene with Loren in tears on a dusty road clearly epitomizes what each and every human being must go through when they are in the midst of war. Jean Paul Belmondo is sexy and interesting.This was the first film I'd ever seen with Loren. I remember I was a teen ager when I saw it and I never forgot the depth of emotion that came from Loren. If you saw this film in the sixties it would have lived on in your mind forever.A great film. Dated perhaps. The message is still the same regardless of the time and place. Loren is amazing. De Sica created an excellent moment in cinema history.".

	onyx:emotionText "The credit for this film rests squarely on the shoulders of Vittorio De Sica one of Italy's great post war directors. De Sica like so many others of his era used realism as the force of his films. This is not his best work but his success is that he elevated Sophia Loren to an actress.Originally Anna Magnani was to play the mother in this story with Sophia playing the daughter. Magnani supposedly objected to the casting and De Sica determined to use Loren in this film convinced Loren to play the mother. Eleanora Bron was cast as the daughter.The story chronicles the life altering events of two women as they try to survive in war torn Italy. The Italian realist film directors of this period didn't rely on the glitz that is used to dress movies today they relied on reality. Real places real people real stories. Magnani backing out was Loren's ticket to cinema history.Although now the film seems dated and in comparison to what we see on the screen today perhaps it is but so rarely do we get to see the realistic reactions to any moment in time as we do in this film. Loren is outstanding as the mother and completely believable. It's her film from beginning to end. De Sica takes her quietly from the beginnings in the mountains to the church to the confrontation with the American soldiers in their jeep. He allows her to paint a portrait of a woman who learns that survival is not only physical but emotional and mental.Eleanor Bron as the daughter is not given much to do in this film but their is one shot of her after an encounter that makes your heart ache.

Although I have forgotten some sequences the overall feeling I have is that it was a great film and the first to capture an Oscar for a leading foreign film! There were a few things u never let get by you in 'The city' one was a film by De Sica and Carlo PontiSophias husband. Two you never missed a film in which Sophia LorenJean Paul Belmondo Jeanne Moreau or Marchello Mastroianni was starring. This could be said of all the foreign films coming out in the 60's. We were so used to subtitles that sometimes we were not sure if a film had them or not  once outside the theater. I digress. The film was very heart wrenching and I thought De Sica brilliant the way he kept us wondering about the mother and daughter and the lewd and leering smirks of the men and when the rape of these woemen would occur. by having it toward the end was a master stroke.The heartbreak of CesiraSophia as her daughter Rosetta sits staring off into space dazed by what has just happened Cesira trying to wash  the tradgedy away in the river. Rosettas' then hostility to her mother and the men she picksup. And finally Cesiras' loss of temper which seems to bring Rosetta back to reality. They embrace and the tears flow. I gave this film a 10 As it is one of the best to date. ciao  PS I have looked for a copy of this film and have found all sorts of complaints  re its' remastering. Amazon is coming out with a DVD version I heard that the other DVD version was really terrible. Does anyone have a clue on how to get a good copy? Thanks and ciao".

In a novel one can immensely enjoy the detailed depictions of situations and reflections of practical and obstinate but very goodhearted and sharpminded Cesira. In the film the narration is very chaotic and many situations or characters are treated in not a very profound way. Loren seems too glossy for a simple rude countrywoman and sometimes her performance seems quite stiff the most convincing only in the sequence of waiting for her daughter who had gone to the dancing with Florindo. Such important character as Michele Festa was absolutely mistreated. In film he's only ridiculous with his clumsy wooing of Cesira. Indeed Michele in book is a kind of new formation intellectual that was moulded under the pressure of fascist regime but had acquired  spontaneous but wellconscious antifascism. He's a gloomy reserved young man with the hidden tempests inside outsider among the countrymen and his relatives sometimes bursting into tantrums but with a gift of persuasion and imposing. You should have heard his powerful speech about the corpses who imagine that they are alive which is unfortunately much cut in film. And by the way he absolutely wasn't interested in women. So in general if you want to grasp all the tragedy of Ciociara you should first read a book and then it would be very ridiculous to compare it with the film where De Sica even in the most tragic moment didn't forget to set off Loren's seminude bust. Well if her husband is a producer it's quite acceptable.".

Sophia Loren is a mother who takes her daughter away from the daily bombings in Rome to her childhood home. She is pretty good as the exasperated mother.

Both characters are quite superficially stereotypical and their big scenes are all over the map. I think that is a good phrase for this film all over the map. Themes are very weakly held throughout so it feels meandering. By the end nothing is accomplished. All I could think of were better films that dealt with similar subjects. This is incredibly unfortunate seeing that de Sica and his screenwriter Zavattini concocted two of the best films of the 1940s The Bicycle Thieves and Umberto D.SPOILERSThose who love the movie are probably wishing to crucify me right now since I am criticizing a film in which the central episode is a rape. But really I did not dislike the film before this scene. Although I felt it meandered I liked it. But when Loren and her daughter are raped the movie fell apart. Let me say this just because such a heavy subject is dealt with does not make the movie great. I felt this scene this plot point was handled extraordinarily poorly. Instead of seeming horrific it seemed completely exploitative. After the deed Loren certainly a beautiful woman walks around with her cleavage popping out for the rest of the film. I did not feel that she and her daughter have been destroyed by this incident. Instead it feels more like an unfortunate thing that happens to them on their journey. The reason for this is that the film ends only about ten minutes later. Since everything before the rape scene had been dealt with more successfully in previous films I believe the best choice would have been to open the story right before the rape and have them deal with it afterwards. That way the gravity of the situation would have hit better.Just randomly I watched two films tonight that had to do with rape. This one and right before it Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring. The Virgin Spring hit me like a sledgehammer whereas Two Women left me squirming with disappointment. The major difference between the two is that The Virgin Spring had a theme a point. It went somewhere with the horrible event. Two Women just believed it would be powerful because it happened.  I may sympathize but I have little empathy since I do not know what they felt. 510".

We also love all the great films it has produced around the world in the last 60 years although needless to say not in the USA. La Ciociara is a novel written by the immortal Alberto Moravia who was a Communist MEP for the last dozen years of his life.His story as interpreted by pioneer filmmaker Vittorio De Sica is told from the point of view of Cesira an uneducated widow Sophia Loren in her Oscarwinning role who inherited a grocery from her older husband.

We also love all the great films it has produced around the world in the last 60 years although needless to say not in the USA. La Ciociara is a novel written by the immortal Alberto Moravia who was a Communist MEP for the last dozen years of his life.His story as interpreted by pioneer filmmaker Vittorio De Sica is told from the point of view of Cesira an uneducated widow Sophia Loren in her Oscarwinning role who inherited a grocery from her older husband.

I saw it recently on TCM for the first time during their tribute to Miss Loren and I found this to be a very powerful film.I've seen my share of films about war in the past but watching this one really affected me. Having been born the year this movie was released it gave me a real sense of what people were going through during World War II regardless of where you were at in Europe. I knew the outcome of the story because of having read Miss Loren's autobiography and at times it was unnerving knowing what was to come.On a lighter side Hollywood should remake this film with Kathy Griffin as the mother and in a dual role Kathy Griffin as the daughter. Listen after watching this film you gotta crack a joke.I highly recommend this movie".

	schema:reviewBody "Y tu Mama tambien' a stunning new product of the New Mexican Cinema that is achieving crossover success in the American film market is a frank open and uninhibited celebration of teenage sex  masterfully directed by Alfonso Cuaron and beautifully enacted by a trio of firstrate performers.  Don't miss it  provided you are not offended by sometimesgraphic depictions of sexual activity please note that the film is unrated.  The matteroffact unflinching way in which Cuaron films his sex scenes purges them of indecency and helps to bring a new frankness to a subject all too often approached by American filmmakers from the angle of tittering exploitation wherein the directors and writers seem as adolescent in their attitudes as the characters on the screen.  Not so here.  The film centers around two boyhood chums Tenoch and Julio just embarking on their careers as university students who for one last glorious summer decide to revel in all the wildness hedonism and promiscuity that carefree adolescence has to offer the title of the film is emblematic of the youthful immaturity of the characters.  With their girlfriends away in Europe the two decide to take a road trip through Mexico with Luisa the attractive young wife of one of Tenoch's stuffed shirt cousins.  While on the journey the three of them not only indulge in all the bizarre sexual hijinks that both the situation and their hormones would lead one to expect but they also learn a thing or two about life about relationships and about how sex can be used both to bring people closer together as well as to pull them farther apart.  For indeed one thing the film makes very clear both to the characters and to us is that sex can often be employed as a weapon to wound those we care most about especially with all the power shifting that takes place even in some of the most nonsexual of relationships.  The boys also discover that sex can be used as a sublimation to avoid recognizing what one REALLY wants.  This awakening leads to a final scene that is almost heartbreaking in its understated poignancy and pathos.One of the most unsettling  and thereby controversial  aspects of the film and the one that will make it uncomfortable for many in the audience is that it refuses to take a moralistic stance regarding its characters' behavior.  The filmmakers neither approve of nor condemn what these young people do  they merely record the events with an attitude of detached objectivity that precludes any fingerwagging disapproval.  If the characters learn any lessons' from their experiences they do so strictly on a subliminal subconscious level  and the same goes for the audience.As a director Cuaron displays a confidence and spirit rarely seen in filmmaking today.  Along with his cowriter Carlos Cuaron the director has chosen to take an objective almost documentarystyle approach to the material allowing the scenes to play themselves out in a way that makes them feel realistic spontaneous and almost unscripted.  He uses a shaky handheld camera much of the time to enhance the immediacy of the experience. We often feel as if we are eavesdropping on the lives of these three fascinating individuals.  As a result not a single moment of the film feels forced contrived or artificial.  Only the fate of one of the characters seems a bit convenient and contrived. Cuaron is not afraid to let the camera linger on a scene a moment two longer than necessary  nor is he afraid to let the camera wander off on its own from time to time such as when it spontaneously follows a woman into the back of a roadside caf to show us the cooks hard at work in the kitchen.   Many of the shots even have an elegiac travelogue feel to them.Cuaron has been blessed with three outstanding young actors  Diego Luna Gael Garcia and Maribel Verdu  who bring his characters to vivid endearing life.  Utterly naturalistic in their every move gesture and facial expression the three of them play off each other in such a way that we never doubt for a moment the truth and sincerity of what we are seeing. American actors please take note!Y tu Mama tambien' is a stylistic triumph from first moment to last.  It has a playful expansive spirit as reflected in its openhearted attitude towards sex its wry humor its affection for its people and its country and its visual appeal and inventiveness Emmanuel Lubezki did the glorious cinematography.  The film has heart soul and chutzpah.  What more could a jaded filmgoer want?".

His incredible AIDSdriven comedy Solo Con Tu Pareja was maybe the most funny Mexican picture in a long time and his always present criticism to the way of life of Mexican people in a city such as Mexico City is incredible accurate and clever. His other projects in the United States Little Princess and Great Expectations were beautifullymanufactured motion pictures with the help or support if you may of the marvellous photographer Emmanuel Lubenzki Sleepy Hollow and the abovementioned Cuaron movies. Returning to his home country this time Cuaron displays such magic and poetic visuals in contrast with the subtle criticism to the society in Mexico and the clever and sharp dialogs between the leading stars using every word young Mexicans use to apply in their conversations.Y Tu Mama Tambien And Your Mother Too is in the surface a really funny story about 2 friendsalmostbrothers Tenoch Iturbide an outstanding Diego Luna and Julio a really incredible performance for the recent Ariel the Mexican Academy Award winner Gael Garcia Bernal in another excellent portray of a young guy with issues that plan a trip to an imaginary beach Boca del Cielo Heavens Mouth in order to flirt with a Spanish girl married with Tenoch's cousin and portrayed by a credible Maribel Verdu.But this is only the surface of this road movie. In fact we are dealing with dreams and realities with social problems and political ones. Tenoch is a young guy living with a millionaire family son of a wealthy businessman with friends in the highest stairs of Mexican politics with a second name such as Iturbide one of the most important and powerful leaders of Mexican politic history. And in contrast Julio  is a middlelowclass guy living with his mother brothers and sisters in a small department with a last name such as Zapata a revolutionary leader in Mexican history with native origins that took part in the Revolution at the beginning of 20th Century. This is a clever and sharp critic of the different models of living of these 2 friends and in fact of all Mexican citizens I know it because I'm Mexican too.Also the movie has an excellent narration by Daniel Gimenez Cacho star of a previous Cuaron film Solo Con Tu Pareja that explains the things we cannot see but that we can understand and feel. The subtle critic about Mexican society and traditions that I have talked about all along this comment is the one thing that makes this picture go from a funny comedy to an intelligent essay of the lives of young people social classes discovery and rediscovery of personality and our own soul and the final revelation of who we are and what we become when time passes by. In the lives of Julio and Tenoch there is no redemption but a clear message of their goal in life their true feelings about friendship and their sexuality. This road trip is only a pretext to tell a story about discovery and finding our true nature.Yes maybe it is a little provocative and bold but because of these characteristics And Your Mother Too is an incredible motion picture true to its meaning and compromised with the reality it is trying to show. We care about this people we care about their problems and at the end we care about our own society and we care about what we have become with time. And the true meaning of the movie's title And Your Mother Too within the narrative of the film is simply hilarious.Give this movie a chance and see it. You won't be disappointed. It has an excellent direction excellent photography its is very sexy it showcases credible performances by all its cast. But above all it has a real story real character development and real power. One great movie from a great Mexican director. Maybe not his best but really near.".

	schema:reviewBody "I read an article about this movie and some have referred to this movie as a Mexican version of American Pie.  I believe the joke was that it should be called LatinAmerican Pie.  Now I enjoyed the AP movies and don't believe them to be crappy movies but they possess no depth and substance. Y Tu Mama Tambien is much more sexually explicit than those two films put together but it's in no way exploitative.  It's a sliceoflife story involving teens and who's gonna deny that 80 percent of a teenager's life revolves around sex?The two main characters though utterly repulsive in nature aren't totally unsympathetic like the characters in Larry Clark's Kids.  Through the narration we get a sense of the characters' backgrounds and why they are the way they are.  We aren't simply thrown into this torrent of teenage decadence without a net.I'm sure very few people will regard this as a comedy but it's filled with hilarious moments mostly involving the explicit sexual conversations. Though it leaves you with a sad feeling at the end it doesn't keep you depressed the whole way through.As well as being a characterdriven youth dramaroad movie it's basically a film about life most specifically fate and how it works in mysterious ways and how many people live parallel lives and simply aren't aware.  I'm not going to pretend as if I wasn't stimulated by the sex scenes or seeing the Spanish actress who plays Luisa naked but I didn't enjoy it just because of its sexual content.  Too many movies nowadays forbid you the pleasure of going on a character's journey.  Too many movies are all about plot and more specially about plot devices.  Screenwriters spend so much time developing plot that character development is put on the backburner.  When you get to know the characters this deeply you're able to connect with them feel their pleasure and feel their pain.  Y Tu Mama Tambien is one of those rare characterdriven gems that is definitely worth a trip to the video store!My score  9 out of 10".

Using three central characters  two immature adolescent males and a young woman in crisis  set in a roadtrip situation it was hardly a roadtrip movie.  Nor was it an adolescent movie.  Nor was it a womanincrisis movie. Nor was it about sex.  Instead what starts out with a sizzling but ditzy prologue becomes something much deeper and much more profound as it goes along.  By the end I was breathless and somewhat stunned.  The character study is amazing.  The societal insights are haunting.  The shared humanity it exposes is painful at time but ultimately reaffirming and uplifting. These are three of the most memorable identifiable and completely human characters I've seen on screen in ages.  They taught me more about life and the human species than the last ten movies I've seen put together.  I'll not soon forget Julio Tenoch and Luisa and their eyeopening journey to Boca del Cielo.".

	schema:headline " A comment on economics and sexuality";
	schema:reviewBody "Y tu mam tambin offers an extreme insight into the rampant sexuality of Mexico's young adults. The film depicts lives of two teenage boys against the backdrop of presentday Mexico. In his film Alfonso Cuarn not only describes the sexual experimentation of Mexican youth but he also addresses the impact wavering politics and an unstable economy has on the Mexican people as a whole. The film takes place in 2001 just one year after the election of Vincente Fox a member of the opposition party. After about 70 years of revolutionary presidents Mexican government underwent a radical change during the time of the narrative as well as the film's release. Mexico has undergone numerous financial fluctuations throughout its history as a country and recent years have brought along various economic lows. The extreme changes in economy throughout history caused Mexico to have a large separation between each of its economic classes. In his narrative the two young boys who take a journey to a beautiful land with a beautiful woman seem to represent the desires of most Mexicans during this insecure time. Julio Gael Garca Bernal and Tenoch Diego Luna embark on a thrilling journey filled with sexual exploration and an investigation of their inner selves. After convincing the beautiful Luisa Maribel Verd to take a trip with them to an imaginary beach the trio heads off in search of adventure. Selfdiscovery ensues when Luisa seduces both boys and convinces them to make love with each other during their last romantic encounter. The raw sexuality displayed throughout this movie seems to encapsulate the uninhibited nature of Mexican youth. While the full frontal nudity and unashamed sexual acts performed on screen may be disturbing to an American audience Mexican cinema seems to embrace sexuality with open arms. While they do not leave anything to the imagination the sex scenes throughout Y tu mam tambin are beautifully orchestrated. These scenes absorb the magnificence of sexual attraction and the inhibition that comes along with this temptation. While the film utilizes the characteristics of raw sexuality at its core the underlying message of the film seems to encompass the trials of politics and economy within Mexican society. Julio comes from a lowermiddleclass family while his best friend Tenoch is the son of a highranking politician. As their mental age begins to grow throughout the film the distinction among their varying classes also becomes clear. It is this distinction that ultimately drives them apart. Cuarn uses the distinct lives of these two boys to comment on the state of Mexico's political affairs. While the large separation between classes is rooted in economics the separation also occurs within the lifestyles and moral character of each class's constituents. Cuarn's film Y tu mam tambin depicts the raw sexuality apparent in Mexican society and also indirectly comments on the political atmosphere of the country. Through the use of a compelling story of selfdiscovery and the beautiful landscapes of the Mexican countryside Cuarn offers his audience a glimpse of Mexico through the eyes of one of its citizens. While the underlying meanings apparent throughout the film are deeply rooted in the political principles of Mexican society the narrative of the film introduces a moving story that forces its audience to fall in love with its characters despite their downfalls. On a scale of 1  10 Y tu mam tambin is definitely a 10.".

One in which you can really appreciate the sure hand of director Alfonso Cuaron working at the top of his form with an excellent group of actors which proves that when someone of this magnitude decides to make a good film about interesting characters in contemporary Mexico one can expect a fine finished product.Alfonso and Carlos Cuaron have created people and situations that are very believable. The script is fine. Y tu mama tambien is about awakening and about reaching maturity. It's a great Mexican Road movie done with a lot of care.The Cuarons shows us a slice of life that could happen not only in that country but one that is universal. Producers and directors in Mexico should see this film and learn how to do future movies even though the popular taste runs into the horrible soap operas popular in Mexican TV. The Cuarons have turned out a magnificent script and have turned away from those popular melodramas that are a staple of the film industry of our neighbor to the South.Gael Garcia Bernal who was excellent in Amores Perros here demonstrates once again what an actor can do given the right scenario and obviously a lot of freedom to give life to Julio. Diego Luna is also very credible in his portrayal of the son of a rich man on the road to discover himself. Obviously the underlying theme is that both like each other but it never comes out as they both are so closeted and think themselves of being straight in such a macho atmosphere.Maribel Verdu plays the pivotal role of Luisa. She sees right through the boys but has to play the part since they are the salvation from her miserable marriage. Here as in other Spanish films she lets us know she is an actress who likes to take chances. This was the right vehicle for her and she takes advantage of a role that makes her outshine the rest of the cast.One can only hope more interesting things coming from this director and Mexico's gain is our loss as it's obvious Mr. Cuaron's incursion into American films have not been as satisfactory as his work here.".

Likewise Luisa's motivation seems more despair than romancedriven.  Thus the trio's trek in search of the idyllic Boca del Cielo is reminiscent of the forlorn lovers' quest for emotional fulfillment in the Bertolucci film.Comparison with the Antonioni opus stems from Cuaron's script seemingly being about a carefree liberated trio on a journey for fun when in fact it's really about escape from their own worst enemiesthemselves.After a particularly talky beginning complete with abundant narrations the film settles in on its main theme and the dialogue becomes more pointed. While the camera work is generally appropriate Cuaron tends to rely on long to mediumshots with nary a closeup.  The result of this is a somewhat distant enactment in which the viewer is held a bit at arm's length from the action.  One seldom gets close enough to become intimately acquainted with these people.  In the end one is touched by important revelations which are crucial to understanding that which has transpired.  Yet the viewer's emotional involvement is perhaps less than what it might have been given closer perspectives.This film obviously impressed many people and I must agree the work by the principles is uniformly solid. This is a last tango which has made its mark as a distinctive film work.".

Find out where it's playing and buy yourself a ticket in fact bring as many of your friends as you can such as I did and I promise you will all somehow have enjoyed it in a way films are rarely enjoyed. I do not feel that I will be able to describe exactly what I felt having seen this film but if you would like to see my effort then read on.This is the story of 2 teenagers Tenoch and Julio best friends their whole lives which have indulged in many of life's guilty pleasures. We meet them at a point when their respective present girlfriends are leaving to study in Italy leaving the 2 friends on their own for the summer. In the short time after their departure we see a whole new side of the boys. They masturbate to the thought of Salma Hayek smoke weed drink hard and flirt with another man's wife. She is a beautiful older woman named Luisa at a wedding who in turn is Tenoch's cousin's wife. They flirt with her and invite her to come with them to the fictional beach Heaven's Mouth. She is of course reluctant but takes them up on the offer after her husband one night calls her to confess he cheated on her. This is the beginning of the road trip to the nonexistent beach that will change their lives.An unidentified man narrates the entire film and when he speaks all goes silent in the scenes serving as a moving freeze frame if you will. He speaks the future of the lives we are watching these people interact with and ultimately you begin to worry what will be of there own future. During this road trip to the fictional beach all 3 main characters meet new and interesting people in new and interesting parts of Mexico. It makes them ponder life as their own past experiences begin to unravel in their intimate and personal conversations. Not before long the compounded sexual tension between them is in a way relieved but to mixed consequences. All of the subtle characteristics of jealousy anger passion naivety become completely real.These characters are so believably acted that when you see these actors in interviews or in other films you'll almost feel cheated. Relationships like this simply don't seem like they can be cheated yet through some form of skill and humanity every element comes together just right never distracting or deterring you from the story.Featured are some of the bestshot sex scenes ever as one of my friends pointed out as a matter of fact. Y tu Mama Tambien' finds a way of making all of it's moments feel intimate and genuine yet never in bad taste. Alfonso Cuaron makes it difficult for us to believe what we are seeing at times is only movie which serves this tale all the more. The shaky Road Film Style' cinematography used here is perfect in capturing this uncommon and unbalanced relationship. You are kept on your toes at all times expecting something or someone to break. The dialogue is fresh and funny the kind you just know cannot be faked that in fact somewhere somehow the writer or actors uttered those phrases. I am convinced that a great majority of this film was improvised whatever the case may be. This film is obviously more than flesh more than experimenting youth. Take some of your favorite moments from mediocre mainstream movies like American Pie 1 and 2' and remove all the slapstick value. You will realize that there is much more there than you ever saw before. That is what I think in small part this film strives to achieve. It succeeds. We can sympathize with theses characters every step of the way because as we first get to know them you realize that they either are like you someone you know knew or maybe someone you always wished you could be. By the time things begin to happen to these characters you yourself begin to feel part of their journey.This is an experience many of you won't take part in and that is the sincere shame. Instead a great majority of people have been walking out of The Scorpion King' unchallenged and unentertained. Y Tu Mama Tambien' offers a true form of escape one that no blockbuster will dare. It's the lives few of us will ever live for better or worse. What transcends from the screen to your hearts and minds is as eye opening as anything you'll ever see and as effecting if not more as your own personal life experience. Bold words? Go see it and you tell me.Note Please feel free to contact me and share your thoughts on this film or on my review of it.".

	schema:headline " A Mexican masterpiece that's full of youth ribald sex politics economics and death.";
	schema:reviewBody "SpoilersAlfonso Cuarn's Y Tu Mam Tambin' is an instant classic that's bursting with sexy fun but this Mexican movie about two oversexed boys on the road with a beautiful and sad older woman is haunted by tragedy and history  film history as well as the political and economic kind.  It's amazing how Gael Garca Bernal and Diego Luna as Julio and Tenoch work off each other they have a hysterical time laughing and laughing.  I couldn't help wondering if when they shot some of these scenes they themselves may have been high on some of the superior grade sticky' mota their characters love and praise so much.  These frisky pups so eager for sex so incompetent and overhasty when they get the chance having such a wonderful time with the sexy Spanish lady with the impressive tits are very real but quite symbolic the Mexican upper class and the lower middle class inseparable and cautiously in love with each other going to bed with Spain to acquire some sophistication but wait!  Spain Spain is dying while Mexico as Luisa the assured somber Maribel Verd tells the boys breathes with life.' It's all haunted by mortality and pursued by corruption and their summer is the end of an era for them.  Back in Mexico City their sexual tutor is gone and they are no longer friends it's over la commedia  finita.  Julio and Tenoch have no choice but to act out their social destinies separately as history decrees.Alfonso Cuarn and his brother Carlos have produced a movie that is as sophisticated and multilayered as it is entertaining.  If last year's Mexican hit Amores Perros' was a homage structurally anyway to Quentin Tarentino's Pulp Fiction' this one is a homage to the French Nouvelle Vague and most specifically to Truffaut's Jules et Jim' itself the tale of two different kinds of young men bosom buddies both more than a little in love with each other unified and separated by their far more sophisticated lady love embodied by the sublime and unforgettable Jeanne Moreau.  The voiceovers in Y Tu Mam' mimic the same device so often used in many New Wave movies particularly in Jules et Jim' and as in Truffaut's film they are a constant reminder of the fact that this is just a moment in time that it all ends and in Cuarn's version the narrator talks about death degeneration road kill disease all kinds of disasters that happen around and before and after the events of the charming and ribald little story of Julio Tenoch and Luisa. The action freezes during these voiceovers to emphasize the momentary nature of the story and to break the jaunty rhythm with the introduction of an awareness of politics mortality and history. This goes well beyond the Nouvelle Vague model and as one writer has put it is as if the American Pie' DVD had a director's commentary by Susan Sontag or G.K. Galbraith. Sure this movie is hilariously sexy and ebullient.  But there's a whole lot going on here. The Mexican obsession with death is strong in Y Tu Mam' the combination of death and vibrant sexuality and love of life is a rich dish for a gringo palate.  But this isn't just spicy food  it's a brilliantly constructed movie that works on many levels.Y Tu Mam Tambin' moves with an energetic and liquid flow from the first. This is very assured almost blessd filmmaking.  Scene follows scene with imperceptible grace never held too long never cut short. The visual rhythm is perfectly sustained. There aren't any wrong notes. The whole cast are constantly alive and right.  Bernal and Luna just seem made to act in this film. Bernal's beauty and his gifts are indicated by his presence in both this and Amores Perros' and his receiving Mexico's highest film acting prize. Cuarn works with a rich palate  his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki always has a lot going on in the frame.  In a road house the camera just wanders off and catches local people an old lady stiffly dancing to a radio.  Mexico is constantly present without being commented upon the voiceover doesn't belabor the images but augments them the boys drive by many police roadblocks oblivious of the repression.  The landscapes are subtly beautiful never conventional. There's so much going on that I couldn't think of writing about the movie till I'd seen it twice.  But none of the peripheral action and scenery that make the palate of the movie so rich ever distract from the story.  All focus is on the story and its irresistible momentum in every single frame so it's only afterward that you realize the full complexity of Y Tu Mam' and the beauty of its imagery. For me images that remain are a short tracking shot that goes over to the window of Luisa's flat and looks down to see her meet Julio and Tenoch and get into the car to go on their journey to the mythical beach the country club pool with its wide expanse and the ranks of elegant modernistic lounge chairs behind a stream of water spraying the perfect lawn the rich leathery tan of an old lady's face momentarily glimpsed with a patch of red flower a lovely shot in a bar worthy of CartierBresson showing Luisa phoning her husband through a little window while in an identical window we see reflected Julio and Tenoch playing a game of hand soccer the pigs scattering across the beach at dusk and ruining the boys' encampment. Why some critics have called this movie lightweight or even bothered to drag out the phrase road movie' I can't imagine I guess they overlooked the burden of sad knowledge and the cinematic genius amid so much happy fun.".

It is the first film I have seen with Gael Garcia Bernal Julio in this film and boy is he great! I love the portrait the film draws of Teenage Boys lust. The contrast with the mature and controlled Luisa is very interesting. Altogether I'd recommend it warmly to anyone who enjoys road movies in general and great characters. Obviously it is better in the original so if you understand a bit of Spanish don't be put off by the subtitles you end up reading them really quickly and still enjoy the images....".

	schema:headline " A fabulous story and a guaranteed good movie";
	schema:reviewBody "WARNING This is a review which I will reveal the storyLiving life to the fullest can make life balanced as revealed through the characters in Alfonso Cuaron's Mexican motion picture Y Tu Mama Tambien. When looking at the movie cover and movie rating perhaps the film seems like the Mexican version of a mix between Road Trip and American Pie but after watching the film deep life lessons can be found in the background of the picture.  After being enthralled with the message and theme of this movie I was excited to test Linda Seger's theory Creating the Myth'.  I knew that most mainstream Hollywood movies would follow this theory but was interested to see if this theory transcended both language and culture in this independent film. After the completion of Y Tu Mama Tambien an additional time I was surprised to find that Linda Seger's Healing Myth' theory truly explains the components Alfonso Cuaron's masterpiece. Before delving into the specific nature of the theory describing the colloquialism of the movie helps explain the movie's cultural phenomenon. The audience is introduced in Spanish with subtitles to two Mexican teenagers Tenoch and Julio who are seemingly free for the summer after their girlfriends leave for a European vacation. Despite having to read subtitles the movie is easy to understand by the characters lively expressions and acting ability. Julio and Tenoch stumble across a beautiful woman Luisa who happens to be the wife of a distant cousin.  They lightheartedly invite her to go to a beach really joking about it.  After Luisa finds out her husband has cheated on him she agrees to go out on a road trip to a beach named Heaven's Mouth. On this journey she seduces the teenagers and has sex with both of them. The sexuality of the film is realistic which in no way is pornographic or crude but rather honest and respectful.  In their journey to the beach many scenes of the reality and blight of rural Mexican life can be seen through the windows of the old Volkswagen. People being searched at checkpoints drug busts deadly traffic accidents and poor villagers walking the streets all give the film an underlying message reminding that many people are left behind in rich economies penniless and hopeless. Once reaching the beach they are in paradise and relax and live in the beauty of nature. As the teenagers have to go home Luisa decides to stay at the beach. The ending shocks the audience with a surprising twist.  It is revealed that Luisa knew she had had cancer and soon died after the guys left.  Much meaning is added to the movie after this realization is made and Luisa's character takes on a true mold of the healing myth. Seger's theory begins by stating All of us have similar experiences' Seger 161. This theory therefore not only applies to American films but all people in all cultures.  This is evident in seeing the two seventeen year old Mexican teenagers in this film.  The emotions growing up searching for oneself all humans can relate to this. Although the film does not fit the popular mold of the Hero Myth it fits the Healing Myth mold almost perfectly. The oneline description of this myth is some character is 'broken' and must leave home to become whole again' Seger 165.  Luisa the attractive female is this broken person who flees home for two main reasons.  The reason the audience is led to believe for most the film is because of her husband's affairs she has left the life in Mexico to get away from her problems.  What the audience does not realize during the duration of the flick is that Luisa is actually diagnosed with cancer and is terminally ill.  Her need for rejuvenation and balance takes her to Heaven's Mouth and allows her to become whole again. She does this by simply living a life which is meaningful and seeking the truth. In telling colorful stories of old times and sucking the marrow out of all interactions this allows her to become whole and ready to die. In realizing her frailty and death she realizes the importance to live up to the ideal of  living life to the fullest'. As Seger's theory gets more specific it discusses the many ways the character can be broken.  Whether spiritual physical emotional or even sexual the journey which the character goes must heal the broken aspect of them. Luisa is broken on many levels.  The one that is apparent to the audience is the sexual and emotional brokeness.  She cries her self to sleep after she hears her husband has cheated on her and sexually misses his love and presence. This is the outer wound' in a sense that the audience can see it. Just as the theory states this outer wound forces Luisa into exile which begins her process of transformation.  Seger discusses the inner wound' as something that the character does not know about.  This is a different variation in the theory because in fact Luisa knows that she is suffering from cancer. The interesting twist is that the audience is the one who does not know about this wound and is hidden until the film's conclusion. Although this shows a difference from the theory and the film it does not disprove the theory.  It is merely a trapping which is a product of the culture. As Seger states The trappings may be different the twist and turns that create suspense might change from culture to culture...but underneath it all its the same story' Seger 161. In noting this variation the audience can fully appreciate the beauty of the film's writing.  Although her cancer is a physical ailment this brokeness is also inner due to the place she keeps it.  Luisa does not let cancer slow her down but rather she lifts herself to live life to the fullest. This transformation of the way she lives her life can inspire all people to break out of their shell and live everyday as if it were their last. The archetype present in the film also adds to the cultural phenomenon and proves Seger's theory in yet another way.  The archetypes usually found in hero myths are commonly present characters. Y Tu Mama Tambien does not have the typical archetype in that it is not a character but rather the narrator's voice who fits the archetype.  This archetype is the wise old man who provides the audience with special knowledge.  This part is essential to the success of the film. The narrator has an older deep calm and soothing voice which gives the impression he is wise and intelligent.  The narrator's voice fills in all the gaps of the movie which are not said by the characters which allows him to serve as the wise man for the audience. One example which summarizes the narrator's purpose happens during the long car trip. Suddenly the noise of the movie becomes silent for two seconds and the narrator's voice calmly comes in. The voice explains that the village they were passing was the village which Tenoch's nanny was born in.  His nanny was forced to leave the village alone at the age of thirteen to look for work because of the desperate poverty she was experiencing.  This really contrasts the two worlds present in Mexico the rich upper class and the marginalized poor.  Throughout the film the narrator's voice provides similar comments which opens the viewer to an entirely new insight of the often painful Mexican life. The narrator even reveals the secret of Luisa's cancer in the end. He then tells of the way she continued on with her life as balanced and full of energy. The narrator captures the essence of the film in his wise old man archetype which he beautifully fulfills. Balance in life is something that all people want but do not necessarily seek out actively until it is too late.  Luckily for Luisa she balanced her life by simply taking a trip with two guys to a beach.  In this journey she learned life lessons of friendship humor compassion pain and joy.  The movie has certain differences from the exact mold of the Healing Myth but those minute differences do not affect the overall theory. Rather they add to the uniqueness and power of the movie. In closely following Seger's Healing Myth' Luisa truly has been healed maybe not from cancer but healed from all worry and fear of the painful world and she enjoys life as a blessing.".

The movie has certain differences from the exact mold of the Healing Myth but those minute differences do not affect the overall theory. Rather they add to the uniqueness and power of the movie. In closely following Seger's Healing Myth' Luisa truly has been healed maybe not from cancer but healed from all worry and fear of the painful world and she enjoys life as a blessing.";

In this story Tenoch and Julio are two friends whose girlfriends go away to Italy for a little while and are left with not much to do outside of partying and masturbation until they get an idea to go to a secluded beach called Heaven's Mouth and ask the married and 10 years older Luisa to come along.

The only flaws keeping Cuaron's latest work from being a great coming of age tale is that the narration while keeping in some good insight along the way becomes heavy handed at times and gives information that is either humorist news along the area the characters are traveling or about the characters themselves which isn't a bad thing until it digs into things that don't have much relevance to the rest of the picture or even to the characters when you think about what is really up on the screen. Plus the very last scene is too conventional to be placed as where the film leads up to he should've ended it when Luisa goes into the ocean the last time.But still these squabbles shouldn't stop people from seeing this movie overall it delivers splendidly in it's uninhibited and mature ways. Props also go to the performances by the three leads and to the cinematography.".

Sample insight they agree that masturbation feels good. A woman joins them adding nothing to the mix. After two hours it ends. There is no story no characterization no relationships not even a hint of writing or directing talent.It's not the actors' fault. They dutifully disrobe simulate intercourse and they look okay naked. But there is less meaning here than there is in the average porn vid.I guess some of these rave reviews are from kids who are excited to see nudity and hear dirty talk. I direct these children to their older brothers' socks drawer where they'll find more intelligent handling of sexual and gender issues in any 4Hour XXX video.Though the cast is attractive even the sex scenes boring. There is not an interesting or original thought shot or line of dialogue in the whole film.The idea that this movie has anything to say about politics or sex roles or coming of age is ludicrous. The morons who compare this movie to masterpieces by Truffaut Fellini or Almodovar should be shot for sacrilege. It takes more than two actors and an actress on screen to make JULES ET JIM.To repeat ALL THAT HAPPENS in this movie is two boys and one woman ride in a car get naked sit around on the beach have sex and read page after page of pointless clichd dialogue. These aren't characters they're voids with names.The filmmakers haven't the talent to even begin to suggest characterization or plot development. The political side which some posters find so intriguing amounts to the narrator telling us near the end that the PRI lost an election  which has no connection to anything said or done by the characters. Faux meaning doesn't get any more faux than this.It would have been easy to append a phony political point to the film maybe by having the leads murdered by the oppressed masses  giving the film at least an illusion of meaning  but the filmmakers aren't smart enough to figure this out.I've seen many films I've disliked even hated but there was always SOME talent involved in their making. This one provokes nothing  no emotion no thought no reaction of any kind. It's like staring at a blank wall for two hours.I recommend Y Tu Mama Tambien to very horny very stupid teenagers and to anyone curious to see what happens when people with absolutely no talent and absolutely nothing to say get their hands on a movie camera.".

While I loved the Mexican backdrop spending time with two teenagers who are hardly smarter than Beavis and Butthead seemed to me quite a drag. Yes well observed but what are we getting here? People that have nothing to say and are saying it!The road movie has only so many cliches to them and this obeys most of them. They all have to have a scene where one person argues with another and they get and walk. Then the driver drives alongside and begs the other person to get back in. Do you think this doesn't happen here? And there are two boys and one girl  do you think there isn't going to be tears and jealousy before and after bedtime? This should be called road movie by numbers!There are some lovely rolling scenes with nice music and just as you are getting to enjoy it we get in to another my dick is bigger than your dick style shouting match. On the roadside people seem to be being hassled by law and order or living improvised lives but the film doesn't seem to careless. They drive on by. Depth? There isn't any.The problem with sex is that I am not shocked by it. Sex doesn't have to be sexy indeed sex when viewed abstractly from medium distance looks quite funny. I don't know why a woman in her late twentiesearly thirties I am presuming here based on the age of the actress would want to hang with these clowns. For sex? When did an attractive woman ever have to go short of casual sex. In real life clever men hang out with stupid women  you never see it the other way round!This is the kind of film the French have be doing for years only much better. Just off the top of my head Pauline at the Beach and Betty Blue are miles better films so why are they rated lower than this? Maybe this got good word of mouth and the people that saw it loved it? And the people that wouldn't like it were kept away or turned off after five minutes. One of the top hundred films ever made  what a complete and utter joke!".

It is burden enough when the country has a healthy economy a long history with film and political stability. But when the country lacks any of these each marginally competent film gets blown up to mythic proportions.So it was within a whirlwind of expectations that I viewed this as a nonMexican North American.

In the last few decades this has merged with postmodern fabulism or magical reality' to produce some similarly great art.But there is a backlash from the street which promotes the frank impulsive sexuality of hispanics. And so we have Spanish films that are about sensual caprice. And people flock to them for selfdefinition. I recently saw a most amazing film Luca y el sexo' which to my mind was a superb blend of the two Spanish selfaware abstraction folded into a selfserving passion for sex as life. Both literary and cinematic.Now along comes this film that doesn't make any such synthesis. It in fact sticks entirely to the passionforlife' side goobered up with some political commentary and wrapped in a traditional dying girl' wrapper. That this is deliberate can be seen in the girl leaving her writer husband whose friends talk about intellectual things she doesn't think important. Its pleasant enough especially the dialog and I didn't mind watching it. But knowing that millions of Mexicans adjust their sense of self using this template is somewhat tragic.So let's emphasize what element remains of interest the narrative structure. There are three narrative stances here the one within the story centered on the boys the underwater' one presumably the placeholder for what would be the folding in a better film and presaging some new awareness in the story and the spoken narrator. These are separated by very clever sound editing and constitute the best element of the film. All the folding is done here for instance one road is blocked by a traffic death and later on a different road the narrator informs us that if they had been on that road tens years prior they would have seen an accident with similar social context.If you work hard this spoken narration is sometimes clever but all in all you'd be far better off watching Luca y el sexo' and celebrating hispanic passion both sensual and intellectual.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 4 Has some interesting elements.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Coming of Age genre is so well worn that when a movie like Y Tu Mama Tambien comes along the frank authenticity can be jarring. Although the plot doesn't steer far away from convention at each point the viewer's anticipation is deftly sidestepped and the scene is injected with a dose of raw emotion that has little to do with Drama and everything to do with reality. It is so refreshing to see characters behave in a way that resembles personal memory if not actual experience.The guys are by often banal bratty and obnoxious  in other words quite normal teenagers  but not without their charm. They float along in their privileged bubble largely oblivious to the social tensions wracking their country except for facile quips like leftwing babes are totally hot. They have a lot to learn and their trip with Luisa is a catalyst to confronting their adolescent fantasies and indolence with a dose of reflection.As for the much talked about sexy bits they are funny erotic and utterly nonpornographic. What a pity that such a candid portrayal of sexuality seems to be nearly impossible in American film.Highly recommended.".

This is less a road film than it is a comedy of very bad manners.

By the end they are very very different people and in danger of becoming sort of plain vanilla postteens whatever the Mexican equivalent of the Japanese salaryman is they may well be launched along that path.This film is rated R but many will wonder how it avoided an X. Be forewarned.  But some of the sex scenes are hilarious  especially if the viewer has ever been a teenager. Cuaron uses voiceovers not so much to explain the story but to quietly show that all lives have sidebar events beyond the tale being told events that can be described in one or two sentences and which illuminate the fullness of a character's journey.The scenery is gorgeous.Definitely a different and engrossing story.".

In fact many film snobs immediately assume something artistic and deep must be going on because they see a film with subtitles and unknown foreign actors.This movie has been hailed as an amazing insight into Mexican culture and politics. However any cultural elements explored here are so general they could be applied to just about any country around the world. Yes there are class differences and income differences in Mexican society. Some people are more privileged that others. Big surprise. Apparently teenage boys in Mexico are incredibly horny and will have sex with just about anything that resembles a woman. Uh I think that's kind of a universal truth around the world. Sometimes Mexico like every other country goes through periods of political turmoil. This is rather vaguely hinted at in the film and isn't an amazing revelation.The movie's rather obvious observations are compounded by the three main characters' annoying and emptyheaded personalities. These are definitely not deep thinking individuals. Julio and Tenoch exhibit the macho attitude and homophobia one would find in teenage boys just about anywhere. So we're stuck with nearly two hours of their sexual ramblings as they drive through the Mexican countryside with their older female companion Luisa. Luisa is certainly the most interesting and likable character of the bunch. At first we think she's a confused middleaged woman with a dissolving marriage looking for a mindless fling with two young men. It's painfully obvious early on that her relationship with them will be a sexually charged one. The plot twist at the end of the film where we discover she was aware cancer would claim her life soon at least brings a little depth and intrigue to her character. Which is more than one can say for anyone else in this film. Also the homosexual encounter between Julio and Tenoch is not much of a surprise either. Sometimes the most macho and homophobic guys can have homosexual tendencies. It almost feels as if this scene was added just for shock value rather than to say something meaningful.This isn't a road trip movie or coming of age movie. In the end there's not much of a feeling that the characters have grown or changed with the possible exception of Luisa. I don't see it as much of a character study either because we're stuck with three uninteresting unintelligent central characters. The conclusion of the film is certainly its strongest point and at least helps to give the feeling the movie was trying to say something insightful even if it fails miserably.".

While an omniscient voice narrates the past present and future of seemingly meaningless background events the boys continue their trip oblivious to all but their own libidos. Although skilfully executed through voice overs the political statement doesn't quite cement with the main storyline as intended. An interesting watch if you are patient enough to handle the slow moving storyline but it does feel like Alfonso Cuaron is trying a bit too hard to be arty and missing out on simple clarity. After opening into an explicit sex scene you're bombarded with names and background information and spend the next few scenes trying to work out who's who when it really doesn't matter. Well worth a watch though if only for the exceptionally well written characters. The boys are especially believable and development of Luisa's character from fragile tagalong to free spirit is wellpaced. Good nothing special but worth watching nonetheless.".

So much as to hide her from herself and to help thwart a cholera outbreak this is a marriage more than on the rocks. This is a cold indifferent and loveless partnership in a vast unknown and deadly environment that will test both these flightless lovebirds and with the hardships and tolerances more than any had ever anticipated. A visual delight amid the pain and suffering of a dying people and failing marriage. Will a cure be found for both before it's too late?";

Beautiful scenery and costumes a cast of thousands and enough background information to make you feel you are more educated about a time and place than you were before you saw the movie.What this film offers the fortunate viewer that many other movies of its kind do not are lead characters you can actually empathize with and grow to care about. Walter and Kitty are far more likable and worth rooting for than I don't know let's say Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas in the English Patient see? I don't even remember their characters' names. The movie's tagline Sometimes the greatest journey is the distance between two people succinctly points to the heart of this film and what makes it work so well the journey of a couple who married for the wrong reasons towards true intimacy with each other.On one level the plot is so simple and straightforward that a one line summary gives the whole story away and for that reason I will refrain from providing that information as much as possible. It is enough to know that it is the story of The Fanes Walter the shy bookish bacteriologist and Kitty the shallow haughty young woman he becomes infatuated in and persuades to marry him. Walter takes Kitty to Shanghai where he works in a government lab. Circumstances lead Walter to relocate them to a more remote area of China in the throes of a cholera epidemic. It is in this setting that the parallel stories unfold the story of a doctor and his wife living in the house of a dead missionary's family as the doctor tries to get control of the conditions responsible for the epidemic and the story of the couple's journey towards rediscovering each other.The impressive skill that Ms. Watts and Mr. Norton bring to their work truly makes you believe that that the first challenge combating cholera amid colonial unrest and nationalist hostilities is easier than the task of repairing a damaged marriage and with each uneasy glance and every unsaid word you feel what these two people feel. And that is the beauty of The Painted Veil. Fans of Ms. Watts and Mr. Norton will have reason to rejoice this is a performance unlike any I have ever seen Ms. Watts give. There is nothing of what was becoming her trademark emotionally fragile woman in shambles persona on display here. And what of Edward Norton? Well after his turn in The Illusionist earlier in the year and now Walter Fane all I can say is move over Ralph Fiennes there's a new sexy repressed stiffupperlipped sensually simmering under the surface leading man in town.The Painted Veil is an intelligently adapted welldirected film with two charismatic awardworthy lead performances and a strong supporting cast including Liev Schreiber Diana Rigg and most notably Toby Jones as the Fanes' neighbor. It is also wonderfully entertaining and a good introduction to the period piecehistorical epic genre some viewers have been avoiding due to fear of suffocation.".

There hasn't been a hugely successful film of this type since 1996's The English Patient. We haven't seen a worthwhile film in this genre since Neil Jordon's underrated The End of the Affair in 1999 which not coincidentally was an adaptation of one of the great novels from Maugham's fellow Brit and contemporary Graham Greene and addressed many of the same themes.What The Painted Veil lacks in epic sweep it makes up for in scores with its nuanced performances and subversive outlook on romance and true love.

The only negative thing I can say is that there was a point when editing needed to be tighter because the movie dragged a bit in defining Kitty's boredom and isolation. The audience got the message much earlier. But this was only a brief irritation because the movie was so fascinating. The movie does deviate from the novel in that the ending has changed somewhat but few people have probably read this novel and most won't even notice.

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. This is a surprisingly wonderful adaptation of the W Somerset Maugham novel. Maugham passed away many years ago but in his time was an incredibly famous and popular playwright and novelist. His best known work is probably The Razor's Edge. Part of the surprise is the beauty of the film since it is directed by John Curran who has no directing credits to his name since 1995's excellent Babe the pig. Curran's eye and talent are on full display here with the aesthetics of 1920's China and the devastation of cholera.The story is simple but oh so elegant. Edward Norton and Naomi Watts are a very odd couple whom circumstances bring to an illconceived marriage. They are quite the odd couple and not the least bit charming together even in the good moments. Norton stumbles on an affair between Watts and Liev Schreiber and the next thing we know Norton and Watts are on a two week journey into the depths of a Chinese jungle where a devastating cholera epidemic is occurring. The horrible situation brings out the best in each as people and finally as a couple. Along the way their lives are impacted by two rather odd acquaintances Toby Jones off his fine turn as Truman Capote and the long lost Diana Rigg as the Mother Superior at the local orphanage.The story is tight interesting and believable ... all signs of a terrific writer. The acting is worthy of such fine material and direction. Mr. Norton is wonderful as the quietly simmering bacteriologist who lacks interpersonal skills and warmth until the tragic environment brings about selfdiscovery. Ms. Watts continues her amazing run of topcaliber performances and is one of our top 3 actresses today. She is so subtle at times that it is easy to take her skills for granted. Mr. Schreiber Mr. Jones and Ms. Rigg are all excellent in their roles and lets hope that Ms. Rigg will continue to bless us with her screen magic. It has been 40 years since she was the sexy Emma Peel from The Avengers but her presence on the screen is very welcome and needed.There is a haunting score that continues throughout the film and some tremendous piano work credited to Lang Lang. The mood of the music and the film setting work together to deliver the effect of reading the novel as we watch the film. Quite a knockout for director Curran who hopefully will not now disappear for the next decade!".

	schema:headline " Finelyobserved colonialera drama";
	schema:reviewBody "When I was nearly eighteen I married. To the prettiest girl at art college. Lack of confidence vanished with virginity. I loved her with unbearable blinding intensity. We painted each other with unquenchable desire. What could go wrong?Our film's title goes back to a stanzaLift not the painted veil which those who liveCall Life though unreal shapes be pictured thereAnd it but mimic all we would believeShelley's poem furnishes the title of Somerset Maugham's oriental love story. That classic set in the 1920s has three times been made a film. Our latest offering comes like fiveyear incense from Sinophile Edward Norton with screenwriter Ron Nyswaner Philadelphia and producer Sara Colleton.Two people whose characters are a million miles apart wed in London. They travel to Hong Kong. Suddenly they can no longer play the game that society has set them. Facing their own true natures is a journey of discovery greater than geographical distance. Visually and emotionally restrained given the passions and breathtaking scenery involved the Painted Veil shines with intellectual integrity. If only you can get excited enough about it.Brilliant bacteriologist Walter Fane Edward Norton only occasionally gives way to anything as unscientific as showing feelings. Kitty Naomi Watts is warm and natural but marries Walter more because it seems like a sensible thing to do than for any overriding love. She enjoys tennis and nice things. Walter derides such superficialities. And Walter speaks only when he has something to say. Kitty has an affair with government official Charlie Townsend a charming and seductive married man who made a science of popularity. Walter correctly labels her as stupid to think he wouldn't find out. Their trip to a cholerainfested village of Meitanfu a professional honour for Walter becomes his journey of revenge.Walter's sense of superiority is impenetrable. Even though he vomits at his first sight of suffering he finds a way to save much of the village from disease. Kitty is meanwhile wasting away through loneliness. They have yet to discover the real vibrancy behind each other's mask. As they attempt to do so the film challengingly asserts the contradiction of sexual versus spiritual love.An emotionally unintelligent man discovering the tenderness and complexity of another human being and a good yet fairly shallow woman appreciating her own potential  and the value of another's great mind. But the symbol of the 'veil' goes much further. Norton says he wanted to 'lift the veil' on issues facing China in the 1920s. If you're going to make a film set in China during the period I think there's got to be a reason for doing it other than the inherent romanticism of the location.To Kitty the work of the nuns headed by Mother Superior Diana Rigg is laudable especially with orphans. Walter on the other hand points out that they also pay parents for their children so as to indoctrinate them with Catholicism. Every Westerner is a colonialist of some sort fuelling increasing resentment with the locals. Walter carrying his torch of medicine rather than the fire of armaments believes he is 'neutral'. He is somehow 'above' the armed soldiers that he relies on. Yet his rationalism is shallow limited to believing that if only people would embrace Western ways they would have it so much easier.Kitty stays with Walter initially out of 'duty' but comes to question it when the Mother Superior says Duty is only washing one's hands when they are dirty. The philosophical challenge echoed from Maugham is whether duty and love can become one. This is the central tenet of the film. Walter indubitably seems to be following a higher 'duty' in saving people from cholera. Yet it is the experiencing of love in one form or another that gives meaning and fulfilment. That 'love' must be genuine but also under the domain of duty  else it leads astray. Walter's initial 'love' is respectful exact  and only with the lights switched off. Kitty's is that of a gifted dilettante.The performances are finely chiselled. Watts combines convincing sensuality and tenderness yet still gives her character room to express deep emotion later on. When Walter discovers her sexual liaison with Charles played by Liev Schreiber Naomi Watts' reallife partner he goes into heartlessbastardmode. Norton who majored in history at Yale produces a convincing portrait of someone who is sharply intelligent and as precise as a scalpel. His painful awakening to the fact that humans are more than complex microbes is superbly judged. Polar opposites of smooth sleazebag Charles and straightasadie Walter are movingly adjudicated by Deputy Commissioner Waddington Toby Jones. He has more insight into relationships than the rest of them put together yet are we misled by his persona? He is a good man says the young Chinese woman that we saw him tussling naked and unashamed with moments earlier.Going beyond what we believe another to be whether we put them on a pedestal or in derision may only be the first stage. Being away from familiar surroundings leaves nothing to fall back on. No painted veil.This adaptation takes excusable liberties with the plot. It is true to the spirit of Shelley's poem I had to look it up to fully appreciate that I think. It is a finely observed colonialera drama that holds attention with a subdued dignity quietly resisting the enticement to do a Merchant and Ivory. To the casual viewer it sometimes hangs between wasted opportunity and insipidness. But its themes are lovingly executed with skill and exactitude.My marriage lasted precisely one year.

	onyx:emotionText "When I was nearly eighteen I married. To the prettiest girl at art college. Lack of confidence vanished with virginity. I loved her with unbearable blinding intensity. We painted each other with unquenchable desire. What could go wrong?Our film's title goes back to a stanzaLift not the painted veil which those who liveCall Life though unreal shapes be pictured thereAnd it but mimic all we would believeShelley's poem furnishes the title of Somerset Maugham's oriental love story. That classic set in the 1920s has three times been made a film. Our latest offering comes like fiveyear incense from Sinophile Edward Norton with screenwriter Ron Nyswaner Philadelphia and producer Sara Colleton.Two people whose characters are a million miles apart wed in London. They travel to Hong Kong. Suddenly they can no longer play the game that society has set them. Facing their own true natures is a journey of discovery greater than geographical distance. Visually and emotionally restrained given the passions and breathtaking scenery involved the Painted Veil shines with intellectual integrity. If only you can get excited enough about it.Brilliant bacteriologist Walter Fane Edward Norton only occasionally gives way to anything as unscientific as showing feelings. Kitty Naomi Watts is warm and natural but marries Walter more because it seems like a sensible thing to do than for any overriding love. She enjoys tennis and nice things. Walter derides such superficialities. And Walter speaks only when he has something to say. Kitty has an affair with government official Charlie Townsend a charming and seductive married man who made a science of popularity. Walter correctly labels her as stupid to think he wouldn't find out. Their trip to a cholerainfested village of Meitanfu a professional honour for Walter becomes his journey of revenge.Walter's sense of superiority is impenetrable. Even though he vomits at his first sight of suffering he finds a way to save much of the village from disease. Kitty is meanwhile wasting away through loneliness. They have yet to discover the real vibrancy behind each other's mask. As they attempt to do so the film challengingly asserts the contradiction of sexual versus spiritual love.An emotionally unintelligent man discovering the tenderness and complexity of another human being and a good yet fairly shallow woman appreciating her own potential  and the value of another's great mind. But the symbol of the 'veil' goes much further. Norton says he wanted to 'lift the veil' on issues facing China in the 1920s. If you're going to make a film set in China during the period I think there's got to be a reason for doing it other than the inherent romanticism of the location.To Kitty the work of the nuns headed by Mother Superior Diana Rigg is laudable especially with orphans. Walter on the other hand points out that they also pay parents for their children so as to indoctrinate them with Catholicism. Every Westerner is a colonialist of some sort fuelling increasing resentment with the locals. Walter carrying his torch of medicine rather than the fire of armaments believes he is 'neutral'. He is somehow 'above' the armed soldiers that he relies on. Yet his rationalism is shallow limited to believing that if only people would embrace Western ways they would have it so much easier.Kitty stays with Walter initially out of 'duty' but comes to question it when the Mother Superior says Duty is only washing one's hands when they are dirty. The philosophical challenge echoed from Maugham is whether duty and love can become one. This is the central tenet of the film. Walter indubitably seems to be following a higher 'duty' in saving people from cholera. Yet it is the experiencing of love in one form or another that gives meaning and fulfilment. That 'love' must be genuine but also under the domain of duty  else it leads astray. Walter's initial 'love' is respectful exact  and only with the lights switched off. Kitty's is that of a gifted dilettante.The performances are finely chiselled. Watts combines convincing sensuality and tenderness yet still gives her character room to express deep emotion later on. When Walter discovers her sexual liaison with Charles played by Liev Schreiber Naomi Watts' reallife partner he goes into heartlessbastardmode. Norton who majored in history at Yale produces a convincing portrait of someone who is sharply intelligent and as precise as a scalpel. His painful awakening to the fact that humans are more than complex microbes is superbly judged. Polar opposites of smooth sleazebag Charles and straightasadie Walter are movingly adjudicated by Deputy Commissioner Waddington Toby Jones. He has more insight into relationships than the rest of them put together yet are we misled by his persona? He is a good man says the young Chinese woman that we saw him tussling naked and unashamed with moments earlier.Going beyond what we believe another to be whether we put them on a pedestal or in derision may only be the first stage. Being away from familiar surroundings leaves nothing to fall back on. No painted veil.This adaptation takes excusable liberties with the plot. It is true to the spirit of Shelley's poem I had to look it up to fully appreciate that I think. It is a finely observed colonialera drama that holds attention with a subdued dignity quietly resisting the enticement to do a Merchant and Ivory. To the casual viewer it sometimes hangs between wasted opportunity and insipidness. But its themes are lovingly executed with skill and exactitude.My marriage lasted precisely one year. We both decided to travel. If we had been isolated in a distant country like the protagonists of this film we may have discovered a more genuine love. Or killed each other. Unlike this sumptuous historical and emotional travelogue the games we play don't always paint a pretty picture.";

So beautiful and so natural does it look thanks to the breathtaking cinematography and an intense yet whimsical soundtrack. Though most of the story is set in China even the scenes of England were filmed in China which is quite an interesting change since it's usually the reverse.'The Painted Veil' is essentially about the journey of a couple a frivolous Kitty and a stubborn Walter and how they grow during this ordeal. While some have stated that the film is too slow for their liking it did not feel that way to me. Growth is best shown when the story takes its time rather than rushing. Meanwhile there is plenty of other things to enjoy such as the exquisite sceneries and the witty and creative dialogues.Edward Norton and Naomi Watts are terrific in the lead roles. They wonderfully demonstrate the transformation of Walter and Kitty. While they have the support of great dialogues and a fine director it is their nuances and chemistry that stands out. The supporting cast is equally noteworthy. Toby Jones is outstanding while Liev Schreiber brilliantly fits the part of the charming caddish Charlie and Diana Rigg is amazing as the good Samaritan.Curran's direction is quite remarkable. In addition to bringing it all together I liked how he briefly tackled some themes by suggesting both sides of the issues. For example the scene where Kitty tells Walter about the good deeds the nuns are doing Walter brings up the problem of acculturation. Curran cleverly puts layers and depth into the film unlike many period pieces which end up looking shallow and clichd.'The Painted Veil' is one of the few adaptations that work beautifully on screen. It's really a pleasure for the eyes and ears and a treat to the heart and mind.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll start with the positives first. Edward Norton is an amazing actor and lights up the screen with his talent. The music is exquisite and the scenery is breathtaking. The actor portraying Waddington captured his character exceptionally well. Out of the three film versions of this novel this particular version is the best.However I have a few major issues with this film.First and foremost much of the original message of the book is completely lost. The original book published by Maugham around 1925 is NOT the story of a woman's selfdiscovery or of spiritual awakening nor is it meant to be actionpacked. It is NOT a political book about China or its issues. It is a character study of an adulterous woman and her husband and more generally it is a study of relationships. One can compare for example Kitty and Walter's relationship to that of Waddington and his Manchu lady or to Kitty's parents' relationship or the relationship between the nuns and God. In Maugham's original story Kitty and Walter never fall in love with each other. Walter loves Kitty she never loves him. It is arguable whether or not Walter is able to forgive Kitty by the end of his short life but Kitty never truly finds a place in her heart for Walter or even cares much for him beyond a basic human level.In the book it is implied that Charlie and not Walter is the father of Kitty's unborn child and it is also implied that the child might be a girl rather than a boy. This is particularly tragic because it is stated in the book that Walter very much wanted a child whereas Charlie already had three boys with his wife and who knows how many illegitimate kids he might have had given that it is also directly stated that Kitty is not the only woman with whom he has committed adultery. The film also changes Walter's reaction to learning that his wife is expecting. In the book Walter though he acts calm and even noble by trying to send Kitty away is devastated and destroyed inside upon learning that his wife is having a child that most likely belongs to another man. While the movie does show Walter as heartbroken they also show him as being able to forgive Kitty's offense against him and they show him as being willing to accept that Kitty's child is most likely not his which is not at all how he handled the situation in the book.Further it is also heavily implied that Walter commits suicide by medically experimenting on himself and giving himself cholera shortly after Kitty tells him that she is with child. The fact that Walter who is admirable noble kind and intelligent is also completely unlovable is heartwrenching but also true to life in the book. The film destroys this poignancy by Hollywoodifying this film. The whole point of the book was a character study of people like Kitty and Walter. The novel made you stop and look at how you treated people or at least it did in my case. Maugham's novel pointed out a few things which are still very true today e.g. that many people go into relationships without truly knowing who the other person is and many people dismiss good partners for more 'exciting' ones even though the 'bad boys''bad girls' are not good human beings. People fall for charm and insincerity and overlook kindness decency intelligence and integrity. This is human nature and Maugham does not sugarcoat it.In addition Kitty never really does change in the book. She goes back to Charlie while a guest in Dorothy's home and sleeps with him. She is just as frivolous and selfish and stupid as she was initially but perhaps more honest with herself. She is callous and cold when Walter dies and simply feels relieved that he is gone and that she can start a new life. She also doesn't hesitate to impose on her own father who after her mother's death finally has a chance at peace and freedom. She remains as selfish as ever. This is also true of many people in real life who are like Kitty again Maugham does not sugarcoat human nature and I personally appreciate that. The original book is very dark and the filmmakers should have embraced this darkness instead of running and hiding from it.The movie was a major disappointment because the original tragic beauty of the novel was completely erased. I also was annoyed that some of the characters differed from their original physical descriptions in the novel but I could have lived with this if they had at least kept the original ending. At times the accents of the nonEnglish actors were a bit off and inconsistentthough Liev Schreiber does a good job with his and is probably the best at the accent.All in all there are points in the film that are lovely and enjoyable. In all honesty had the film kept the original ending and had the film stayed more true to the nature of the characters I would have given it a much higher rating. I hope that someday a good filmmaker will stay true to Maugham's original story none of the three film versions made thus far really keep to the novel which is sad because it really is a story worth telling.".

The man is John Curran an independent director with a profound vision who is riding the right path and if he continues to do so I dare to say he'll be among the big names soon. That's of course if he decides to work more constantly. He's done three fulllength features that have garnered awards and recognition.I've seen two of them We don't live here anymore and now The Painted Veil the life of a couple in the 1920's where a man came to a woman after knowing her for a day and said I came here to ask you to marry me. This is what Dr. Walter Fane Edward Norton proposes to Kitty Naomi Watts and she agrees of course because it's a chance to get as far away from her parents as possible. Fane is a microbiologist or something like it however she doesn't care. He takes her to Shanghai where she meets Charlie Townsend Liev Schreiber.Something awful and predictable happens. It hurts a character and the viewer and it lets Curran to deal with a theme he knows well adultery. Anyway this is just the beginning of a silent suffering and of a silent life with limited conversations. But strong conversations coming from Ron Nyswaner's intelligent script based on W. Somerset Maugham's novel. Overlooked by the Academy Nyswaner's work allows the characters to expose their feelings mercilessly which is exactly the way John Curran makes films.In We don't live here anymore the images were violent. Do you absolutely despise me? Kitty asks Walter. No I despise myself for allowing myself to love you once he answers. In scenes like this one Curran's closeups are daring but he's also able to measure his shots to give us some beautiful landscapes. Going back to Nyswaner he achieves the turn of the story perfectly providing us a big gallery of characters Toby Jones as an unpredictable neighbor Anthony Wong ChauSang as a harsh Chinese colonel Diana Rigg as a caring nun as he deals with strong issues like terminal diseases and social differences.Sometimes recognized as the most intelligent man in the industry a versatile and underrated actor Norton produced the movie in which he's absolutely brilliant with the English accent included and made sure Naomi Watts was in itEvery time she appears on screen in a film she looks different although we know it's her. Her range is more surprising by the day. Not so long ago Watts said in an interview that she was tired of dramatic roles where she had to cry all the time she wanted to get a big paycheck in some stupid romantic comedy. Even so she produced Curran's previous movie where she was also great and coproduced this one she must care a little bit.Ultimately with all the things it covers The Painted Veil is a beautiful story about love found as in discovered a story about regret and the purest forgiveness. I also want to comment that after watching two of his pieces Curran has something going on with streets in last scenes.".

Even so she produced Curran's previous movie where she was also great and coproduced this one she must care a little bit.Ultimately with all the things it covers The Painted Veil is a beautiful story about love found as in discovered a story about regret and the purest forgiveness. I also want to comment that after watching two of his pieces Curran has something going on with streets in last scenes.";

I think it goes deeper into the ideas of what love truly is. I think what is trying to be said through the movie is that the painted veil is the illusion of life as one wishes to see it. Once that veil is stripped away one must accept life for what it is...with all of its flaws. People must learn to see the beauty of imperfection. The movie really makes you think about what love truly is.".

It is probably one of the most romantic moving welldeveloped films I have ever seen. Edward Norton and Naomi Watts are excellent as the husband and wife who eventually reconcile with each other in the midst of a cholera epidemic in China in the 1920's. Watts is initially selfish and spoiled Norton is deeply in love with her yet is shy intelligent and rather dull. Watts' Kitty rushes into an affair with Charlie Townsend Liev Schrieber and Norton's Walter Fane soon discovers her infidelity. Angered by her betrayal he punishes her by making her accompany him to the cholera epidemic which becomes a sort of suicide mission for Walter Fane. Yet Walter and Kitty eventually see qualities in each other and themselves that they never recognised before and gradually fall in love against a backdrop of disease death and political turmoil. The film is relentlessly beautiful thoughtprovoking and quietly passionate. The two leads exchange many looks between each other and these are more revealing than any dialogue could be. While the cinematography is stunning and the backdrop of the film is fascinating the film is most enthralling in the quiet scenes between Watts and Norton discovering each other all over again.".

Although set mostly in an exotic locale under revolutionarytype conditions it is a bit of an adventure story but it is mostly a subtle romance. It's a story of a couple who married despite one not loving the other but learning to as time goes by. Normally that wouldn't particularly appeal to me especially with a female that is cold and sarcastic as Naomi Watts' Kitty Fane but this film had an odd appeal. It has a tension running through it for the first threequarters of the film that makes you want to keep watching and find out what happens.It doesn't hurt that it's beautifully filmed and that alwaysentertaining Edward Norton plays the male lead Kitty's husband Walter. Norton is one of the few modernday American actors who could surprise us with a British accent and make it sound natural forgetting quickly that he's faking an accent. He's that subtle.Shanghai is an interesting place I'm sure especially during the period of the unrest in the 1920s which is pictured in this Somerset Maugham story but this still is a very lowkey romance movie in which the wife slowly learns to love and respect her husband and he meanwhile learns even more slowly to forgive her for her sins which include adultery. The tension between the two is wellplayed not overly melodramatic.Of the minor characters Toby Jones as Waddington was most intriguing. It took me awhile to figure out if he was friend or foe a trustworthy friend or not.If you are patient and enjoy good visuals and acting you probably will like this film.".

And what better way to relieve boredom than an extramarital affair with Charlie  the philandering consular official Liev Schrieber? But Walter discovers the affair and decides to volunteer to a cholera stricken province and take Kitty with him. Charlie was never serious anyway so off they go into the jaws of death. In the cholera infested back of beyond Walter and Kitty discover more about each other than they did in many months of marriage. A mutual respect grows into something else but it is a cholera infested region after all. So the tale must have a tragic ending and it does. But it leaves one with a sense of relief as the camera finally moves away from the oppressive dark tones and into light.The movie has beautiful performances by Ed Norton and Ms. Watts. His serious then almost sinister then enlighetened Walter is the perfect foil to her luminous wicked and then vulnerable Kitty. Liev Schrieber is good in the brief role as Charlie and all the supporting cast is very good indeed. The locale is stunning and the mood is brilliantly captured in the dark the shadows and moments of light.Are there Hollywood moments? Of course there are mostly during the growing attraction between the lead pair there are the clichd moments of intoxication his looking suddenly more attractive and youthful her moments with the orphanage kids. But none of it is over the top. The movie is full of mood sensuous beauty and emotion.

	schema:reviewBody "Produced by both Ms. Watts and Mr. Norton and directed by John Curran maker of We Don't Live Here Anymore 2004 and also produced by Ms. Watts. The Painted Veil was originally released in 1934 and starring one Greta Garbo then filmed for the second time as The Seventh Sin from 1957. Now we have the 2006 version of the 1925 novel by W. Somerset Maugham 1874  1965 and whose title from Percy Bysshe Shelley's verse Lift Not The Painted Veil Which Those Who Live is taken from.The Painted Veil is as stunningly beautiful in its vision of 1920's China's political and geographic landscapes as its sensitivity of the marriage vows and the way in which it deals with infidelity regret and possible forgiveness.This love story has Kitty meeting young intelligent introverted and somewhat dull Dr. Walter Fane whose forte is the study of infectious diseases and the convenient marriage that she finds herself committed too. It is in a web of intrigue and dark clouds that they head for mainland China. So much as to hide her from herself as to help thwart a cholera outbreak and possibly cure his failing marriage also but this is a marriage more than on the rocks. This is a cold indifferent and loveless partnership in a vast unknown and deadly environment that will test both these flightless lovebirds and with the hardships and tolerances more than any had ever anticipated.A cinematographer of Stuart Dryburgh's standard like counterparts' Emmanuel Lubezki for The New World 2005 and Christopher Doyle for Ying xiong Hero 2002 has shown us a landscape that is both breath taking and visually involving. This green and unspoilt landscape is the beautiful backdrop to a plague more deadly than any microbe could ever conquer for here amongst the tranquil rivers and the magnificent hills forests and mountains of deepest China lies Pride the 7th Deadly Sin.This is also driven home by the sensual music that is playing throughout by Alexandre Desplat that brings home the sensitivity and grandiose of both the heart and soul of both the Fanes and their enchanting but precarious quarters. Together with the visual and the emotional aspect of The Painted Veil and its undertones of love and love that wanes and the holding onto the fragile heartstrings that have become stretched and worn.

	onyx:emotionText "Produced by both Ms. Watts and Mr. Norton and directed by John Curran maker of We Don't Live Here Anymore 2004 and also produced by Ms. Watts. The Painted Veil was originally released in 1934 and starring one Greta Garbo then filmed for the second time as The Seventh Sin from 1957. Now we have the 2006 version of the 1925 novel by W. Somerset Maugham 1874  1965 and whose title from Percy Bysshe Shelley's verse Lift Not The Painted Veil Which Those Who Live is taken from.The Painted Veil is as stunningly beautiful in its vision of 1920's China's political and geographic landscapes as its sensitivity of the marriage vows and the way in which it deals with infidelity regret and possible forgiveness.This love story has Kitty meeting young intelligent introverted and somewhat dull Dr. Walter Fane whose forte is the study of infectious diseases and the convenient marriage that she finds herself committed too. It is in a web of intrigue and dark clouds that they head for mainland China. So much as to hide her from herself as to help thwart a cholera outbreak and possibly cure his failing marriage also but this is a marriage more than on the rocks. This is a cold indifferent and loveless partnership in a vast unknown and deadly environment that will test both these flightless lovebirds and with the hardships and tolerances more than any had ever anticipated.A cinematographer of Stuart Dryburgh's standard like counterparts' Emmanuel Lubezki for The New World 2005 and Christopher Doyle for Ying xiong Hero 2002 has shown us a landscape that is both breath taking and visually involving. This green and unspoilt landscape is the beautiful backdrop to a plague more deadly than any microbe could ever conquer for here amongst the tranquil rivers and the magnificent hills forests and mountains of deepest China lies Pride the 7th Deadly Sin.This is also driven home by the sensual music that is playing throughout by Alexandre Desplat that brings home the sensitivity and grandiose of both the heart and soul of both the Fanes and their enchanting but precarious quarters. Together with the visual and the emotional aspect of The Painted Veil and its undertones of love and love that wanes and the holding onto the fragile heartstrings that have become stretched and worn. All this is done with fine acting and finer moviemaking a calibre that is more than fitting and respectful of an Independent movie as this a total pleasure to be enthralled and entertained by.The Painted Veil is a virtuoso of what a period piece should be detailed refined eloquent charming and overall spectacular.The Painted Veil is more than a slow boat to China The Painted Veil is a slow and enduring flight to movie magnificence.";

You can make a case for a number of minor actors that have attempted to break out into an acting career and you could probably make a very good case that they are underrated. However Edward Norton is an incredible actor and is the most underrecognized and the most under appreciated bigname actor.In the Painted Veil Edward Norton does not disappoint. The man has an incredible chemistry with Naomi Watts and delivers a stunning performance. He has different transition periods and in each one he subtly changes his posture and movement and his tones in his voice in a way that nobody seems to appreciate any more. After seeing the variety of roles that the man takes this role seems to be sort of boring almost below his talent yet he makes the role of a biologist come alive in a performance that no one else could deliver.This man is the white version of the incredible Denzel Washington.Listen Tom Hanks might be good but Norton is Phenomenal.Before going to see this movie PLEASE see Fight Club or the 25th Hour or Primal Fear or ANYTHING else the man has done. If you haven't seen American History X then see that one as well. This cat is so versatile and for you to appreciate this movie as much as I did a contrast point is quite helpful.His chemistry with Naomi was impeccable as well. Ms. Watts delivered another stunning performance in her role and the dialogue and the silence between them the building tension etc is crazy to watch.One final note on this movie the Gold Globe the Soundtrack took home is well deserved.Painted Veil is a sleeper film of 2006. Phenomenal.".

The reason it works so well is that Mark Brandon Read is a compelling character beautifully impersonated by Eric Bana. Anyone who's ever seen an interview with Read himself can appreciate what a close impersonation Bana achieves his sudden guffawing laugh and lighthearted way of talking about his really unpleasant deeds being perfectly copied. The movie manages to do what I'm sure Read himself has achieved in real life  it tricks you into liking him before revealing that his hairtrigger temper and propensity for paranoia and violence make him a dangerous person to be around. The thing that keeps you watching is Chopper's jovial nature but also his unpredictability. In circumstances where other gangsters would have gone on a killing spree Chopper just shrugs and takes it in his stride. But likewise in throughly innocuous circumstances his paranoia can kick in at any moment and send him on a violent outburst.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to disagree with those that say this is for Aussie's only.  Chopper is an amazing piece of filmmaking in nearly every regard and goes beyond the limitations of vernaculars.  I had to laugh at the review that dismissed it as sophomoric tripe and attempts supporting his argument citing the film's lack of realism in violence.  Although based on a real man this is storytelling cinema not documentary.  There is an obvious element of gross exaggeration in most of the scenes of violence in Chopper which serve a purpose or more specifically several purposes.  Chopper is obviously incapable of telling the truth  or even hearing the truth. It is at first difficult to figure out why so many are drawn to Chopper and not at all difficult to see why so many wish him dead.   Within the first few moments Eric Bana establishes Chopper's character in a way that reveals the off kilter charisma that some simply cannot resist.  Those Chopper seems to get along with best are those on the periphery those who don't invest too much whom he seems intent on impressing.  Those too involved with him are locked into his doom because simply no one is able to keep up with the mythological figure Chopper has created himself or tries create himself into.  Darkly humorous brutal yet not without pathos the film rightly focuses on its central character and lives up to the unlikely hero's motto never let the truth get in the way of a good yarn.  Chopper is a fascinating film filled several amazing performances even in smaller roles e.g. Jimmy's chain smoking junkie white trash pregnant fiance stumbling to the floor to pick up a sawed off shot gun in the hallway. Not for everyone but those who get this sort of thing will be richly rewarded.".

It basically lets Chopper's charisma speak for itself playing with the audience's fascination with crime and violence.If as flaw was to be found it would be that it never tries to go beyond its goal or push too much the envelope.

	schema:reviewBody "Mark Brandon Read aka Chopper is a smalltime criminal who is violent and unpredictable. During one of his many stays in prison he is betrayed by his friend Jimmy  who stabs him repeatedly in an effort to kill him for a bounty. When Jimmy fails he claims Chopper attacked him and Chopper does the time while Jimmy gets free. Released years later Chopper leaves prison still his jovial friendly brutal violent and unpredictable self.In this review I will not even bother getting into a debate over whether or not it is right or not to make a bigger celebrity of Chopper than he already is  the book is out the film is made and it's a moot point. The film does a good job of being reasonably balanced  it shows Chopper's action in such a light that it is hard not to be disgusted by him and his sheer disregard for human life. There is of course an element of the film liking him but in fairness that may be the truth  he may have been the nice bloke at heart that the film presents him as most of us will know people from clubs and pubs who are salt of the earth and will call you 'mate' all the time until they take offence at any little thing then they'll be fighting before you know it. The film is amusing and shocking in equal turns and manages to be engaging even if the plot is more of a character study than a plot.In this regard it really works because the film captures a great deal of his character and not just his actions  he must be a horror to know and it is this that stops it really glamorising him. The script is really well done and it allows us to feel a strong fear and dislike for this man without ever being turned off him to the point that we stop watching or stop being interesting. Bana is a big part of this and he is really good in one of his earliest roles on film. He manages to make this man both a monster and charming in a blokey sort of way but he also brings out the inner fear and loneliness that Chopper has  and the sheer basic immaturity that drives him.This is not glamorisation this is a fair look at a man who few of us would want to ever meet. The support cast are also good but it is Bana's film and he shows why Hollywood picked him up in the first place.Director Dominik may be a little taken by his subject but he makes it balanced and actually presents a character rather than just a hyperkenitic comedy killer that Chopper could have become in someone else's hands. Certainly if this had been a Hollywood film it would have made Chopper much more of an antihero and would have dropped the character a bit in favour of stuff that targets the Tarantino teenage 'killercool' audience. He does add a great deal of style as well and there are plenty of scenes here that are fun and stylishly directed  however his biggest contribution is bringing out the bad side of Chopper rather than just making him a killer who is funny.Overall I wasn't sure what to expect from this  I'm not generally morbid or interested in people who are just thugs even well known thugs but I did enjoy this film. The direction is cool and stylish but the script brings out a Chopper who is unpredictable childish lonely insecure and brutally violent  if you met him in a pub you would run if you had any sense. Bana takes this and gives a great performance to keep him charming but never hide the fact that he is a dangerous and thoroughly unpleasant man.".

Worth viewing by anyone who thinks they like all the ingredients of film and art to come together in the same project.

Based 'on fact' some portions are a bit too over the top to be fully believed but the movie makes apology for this from the outset. Eric Bana's performance is simply awe inspiring and the supporting characters and performances throughout are believable convincing and multilayered. Despite 'Chopper's obvious mental problems his manipulative charm animal cunning and the intelligence behind the insanity all shine through Bana's eyes. Direction is tight and nonintrusive almost documentary style and i must say it works really well. Its one of those films you very quickly forget your watching a movie. While i do enjoy flashy and creative camera usage some films don't need it this is one of them. The story is funny sad and shocking in almost equal measure and this is one 'little' movie i'm very glad i stumbled across thoroughly recommended viewing i give it a 910.

I only discovered Chopper after seeing him in such movies as Troy and The Hulk and I'm glad I did. What a treat it was to see him in this fabulous indie film before he became a Hollywood sex God. No he was not the handsome dashing Aussie fellow that American females have been drooling over since his role as Prince Hector in the cheesefilled film Troy but instead he showed us that he really can act and take on a very difficult role and do it with real grace. The physical transformation he underwent to play Chopper is insane. Imagine that just a short time later he was playing a fit and sexy Delta boy in Black Hawk Down. That in and of itself it quite impressive. I've always been a fan of the demented and dark comedies and love movies like Pulp Fiction but Chopper takes the cake. This movie has all the comedic violence of Pulp Fiction but portrays it in a grittier and more subtle way. This movie makes you think and it's more than just good fights and death scenes it's really artful. Eric does such a wonderful job making you love this truly despicable character.".

There's a scene where he is shanked by his confidant and continues appearing to be in no pain at all. His lack of concern is shocking. He looks down at blood pouring from his torso like someone else has been injured and then up at his assailant as if conveying sorrow that it should've come to this. Then there's another scene where he shoots a drug dealer and then considerately drives him to the hospital.The movie which I'm completely unsure it finds what it's looking for is either 1 shrewd or 2 too eager to get to the prurient in not depicting an elucidation of Chopper's aggressive depravity. Regardless it does give a hint in the way he's separate from criminal gangs and has no partners. He's not a gangster if that word entails a line of work but a brutal psychopath taken by impulsive frenzies. There is a surprising moment during a passing stint on the outside of prison when he reexamines old hangouts and old friends and appears gracious and appeasing until his rabid side lashes with unrestrained wrath. The earlier amiability was not a puton to throw people off their guard. He actually was feeling welcoming and did not essentially expect the blasts of rage out of the blue.How this initially shocking then bleakly funny then merely repetitive cult biopic uninflectingly illustrates its subject is as a row of disturbed emotional states and thought processes. Perhaps a clinical mood disorder case reared in a society not bound to notice or care or equip him with the ability to do either himself he's just seized by these agitated episodes flanked by comparatively normal behavior despite being a violent oversexed criminal. Nevertheless the rapid alternating which is sometimes played for perverse laughs or suspense or surprise though it's more fascinating portrayals occur near the beginning as mere exposition sometimes leads to what is either delusion and hallucination on his part or stylistic flourish by Dominik.I'm guessing the latter though I enjoy Dominik's fascinating use of camera speeds in depicting the influence of cocaine or the multiple perspectives of Chopper's shooting of a man and the intentions of both later on.

Anyone who enjoys movies about Psychopaths Sociopaths Killers Criminals and the like such as Taxi Driver Natural Born Killers Devil's Rejects etc. should really be into this. The character Chopper is pretty much completely crazy but still intelligent funny and likable. He is a criminal that really only victimizes other criminals and other scalawags and his behavior is generally disturbing and amusing at the same time. I saw it on a whim after seeing Bana in Blackhawk Down and this movie really put him at the top of my favorite actors list. The story is well told and the cinematography is unique and interesting.

	schema:headline " Chopper Read cut down to size in both a physical and observational sense as the life and times of a hard bodied man is explored.";
	schema:reviewBody "Chopper begins with a group of men huddled in a cramped prison cell watching a television that it would appear has been placed especially within. They're watching a programme about one of the three men that man is Mark Brandon Read an Australian made somewhat famous for his infamy and who goes by the nickname of Chopper. Eric Bana's steely gaze as the convict dominates the sequence the film lingering on his expression in close up format as he himself remains locked on a TV programme detailing his very exploits. Through lingering on Read's expression a sense of glee at his actions as one of his victims explains how the very onlooker once harmed him the audience are invited to realise a viewpoint or perspective of the man one from the point of view of a victim whilst systematically cutting to the guy for what he is sitting there in the flesh and watching on. The film is more interested in the figure of Chopper than the news report essentially setting up what Andrew Dominik 's 2000 film is all about the getting to know what made Chopper who he is away from all the television and the media opinions.The film is mostly all of one long flashback one that'll begin in 1978 therefore allowing us to observe ourselves mostly everything that made Chopper who he is up to that point in prison circa 1991. In introducing Chopper as a jaildwelling steely eyed tattooed individual whom watches accounts of men he's maimed in the past on TV informing everyone of how badevilnasty he is the film sets up a pretty stonewall image of the man during the early exchanges. What follows is a film that doesn't' excuse what Chopper did or what he is but rather explores how he came about obtaining both his physical and mediadriven image and aura. When the film has come full circle and we end up in the prison cell again there's a moment one of the guards appears sad that the time has come for the TV report to conclude both guards to leave and for the door to be slammed shut and locked. The guard looked sad but there was an additional degree of acceptance in his face  Chopper Read may well be a funny charismatic and involving guy but he's done what he's done in the past and that time which arrives that'll see the jail house door slam shut is a sad realisation that he's there as a result of his flaws moreso his enthusiasm for what he does.When the tale of who he is why he is begins in Pentridge Prison in the late 1970s the film waits for all of about five minutes to use this frightening and unhinged aura about the man it built up by way of all the talk in the opening. Chopper's a violent man and the film is accordingly so with one of its more gruesome scenes playing out in the tough manner that it does because it's bloodletting and maiming which is self inflicted by way of a third party. Whilst not a direct action of one character on another Chopper's drive to get out of the prison division he's in and get relocated sees him take measures that see him loose parts of both ears.Chopper is the sort of film that'll see a person stab another several times whilst in prison before have the pair of them sit down some years later in an apartment and just talk. Chopper's like that there's a really odd atmosphere about it a brooding sense that there'll be an emoting of anger just around the corner all put across by way of an odd blue tint that drowns out most other colours and emphasises the grime and the dark most locations possess. The film presents Chopper as a distinctive figure whereas most of his prison inmates in the early scenes sport long hair and huge moustaches Chopper doesn't have any of anything. His shaven head and minimal facial hair aid in our association with him as this alienated figure from everyone else to the point it appears his own friendships have run aground. Chopper's physical appearance in his hard muscular and tattooclad body further pushes him away from his fellow inmates as this tale of how a society a culture a nation eventually bordered on a kind of infatuation with the man.Just as Chopper's body is put through a wringer of stab wounds and ear mutilation his mind goes through a similarly rough period of anguish. Once out of prison in the 1980s and out with girlfriend Tanya Beahan he eyes a man named Neville Colosimo who he believes was seeing his partner during his time inside. The camera sticks with Chopper's face complete with stare again in close up format as a series of strobe lights flash across his face  a storm brewing on the inside a series of explosions built on rage going off behind the steely face. The film will use the three primary colours of red green and blue to blend together to create a spectrum of hate threat and supposed forgiveness at various times maintaining a blue tint throughout with later on a minibar at Neville's home being drowned out by some blood red lighting as further tempers fray and hatred reaches a peak. This as Chopper's conversation with a former best friendturnedbetrayer and consequent enemy is covered in a green tint suggesting calm or neutralness as they sit amidst drug infused squalor and talk uneasily. Chopper's an interesting film a combining of smut and grot with some odd sequences of a postmodern sort channelling an aesthetic akin to something like 1996's Trainspotting. Dominik would later revisit this idea of studying a menace to society in his 2007 Jesse James film but Chopper's detailing of a guy with a bizarrely attuned celebrity status plus violent streak is worth seeing by itself.".

	schema:reviewBody "Andrew Dominik writes and directs his film debut of Australian crime legend turned best selling author Mark Chopper Read who can't even spell and claims to be nearly illiterate as he spouts a big mocking laugh right in the faces of everyone. Bana in the title role completely owns this character and goes through a gaudy transformation producing one of the most fascinating performances you will ever find. A performance that should be as legendary as the real life character in which it based on is sadly overlooked and missed by many. A movie this low budget and this relatively unknown hinders the level of praise it will receive from fans and critics alike but it's one that should be sought out by anyone with the least bit of interest because it doesn't disappoint. Bana gives the performance of the year and one of the best the decade has to offer. He truly captures the charisma of Read. He's also convincing when he puts a bullet in someone's knee or head or stabs them to death and leaves them in a pool of their own blood. Completely driven by paranoia jealousy and speed Chopper corners himself into a room and finds a nice cozy spot all by himself. He's pitted against anyone and everyone which is beautifully captured in the films final moments. Out of fear he's forced to kill or be killed. He has no friends and the friends he does have attempt to kill him because of the dire circumstances he puts himself in. He has a sense of charm and infectious attitude that attract people to him when he's sober. He's seemingly incapable of murder until he's struck the wrong way at the wrong time then anything is possible. Whether it be the guards in the prison the media or the people of Australia Mark Chopper Read is as fascinating as they come.Dominik really has shown to be extremely interested and captivated by the art of storytelling and how fact and fiction can become blurred or distorted. We see multiple scenes where an event will unfold then we'll hear Chopper tell the story of what happened then we'll hear someone else tell the story in a completely different manner. One thing Chopper loved to do was tell a story. He loved to fascinate and make people laugh. Sometimes he had to bend the truth and make certain events a little more entertaining or more intense because that's what storytelling is Bending the truth and amplifying certain facts while downgrading or disregarding others. This is way when Chopper tells Read's story the audience feels all the emotions he felt during that time. Dominik captures this beautifully. One great scene portrays Chopper getting stabbed by his own friend and the pure shock that he felt by getting stabbed by his friend is illustrated in a way that's incredibly unusual and surprisingly hilarious. Like Chopper we can find humor in some of the most odd and unexpected places. Chopper is one of the best films of the year and Bana gives the performance of a lifetime.".

	schema:reviewBody "Eric Bana is an Aussie ? I knew this before I saw BLACK HAWK DOWN . If I hadnt I would have been totally convinced this guy was from the Southern states  Banas deep south accent was absolutely flawless in that movie unlike some of the British cast members . Since then hes appeared in the blockbuster release of THE INCREDIBLE HULK  Which I havent seen yet  and hell be playing a major role in up coming megablockbuster TROY . After seeing him as Mark Read in CHOPPER I was totally struck by something  Eric Bana is gonna be a megastar very soon Watching CHOPPER is somewhat like watching the young Deniro in TAXI DRIVER Banas performance more than makes up for the flaws in the movie  hes not an actor playing a character  He is that character  he is Mark  Chopper  Read . Chopper puts on weight so Bana puts on weight  and Im loathe to ask what Bana did in order to er ... how can I put it  that scene in the bar ! Did Mr Bana get a surgical extension ? That no doubt explains the title of the movie Like I said there are some flaws to this movie which revolves around Chopper Read starting off as violent criminal to becoming best selling author  A sort of Aussie Jimmy Boyle  but his writing is only referred to within the last 10 minutes of the movie and Im none the wiser as to what his books are about . One things for sure but  His bestsellers cant be half as bad as anything JK Rowling has scribbled . I also liked the poem sequence at the end though I guess just as many people will loathe it as like it I do admire the producers honesty in pointing out that much of this screenplay is invented and I do wish more producers would do this  a pity that those of us such as myself who had never heard of Chopper Read have no idea what bits are true and what bits are fiction though . I guess that the way Chopper is written and played our sympathies should go out to him though we cant condone what hes done in life . I found it difficult to sympathise with this violent nutter myself but I guess anyone who asks Who did you f while I was inside ?  only to be met with the reply Everyone . I work in a brothel dont I ?  cant actually be responsible for much of their own actions . Indeed Chopper is painted as a sad pathetic idiot though thankfully not as some type of victim So I found CHOPPER to be violently disturbing and laugh out funny in equal measure  just like the first time I saw TAXI DRIVER . Have I mentioned that Eric Bana is going to become the worlds biggest movie star ?".

It's a brutal sensitive and brilliant look into the psyche of a disturbed mind.Eric Bana plays the role of Mark Chopper Read one of Australia's most notorious criminals. Chopper is a man who through circumstance and necessity uses violence as a tool. He is a man of intense emotion  most of the time he is torn between fear remorse horror and despair.Film at its best makes think and makes you uncomfortable. It explores emotions and feelings which the viewer understands but wants to comprehend. This is such a film.Chopper is an intelligent man but lacking in classical education. He has learnt his way on the streets where he grew up. He is a man of character and morales and is angry at himself when he has to compromise on what he believes in. He wants to be loved and this is the reason why his life has become infamous. There are many evil criminals out there but few have captured the imagination quite like Chopper.Bana's portrayal is quite frankly amazing. The DVD contains footage of an interview with the real Chopper Read which shows just how accurate Bana has been in capturing the essence of the man. All the extra footage and commentaries are essential to get the most out of this film.Is Chopper a real psycho? Are his actions justified? Is he a reaction to the society around him? Is he a good manipulator of the truth as a means of survival in the film and real life? These are questions asked by the film and like all good movies the answers are left to the viewer.If you are expecting a glossy Americanesque documentary you will be disappointed. This is a real film examining the very real phenomena of human nature and nurture.This film made me shudder squirm and laugh often all at the same time. I can give it no higher compliment.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just wanted to quote this reviewas there are several things I wanted to comment about Chopper is a simpleminded flick which tells a tall tale about an Aussie man who not only is a self professed murderer but also a best selling pulp author who penned a series of Chopper novels. Regardless the film is mostly fiction and very simpleminded in its approach with the Dominik obviously getting off on having people get hurt without the expected reaction. EXAMPLE Chopper gets stabbed several times and the hugs and consoles his attacker. EXAMPLE A guy gets shot in the head point blank with a 410 gauge shotgun and wanders around with a hand over the wound before keeling over. EXAMPLE Chopper has part of his ears cut off while he sits calmly bleeding like a stuck pig giving instructions since he apparently can't do it himself. Etc. In the final analysis Chopper is a dumb movie with poor production value and little going for it as it flounders near the bottom of the Bflick barrel in that vast wasteland called broadcast. Recommended only for Aussie crime junkies or fans of the players. D  The whole idea of Chopper consoling his victimsor suffering ridiculous pain is part of the mystery and many contradictions within the manand is likely embellished something that is made clear throughout the film.Never let the truth get in the way of a good yarn.This is a man with little if any consideration for human lifedo you expect his recollections to be exactly as they happened? It heightens the drama of a good storyso that's what he does when recalling his life.And that's what Mark Chopper Read enjoys doing.The contradictions displayed within Read's character make an incredible performance even betterin that they could have merely portrayed him as a mindlessonedimensional thug.HoweverRead is not that and this film clearly illustrates this notion.Simpleminded? Hardly. Poor production values? Matethis is an Australian film we're talking about.There's hardly the Hollywood  availableand it's gritty style perfectly fits its themes and characters.The film's sets and characters appearances are right on the money.It captures the Australian underworld better than any other film I've seen.    Only for crime junkies? Obviously you could tell that you are American merely through reading that comment.Chopper is a cult figure who continues to fascinate people in this country.He puts such a unique spin on the idea of an anti hero and makes us question why we are interested in mediadriven and selfpromoting celebrities in the first place.If you were Australia you would understand the context of the film and the pure fascination with him better.If you know anything about the character you would realise that Bana ABSOLUTELY NAILS every aspect of Read. Every Aussie adult should see this film.You don't have to be Australian to enjoy this filmthough.The film has themes that are relevant to all societies.".

That mix makes for a very interesting watch even if there's not enough material for a satisfying film it could have been a thirtyminute film and achieved about the same level of success and it doesn't leave you with any clear notion of what you saw. Chopper doesn't quite work out as a biography or even a character study but it's an intriguing document on violence and violent people and about what makes the same people land in trouble again and again.On top of that it's also pretty entertaining. Eric Bana is terrific in the lead. Not being from Australia myself I first became aware of Bana as a leading man in American mainstream films like Troy and Hulk where he always struck me as dull and uncharismatic but finding out that he was a successful comedian is his native country first makes a lot of sense after seeing his disturbing layered and very funny performance as Chopper. It's difficult to call it a comedy  don't expect a crime farce like Snatch because there's very little of that going on. But Chopper's character is outrageous enough to be entertaining throughout.".

Eric Bana as Mark Chopper Read is one of the most chilling and disturbing acting in film. i don't rate Eric Bana that good this is the only film i think he's amazing in. its a true story about Mark Chopper Read's life it starts with him in prison. he then stabs a rival and then he ends up being a marked man. he has a large contract out on him and his friend takes it once they got chopper on his own his friend stabs him over and over again which is one of the most chilling scenes I've ever seen. Chopper takes these stabbings like he cant even feel them. he then takes his friend that was to court. he gets out of prison and he works for the law killing people. thats a slight overview on the film but id advise anyone who wants to watch something really dark gritty and chilling to watch this masterpiece. this is a brilliant film directed by Andrew Dominik i'm not so much into the assassination of Jesse James film which he also directed. Chopper is daring cinema but needs to be watched........ 1010.......j.d Seaton".

	schema:reviewBody "Crime movies have traditionally been criticized for glamorizing their subjects and often with justice. There has long exsited a tangled relationship between fictional and actual crime with real crooks basing their behavior on fiction at least as often as the other way around. The Australian film Chopper is particularly relevant to these issues for it depicts a reallife criminal who has become a sort of twisted media personality Down Under by writing a series of bestsellers about his violent exploits. You could say that a movie like this is profoundly immoral in how it publicizes a scumbag like Chopper who is said to have gained his nickname by cutting off his victims' toes. To the degree that the movie avoids this it is due to the visual scheme and Eric Bana's performance as Chopper. Chopper makes Joe Pesci's psychotic GoodFella Tommy look like a model citizen. Bana was a standup comedian before being cast in the film and he brings to the role a likable jovial heartiness that makes Chopper's sudden shifts to savagery all the more chilling. Chopper often apologizes to his victims after attacking them and the most bizarre and funny thing about his apologies is that they're sincere. In a prison scene after mutilating another prisoner he then tries to justify his actions to the man who is lying on the floor in a puddle of blood. Later when Chopper's best friend repeatedly stabs him in retaliation he doesn't even react to the pain and instead acts emotionally hurt by the betrayal. Not just Chopper himself but the whole criminal subculture shown in the movie is sleazy and repulsive without a hint of glamor. Though the movie's sordid quality paradoxically enough is morally satisfying it also isn't very entertaining. The director Andrew Dominick employs flashy visual tricks to effectively limited use while filming most of the action in a restrained austere style that reinforces the banality of the characters. Consequently the movie starts to feel somewhat repetitive and dull. Dominick shows some talent but in the end it's Bana who carries the show.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anthony Hopkins is simply astounding. The man can disappear inside of characters so diverse and capture you so completely that you have to wonder if his well of talent has a bottom.This film is at turns charming bawdy fascinating riveting nerve wracking hilarious heartwarming and heartbreaking. As Burt Munro  an aging New Zealand man losing his hearing short on money living in a shed surrounded by weeds considered a lovable if eccentric oddball by all who know him except one small boy and obsessed with making a 45 year old motorcycle capable of breaking the land speed record on the Bonneville Salt Flats  Hopkins takes us along for the ride every minute of this movie. The fact that this film is based on the true story of Burt Munro makes it all the more captivating but a lesser actor than Hopkins might very well have lost us along the way. It is no wonder that the children of the reallife Burt Munro were moved to tears by Hopkins' portrayal.There's a clever ongoing bit about the taste of Burt's hot tea and you will also wonder a bit about how his lemonade might taste. Every scene is a jewel in this movie and the cumulative effect proves that extraordinary films do not have to cost bazillions of dollars and take two years of computergenerated special effects to WOW their audience.Burt is challenged by every imaginable obstacle standing between him and his speed dream his failing heart may give out any minute the journey around the world to transport the 1920 Indian motorcycle to the USA seems insurmountable he has no machine shop or whizbang tools and equipment to work his engineering miracles etc. What he DOES have is an indomitable spirit that will never ever stop trying. Whether he's battling young ruffians who diss his ancient motorcycle or banking bureaucrats and red tape he is a wrinkled but worthy warrior.The supporting cast is as beautiful and bizarre as it gets and the audience becomes inordinately fond and just about every one of them except for a nasty foreign cabdriver Carlos Lacamara but hey somebody had to be disliked. Great actors in small roles abound including Diane Ladd as Ada a frontier gal that's been lonely a while Saginaw Grant as Jake an Indian with a really distasteful solution to Burt's prostate problems and Paul Rodriguez as Fernando a human and humane used car salesman. Perhaps the best scene  and heart  stealer is Chris Williams as Tina a crossdressing front desk night clerk at a fleabag hooker hotel. You gotta love him. Or her as the case may be. Stellar performance and Hopkins' Burt treats Tina with such dignity it defines friendship.Don't miss this fine fine film. And if there is justice in the boffo box office world The World's Fastest Indian will be a true Oscar contender in 2006.".

	schema:reviewBody "Seeing the movie The World's Fastest Indian reminded me why I go see movies. I average about one every two weeks and this was one of those rare movies that actually made me feel happy afterward.The main character New Zealander Bill Munroe as played by Anthony Hopkins is a true man's man. He has spent his entire adult life tinkering with his streamlined motorcycle a 1920 Indian hence the title. Now in his 60's in the year 1963 he wants to realize his life's dream of taking it halfway around the world to the Bonneville Salt Flats Test Track in Utah the only place where he can find out how fast it will actually go.The movie pulls off two oftenused themes The Long Journey and Overcoming Adversity without a hint of phoniness or melodrama. The Long Journey from New Zealand to Utah takes up most of the movie with Munroe scrounging up travel money working off part of his passage on a dilapidated freighter and the long eventfilled drive from the California coast to Utah in an old used car. Overcoming Adversity is portrayed in two ways by Munroe's awesome mechanical genius as shown by his ability to fashion spare parts out of almost anything and to improvise a la MacGyver and in his charm and likability when confronted with more human obstacles. Indeed one of the movie's chief strengths was the character's ability to make friends easily under any situation with a cast of colorful supporting characters who wonderfully complemented Hopkins' acting.After finally reaching the test track the movie's focus shifts from the acting to the cinematography and drama. The dozens of colorful cars motorcycles and drivers' outfits contrast strikingly with the blinding white of the salt flats and the mountainous backdrop. And when Munroe finally gets the chance to make his test run two questions come to mind. How fast can he go? More importantly will the 64yearold man and the 43yearold patchedup bike hold together under the strain?After seeing the movie and while still in my euphoric state my skeptical mind wondered how much of it was actually true. I did a little research and the portrayal of this amazing man seems to be true enough. Go see this movie if you do you'll leave the theater feeling good and perhaps even a little inspired.".

	schema:headline " Blatantly Kiwi surprisingly Universal";
	schema:reviewBody "'The World's Fastest Indian' is a unique movie that not only provides a film that New Zealanders anywhere can be most proud of while at the same time contemplating universal themes that everyone outside the borders of the country can relate to.The film contains that familiar 'Number 8 fencing wire' mentality that resonates throughout New Zealand society  and also echoes those tropes of masculinity that are so prominent within the National cinema Burt tinkers with his 1920 Indian Motorcycle with the most unexpected results using common household objects he travels to the Bonneville Saltflats in Utah alone getting by on his wit and has that dry sense of humour that is familiar around these parts. It also contains the familiar 'man Alone' motif but in a foreign country and also touches on that other image of New Zealand men tinkering in their sheds. The film is what I would call blatantly Kiwi.Wider themes that surface are of isolation alienation and beating the odds to achieve your dream. What I can definitely say about 'The World's Fastest Indian' is that it's very refreshing  this is no typical underdog story it's a story that proves that you're never too old to follow through with a dream you've had for years. It was great to have a protagonist that was older than the usual one in contemporary movies and seemed to give the film more of an anchoring in reality. It makes it far more easier to believe in the story and it's motivations and heightens the sense of isolation one sometimes goes through when following your heart.Sir Anthony Hopkins does an amazing job as Burt Munro  the New Zealand accent is impeccable aside from one or two vowel sounds. His subtleties communicate an intense psychological battle and determination to get the chance to achieve his dream and his typical sense of humour is wonderful. I'm not sure how accurate this portrayal of Burt Munro is but the screen character is engaging and pulls the audience in for a solid 2 hours as we watch Burt battle with his demons and the lack of people's belief in his achieving his goal.All in all 'The World's Fastest Indian' is a fantastic film that New Zealanders can be proud of soaked with Kiwi humour and a character that will remind a lot of us of our grandfathers and that older generation that never complained and got on with life no matter what they were up against. For international audiences it's a wonderful underdog story about an older man who had never given up on getting his chance to achieve his dream.'The World's Fastest Indian' is a fantastic film and will inspire anyone who gets the chance to see it. Roger Donaldson continues his fine tradition of great movies and all Kiwis should hold him up to the same heights as they do that other Jackson fulla!".

	schema:reviewBody "All I knew about this movie going in was that it was the life story of an Ivan Maugertype motorcyclist whom I'd never heard of that he was a Southlander and that Anthony Hopkins was playing the chap  complete with a rolled rrrr's Southland accent. I came away with a feeling similar to when I first saw Tucker the man  his dream and Cool runnings  A genuine feeling of euphoria that someone whom I ordinarily would have little particular interest in has accomplished a dream. Roger Donaldson has created a rare cinematic masterpiece with The world's fastest Indian  he has crafted a feelgood movie which achieves a Field of dreams emotional level with a climax which is deliberately lowkey and in keeping with the subject matter. Despite the fact that Burt Munro's efforts set an asyet unbeaten world record he was a humble bloke who just went back to his shed at the end of the day to tinker. I loved this movie because it tells a straightforward tale of someone so fixed on his dream that anyone he comes into contact with simply can't help but do what they can to help him. There are no villains in this movie  except bad luck and circumstance. And the way Munro overcomes adversity is incredibly charming and an inspiration to anyone. Sir Anthony Hopkins is incredible as usual. There aren't many actors who could pull off the Antipodean twang and the Southland Rrolling to boot! But Hopkins carries it off almost impeccably. The shimmering cinematography on the Bonneville salt flats is another highlight of this masterpiece and I think I'm going to have to see it again before it winds up its run at my local cinema to fully appreciate it! The first time I was too caught up in the agony of Burt's struggle! This truly is a great flick. Probably not an Oscar winner but for me World's fastest Indian belongs alongside the aforementioned Tucker etc. There's probably not much point in releasing it in the United States  it's not their kind of feelgood movie. But I sure hope Donaldson takes it to Cannes...the Europeans should like it as much as Whale rider.".

	schema:reviewBody "I took a look at this film with a slightly wary eye the title being rather ambiguous and misleading initially. I almost passed it by to watch one of the many screener DVD's I had to view. for possible inclusion in the BAFTA awards. I presumed it was about a runner or maybe an Indian astronaut possibly. I had no idea initially the Indian referred to a great American motorcyclerather than a particular type of human.I am so glad I wasn't thrown by the title and started watching. There unfolded a most delightful story about Bert an instantly rather charming eccentric old character superbly played by Anthony Hopkins who built an old 1920's motorcycle in his garden shed. He then attempts to break the worldland speed record on a machine designed to originally travel about 90mph. The plot develops into a most charming and beautiful story of Bert's determination to get to the race event and the journey is as much of the story as the event itself. Obviously I shall not divulge the result or the events that happen suffice it to say that Bert becomes an instantly likable character by everyone he meets. Bert's charm shines through and he takes everyone he meets at face value and welcomes all with a smile and a shake of the hand. He meets various characters along the way who he befriends like longlost friendswhich is a fresh in these days of prejudice and alienation. This was a very innocent time in 1967 for a New Zealander going to America and there is one of the films most delightful and charming moments when Bert realises all is not quite what it seems when he meets one certain character......... MAKE SURE YOU SEE THIS FILM it will have you laughing crying and will uplift you which is quite uncommon in these days in the movies of blood killing violence and savagery. I would be very surprised if Anthony is not at least nominated for his starring role as Bert. Lovely film which needs a different title to me but then again it does what it says on the tin as they say. Go and see it. Great".

WriterDirector Roger Donaldson has been very prolific in his Hollywood career creating mostly slick hohum projects such as The Recruit Thirteen Days Dante's Peak and Cocktail. Although there is a touch of sap in this one Donaldson turns on the charm for the fascinating tale of Burt Munro the New Zealander who shocked the world with his speed records in the 1960's.Playing a bit like a motorized Hidalgo the film captures your heart and imagination thanks in large part to the amazing journey of this spirited man and the terrific performance of Sir Anthony Hopkins. Making his way half way around the world with almost no money to his name Munro realizes a life long dream of running his handbuilt 1920 Indian motorsickle at the Salt Flats of Bonneville in Utah. his journey and openness introduce him to so many people along the way. His warm heart and courage just will these folks to help him out. Everyone wants ol' Burt to make it.While you may think to yourself this is just a lighthearted Hollywood feelgood film just remember the man and the story are real. Donaldson and Hopkins worked together over 20 years ago in The Bounty and have another very interesting project under way now with Papa  a biopic on Ernest Hemingway. Three supporting performances really stand out Diane Ladd comedian Paul Rodriguez and Christopher Lawford Peter's son as Jim Moffit. Donaldson in a nice touch also spreads in a few appearances of the guys from the high speed world.This is one you can take the family to and almost everyone will enjoy the story journey and spirit of Burt Munro. And believe me when I say you will never look at Lemon trees the same again!!".

After a minute or so I realized my partner a fairly new motorcycle rider himself making me a motorcycle widow of course had lured me into a film about motorbikes. I rolled my eyes at him yawned and prepared for the worst ...What I got instead was the best film I've seen for quite some time.Anthony Hopkins totally blew me away. His accent was really very strong it should be noted that the Invercargil accent is pretty distinct from the rest of the South Island of NZ and he managed to maintain the audience's interest though some pretty dialogueheavy scenes. All of the supporting characters did a brilliant job defining a diverse physical and emotional landscape for the protagonist. The cinematography was economical and meaningful and assisted the humorous moments beautifully. The story unfolded very nicely and  thanks to some great editing  the small moments of tension were plentiful and kept the story moving along nicely.With all the cynicism and politics in contemporary cinema it is so refreshing to see a film that is very pure that speaks volumes about kindness and passion and friendship without saying anything at all. This film didn't try to make any big statements there were no lengthy diatribes about 'acceptance' and 'tolerance' and I loved that.I left the cinema with a huge grin on my face. I'm so glad I was dragged along for the ride.".

Munro's bike the shop the tools the cobbledtogether machinery the lowtech transportation ... all dead on the money in authenticity. The entire film is like a string of old racing photographs come to life.Anyone interested in what really went on back then before fullride sponsorships and corporate superevents became the norm should see this film. Even the audio is authentic. When Mickey Thompson's 4engined 32cylinder Challenger rolls off on a land speed run that's the actual sound of the original runs you hear in the background.I have to admit that when a replica of Dr. Nathan Ostich's Flying Caduceus rolled by in one scene I got a bit of a lump in my throat remembering those who died in their attempts to be the fastest. Despite the lighthearted goofiness shown in the film never forget that these people were deadly serious about a seriously deadly sport. Land Speed Record racers were a special if slightly odd bunch. Even those of us who raced normal events were a bit in awe of the LSR people. As someone else mentioned there are a few corny scenes early in the film that might make the purists wince a bit but the payoff is worth it. Anyone who lived through those times will instantly recognize the slightly overbearing track officials and the fortunately loose attitudes towards rulesbending.All in all this film perfectly captures a time and an attitude that we will never see again. Racing is definitely safer now but we're only having onetenth of the fun and satisfaction Munro experienced way back when.".

	schema:reviewBody "I used to own a gas station in a small town in West Texas right where the Hill Country ends and the desert starts. On a bright Summer day a rider on an old BMW rolled up to my pumps. Being a motorcycle rider myself I walked out to greet him.As I approached and greeted him he held up a gloved hand. He slowly stretched it out and flexed his fingers and then did this with his other hand and then slowly with a little bit of difficulty pulled off his helmet. His head had a shock of snow white hair. He had a white beard and eyes that were a stunning shade of sky blue. His smile belied not only and easy friendship but an experienced wit. Looped around his head was a clear thin plastic hose that ran down into a small tank bag to an oxygen tank.He told me he was 82 years old and had been riding motorcycles for 60 years. His old BMW had 200000 miles on it and he had ridden it in 20 countries on 5 continents. He said he had been diagnosed with cancer and had outlived his doctor's prediction of his demise by two months so far. He had been on the motorcycle since the day of his doctor's prognosis and would continue until he died which he admitted would not be long. There was not a single inkling of sadness in his eyes. Just merriment and passion. This old man was doing what he loved and was going to go out on his terms after living an amazing and enviable life.I imagined time and time again what having such passion for something could be like. I love my bikes. I am passionate about my occasional days at the track but it does not match what I saw in that old rider that day.Then I saw Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Munro and it became so clear. I wonder if that old man ever watched The World's Fastest Indian. If he had it would have spoken directly to his soul as it did to mine.This movie had such heart. A story about the triumph of the human spirit. Only Rocky comes to mind as a movie with such a soul. I recommend this picture to everyone I talk movies with.".

Not only is this movie entertaining from start to finish but it features one of Anthony Hopkins greatest ever performances which is saying something and was laughoutloud funny to boot! Hopkins depiction of Munro was immaculate. the movie left me wishing I'd known the man and Hopkins perfectly captures the unpretentious friendly character of many New Zealanders which made Munro an innocent abroad when he took his bike to the Bonneville Salt Flats. I wondered how Roger Donaldson was going to make this movie interesting but it's really gripping throughout. Munro's character has a lot to do with it but it's also more of a road movie than a film about motorcycling. Munro's journey from his garden shed to the record books is a delight and an inspiration. There are some terrifically funny lines in this film which emerge simply from Munro's down toearth character. The audience we saw it with was really amused. We didn't expect it to be so funny. As usual the only downside is that this film doesn't seem to be getting the attention it deserves. If I hadn't seen the IMDb reviews and just returned from a trip to NZ myself I would have missed the best movie of the year so far. All involved with the making of this film deserve the highest praise.".

From the first line they laughed then thoroughly enjoyed it to the end  even applauding as the credits rolled.I wasn't expecting much from the movie  since usually anything involving motorcycles on film just makes me grit my teeth in frustration at the sheer ignorance of the directorsproducers.This movie was completely opposite. Not only did it do a wonderful job at depicting the bikes and riders JUST RIGHT it also did something wonderful  it made even the nonriders in the crowd feel just a little bit what it's like to ride a fast bike. The sheer joy of speed with your body inches off the ground and nothing protecting you but your own skill and the quality of the machine you've built.Also having toured the back roads from CaliforniaOregon through Utah quite often the landscape and regional town shots really made me want to get on my bike and run through there again  right now! Taking backroads you can find those little cafes in tiny towns that time forgot  it's one of my favorite reasons to ride.Anthony Hopkins was perfect  played the part perfectly and was supported expertly by an exceptional cast of characters. Seeing some of the old legends of the sand like The Redhead and its owner was just icing on the cake.All in all a thoroughly enjoyable movie. I can't wait to see it again.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a great film. A real sleeper one has to wonder why it didn't make more money? Actually that makes me like it even more and I can't help feeling Roger Donaldson's underdog Bert Munro character tells us something of Donaldson's own journey through life.Anyway on to the film.There is more soul in this films two hours than in the last two maybe 10 years of Hollywood flicks. No one gets killed no one gets shot or shot at virtually every character is so memorable and yet totally believable not to mention so well played.I'm wondering where all these great actors have been hiding. more about this laterSpecial effects are exactly what they need to be not Hollywood overblown just totally transparent. Anyone who has ever raced a machine right on the limit or rather not knowing where the limit is will be in awe of how they captured those moments in the film that rush blur and vibration that seems part of you to the extreme your very eyeballs vibrate in your own head blurring even further.More than one scene left me wondering just where the world has gone wrong today and long for those days when people were still people and prepared to make an effort to help a total stranger so obviously out of his element in a far off land. I haven't been to Utah but I hope there are still people there today like they were in the 60'sAnother appealing asset is a total lack of Hollywood marketing hype and no need to suspend your disbelief.. as they so love to sayNo this is a REAL film about a real guy. I can't help wonder if the Hollywood marketing bods missed the point totally After all dealing with reality is not a strong point in marketing circles Speaking of missing reality that reminds me. MPAA Rated PG13 for brief language drug use and a sexual reference. Who are you kidding? DRUG USE! Your all fired! I'm sorry but I don't believe even the bureaucrats at the DEA have listed ground up dog's balls Or medically prescribed Nitroglycerine tablets used since the early 1900's to this very day It's only just a little over ONE hundred years of history guys. I guess you don't get out much.Well what else can you say about Sir Anthony? Sir Anthony Hopkins is a great actor as I think most will agree And this film proves that yet again in a not at all typical role for him. His chameleon like skills put him right in time and place and character. I'm not quite convinced with his Southland accent which is not quite flat enough IMHO but all same it's a good attempt probably better than mine and I'm a Kiwi Regardless he captures that I can do that Kiwi attitude so well and delivery is timed to perfection.Christopher Lawford playing Jim Moffat is SUCH a standout too. From his first scene the moment he climbs out of his car you KNOW he's a speed freak. He has that laid back Southern California poise tan and smile with his 1000mile stare. I was racking my memory to recall a 1960's racer of that name before realising the character he plays is a composite of several real racers. Absolutely convincing!Bruce Greenwood plays a more minor role but nails it also. I loved the scene when he first meets Munro and can't tell what to make of him What a classic.Speaking of classics Chris Williams Tina character is hilarious. Especially in the scenes where she tags along with Munro and the reactions to the bizarre duo.Finally Jessica Cauffiel. What a darling. A sweet 60's belle with a heart and smile bigger than a mountain. She totally steals more than one scene from Sir Anthony.It is a very rare film indeed that can appeal to men and women boys and girls of all ages after all everyone has their dreams and ambitions and asks what if even though we so often forget them as we get older being reminded of them by a film is no bad thing and it bonds with you along the way. Yet it takes it's time and tells the tale with a deliberate style and finesse. Like this film Munro was a larger than life character who REALLY did things in HIS time.This is a feelgood film about humanity spirit and passion for life and living your dreams whatever your age.".

With minimal pretension and just the right combination of drama and laughout loud comedic relief this film entertains on every level. One can't help but fall in love with the legend that is Burt Munro and be inspired by his legacy of tenacity and endurance. Although the story is of a New Zealander in the 1960s the journey Munro takes is universal. His determination to live his dream is a theme everyone can understand.

	schema:headline " The Story Of Burt Munro An Amazing Man";
	schema:reviewBody "This was an interesting story of an older poor guy traveling all the wayfrom New Zealand to the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah to try to set a world speed record on his motorcycle. With Anthony Hopkins playing that man Burt Munro you know it's not some hokey little Bfilm. It's also based on reallife character who did this back in 1969.This film reminded me of The Straight Story starring Richard Farnsworth. That dealt with an old man taking a long tractor ride across the state of Iowa to see his dying brother. It featured a bunch of nice characters he met along his journey. This is much the same as we witness Munro's encounters with a variety of people in the United States. Like The Straight Story all the people are good people and help our man. That's nice to see.Once he finally gets to the Salt Flats however his problems are far from over as he is unable to meet any of the minimum safety standards. It appears he made his trip for nothing but you'll see what happens if you view this movie.New Zealanders say Hopkins did them proud too and they would know if he did a good job or not playing a man from their area of the world whether he sounded and acted realistically. They say he did.I enjoyed the first 35 minutes of this story the most. Maybe because that's the most innocent part of the film and features a young boy who looks up to Burt and encourages him when few others are willing to do so. It's when Munro reaches America where the nice clean family film goes south a bit. He hooks up with transvestites onenight stands profanes here and there and the PC angle gets a little overplayed. However despite making America look a little too weird everything is done is a tasteful way and it still was a wonderful story. It has to be an inspiration for older folks who might think life's challenges are over once they hit a certain age. Not so as Mr. Munro shows us in this inspiring wellphotographed film.This certainly is quite an unknown movie for one which has such a famous actor in the starring role. It's well worth your time though to check out.".

	schema:headline " A decent tribute";
	schema:reviewBody "Invercargill New Zealand is noted for being the country's southernmost city and for having the least hours of sunshine and the most number of rain days of any NZ large town. It is also famous for being the home town of a gritty old codger called Burt Munroe who set a number of world motor cycle speed records one of which still stands in the 1960s at Bonneville Salt Flats Utah riding a 1920 Indian Scout motor cycle.Roger Donaldson one of the midwives to the renaissance of the Kiwi film industry in the 1980s Sleeping Dogs Smash Palace and latterly Hollywood director Thirteen Days made Offerings to the God of Speed a documentary on Burt in 1972 when he was still alive. This dramatization of the same story  little man triumphs though sheer grit and determination  is a triumph for his star. Anthony Hopkins is good at quirky curmudgeons but here he manages to exude a little homespun charm as well. His Burt has the happy knack of getting people to help him rather than shaft him. Officialdom melts at his approach and he is even attractive to the ladies as Burt would have put it. It's Tony Hopkin's film and he carries it off in fine style. I'm not sure about the accent which is more northern British than southern NZ but it hardly matters as the Americans in the film can scarcely understand it anyway.The rest of the cast were all adequate and Aaron Murphy as Tom the kid from next door was actually able to steal some scenes. I also noticed an old acquaintance in a minor role as Frank the bike club president  Tim Shadbolt student radical of the late 60s and now mayor of Invercargill. Burt had no money but he did get community support at various times so Invercargillians can take some pride in his achievements.Which brings me to what I think is the hole in this account. The Indian motorcycle which was a light machine used for dispatch and scout work in World War One had a top speed according to the makers of 57 mph. It had a V2 cylinder block design and a decent capacity of just under 1000cc. Burt was a backyard mechanic who constantly tinkered with it even casting his own pistons which blew with monotonous regularity. Somehow he got the thing to exceed 200mph. No doubt the streamlining helped but he must have modified the original design radically. Donaldson presents this without any explanation. Maybe Burt wouldn't tell him or maybe Donaldson thought too much tech stuff would put the punters off. It wouldn't have taken much to explain it.As others have said this is very much a feelgood movie and I think as an exresident of NZ evocative of some of the more admirable aspects of the NZ character  the optimism the friendliness the capacity for improvisation and the willingness to rise to a challenge and even occasionally to take risks. Burt had a lot in common with those pioneer settlers from Scotland who arrived in Southland 100 years earlier and founded Invercargill a place the Maori sensibly regarded as a trifle too chilly to actually live in though they visited for the oysters and muttonbirds. But he also had some homegrown attributes as well. .".

Burt was a backyard mechanic who constantly tinkered with it even casting his own pistons which blew with monotonous regularity. Somehow he got the thing to exceed 200mph. No doubt the streamlining helped but he must have modified the original design radically. Donaldson presents this without any explanation. Maybe Burt wouldn't tell him or maybe Donaldson thought too much tech stuff would put the punters off. It wouldn't have taken much to explain it.As others have said this is very much a feelgood movie and I think as an exresident of NZ evocative of some of the more admirable aspects of the NZ character  the optimism the friendliness the capacity for improvisation and the willingness to rise to a challenge and even occasionally to take risks. Burt had a lot in common with those pioneer settlers from Scotland who arrived in Southland 100 years earlier and founded Invercargill a place the Maori sensibly regarded as a trifle too chilly to actually live in though they visited for the oysters and muttonbirds. But he also had some homegrown attributes as well. .";

His looking through his old family photo album with the young boy ...here's Ernie there's my Mum....they're all gone now.. is as moving a scene as the one in Honkeytonk Man where John McIntire talks to his grandson about what it was like in the Oklahoma Land Rush of his youth. Subtle underplayed but filled with deep emotion. This isn't a motorcycle movie it's simply a kind and gentle tale that inspires dreams. A thoroughly enjoyable film. As Burt says when he finally sets foot on the salt of Bonneville ...big things happen here...this is Holy ground Mate!".

	schema:headline " moving comingofage story with a starmaking performance";
	schema:reviewBody "'Monsieur Ibrahim' is a fine comingofage tale set in 1960's Paris. Young Pierre Boulanger gives a remarkably assured performance as Moses a Jewish teen living with his cold skinflint of a dad in a lessthansavory part of town. Abandoned by his mother and living in the shadow of a brother who has himself fled the scene Moses leads an embittered existence seeking surcease in the beds of the local prostitutes who ply their trade on the street where he lives. Moses is finally befriended by an aged shopkeeper named Ibrahim Demirdji a Safi Muslim who after Moses' father commits suicide adopts the boy and instills in him valuable life lessons gleaned from his religious training and his long years of experience. In terms of its storyline 'Monsieur Ibrahim' offers little that is new here the idea of an older mentor figure raising an orphan child of a different religion goes at least as far back as 'The Two of Us' in 1968 and probably much further . Where it excels is in its tenderhearted view of daily life and in its subtle plea for understanding between Arab and Jew. Moses is an almost heartbreakingly ordinary kid a fact which makes his story all the more compelling he has much of the roughandtumble poignancy of the boy in 'The 400 Blows'. We can identify with every emotion he is going through on his painful journey to adulthood his fears his insecurities his need for acceptance his appreciation of simple kindnesses. Moses lives in a world where life can sometimes be cruel but where fellow human beings reach out to help one another in their moments of greatest need. This is a beautiful heartfelt film that doesn't stand on its head to try and impress us. It seeps into our hearts one scene at a time until by the end we realize what a profound emotional impact it has had on us. Veteran actor Omar Sharif is wonderful as the solid and wise Monsieur Ibrahim but it is Boulanger who is the real revelation here. This amazing young actor is the true heart and soul of the film an absolute natural. He is very rarely off screen and he rivets our attention on his character in a way that most highly paid movie actors can merely dream about doing. I hope he makes many more films in the future.".

	schema:headline " A film of singular grace";
	schema:reviewBody "Monsieur Ibrahim the American distributors have left out the flowers of the Koran is from a novel that was made into a play by a popular writer named EricEmmanuel Schmitt. The French editor's blurb goes like this Paris in the 1960s. Momo a twelveyear old Jewish boy befriends the old Arab grocer living on Blue Street. But appearances can be deceptive Mister Ibrahim is not an Arab Blue Street is not blue and maybe the lad is not Jewish... This is the coming of age tale of a boy who when his depressed father runs away and throws himself under a train is adopted by an old Arab shopkeeper actually Turkish who has become his adoring mentor and solace.Mose nicknamed Momo Pierre Boulanger gets laid on his birthday with one of the cutest of the prostitutes who line the street where he lives. He goes back and forth to school and at home fixes dinner for his sad stingy dad and gets the food from Ibrahim's picerie down below. Momo's a sweet boy who's full of the joy of life and finds his father's grimness annoying. He gets little revenges like hogging the toilet when dad's laxative is kicking in. The movie is intimate and lovingly textured. Everything happens in the crowded Parisian street. It's summer. Momo puts on a thin white shirt over his undershirt and rehearses his opening to the whore Quelle chaleur! C'est combien? What a scorcher! How much do you charge? The light is beautiful. Pedestrians flow on the narrow sidewalk. The camerawork hugs the scenes intimate but unobtrusive. Momo has to make his own birthday celebration he's sixteen in the movie so it's legal for him to go with one of the ladies. His sexual initiation is sweet too simple not saccharine. His father is always comparing him unfavorably with a missing older brother Popol Paulie who was bookish. But Popol didn't have to do the shopping and fix dinner as Momo has to because his mother has left them. Momo doesn't remember Popol. Monsieur Ibrahim says he likes Momo 100 times better than Popol. Later it seems Popol never really existed. . .It's hard to describe this film  which the 71yearold Omar Sharif came out of retirement to star in and persuaded Franois Dupeyron to direct. It's a delicate thing gossamer light yet unforgettable. To tell its story is to break a butterfly upon a wheel. As in Manuel Pradal's 1997 Marie Baie des Anges which also has a classic mythic quality its evocation of period is effortless. Both films exist in a Fifties or Sixties time that's all the more pungent because never broadcast  except through irresistible period music. The little lessons M. Ibrahim teaches Mose I know what is in my Koran may seem clichd. The stark and exotic direction the story takes later on in its 85 minutes may seem incongruous after the classic Frenchness of the opening scenes. But the movie conveys its mood and period with a deft simplicity no American director would be capable of. When a New Wave movie scene is shot in the street with Brigitte Bardot reincarnated a bit incongruously but vividly by neodiva Isabelle Adjani it's a blissful moment of dja vu.This film achieves its perfection by not seeming to try with tossed off gestures Ibrahim giving Momo cat food to pass off as a terrine de compagne for his dad with stale bread and cheap wine to dilute his Beaujolais so he won't complain about the cost Momo smashing his piggy bank for the 35 francs to pay the prostitute a group of men suddenly appearing around Ibrahim at a cafe table in Turkey.Dad disappears after getting fired leaving his savings on the table. Momo is undaunted. He plays soccer in the street with his schoolmates learns to dance outside with the Jewish girl across the way and continues his life lessons from Monsieur Ibrahim who senses something wrong.Ibrahim is grizzled with bad teeth but his outlook on life is beautiful. Momo has a singular grace he seems to float across the screen a delicate presence. He's pretty he's cocky but vulnerable he's light on his feet. When Ibrahim buys him a new pair of shoes he twirls and flies through the air. The film itself skips along at first then takes on a realtime slowness.Ibrahim adopts Momo buys a red sports car for cash and drives through Greece and Albania to Turkey and his ancient home where he leaves Momo by the road to go ahead crashes the car and dies in a house stacked full of kilims. These events turn the film toward the feel of a fable something perhaps by some Moroccan novelist writing in singing biblical French.Earlier but at this point in the book Momo's mother comes looking for him but he poses as a boy housepainter named Mohammed. He is already playing at being the Arab on the street which is what he becomes inheriting Ibrahim's store and all his wealth choosing to live the rest of his life with a gentle irony by Ibrahim's motto Slowness la lenteur is the key to life.There may be a little too much lenteur but many things make this movie sing its lightness the flow of the editing the beauty of the photography the charm of Sharif and Boulanger. There's a scene of whirling dervishes toward the end of the two guys' odyssey that's not like anything else you've seen in the movies. The camerawork is simple handheld timeless yet evocative of the period the tones are fresh and saturated. There's an early shot of Momo in a red shirt standing in the window with a flowered curtain that's unforgettable. The color!Thanks to Omar Sharif for getting this project made. There are moments in Monsieur Ibrahim especially during the first half hour that have that blessed rightness shared only by cinematic classics.Likely to be one of the year's best.".

	schema:headline " Monsieur Ibrahim 810";
	schema:reviewBody "Every once in a while a movie comes along that's so simple in nature so kind in its intentions that it can't be American. One of those select movies is Monsieur Ibrahim a simplistic realistic story that takes place in a lowerincome area in Paris where prostitutes roam the street the streets are overcrowded so much that it's quicker to walk than drive and two unlikely people meet to form an unlikely but lasting friendship.Moses Pierre Boulanger is a sixteen year old boy who uses the previously mentioned prostitutes often as his father is too busy making ends meet to really have an impact in Moses's life. When he's caught shoplifting in Ibrahim's Omar Sharif store they soon bond and become friends. Ibrahim teaches Moses many things about life the universe and everything. Soon Moses is basically forced to flee from his home so the two of them go off on a road trip.The one thing that sold me about Monsieur Ibrahim was the genuine relationship that seemed to be shared between the two characters. It wasn't anything that seems to be prevalent in cinema now such as pedophilia or loneliness or the young person teaching life lessons to the older person. It's just like the relationship that many people have with their friends. There were a few times where I felt that it was a little too close for comfort but other than that it's just a simple friendship nothing more.Ibrahim always had something to say about one thing or another. I especially agreed with his views on money although some of the dance sequences and his mediations on dance seemed a little too heavy and untrue for a movie like this. A movie like this switches successfully between comedy and drama I especially love the piggybank analogy and works. At the end though it was predictable but the final turn worked well. Overall Monsieur Ibrahim works very well overall and is one of the most surprising movies I've seen so far this year.My rating 810Rated R for some sexual content.".

	onyx:emotionText "Every once in a while a movie comes along that's so simple in nature so kind in its intentions that it can't be American. One of those select movies is Monsieur Ibrahim a simplistic realistic story that takes place in a lowerincome area in Paris where prostitutes roam the street the streets are overcrowded so much that it's quicker to walk than drive and two unlikely people meet to form an unlikely but lasting friendship.Moses Pierre Boulanger is a sixteen year old boy who uses the previously mentioned prostitutes often as his father is too busy making ends meet to really have an impact in Moses's life. When he's caught shoplifting in Ibrahim's Omar Sharif store they soon bond and become friends. Ibrahim teaches Moses many things about life the universe and everything. Soon Moses is basically forced to flee from his home so the two of them go off on a road trip.The one thing that sold me about Monsieur Ibrahim was the genuine relationship that seemed to be shared between the two characters. It wasn't anything that seems to be prevalent in cinema now such as pedophilia or loneliness or the young person teaching life lessons to the older person. It's just like the relationship that many people have with their friends.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a reply to a couple of rather rash and inconsiderate comments above done by people who apparently not only live in a world of hatred and mistrust but cannot even assess the obvious messages in an easygoing unambiguous and outspoken story.This movie has nothing to do with RELIGIOUS PROPAGANDA! Mr Ibrahim does NOT at any point try to proselytize Moise. Moise does NOT change his name does NOT change religion and does NOT deny his roots. He was adopted for personal and not confessional reasons.The author of the novel upon which the movie is based is a French Jew by the same name as the main character. This quite easily explains why the boy had to be Jewish and not let's say Christian for that matter. To see propaganda here is a proof of bad taste.Momo was poor and an obviously bad student  he had no bright future which to sacrifice that is why he settled himself with the grocery store not because he was proselytized to adopt Arab ways.Mr Ibrahim made it quite clear that his wisdom does not come from the Koran but from life he was a halfliterate man he led a secluded life he attended no prayers he did not speak of the Prophet or whoever. He quoted the Koran only on matters of love because this is what interested him. What Mr Ibrahim knew was in his Koran which apparently escaped the attention of the paranoic Muslimhaters above were the two flowers hey they are part of the title of the movie! a remembrance of his longdead wife and love of his life.This was a movie about how religious messages may be perceived in a spirit of love and harmony with the world and not in terms of selfseclusion mutual suspicion and hatred. Yes the visits to the churches and mosques were a little too naively funny to be convincing but the message was easy to grasp  there is A LEVEL OF PERSONAL RECEPTION of religious messages the inner religion about which young Moise was wondering what it meant which is equally easy to approach by all adepts to all confessions.I actually did not like the movie that much  the plot was partly lame and too fairytalelike for such a showlifeasitis kind of movie.

However unless you'd see the sympathetic portrayal of a Muslim man IbrahimSharif as being antiSemitic it's unlikely you'll be bothered.I don't know what the thrust of the book is but movies rarely literally translate books the book may suggest but the film moves in its own direction  even at times contrarily. This film reminded me a great deal of Le mari de la coiffeuseThe Hair Dresser's Husband directed and cowritten by Patrice Leconte. That film also has a coming of age boy getting haircuts he's enthralled at having his head pressed against the bosom of his female barber. When his father questions his son about what he wishes to do when he's grown up and is displeased with the answer he sends him to bed without his supper. The rest of the film without any clear transition deals with the boy's fantasy about someday marrying a lady barber and what their life would be like. It's a realistic portrayal of an adolescent boy's fantasy.On the surface this film recounts the development of a mutually satisfying fatherson type relationship that develops between a Turkish shopkeeper and a coming of age boy MoMOBoulanger who is Jewish by the way.I say on the surface because most films try to tell a story in a way that we experience see and live the story from a fly on the wall perspective. Ahhh but not THIS film. While you COULD view it that way it's really far better understood if viewed from a different perspective. Let's say you wandered in to the shop on this Parisian street one afternoon and heard the owner called the Arab. You wonder why and also how he got into this particular trade. You start asking and he starts telling you the story of his life.And that's what this movie tells us  HIS version of HIS story as experienced through HIS eyes and ears growing up. So it's a realistic portrayal of that collection of childhood memories assumptions distortions and causes.As a child do we see things the way we'd see them as an adult? Never and so it is with this version. Everything is somewhat overdrawn not quite a caricature but somewhat that way. All the streetwalkers are attractive 2131 years old well dressed and kind. None middleaged trashy disturbed or predatory. As we recount the story of our lives we frequently expand the highs and lows and are liberal in delegating blame to those who disappoint us as well as credit to those who serve as heroes. And that's what this movie does.Seen from this frame of reference not all events make logical sense. So we never know for sure what happened to his father or mother or brother. We have his sometimes conflicting memories and versions his suppositions that substitute for reality and which leave us wondering Golly I wonder what really happened? Some things of course we'll never know. But it was fun finding out what we did. We had an interesting afternoon with the guy and he had a remarkable story to tell.One of the best pictures of all time? No. But a thoroughly entertaining one most especially for those of us interested in family dynamics.".

Why? Because we care for the characters we feel with them through them. Omar Sharif is just stellar as Monsieur Ibrahim and carries the story with such an ease that it is a delight to watch.One of the most powerful scenes for me was when Ibrahim confronts Momo about the stealing.

Pierre Boulanger has also a great acting in the role of a needy teenager that finds the father he has never had in Monsieur Ibrahim.

Ibrahim's Koran which surprised and intrigued me and what that might mean.The message boards didn't help much  and there was more ranting about more or less nothing and facts that seems unlikely to say the least.Then I found the author's site and things started to make a lot more sense.EricEmmanuel Schmitt tells us that Momo and Monsieur Ibrahim are two people who pass unnoticed through the world. Momo is an only child with no mother and a father who barely deserves the name of 'father' too sunk in depression to take care of his son and bring him up or teach him and hand on to him a taste for life and its principles. As for Monsieur Ibrahim the only thing anyone asks of him is that he give them the correct change. Both man and boy change their lives as they get to know one another. Their encounter is a marvelous enrichment.The author notes that there has been a lot of verbiage about the fact that the child is Jewish and the grocer Muslim  Rightly so. It was a deliberate move to create them like that. I set out to prove something and be provocative. What I wanted to prove was that in many places in the world European capitals ports American cities North African villages people of different religions from different backgrounds live together in harmony. In Paris Rue Bleue the road where this story takes place and where I once lived and which definitely isn't blue was largely inhabited by Jews with a few Christians and Muslims. They all shared not only the same street but daily life their joys discontents and conversation. Friendships or mutual understanding developed among these people who came from just about everywhere either geographically or spiritually. In this unpretentious quartier down from Montmartre I felt I was living somewhere rich and burgeoning where cultures met took an interest in each other and joked about their differences.Also when Momo is handed Monsieur Ibrahim's old Koran he finds what was in it  dried blue flowers. The Koran is the text but it is also what Monsieur Ibrahim has placed in it  his life his way of reading his interpretation. According to the author spirituality is not about repeating sentences parrotfashion but about grasping the meaning and understanding the concept and shades of meaning the implications. True spirituality is only worthwhile when obedience and freedom are balanced.There is a quite a bit more that you may find useful and interesting  search EricEmmanuel Schmitt if you want to explore further.".

	schema:reviewBody "Francois Dupeyron has directed a masterpiece in cinematic excellence. Don't miss this very compelling drama. Monsieur Ibrahim has a performance by Omar Sharif that extends his dramatic displays far better than any since Dr. Zhivago. His costar is Pierre Boulanger who plays Moses also called Momo in the film. Moses is only 16 and is being raised by his depressed Jewish father who reprimands Momo constantly. Momo or Moses becomes enamored by the proprietor of the neighborhood grocery across the street. He is also enamored by the young street walkers in the same location on Blue Road. The first encounter is with Anne Suarez who plays Sylvie the young blond prostitute who initiates him into her world. His most interesting relationship is with Monsieur Ibrahim who persistently repeats the importance of the Koran in his own life. The eventual adoption of Momo and their adventurous trip to Turkey is as beautiful a story as one can imagine. Be sure to add this one to your must see list.".

It was a really wonderful movie and I wouldn't mind watching it again! I felt that the movie was trying to convey to us a silent message about how we should accept one another for who were are regardless of religion caste sex or color. That we should learn how to respect each other's religion customs and lifestyles. I would have liked to see more music in the movie as well as a better idea of the location of the film. I think the actors director and other members of the crew did a really good job on the entire production. In the future I would love to see more movies of this type coming out.

In my opinion what makes this film so important is its simplicity and sincerity. Most of the recent examples of modern French cinema are suffering from flamboyance and Monsieur Ibrahim is an exception. The film delightfully combines a new perspective to love self identification and empathy with magnificent acting skills and impressing cinematography. As a Buddhist myself I've always found Safi ways interesting and this film presents a brief summary of this way of belief besides the touchy 'journey' theme. Religious motives are humanistic and the director carefully avoids any kind of religious propaganda. Instead the audience watches the journeys of two men from different ages and different cultural backgrounds. Ibrahim and Moses meet in Blue Rue which is a chaotic place for a 16 old boy to be. Both has a lot to teach each other and share. Abandoned and broken hearted Moses searches a way out through his teenage life full of growing pains whereas Ibrahim the immigrant who fell apart from his country searches a way out with the guidance of his beliefs and longings. Dialogues between Moses and Ibrahim are mind nourishing. Side characters are also memorable regarding Anne Suarez's performance as Sylvie and Lola Naymark's performance as Myriam that are truly remarkable.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the first scene of the film 12yearold Mose walks down the hot backstreets of Paris on Rue Bleue summer sizzling in the background and loses his virginity to a pretty prostitute. The sametitled novel by Franois Dupeyron opens also on this bold note setting the blunt nononsense tone and approach for the story. It explores the friendship between young Mose and old Monsieur Ibrahim the Arab on the corner and unlike the majority of French cinema it makes no pretense about it. It is merely a gentle look at how two people cultivate an unlikely fatherandson relationship.Because Mose is a Jew and Monsieur Ibrahim Omar Shariff is a Muslim the film pins cultural contrasts and issues of tolerance somewhere in between them juxtaposing their different personalities through the use of insightful dialogue the observation about trashcans in different districts comes to mind. Yet for a film primarily about beliefs and outlooks it never preaches or falls prey to moral messages which is endlessly refreshing. It does however feature a lot of religious undertones throughout and by the time Ibrahim starts teaching Mose about the Coran you know the film is about to take a standpoint.Omar Shariff allegedly came back from retirement to do this lowkey film and his dedication to the content shines through in his wonderfully charismatic performance he is a Morgan Freeman buddy type character and he manages this goodnatured persona with effortless conviction. Pierre Boulanger who plays the young boy Mose is certainly less convincing  not quite capturing the inherent loneliness or idealism of his character that explain why he seeks out prostitutes or befriends the local Arab. Thankfully Shariff more than makes up for the latter's lack of skill by being the propelling force behind their dynamic friendship.Although Monsieur Ibrahim et les fleurs du Coran is largely a characterdriven little film its style and cinematography are elegantly expressed  cleareyed and blunt at the same time as it manages to convey the dreamy steamy atmosphere of a hot summer day in Paris. Upon shifting to Middle Eastern setting it features gorgeously striking dusty plains and mountains. A device for the dreamy tone is the consistent use of a particular 1960's song the film takes place during the 1960's which invests the whole film in an almost lyrical flow.There is little wrong with the film and I greatly appreciate the direct approach to story only a few introspective moments but it is so lowkey that it becomes forgettable. It does not claim to be important and therefore isn't. It isn't a memorable product and it does not always manage touching which renders it unremarkable. 7 out 10".

The whole movie is just the fact that a Jewish kid is left to his own devices by his depressed father in a colorful neighborhood of early 1960's Paris and he turns to a Turkish grocer for a paternal role model. It manages to skirt the cloying sentiment of the similarlythemed recent Chinese film Together Han ni zai yiki especially through the boy's exposure to prostitutes and new rock 'n' roll in an exuberant soundtrack. We learn almost nothing about his mother who seems incredibly easy to fool. Let alone whoever his landlord is.Omar Sharif makes a wonderful old sage.".

The whole movie is just the fact that a Jewish kid is left to his own devices by his depressed father in a colorful neighborhood of early 1960's Paris and he turns to a Turkish grocer for a paternal role model. It manages to skirt the cloying sentiment of the similarlythemed recent Chinese film Together Han ni zai yiki especially through the boy's exposure to prostitutes and new rock 'n' roll in an exuberant soundtrack. We learn almost nothing about his mother who seems incredibly easy to fool. Let alone whoever his landlord is.Omar Sharif makes a wonderful old sage.";

He handles this with relative aplomb but as a viewer I was left gasping.You would think a movie about a single older man who befriends a young teen and takes him to the steam bath and gives him money would necessarily have sexual overtones but it just never comes up. The movie is set in a more innocent time. There is plenty of sex in the movie but all heterosexual.".

	schema:reviewBody "Starting off I will say that I am a huge fan of Omar Sharif. And how could you not be? If you have seen him in Lawrence of Arabia to Funny Girl to Dr. Zhivago you know what I mean. Monsieur Ibrahim is a truly touching cliche free story of the relationship between a young distrusting adolescent boy and the shopkeeper Sharif who knows more than he lets on. The boy Moses nicknamed Momo is Jewish and his father barely responds to him. His mother left when he was young and he cannot live up to his older brother. Ibrahim is the Muslim grocer across the street whose quiet demeanor is excellently portrayed by Sharif. He understands more about Momo than Momo realizes and they quickly become friends in the lack of a solid father figure for Momo. Ibrahim explains to Momo that there is more to life than is often seen wisdom he has learned from the Koran. The movie is highlighted by the wonderful backdrop of France in the 60s with American Rock 'n Roll playing in the background. It is reminiscent of the French New Wave which was so good at making young people seem wiser than adults often gave them credit for. Do yourself a favor and go see this wonderfully enjoyable gift of a movie. I have now seen it in the theaters twice. The film is in French with subtitles but it will not detract at all from the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been asking myself recently In this HollywoodBollywood movie world filled with shallow stereotypes and money making divas is it possible to make a truly spiritual movie that will introduce some very quiet and smiling vibration into the heart a movie that will be a success both spiritually and commercially?  Franois Dupeyron succeeds admirably in this task. Like any major work of art the movie is multifaceted and can be interpreted on many levels material as a comingofage story of waking sexuality and finding your place in the world emotional as a tragedy of a family and a vivid description of psychological troubles we deal with in life or finally spirutual with life being a mystic experience and the adventure of consciousness and joy as Indian mystic Sri Aurobindo put it.The subtlety of the movie is that it is all based on nuances  we don't see openly raging emotions and all the psychological play is presented by some almost imperceptible but very powerful symbols of what is happening in the consciousness of the character like the hat the symbol of his old life  that  Momo is helplessly kneading in his hands after he received bad news.The movie is about what we are all trying to do in life sometimes without even realizing it psychological liberation. The process of it does not end with teenage years even though some people lose the ability or desire to analyze and work on their conditioning.Monsieur Ibrahim as he says himself knows his Koran he shows the boy inner truth and inner path of freedom from our own inhibitions mastery over one's nature and also shows by his very daily acts that in the world and life there are no sacred figure to be adored blindly or just because everyone does it that the true religion lies where all religions in the world converge into some shining truth and all difference between Islam Christianity or Hinduism disappers and the world becomes one an inner religion. One can call this approach Sufi but it is only one of the names. Too bad in the United States the second part of the movie title the Flowers of Koran was missed out but ...well...no comment...Excellent acting and casting. Mr. Sharif is superb in every respect. Mr. Boulanger deserves a special mention very self confident at the same time not showy without teenage lust for fame and stardom one can expect at that age.The movie can be called one of the inner movies that shows more the inner life than outer and through the eyes of the characters   during the journey to Turkey we see the country through the eyes of someone who lived there and there is a very comfortable feeling that we  just like Momo himself  found ourselves in the country we never were befire but that still is very comfortable and looks and sounds strangely familiar.One of the most amazing episodes if the whirling dervishes scene but one has to see it and hear the voice over.The very end of the movie showing the circle of life seems to be a bit too rationalistic and more like a mechanical repetition instead of living and developing process of life and spiritual thruth. Some things are better left untold or shown indirectly. Besides Momo because of his age and apparent lack of spiritual wisdom seems unnatural and wearing someone else's clothes in the final scene.Overall the movie is the kind that is able to tell a lot only if you can see and listen. It is very real and sincere both in terms of emotional psychological problems people deal with in life and thier solutions. At the same time the movie avoids religious moralizing and has great very subtle sense of humor. Unfortunately I don't know enough about mystical side of Sufism to be able to enjoy and appreciate Sufi or Islam imagery even more.".

In fact it begins with an introduction by puppets ! so we know we're not to take the plot very seriously.  Renoir's film is light and fun and is very interesting to watch for comparisons of 'moral standards' between France and Hollywood.By now you probably know the story.  A sad little man gets involved with a prostitute and her pimp.  Hollywood toned down the fact that Robinson and Bennett were involved in a sexual relationship and the ending of the film had to live up to Hollywood's standards of 'morality'.  I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet but needless to say the endings between the two films differ in a major way.What makes SCARLET STREET so outstanding in my opinion is that given the repressed nature of the protagonist the film works better because of the changes.  You can better understand the pressures of what living as a human doormat has done to this man and how coiled up he really is.  Edward G. Robinson gives one of the best performances of his career which is saying a lot!  I know there will always be those who will insist on seeing him as the cigarchomping tough guy only and won't accept him as anything else but SCARLET STREET showcases his more subtle talents and his enormous range. Joan Bennett is pure charm and snake oil in this and Dan Duryea outweasels Richard Widmark in KISS OF DEATH in fact I'll bet good money that the weasel toons in WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT were based on Dan Duryea's character!.  Hollywood films will always falter in comparison to other country's films because the industry's fear of offending audiences always dulls the blade of truth.  But at least during the classic era of Hollywood the talent usually made up for the story flaws.  What do you get when you put Fritz Lang Edward G. Robinson Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea together?  Magic!".

	schema:reviewBody "It is often said of Fritz Lang that his American films aren't as good as the ones he made in Germany and judging by the films of his that I've seen so far this analysis is proving itself to be true...but damn this one isn't far off. Scarlet Street is simultaneously compelling and unpredictable for it's duration Lang truly knows how to plot a film and that is evident throughout. The story follows a banker and aspiring painter played to perfection by Edward G. Robinson who saves a young woman from a purse snatcher one night while on his way home from a party. The two begin talking to each other and the banker 'accidentally' tells the girl that he's paints pictures and gets a lot of money for doing so Lang shows us the pitfalls of trying to impress young women by way of lies. However all was not what it seemed with the pursesnatcher and he's actually the young lady's fianc and when he learns that his girlfriend has a man with money after her.... he's out for all he can get!A lot of Lang's American oeuvre is concentrated on the American justice system and various other crime related things and this one is no different. Scarlet Street professes that nobody can ever 'get away with murder' and the fantastic climax to the movie shows this masterfully much more so than many other films that have tried to convey the same message have. Scarlet Street is drenched with irony throughout ironically it took a nonAmerican to make an ironic American film. This irony ensures that the film stays interesting as the audience is never able to guess what's around the corner. There's nothing worse than a predictable film and Scarlet Street is certainly anything but. The movie is packed with stand out moments but non stand out more so than the ending. I'm a big fan of horror films and have seen many but many of those fail to be as chilling as the ending of Scarlet Street. The atmosphere that Lang creates is incredible and it ranks one of the most powerful psychological mind games that I've ever witnessed on screen. If Fritz Lang set out to put people off murder with this film I dare say he succeeded. I know I won't be murdering anyone after watching this!Overall Scarlet Street is another Fritz Lang masterpiece. While not as mind blowing as Metropolis or as powerful as M Scarlet Street fills a niche all of it's own. I rate this film as a 'must see' and I can almost guarantee that you will not be disappointed after seeing it.".

Robinson is among his best and often strangely neglected.For me the essence of noir films has as much to do with the bleak outlook on human existence as it does the visual sense and at the very beginning of this film we see IMHO the single most perfect noir moment Chris Cross Robinson is given a dinner a nice little send off for a nice little man. On his way out a friend asks if Chris is going to ride the train home as is his normal pattern. Chris has something on his mind though and chooses to walk instead.That one single moment that one choice... and because of that this man will lose his home his wife his career and the very thing that makes him want to continue his art. One moment one choice and an entire life is destroyed.THAT is noir!".

	schema:reviewBody "Fritz Lang does a wonderful job directing Scarlet Street a true film noir from 1945 starring Edward G. Robinson Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea. A miserable henpecked man Chris Robinson falls in love with a prostitute Kitty and she starts milking him for money with the encouragement of her abusive boyfriend Johnny Duryea. Chris is a cashier who has just reached his 25th year of service he's also a parttime painter. He steals bonds from his wife who is the widow of a police detective and sets Kitty up in an apartment where he can also paint since all his wife does is complain about him cluttering up their place. He believes that Kitty is an actress and that Johnny is the boyfriend of Kitty's exroommate. You really want to slap him. His stealing escalates meanwhile Johnny and Kitty are passing his art work off as Kitty's and she's making a name for herself. Instead of killing her then and there Chris is happy about it believing that he's a failure and could never have sold a painting and continues providing her with art work. We assume she and Johnny are getting the money.Alas there probably are desperately lonely and unhappy men like Chris with footprints all over their bodies though Chris seems pretty gullible even by 1945 standards. Robinson however does a fantastic job in helping us understand why Chris is the way he is. He's a simple shy selfeffacing man who just wants someone to love him and enjoy his hobby of painting and Kitty pays lip service to that while she's sleeping with Johnny. It seems that just to bask in her presence is enough for Chris.Using the backdrop of New York City Lang has directed this with magnificent style and flair making it one of the most famous noirs of all time. And the performances are top notch. It's amazing how much Joan and Constance Bennett looked alike when they were both blond but they were very different actresses. Constance had a great deal of sophistication Joan did better playing tramps. She had a low voice and could be very sexy and she made a stunning brunette. I saw her in person in the late '80s and was surprised at how tiny she was given how tall she looks here. If anyone has seen the Gone with the Wind screen tests she was one of the most beautiful Scarletts. Here she's very convincing talking out of both sides of her mouth telling Chris that she loves him and Johnny that she loves him. Duryea is phenomenal as a very unlikable con man and the two make a great couple.But the character of sad Chris hangs over the film due to Robinson's performance with his shy smile and nervous manner. When his anger emerges it's years and years worth of it. Unfortunately he's basically too good a man not to hate himself for actions committed in a rage and in true Hollywood fashion he goes the way of most men who let themselves be made fools of by women.A really really great film. Lang was difficult to get along with and as the studio system diminished the powers that be were less willing to put up with him so his last Hollywood films can't compare with those he did at the top. This is top Lang. Don't miss it.".

Her boyfriend Dan Duryea is perfect Duryea clever and annoying and as usual coming out less than rosy.The cinematographer Milton Krasner has so many richly brooding and dramatic films to his credit it's almost a given that we will be invisibly swept into every scene and much of the action takes place in an apartment almost tailor made for great filming with glass doors and two levels to look up or down from. The story is key based on a novel by Georges de La Fouchardire little known here but he wrote La Chienne the basis for Jean Renoir's second film 1931 where the film announces to the audience that it is about He she and the other guy . . . as usual. And that describes Scarlet Street just as well for starters.Lang is credited as one of the key shapers of the film noir style and that certainly applies visually. It lacks that film noir key of a young man at odds with postWar America but it does have a man alone at odds with the world. Chris Cross is a pathetic creature far more naive than most of us could ever be but yet we identify with him because he represents innocence swept up in a world more sinister than we expect. He's a victim in a way but also the cause of his own troubles.And troubles they are. What a story what a film. Dark wrenching and unpredictable. Very Fritz Lang.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some spoilers. As he moves uneventfully through middle age Chris Cross a poor henpecked accountant played to perfection by Edward G. Robinson begins to feel the exact dimensions of his particular prison. He has never done anything being a lifelong office drone with a drab and cheerless home and a loveless wife who is a terrible scold. His only retreat from quiet despair is dabbling in oils in his spare time. Although he clearly longs for something to happen to him he is a physically unadventurous man we quickly realize who wouldn't know where to start trying to bust a move even if he had the heart. When a sequence of events is set into motion by a chance meeting with a prostitute he is jackknifed into a track he could never have imagined. It is typical of the temper and character of this gentle man that he doesn't recognize Katherine March as a prostitute or that the man beating on her for money isn't simply a thief but her pimp. Once the bus on which Chris has been biding his time begins to roll down the hill he wants off at the next stop. But it is too late. This fatalistic film could make you believe that we are rationed in life precisely what we are able to handle. And further that the few people who manage to fly under the radar for a while and live a life not intended for them are always checked inevitably. Chris never really gets cut much slack here even during his outofcontrol ride He experiences one of the two life triumphs he has longed for the public discovery of his artistic talent  vicariously as through a pane of glass. Even when his art becomes famous it happens in such a messedup way he is forced to observe from the sidelines wondering what it must be like to be the artist who is getting all the accolades. And the one other life triumph he longs for  the love of a beautiful woman  plays him false when it finally appears making the sad unexciting little life he had before seem sweetly and simply desirable by comparison. Scarlet Street IS an unstintingly sad claustrophobic story. Movies seldom told stories like this at the time of Scarlet Streets release and still don't too downbeat everybody likes feelgood movies. Don't they? The makers supposedly had to change the ending of this film to satisfy censors. What remains is nevertheless a finish that is hauntingly right if not especially just one that will stay with you for years to come. Ten Stars. As good as it gets.".

It's also easy to see Fritz Lang's skilled hand at work in the storytelling mood and pacing.Robinson shows his skill and versatility in portraying a mildmannered bank cashier who really wants nothing more than the chance to dabble in his painting before getting caught up in a complicated situation. Bennett is quite effective as the opportunistic young woman who befriends him and Dan Duryea adds his presence and ability to very good effect  Duryea had the knack of portraying this kind character as well as anyone. His appearance in any filmnoir always seemed to make an average movie good and a good movie even better.The story is developed carefully as Robinson's character slowly begins to realize that he has gotten into a situation beyond his control. By the time that things come to a head the tension is considerable. The ending is also rather resourceful in being carefully written so as to satisfy the stringent requirements of the production code of the era while also ending the story in a way that seems appropriate and fitting to the tone of the movie as a whole.All of this adds up to make Scarlet Street a fine movie that is well worth seeing especially for fans of filmnoir.".

One dark night he comes to the rescue of an attractive but gold digging woman Kitty Joan Bennett who really doesn't love him but thinks he is a talented and rich painter.  He permits her to believe this because he is smitten with her.

The results are shocking.I've heard much about the famed director Fritz Lang but this is his first film I've seen that I'm aware of unless he directed the silent film Metropolis which it seems that he may have and which I didn't like all that well.Anyway this is a great film!  It's a morality tale and sometimes morality gets twisted when the good character goes bad and the bad characters get more that they bargained for from someone they thought was an easy target. It's wonderfully directed by the aforementioned director Fritz Lang.  The movie gets better and better as it progresses.  By the end this old movie had me in it's clutches.  Extremely watchable and entertaining the director put together some extraordinary cinematic moments which pack a punch and linger in your memory.  I was amazed by Edward G. Robinson's performance in the scene where his boss fires him.  The tears in his eyes and the look of shame and defeat on his face are unforgettable.  Edgar G. Robinson delivers a near genius performance.  Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea are no slouches either.  The real applause however needs to go to the director for many marvelous touches in this film and for a powerful climax that will impact you.  I give this movie a 91100.  In my book it's a classic or near classic film.  Don't miss it!".

Little does he know her actual lover has persuaded her to milk him for all he's worth.You might find that the above description sounds a bit clichd and I'd be inclined to agree. About the first hour of the film proceeds in predictable fashion before the story really comes into its own. The plot does eventually justify your attention but the routine proceedings of the film's first half are arguably its biggest drawback.The cast is decent but not outstanding. Edward G. Robinson gives the best performance by far. It's hard to believe that he was never even nominated for an Oscar over his long career. I have less patience for Joan Bennett  Dan Duryea though that's mainly because their characters are basically one dimensional.Lang's direction is attractive while the H.J. Salter score and Milton Krasner cinematography combine to give the film the atmosphere that it requires. The adapted screenplay from Dudley Nichols also delivers the goods in the long run.Had the film not started out so ordinarily I would have ranked it higher but even though the latter portion of the film is eminently satisfying I can't ignore what preceded it. Nevertheless I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the film despite my caveat regarding the film's relatively uninteresting early stages.By the way this film is in the public domain meaning that any distributor can sell copies without licensing the material. As a result poor quality versions of the film abound on home video. As far as I know the best presentation available is the Kino DVD edition which is mastered from material preserved by the Library of Congress.".

	schema:headline " Black comedy mixes poorly with the melodrama in this flawed but fascinating film noir";
	schema:reviewBody "Few movie fans and no film noir fans will want to miss this flawed but fascinating film with the great Edward G. Robinson playing Christopher Cross a banker and amateur painter who falls in love with a woman Joan Bennett young enough to be his daughterand devious enough to destroy his life. She is in love with the noaccount Dan Duryea who slaps her around and encourages her friendship with the old dupe. But who is duping whom? He tells her he's a famous painter and she believes him. So does the noaccount who tries to sell the paintingsand sets in motion a series of events that will drastically change Cross's life.I haven't read the novel or play La Chienne that provided the basis for Scarlet Street nor have I seen the Jean Renoir film based on the book. I hear they're all black comedies which might explain the offbeat quality to this film. Did the director Fritz Lang intend a black comedy only to be thwarted by Universal Studios? Did he intend the serious tone but neglect to remove some of the sources' black comic elements?Whatever happened Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea don't quite seem to belong to this movie. Duryea in particular seems to playing his part for laughs. Bennett isn't bad but there's a certain phoniness to her performance. Watch that scene where she sits in her bed while talking on the phone she seems to be posing for a magazine layout. She's also too stridently evil. There are hints from her dialogue that her character Kitty is a fundamentally decent woman corrupted by her lover. But Bennett doesn't convey this particularly well. I believe Kitty's hateful outburst at the end is an expression of selfloathing and of a frustration over Robinson being gullible enough to allow her to be so evil more than it is an expression of sheer malice. Bennett plays only the malice.Another thing that seems left over from a black comedy is the introduction of the character with the eye patch. I won't give away the surprise but I do think the situation too wacky and implausible for this film. Did this plot twist come from La Chienne or was it imposed by censors who wanted to prevent a certain sin from occurring in a film already drenched in sin!?The two young lovers Kitty and Johnny seem drawn from lifeif you can ignore the way they're performed. Kitty is a woman who couldn't bear a man to treat her well. Her need to be slapped around was probably too potent for 1945 just as it's too politically incorrect for 2007. But it's true to the dark side of human nature. We all know women like Kitty. Johnny is a bit opaque to me. Does he need to slap around a woman to love her? Does he love Kitty at all? My guess is he doesn't love her. Does he even want her? That I don't know.This slowmoving film rewards the viewer with many persuasive and memorable moments. There's the behavior of Robinson's shrewish wife Rosalind Ivan when a friend comes to visit. There's Robinson's sincere speech telling how he creates a painting. Finally Fritz Lang uses shadows distorted sound and bizarre sets to convey Robinson's state of mind in the frightening last scenes.".

	onyx:emotionText "Few movie fans and no film noir fans will want to miss this flawed but fascinating film with the great Edward G. Robinson playing Christopher Cross a banker and amateur painter who falls in love with a woman Joan Bennett young enough to be his daughterand devious enough to destroy his life. She is in love with the noaccount Dan Duryea who slaps her around and encourages her friendship with the old dupe. But who is duping whom? He tells her he's a famous painter and she believes him. So does the noaccount who tries to sell the paintingsand sets in motion a series of events that will drastically change Cross's life.I haven't read the novel or play La Chienne that provided the basis for Scarlet Street nor have I seen the Jean Renoir film based on the book. I hear they're all black comedies which might explain the offbeat quality to this film. Did the director Fritz Lang intend a black comedy only to be thwarted by Universal Studios? Did he intend the serious tone but neglect to remove some of the sources' black comic elements?Whatever happened Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea don't quite seem to belong to this movie. Duryea in particular seems to playing his part for laughs. Bennett isn't bad but there's a certain phoniness to her performance. Watch that scene where she sits in her bed while talking on the phone she seems to be posing for a magazine layout. She's also too stridently evil. There are hints from her dialogue that her character Kitty is a fundamentally decent woman corrupted by her lover. But Bennett doesn't convey this particularly well. I believe Kitty's hateful outburst at the end is an expression of selfloathing and of a frustration over Robinson being gullible enough to allow her to be so evil more than it is an expression of sheer malice. Bennett plays only the malice.Another thing that seems left over from a black comedy is the introduction of the character with the eye patch. I won't give away the surprise but I do think the situation too wacky and implausible for this film. Did this plot twist come from La Chienne or was it imposed by censors who wanted to prevent a certain sin from occurring in a film already drenched in sin!?The two young lovers Kitty and Johnny seem drawn from lifeif you can ignore the way they're performed.

Robinson's a decent man though and interferes when he sees a man slapping a woman around on a lonely street in Greenwich Village.He shouldn't have. The woman turns out to be an actress Joan Bennet being mistreated by the man she loves her boy friend Dan Duryea. Over coffee Bennet is mistakenly led to believe that Robinson is a famous painter whose work sells for as much as fifty grand. She and Duryea two weasels successfully dupe Robinson into supporting Bennet in her own apartment and Bennet is constantly wheedling money out of him. Robinson's problem is that he's trying to support himself and his nagging wife on a cashier's salary but since he's now in love with a woman who loves him or so he thinks he steals money for her from the bank.The story gets complicated after that with Robinson's paintings being discovered by an art critic and without Robinson's knowledge being sold for big bucks under Bennet's signature and  well Robinson finally twigs and murders Bennet with an ice pick. Duryea is convicted of the crime and executed. Robinson's embezzlement is found out and he's fired. Then he contracts a severe case of immanent justice which is the notion that bad behavior leads to illness and suffering even in the absence of any causal connection. Robinson winds up wandering the streets an insane bindle stiff hearing the voices of Bennet and Duryea ridiculing him.The year before this was released Fritz Lang directed a successful noir with the same three leads in similar roles The Woman in the Window. There Robinson was a psychology professor who kills a man in self defense and tries with Bennet's help to cover up the crime even while scuzzbag Duryea is figuring things out.Scarlet Street suffers by comparison. It's an ugly picture. In the earlier film Robinson's wife was away but he gathered with two or three friends regularly to have dinner and some witty and sophisticated conversation at their club. Robinson's professor was a little bored but otherwise generally satisfied with his life. The plot was simple straightforward and filled with suspense. In this one Robinson is stupid and friendless from the beginning. Instead of one whiny voiced snoop everybody seems to mistreat him lie to him exploit him and ridicule him in his absence. Or like his wife they simply insult him constantly and boss him around. And they all live like slobs. Bennet flips her cigarette butt into a sink piled high with dirty dishes.The problem doesn't lie in Lang's direction. He does a fine job. The murder scene may make you gasp with surprise the brutality emerging as it does out of a mildmannered clerk. There's a bit of ironic humor in evidence too. Robinson's wife too stingy to buy her own radio goes downstairs to listen to The Happy Family Hour while Robinson sits at the dinner table and buries his head in his hands. And the dialog is sometimes keen. He's too dumb to be a phony. And he IS. Robinson's performance isn't bad but it's stereotyped. There's little complexity in it. He's thoroughly undermined by his corrosive lack of self esteem a naive selfdeprecating fool and he's treated like one. Bennet is more animated than in the earlier film but Duryea is if anything even a riper villain than before.In real life of course Edward G. Robinson was a true aficionado of classical art and along with Vincent Price had one of the more esteemed and expensive art collections in Hollywood. In the film  and I don't know if this was intended as a joke or not  his muchadmired paintings truly stink. Take a good look at that flower in the milk glass. My kid could have done better than that with finger paints in kindergarten. I'll reserve judgment on the big snake with the forked tongue wrapped around the el tracks. That one is either way over my head or way under it.Overall it's pretty depressing and paints a bleak EdwardHopperly picture of modern life so to speak without much in the way of redemptive wit. It reaches for tragedy and winds up with only melancholy baby. Rent The Woman in the Window instead. If nothing else the transfer to DVD is better. This print is so fuzzy and blotched that when an envelope is held up for the audience the viewer can't read the address.".

Duryea doesn't even seem to be taking his role seriously until the con is exposed. And his attire doesn't help much I kept fearing that at any moment he would take his panama off and break into a tap dancing routine and when wearing those suspenders I was expecting at any moment to see Ross Perot dropping in for an interview. I know he was the resident bad guy in many films of the 40s but I don't see anything threatening in his presence. Even his regular slapping of her looks forced and she doesn't look really intimidated by him as it would be the case of any abused woman. As for her she looks totally unconvincing as a streetwalker. She's too fine and delicate. Phony is the word that best describe her acting here. Lindsay should have been the one playing the character a real babe! had I been Chris I would have immediately forgotten Kitty when meeting her.For more than an hour SS plays out more like a comedy noir than a film noir as if Lang wasn't still sure where he wanted to take his movie this is especially true in the scene when Johnny  Kitty examine the paintings Chris just brought in. That would be fitting as Lang seems to have a dark sense of humor too just note the violins during the first romantic date between Chris  Kittyand what a crap the masterpieces are.I see here that Chris has fooled not only Kitty but also many reviewers. He is not the poor innocent sap many assume he is. He has been using her as much as she has been using him both are profiteers egocentric little creatures. There's no generosity in them Chris's problem is not one of lack of selfesteem but of egoism as he sets no ethical bounds to his own behavior when trying to fulfil his romantic fantasies. The emptiness in his life is the result of his own spiritual vacuousness his emotional laziness and for that he has nobody else to blame but himself. His own boss doesn't think much of him as he doesn't even bother to personally present him his 25th anniversary gift. J.J. Hogarth knows him well as everyone else Adele the first. That's why they treat him the way they do. And he hasn't been conned either by Kitty  Johnny after all because they have given him good value in exchange for the money he paid the feeling of being young free and in love. He has as much right to complain as if they had been selling him bona fide cocaine or alcohol. And what truly makes him explode is not his discovery of the con which is secondary to him but the fact that he has come to realize that he can't escape the prison of his own life. Adele isn't gone after all she has simply reincarnated in Kitty. At the sight of her taunting him Chris has understood that this is simply a vision of things to come a vignette of what his future life would have been had her instead accepted his marriage proposal. It's really that awful revelation the sight of the ugliness of his own life what makes him go berserk. So he stabs her the same way he would have broken in pieces a mirror showing him his own unflattering physical features. That's why he is so consumed by remorse later having caused the deaths of two innocents. They are not guilty of the misery of his life it was like that before they came and it will be the same after but now with the burden of their deaths on his conscience. Had they been truly guilty in his eyes had the con really been played on him he would have felt instead avenged redeemed free.I give it 710 mostly for the cinematography and for Robinson's acting work but I don't think it matters. This is genre rapidly fading in the popular conscientiousnessnot only because of its BW but mostly for his utter hopeless and its cynical take on life in gen.and for one I won't be missing its deeply entrenched misogyny and pessimistic mood.".

	schema:reviewBody "Everyone with a bit of classic film knowledge will know about Hollywood movies acquiring a cynical streak in the 40s and 50s. The plot of a picture like Scarlet Street has been analysed into banality for various psychological readings over the years but there is little about its story that is unique to what we call film noir. It is in any case a rough remake of the earlier French film La Chienne itself based on a novel and a silent American picture called The Whispering Chorus 1918 has many similarities. What is so striking about Scarlet Street and so many other noirs is not the themes of the story but the way it is told. Cinema is after all about images.A lot of the look of pictures from this time is down to the circumstances of the war when resources for film making were at a severe low point. Even prestigious wartime productions like For Whom the Bell Tolls and Since You Went Away while epic in length take place on a few small and poorlylit sets and aren't exactly bustling with extras. Now take a little production like Scarlet Street which would receive an even smaller allocation and by necessity you must film it in tiny cramped sets shrouded in darkness or dark street corners devoid of passersby. Of course povertyrow pictures have existed in every era but I think the thing that distinguishes ones like this is that they worked sensibly within their limited parameters. A BWestern from the 30s or a trashy scifi from the 50s would aim high and thus look very cheap. A picture like Scarlet Street aims low and thus looks appropriately atmospheric.If ever there was a director to wring a nightmarish feel from the simplest of elements it was Fritz Lang. He actually makes a virtue of Scarlet Street's low production values shrouding many of the scenes in a cloak of darkness. Take the squalid bar where the two leads go for their first drink together. The standard way to dress that set would be to fill it with meanlooking riffraff. Instead dark and all but deserted it has the atmosphere of a graveyard. And yet Lang's compositions arrange the sparse set decoration into complex patterns making everywhere look like some horrid maze. Scarlet Street also contains some fine examples of Lang's use of imagery to make us understand a character's mindset. When Edward G. Robinson explains that when he looks at the dilapidated flower he sees the ornate one he has painted there is an attentiongrabbing whip pan to the real flower balanced on the edge of a grimy basin. In the following scene there is a jarring cut as Joan Bennett throws her cigarette in a sink full of dirty crocks. The similarity of these two images and the way we are made to pay attention to them gives us a subtle link between Robinson seeing beauty in the wilted flower and seeing worth in Bennett.It's odd how Lang's pictures normally featured quite overblown hammy performances whereas here the three main players are all nicely understated. Eddie Robinson normally a brash wisecracker does an excellent and rather poignant job of the sensitive and selfeffacing Chris Cross very subtle and very believable. Joan Bennett is great too making us believe in both the lowdown floozy who loves a gangster and the sweet innocent lass Robinson worships. And then there is another fabulous turn by Dan Duryea who always seemed a bit of a caricature because of his mischievous face and sly voice but could be a very effective villain when he underplayed it giving the impression of a creepy man who is capable of sinister acts. In fact Duryea is in constant danger of stealing the picture and Lang wisely puts his back to the camera in a lot of scenes to stop him upstaging the leads.Of course the real question is does all the business of Scarlet Street work? It does indeed. The story may have been old but this version of it has a unique atmospheric veneer which makes it chill the heart and linger in the mind. This is how great film noir works.".

	onyx:emotionText "Everyone with a bit of classic film knowledge will know about Hollywood movies acquiring a cynical streak in the 40s and 50s. The plot of a picture like Scarlet Street has been analysed into banality for various psychological readings over the years but there is little about its story that is unique to what we call film noir. It is in any case a rough remake of the earlier French film La Chienne itself based on a novel and a silent American picture called The Whispering Chorus 1918 has many similarities. What is so striking about Scarlet Street and so many other noirs is not the themes of the story but the way it is told. Cinema is after all about images.A lot of the look of pictures from this time is down to the circumstances of the war when resources for film making were at a severe low point. Even prestigious wartime productions like For Whom the Bell Tolls and Since You Went Away while epic in length take place on a few small and poorlylit sets and aren't exactly bustling with extras. Now take a little production like Scarlet Street which would receive an even smaller allocation and by necessity you must film it in tiny cramped sets shrouded in darkness or dark street corners devoid of passersby. Of course povertyrow pictures have existed in every era but I think the thing that distinguishes ones like this is that they worked sensibly within their limited parameters. A BWestern from the 30s or a trashy scifi from the 50s would aim high and thus look very cheap. A picture like Scarlet Street aims low and thus looks appropriately atmospheric.If ever there was a director to wring a nightmarish feel from the simplest of elements it was Fritz Lang. He actually makes a virtue of Scarlet Street's low production values shrouding many of the scenes in a cloak of darkness. Take the squalid bar where the two leads go for their first drink together. The standard way to dress that set would be to fill it with meanlooking riffraff. Instead dark and all but deserted it has the atmosphere of a graveyard. And yet Lang's compositions arrange the sparse set decoration into complex patterns making everywhere look like some horrid maze. Scarlet Street also contains some fine examples of Lang's use of imagery to make us understand a character's mindset. When Edward G. Robinson explains that when he looks at the dilapidated flower he sees the ornate one he has painted there is an attentiongrabbing whip pan to the real flower balanced on the edge of a grimy basin.

Do yourself a favor and skip this one. Watch the news or some commercials instead. Trust me it's better!I like Ben Stiller and really love Drew Barrymore which was why I watched this movie at all. It starts off with a sweet background story and a very sweet couple you root for as the bad luck begins.HERE BE SPOILERS!!!Being a comedy I was hoping into the very end that it would have a happy ending. Instead I was more and more frustrated irritated agonized and angry!!! I really hate movies which base their humour on the misery of others. Even more so if the misery is partially due to stupidity. What annoyed me was first of all how the couple tolerated the mistreatment. And why on earth didn't they respond with the same medicine annoy the lady even more! Make her miserable. Beat her at her own game! And the story was weak and transparent it was apparent early on that the lady was doing this intentionally and that the house salesman was in on it. Or enter hitman for when they would be desperate enough to think that was a good idea.The only surprise was their lame idea to wreck the house so she might leave. For a second I thought they were finally going to make HER life miserable only to find out they were trying to electrocute or gas her to death. Ever heard of life sentence for murder? In the end they wrecked their house were humiliated and tortured sleep deprivation is an effective kind of torture lost their jobs sold everything they loved payed repairs and new TV for the lady sold the house at a huge huge sic loss and on top of that left seeing the lady dead just when they've signed over the house.  The last 'happy' scene is just a joke in my face. END SPOILERS !!!I have no idea if anyone cares enough to read my entire review. But if you are a fan of Drew Barrymore or Ben Stiller do yourself a favour and DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. It is a complete waste of your time and will only leave you disappointed.Now if you are a fourteen year old who enjoys killing ants and who laugh when your friend falls and breaks a leg then this is your cup of tea.".

I am a major fan of Drew Barrymore and the combination of her and Stiller had promise. I hadn't heard great things about Duplex but like to decide for myself. Unfortunately I didn't like this. This movie I guess was OK to start but took a turn for the worse and didn't let up. By the end I was sort of out of it. And not in a good way.There were a number of things that bothered me about this. Number one is the mean spiritedness. Number two is the means spiritedness. And number three is the mean spiritedness. Oh yeah maybe a few other things...The way Duplex develops it gets to the point where one is numb watching it and just wants it to end. As Drew and Ben step up their efforts to drive the old lady out of the duplex things go more and more wrong for them and it's not like the audience doesn't see this coming. Every twist and turn that happens can be totally predicted. The movie gets to the point where it seems like it's one major focus is StillerBarrymore try to drive old lady away it backfires. Unfortunately after seeing this happen about 20 times it DOES make one a bit weary. The happenings become more and more ridiculous and when Stiller loses his book it's at the point where it's just painful. There's nothing funny about this and I'm not sure what the movie's point was. There is a time when something crosses the line from being funny to annoying. And watching it I really did wonder why certain things were even put in there as they were not on the par with what the talented people involved in this have brought to us with other films.Duplex gets a three from me because there were a few genuinely laugh out loud funny lines. But that is only in the beginning things turn around very quickly. I guess to sum up I'd describe this not just with the standard disapointing but also puzzling. I just don't get it either I'm quite wrong about what is actually funny or this movie just didn't get it. I do tend to think the latter. My vote's 3 of 10.".

Here a nice NY couple finally find their dream home only to discover that they have a built in tenant. Not exactly what they were looking for but it really can't be that bad can it? The little old lady that lives upstairs turns out to be a nightmare and a half. In a variety of scenarios most comical and some just plain outright strange the nice couple turn into psycho landlords and the nice old lady turns into the crazy bat upstairs. In the end the twist comes as a true surprise. A hilarious laugh out loud movie this was really enjoyable and a must watch. DeVito has done it again and I can't wait to see what's coming next!!!810".

Here a nice NY couple finally find their dream home only to discover that they have a built in tenant. Not exactly what they were looking for but it really can't be that bad can it? The little old lady that lives upstairs turns out to be a nightmare and a half. In a variety of scenarios most comical and some just plain outright strange the nice couple turn into psycho landlords and the nice old lady turns into the crazy bat upstairs. In the end the twist comes as a true surprise. A hilarious laugh out loud movie this was really enjoyable and a must watch. DeVito has done it again and I can't wait to see what's coming next!!!810";

The house which has three fireplaces is a dream the price is very reasonable and the only inconvenient is the existence of the old tenant Mrs. Connelly Eileen Essel on the second floor. Although aware that they can not move the old lady from her apartment the young couple decides to buy the duplex. When they move to their new home their lives become a hell due to the nasty Mrs. Connelly. Duplex is a very funny black comedy directed by Danny DeVito who is a specialist in this genre. Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore show a great chemistry but Eileen Essel steals the show in the role of a sweet  nasty old lady. There are two plot points in the end of the story that I liked a lot. Duplex is not a masterpiece but make the viewer who likes black humor laughs a lot and is a good entertainment. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Duplex".

	schema:reviewBody "DUPLEX is truly one of the worst movies I've seen in years. Not even considering the talent involved the movie is poorly written directed edited photographed paced and performed. If it was a small independent made by and starring unknowns it would still suck.As the young couple struggling to find a place to live Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore two actors I usually like have absolutely no chemistry at all. They seem to just recite their lines back and forth and never seem to actually be speaking to one another. Stiller does his usual barelycontrollinghimself shtick and Barrymore plays her cute adorable character so badly she is shockingly unlikable.Danny DeVito shows zero of the style and energy he brought to THE WAR OF THE ROSES and THROW MAMA FROM THE TRAIN. It seems like he directed this movie over the phone with an assistant director who barely spoke English as his liaison to the cast and crew. Scenes are so badly edited together there seem to be chunks of the movie missing although there doesn't seem to be any plot points left open. It's just a case of bad writing and directing coming together to create a train wreck of a movie.Apparently the filmmakers were trying to craft a tasteless black comedy along the lines of WHERE'S POPPA or NEIGHBORS but they don't have the guts nor the wit to pull it off. Instead it resorts to the usual fart and puke jokes and pulls the rug out from the audience just when it seems the movie is finally going to get as depraved as it seems to be promising. The ending of the movie is almost aggressively insulting to the audience's intelligence adding insult to injury.I wasn't expecting much from DUPLEX and didn't even get that. It is one of those rare movies that is completely devoid of redeeming value. There isn't a single moment in the movie that was anything close to entertaining surprising or even interesting. The only thing tasteless and offensive about it is that it exists.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's always nice to find a simple pleasant comedy amidst the horde of mainstream moneymakers released every year. It's not that I have a distaste for epics or overproduced movies but after viewing overwhelming films it's always fun to view a simple one shortly afterwards. And if that's what you're looking for  a simple sweet comedy  then Duplex certainly fits the bill.Almost.It's not evil but it isn't exactly sweet. Its premise sounds like the former  it's about two landlords who try to kill their upstairs tenant who is unable to be forced from the apartment due to contractual obligations. For Alex and Nancy Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore this is at first no problem whatsoever. They purchase a nice New York duplex and have no hesitations about loaning out the floor upstairs. Quoting the title of a film starring DeVito the director What's the worst that could happen?Well a lot.At first as is always the case everything seems nice and dandy. They move in buy some furniture set up their new lives and manage to relax a bit. But soon the sweet old lady their real estate agent told them about turns out to be the spawn of Satan. She is an Irish woman who is somewhere between ninetyfive and a hundredandfive lives by herself upstairs plays her television very loud all night long boasts about her passed husband and how great a sea fisherman he was in his day calls Alex Alan and refuses to admit she's made a mistake etc. etc. She calls Alex upstairs every day and has him run extravagant errands for her. Alex is a struggling writer with a deadline before his second book is due so he tries to tell the sweet old woman that he can't help her out all the time. But there's just this one thing she says and fits on an angelic smile in order to make him feel sorry for her.But soon she's claiming that her landlords are trying to rape and murder her and the cops side with the woman. Left with nowhere to go Alex and Nancy eventually succumb to their anger and decide they must put the hag out of her misery and take over the upstairs floor. Their excuse is that a baby is on the way and they'll need the room but by this time we sympathize with both of them and want to see this woman murdered anyway. Trust me after you watch this movie you'll be feeling the same way too.And I suppose that's part of the success of Duplex  like other DeVito movies it takes a seemingly appalling plot see Throw Momma From the Train and by advancing and developing its characters and drawing us into their conflicts has us relate to them. We want the hag dead too.Danny DeVito's directorial debut Throw Momma from the Train 1987 was a simple dark comedy that borrowed its premise from Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train. Since then DeVito has delivered a fair share of hits The War of the Roses and misses Death to Smoochy. One thing's for sure though all of his films have a distinct style of humor and exploitation of the weakness of humanity that separates them from the rest of the genre.DeVito is able to make the audience relate with his characters and have them fantasize about doing similar things. I'm so evil Barrymore complains halfway through the movie. Well I have my fantasies too Stiller tells her which is then followed by images of him killing the old woman upstairs and smiling about it. He tells her his ideas. She grins. You're evil too!From a text standpoint this indeed seems very evil and appears as if it would be in a Stone Natural Born Killers or Tarantinowritten True Romance movie. But when you're watching Duplex it all comes across as a joke and it doesn't seem very cruel at all and DeVito's ability to transform his audience into fantasizing sickos is sort of mildly genius if you stop and think about it. I'd never kill an old woman but Duplex is able to make us sympathize with its characters and agree with their decision. Now that's the sign of a good director if you ask me.45 stars.John Ulmer".

	schema:reviewBody "'Duplex' is a surprisingly funny movie. I say surprisingly because I don't usually find Ben Stiller movies to be all that funny and the addition of Drew Barrymore doesn't tend to improve a comedy's prospects. The little old lady in the movie is eerily similar to the little old lady in a movie called 'The Ladykillers' 1955. In that movie an elderly widowed woman who looks astonishingly similar to the one in 'Duplex' lives alone in a grand old house with her pet parrot her beloved husband having been longago lost at sea. Although to the unsuspecting she may appear helpless and frail there is much more vigor to her than meets the eye. The two characters share so many similarities that were the movies not separated by half a century I could have sworn the same actress played both roles. As in 'Ladykillers' we can expect the feisty multigenerian to focus prominently in the plot's developments and as might be expected do a series of oneups on her competition. Other similarities abound. One difference between 'Ladykillers' and 'Duplex' however is that while in the former we immediately want to root for the little old lady in the latter our sympathies lie closer to Stiller's and Barrymore's characters. Eventually we realize that a more devious plot is afoot but not before Stiller and Barrymore decide to take matters into their own hands.".

In this case it would be an insult for the TV genre because 'Duplex' is much poorer in comic effects funny characters and has even less decent jokes than the average 25 minutes comedy TV series. The story is of a young couple who cannot afford a flat in Manhattan and compromise for a Brooklyn duplex which has an old and frail lady living on the high floor. A few film minutes later the viewer discovers that the old lady is not as frail as it seems and is far from being a nice neighbor. Everything else is just boring and old jokes easy to predict plot and flat character comedy. Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore are not bad actors but De Vitto is no director so they do just what their instinct tells them to do. Eileen Esselis almost an amateur if I get it right and she is the best thing in this movie in the role of the old lady. The problem is that the script and the director do not help at all to create any viewer sympathy for one of the parties. The film has a supposed surprising end but in the context of this flat film it does not add too much. For the duration of 'Duplex' you can watch three TV comedies. My recommendation is  pick the TV. 3 out of 10 on my personal scale.".

We have seen Stiller with a dog Something About Mary a ferret Along Came Polly two horses in the soon to be released Starsky  Hutch and Envy and now a parrot in Duplex.

But after the first few minutes the irritation starts. Time after time you're confronted by the utterly stupid illogical and helpless behaviour of the starring couple. I mean if there is absolutely no way you could imagine any one you know to behave like the way these two behave how are you supposed to enjoy any of it? And when in addition this submitting stupidity and it's not like it's a Dumb  Dumber kind of stupidity since these two are supposed to be like a normal young couple leads into a devastating mishap one after another the irritation accumulates to a level I don't remember experiencing in any other movie.By the time about one third of the movie has passed it becomes obvious that there isn't going to be any change. All you will see is irritating scene one after another seasoned with some of the worst examples of poo humour ever. Depending on the point of view the ending may bring some consolidation to the otherwise crappy content but for me the only consolation was the relief I got when the movie actually ended.It's not like I couldn't enjoy a dark comedy Very Bad Things for example is a quite good one but since Duplex offers practically no plot to follow nor characters to identify yourself with and the jokes are mostly artificial predictable unfunny and even disgusting at times and since the only real substance is the misfortune of the main characters there is really no way I could recommend this to anyone.".

I mean if there is absolutely no way you could imagine any one you know to behave like the way these two behave how are you supposed to enjoy any of it? And when in addition this submitting stupidity and it's not like it's a Dumb  Dumber kind of stupidity since these two are supposed to be like a normal young couple leads into a devastating mishap one after another the irritation accumulates to a level I don't remember experiencing in any other movie.By the time about one third of the movie has passed it becomes obvious that there isn't going to be any change. All you will see is irritating scene one after another seasoned with some of the worst examples of poo humour ever. Depending on the point of view the ending may bring some consolidation to the otherwise crappy content but for me the only consolation was the relief I got when the movie actually ended.It's not like I couldn't enjoy a dark comedy Very Bad Things for example is a quite good one but since Duplex offers practically no plot to follow nor characters to identify yourself with and the jokes are mostly artificial predictable unfunny and even disgusting at times and since the only real substance is the misfortune of the main characters there is really no way I could recommend this to anyone.";

Hired as scouts after losing their supplies to the Indians Jed Gus and Mungo adjust to living the civilized' life within a fort on the edge of the last frontier.' Jed who has been raised by Gus both inspires and looks up to the older' Gus and Mungo and has an especially difficult time dealing with civilization.' His real problems start after he becomes strongly attracted to the colonel's wife Corrina. Colonel Marstonis a reckless man who endangers every one around him with his dreams of  ruthless victory over any opponent. Corrina a woman repressed by her station and sense of responsibility loves her husband for what he could be and Jed for what he is. Caught in the middle is Captain Riordon a brave and likeable man torn among his duty to the army his strong friendship with Jed and his fear of the likely disastrous consequences of the colonel's recklessness. What makes this movie so interesting as well as entertaining is that in most cases the weaknesses and the strengths of The Last Frontier' are EXACTLY the same elements forget the insipid title and dated musicFirst the screenplay. Almost all of the subplots particularly the reckless Colonel have been done better elsewhere but have rarely been assembled with such eccentricity.  Just when you THINK you know what is going to happen next this one takes off in a DIFFERENT direction. POSSIBLE SPOILER  The Last Frontier' being a Production Code' movie back in the day the word virgin' was taboo it's very surprising that the adultery factor was handled in such a mature tolerant manner. I expected either Jed or the colonel's wife to reap some retribution for their sin. I was surprised and a little disappointed the movie didn't exploit that expectation to create a less predictable ending.Second the casting. Mature is at least ten years too old to play the part of Jed the wildeyed innocent raised in the woods'.  James Whitmore who plays Gus the man who raised Jed' is actually five years younger than Mature. Nevertheless Mature is very endearing playing a character who is innocent of civilization but is in no way stupid. Although there were several actors who could have played the role at the time most notably Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas none could have played Jed better. Preston also Mature's junior plays Colonel Marston missing the tics and affectations one would expect from such a driven man. However Preston perfectly captures the sense of honor someone must have seen in Marston to promote such a reckless fool to colonel's rank. Bancroft is an especially shrewd choice as Corrina. Bancroft's dark hair has been died blonde and this achieves the same effect as it did for Winona Ryder Edward Scissorhands' and Christina Ricci Sleepy Hollow'. That is I felt conflicted about the character without knowing exactly why I believe the answer is that blondes and brunettes have considerably different skin tones and eye shades. Further Bancroft has always projected a toughness that borders on hardness here the blonde hair softens her up a bit though. This enables the 24 year old Bancroft to stand toe to toe with both the 40 year old Mature and the 37 year old Preston yep she could be a colonel's wife. Madison walks a careful balancing act as Riordan handling a complex role and sometimes ackward dialogue.Playing a role similar to that of John Wayne in Fort Apache' Madison does a more skillful job at it.This movie has a Silverado' type camaraderie. That alone makes it worth seeing.  It also has memorable performances beautiful scenerary and great action and direction. I just hope a letterbox version is available many have been lost because this movie takes full advantage of that format.".

	schema:reviewBody "Victor Mature plays Jed Cooper a roughandtumble mountain man ostensibly in need of a few social graces who along with his two companions is hired on as a civilian guide at the local army installation a fort on the edge of nowhere. He wants two things a soldier's uniform and commander Col. Frank Marsden's wife Corinna a blonde Anne Bancroft. She isn't altogether turned off. Her husband has been shuffled as far west as possible by the Army to escape his quaint reputation as the butcher of Shiloh. A sizable native army just beyond the fort is waiting. Marsden dismisses them as stupid savages with no concept of military strategy then falls into one of their bear traps.The Last Frontier is about civilization and what it means to be civilized. Jed is an outsider and he wants to belong. For him to be civilized is to wear a uniform and to attain domesticity. He grapples hard with this civilization thing and learns that there are some confounding complexities. Col. Marsden flaunts the veneer of civilization but he's a ruletoting bully.I've probably said too much already but I love the dry adult westerns of Anthony Mann. For all his tackling of a complex theme Mann doesn't forget the action scenes. The climactic Indian attack is exciting with the dust that's whipped up providing a nice visual touch and Jed's oneonone fight with a Marsden flunkie is raw and brutal. The fort in this movie appears to be authentic and detailed and we get to see its layout. Victor Mature's performance as a rough frontiersman is well realized and convincing a far cry from the oiledup Samson wrestling a stuffed lion in a certain Cecil B. De Mille soaper. A special nod to Guy Madison for his portrayal of a sane allround nice guy. This is hardly a lesser Mann picture. It's up there among his best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hope you caught the pun in my title! I much enjoyed this film which offers a variety of interesting subplots and complex lovehate relationships along with interspersed action sequences and some lighthearted moments in which the freespirited mountain men counter regimented army discipline. All the main characters are well cast. Some reviewers question the wisdom of choosing middleaged Victor Mature as the lead character Jed Cooper. Yes he was getting a bit puffyeyed for a Tarzanlike western hillbilly. Others simply don't go for his personality or acting style. But overall I found him quite suitable for his wild man desiring to become marginally civilized role. Robert Mitchum would perhaps have been equally at home in this rile. Several reviewers would have preferred Burt Lancaster. Burt would have his chance as a loner trapper some years later in the eccentric western The Scalphunters worth checking out if you like mountain men tales.At first I thought this story was taking place in Oregon with the high domeshaped volcanic cone often in the background and one of the forts named Medford. But I soon realized that these were false clues. Fort Laramie was repeatedly mentioned as not too far away. Also Red Cloud was repeatedly mentioned as the war chief of the recently belligerent Sioux. Well these are strong clues that the story relates to the wellknown Powder River War in northern Wyoming between the US government and an alliance of Sioux Cheyenne and Arapaho. Guy Madison's Captain Riordan and Robert Preston's Colonel Marston can be seen as modified versions of the historical Colonel Carrington and Captain Fetterman respectively. As in the film the Civil Warexperienced but Sioux inexperienced overconfident Fetterman led his men into an ambush. As in the film Fetterman's entire 81man party was annihilated considered the worst US cavalry disaster at the hands of Native Americans until Custer's much better remembered debacle. During the battle CooperMature takes on the historic role of Captain Ten Eyck sent to investigate the gunplay heard and deciding it was prudent to retreat.Incidentally the army did build 3 forts in this area in the late Civil War years but their names were changed in the film and by treaty they were soon abandoned later burned by the Sioux. The main reason for all this sudden animosity was the discovery of rich placer gold deposits in Montana Territory just northwest of the present Yellowstone Park. Swarms of draftdodging prospectors and other sorts had been negotiating the newly established Bozeman Trail across Wyoming to these goldfields right through the currently favorite hunting grounds of the relevant tribes. The classic Clark Gablestarring western The Tall Men released the same year as this film also relates to this gold fever and he also had to deal with Red Cloud in a semihistorical script.The main problem I find with the plot is the historical anachronism of the 3 buddy trappers. The era of pure trapper mountain men had pretty much ended 25 years before the end of the Civil War with the collapse of western beaver populations and the simultaneous collapse of a market for such. Thus these trappers were limited to much less valuable furs and hides. As others have pointed out the plot bears a striking resemblance to the previous John Ford Fort Apache save for the location. In both cases we have a commander arriving from the east to a frontier post with Native American problems. He underestimates the military prowess of his adversaries regarding them as little more than easy cannon fodder to promote his career. He pays dearlydies for his inexperience and brashness. Also this commander resents a subordinate who has long experience with the local Native Americans and warns him what is wise and unwise to do. In both films we have a budding romantic relationship between a woman dear to the commander's heart and a subordinate which the commander tries to squelch. Clearly the commander must be eliminated to allow these romances to proceed to completion. In common with director Mann's film The Far Country the loner star's longtime partner must be eliminated to allow room for a woman to take his place. In the present film Cooper has two partners who independently die or disappear. James Whitmore plays one of them. Yes he much reminds you of Spencer Tracy. This was Whitmore's second subsidiary role as a mountain man also being in the Clark Gablestarring Across the Wide MissouriI found the verbal confrontation between Cooper and Marsden while the latter was trapped in a bear pit fall along with the fallout from this incident the most interesting aspect on this film. Anne Bancroft as Marsen's conflicted wife has a most interesting role especially as it relates to this incident. The theme of most everyone associated with this fort being a misfit surfaces repeatedly. Most of the soldiers including the commander were sent here because they have 'problems' or are raw recruits. The trappers are misfits personalitywise with army discipline. Bancroft as one of the few woman in this fort is inherently a misfit and hates it.".

Nevertheless Mann was able to get a very good performance out of Mature. And not only that he was able to do a very good film which reminded me more of his older westerns like Devil's Doorway and The Furies. Like those two other westerns The Last Frontier is unusual. Mature is Jed a trapper who is obliged to seek refuge in a fort because the Indians won't accept him being around any more. He falls in love with Robert Preston Col. Marston's wife Anne Bancroft. Preston is very much the same character as Henry Fonda in Fort Apache. You can't blame his wife for not liking him specially because he was responsible for the death of thousands of soldiers on account of his blind ambition. Jed is also ambitious he does not want to be a scout but a blue coat and in his innocent exuberant way he is more balanced and intelligent and likely to get what he wants than Preston. Anthony Mann could never be labeled as a director belonging to a specific genre. He directed such different films as The Glenn Miller Story and El Cid. He was good at every film he did. And such also is the case with Jed. When his friend Mungo Pat Hogan tells him he is going back to the mountains and Jed wants to go with him he tells him You don't belong there I do. He is right Jed does not belong there and also does not belong in the fort as a blue coat. But in spite of not belonging Jed will do well in anything he aims at. Just like Anthony Mann.".

Good adult Western with exciting battle of wits between an obstinate  savage scout and a veteran cavalry commander officer set in a remote Oregon army fort . It deals with a wilderness frontiersman named Jed Cooper Victor Mature and his two pals James Withmore  Pat Hogan see their lives change when takes place the coming of a military outpost called Fort Shallan and they then sign up as scouts . The rough explorer  flirting with the idea of leading a more settled life  decides he needs a spouse and selects Corinna Marston Anne Bancroft  but she results to be the wife of cavalry martinet Marston Robert Preston  commanding officer of the next fort down the line and manned chiefly by untrained rookie troopers . Marston arrives Fort Shallan and announces to Captain Riordan Guy Madison and official Phil Clarke Russell Collins that he has lost his fort and most of his men to an Indian attack led by chief Red Cloud and is assuming command on the outpost .This excellent  meaty Western contains interesting plot  outlandish characterizations  a love story  climatic shootouts  Indian attacks spectacular outdoors and is quite entertaining . This outstanding Mann Western balances action  suspense  thrills  drama and battles remain bloody and indisciplined . The usual wooden Victor Mature does surprisingly a good performance as a crude and illiterate uncivilized backwoods trapper . Topnotch Robert Preston as an embittered Major for having lost his 1500man command during a Civil War battle . Special mention to a sensational James Withmore as old friend  almost father of protagonist Mature and helped raise him  despite the fact that Mature was actually eight years older than Whitmore . Furthermore  the sympathetic Pat Hogan  a real Native  whose career would play Native Americans in approximately eight out of every ten projects he appeared . Anthony Mann does a good work  an energetic and exciting movie  pitting two antagonist characters against the rugged toughness forced a vast natural environment and for love a good woman . Highlight the exemplary value of the landscape as essential dramatic figure and the narrative takes a brisk pace but not fast  a dash dense but not cumbersome . This cavalry drama contains a traditional story and exciting screenplay by prestigious Philip Yordan . Wonderful cinematography in magnificence color is superbly caught by cameraman William C. Mellor in widescreen scope by placing major action on both the far left and right edges of the frame . Atmospheric and lively musical score by Leigh Harline .This firstclass rugged Western is masterfully directed by Anthony Mann  including his characteristic use of landscape which is visually memorable  . Mann established his forte with magnificent Western almost always with James Stewart . In his beginnings he made ambitious but shortlived quality lowbudget surroundings of EagleLion production as Tmen  They walked by night  Raw deal  Railroaded and Desperate . Later on  he realized various Western  remarkably good  masterpieces such as The furies  Devil's doorway and Man of the West and several with his habitual star  James Stewart as Winchester 73  Bend the river  The far country  Man of the West . They are characterized by roles whose determination to stick to their guns would take them to the limits of their endurance . Others in this throughly enjoyable series include Tin star  that is probably one of the best Western in the fifties and sixties . After the mid50  Mann's successes came less frequently . And of course The last Frontier also titled Savage wilderness that turns out to be stylish  fast paced  solid  meticulous  with enjoyable look  and most powerful and minusconsidered . This well acted movie is gripping every step of the way . An unjustly forgotten film turns to be a splendid western and remains consistently agreeable . Rating  Above average  in spite of absence his ordinary star  Stewart  being perfectly replaced by Victor Mature . Well worth watching and it will appeal to Victor Mature fans".

	schema:headline " A great and original Anthony Mann Western with Victor Mature Robert Preston and Anne Bancroft";
	schema:reviewBody "RELEASED IN 1955 and directed by Anthony Mann The Last Frontier aka Savage Wilderness stars Victor Mature as an uncivilized mountain man in 1864 who along with his two trapper buddies James Whitmore  Pat Hogan seeks succor at a wilderness fort on or near the Bozeman Trail in the Northwest manned by a young captain Guy Madison and a brigade of inexperienced recruits. Jed Cooper Mature can't help but be attracted to a beautiful but distant woman at the fort Anne Bancroft who's waiting for her gunho husband a dishonored colonel to return from another remote fort Robert Preston. Meanwhile Red Cloud  his braves threaten Federal advances in the region. Peter Whitney plays a grim hulking sergeant and Russell Collins a reasonable doctor at the fort. If you can get past the hopelessly hokey opening  closing song this is a surprisingly great original Western and one of Anthony Mann's best. The main role was originally intended for Brando who certainly would've been interesting but Mature performs with his renowned beaming gusto. While it might not seem like it on paper the setting and plot are original for a Western and believe it or not this is easily the best fort  cavalry Western I've ever seen. No kidding. The characters aren't onedimensional and are therefore interesting. Take for instance Preston's Colonel Marston He's sort of made out to be the antagonist but you can't help respect his decisiveness courage and honorability. A lesser man for example would've hated the young Captain Madison for defying him whereas the Colonel actually respects him for his bold actions and even commends him !. He understandably seeks redemption for his gallant failure at Shiloh which unnecessarily cost the lives of a thousand men. This would be fine if it were only HIS life on the line rather than an entire brigade of raw recruits.The love affair subplot is handled well and the actionpacked climax is unpredictable although oneelement the final one is eyerolling and tackedon by the studio NOT approved by Mann. Nevertheless The Last Frontier was a huge hit at the box off. It's akin to a mid50's version of the remarkable The Last of the Mohicans 1992 albeit taking place a hundred years later in the remote northwest. THE MOVIE RUNS 98 minutes and was shot in Popocatpetl Volcano Puebla Mexico SE of Mexico City which is an acceptable substitute for the OregonWyomingMontana region. WRITERS Philyp Yordan  Russell S. Hughes based on Richard Emery Roberts' novel The Gilded Rooster. GRADE A".

Led by untamed Jed Cooper Mature the men head to Fort Shallan and take employment as army scouts...By the time that The Last Frontier appeared on the great Anthony Mann's CV he had established himself considerably in film noir and Western movie circles. Here he manages to get the best of both worlds incorporated to provide an interesting and entertaining piece. Filmed on location at Puebla Mexico with the Popocatpetl Volcano providing a beautiful and imposing backdrop the hiring of Mellor is astute ensuring the CinemaScopeTechnicolor aspects boom from the screen. However it's not just the beauty that demands to be observed but also the ruggedness  cum  wildness to which all things that marry up perfectly to the thematic and allegorical beats pulsing away in the story. Of course nobody who loves Mann's Western work will be surprised by this.It's a little disappointing that this ultimately isn't a grandiose adventure epic because all the elements are in place for such but action exists  with the final battle against Red Cloud's hordes  particularly exciting but the emotional turmoil repressed passions and army insanity that resides within Fort Shallan more than compensates via characterisation weight. Mann throws in some tricksy camera work and neat framing shots to keep the visual experience still further away from the mundane while Harline provides a compliant and non intrusive musical score.Cast are doing dandy work. Mature turns in one of his best blending macho strains with confused sadness Whitmore is a reassuring presence by being believable and Preston overcomes his usual woodenness to breathe life into his perf as martinet Colonol Marston. Bonus and taking the acting honours is Madison who as Captain Riordan never over does things ensuring his fulcrum character is the glue holding all together. Bancroft looks wildly out of place her look and the costuming most strange yet it's testament to her ability that her key character is no token female role nailing it without histrionics.The ending sadly is rubbish completely at odds with all before it so it's no surprise to find that it was studio imposed and against Mann's wishes vision. Still forgive them for they know not what they do eh... 710".

Three trappers Jed Cooper Gus and Mungo find themselves relieved of their rifles and the skins they spent a year collecting debate whether to head north to find work in Canada or head to the nearest army camp to demand compensation.

That fort had been attacked but the colonel and some of his men had survived Cooper brings them back to the fort but soon begins to regret it. Col. Marston immediately takes command and sets about planning a counter attack despite the fort only having a hundred raw recruits. The level headed captain who had commanded the post believes it is unwise but the Colonel is determined to win a great victory to restore his honour after losing fifteen hundred men at Shiloh.This was an enjoyable western with an unconventional protagonist Victor Mature's did a fine job as Cooper a crude illiterate man who gets drunk and pursues the colonel's wife... hardly the upstanding hero one expects in such films. Robert Preston's Col. Marston has the heroic look but he is the one who could get everybody killed through his desire for glory. When the fighting comes it is far from glorious instead it is dirty and brutal although not graphic director Anthony Mann did a fine job there. In some ways the romantic storyline seems a bit tacked on but it does serve to show Cooper's lack of concern for 'civilised ways'. The film was shot in stunning scenery although the slopes of Mt. Popocatpetl in Mexico stand in for Oregon!".

The uncivilized Mature lusts for the colonel's wife giving the film an interesting and even dark subplot which goes so far as to reference coveting another man's wife at one point by James Whitmore who plays Mature's older and wiser mountain man father figure. Directed by Anthony Mann this film is lost among his more famous westerns with James Stewart but even so you really don't need the Indian menace to make this a film worth seeing although Preston gets to prove his bad judgement as a commanding officer again in a failed expedition to finally bring the Indians under submission in a well staged attack among the forest that quickly turns into a rout.".

	schema:reviewBody "Very enjoyable 50's Western. I have it in my collection and recommend it to Western fans.Mostly Victor Mature's movie and quite well done in my estimation.He's a trapper who joins a frontier post as a scout. Red Cloud caught three of them on their land and took their possessions. They all joined as scouts after their loss.Victor has set his eye's on the Colonel's wife and lives life on the post without much regards to regulations.Action done quite convincingly but no great depth or much feeling to other characters.50's Westerns are my favorites and this slides easily to a satisfaction.

	onyx:emotionText "Very enjoyable 50's Western. I have it in my collection and recommend it to Western fans.Mostly Victor Mature's movie and quite well done in my estimation.He's a trapper who joins a frontier post as a scout. Red Cloud caught three of them on their land and took their possessions. They all joined as scouts after their loss.Victor has set his eye's on the Colonel's wife and lives life on the post without much regards to regulations.Action done quite convincingly but no great depth or much feeling to other characters.50's Westerns are my favorites and this slides easily to a satisfaction. A Western of this kind is in the pages of the past and perhaps never to be made much again. One to enjoy. Gave it a 7 rating.

The trapper lures the colonel out into the woods and gets him entrapped in a pit and leaves him to die. The trapper in his delusions hopes that the colonel's wife will be impressed and want to be with him. Instead her Christian sensibility is horrified by his actions.

The soldiers at the fort are sick of fighting the local Native Americans and not happy about going out to fight a battle they will inevitably lose. The trapper becomes a hero to them because he is an excellent fighter and much shrewder than the colonel. The colonel is both liked and disliked. He is a loyal soldier but the soldiers are not happy about having to go out and fight to their inevitable deaths. I think this was the best thing about this movie. It was not a typical western. It was a rare 50s movie that was more cynical about war and the point of war.".

It's one thing she wasn't happy in her marriage to the Colonel Robert Preston but to be influenced by Jed Cooper's Mature affections was simply too incredible for this viewer to fathom.The dynamic between Colonel Marston and Captain Riordan Guy Madison was a bit of a puzzler too. As short sighted as Marston was in pursuing his vendetta against Red Cloud's Tetons he still thought it honorable that Riordan tried and failed to have him removed from his command at the fort. You would think the Colonel would have had his second in command further demoted or sent packing to the brig. I just didn't understand it at all.The over arching theme of the story has to do with civilization snaking it's tentacles further West with the Native American Indians marking time until the last of their way of life makes it's lonely exit. The final battle between the Tetons and the Cavalry has a ring of authenticity to it but that's about as far as it goes for this frontier Western.

	schema:reviewBody "Anthony Mann's The Last Frontier qualifies as a terrific U.S. Calvary versus the Indians western that is reminiscent of John Ford's Fort Apache. Victor Mature of My Darling Clementine plays the leading character Jed Cooper a frontiersman who can get the drop on a Sioux Indian. Jed his illiterate surrogate father Gus James Whitmore and their Native American friend Mungo Pat Hogan are three frontiersmen who almost die when Sioux Chief Red Cloud demands not only their firearms but also their animal pelts. The trio discusses their predicament and Gus convinces them that their lives are worth far more than their guns and their pelts. They surrender everything and Red Cloud and his army of Indians allow them to go. Red Cloud warns them that they cannot return least he kill them. Our heroes learn that Red Cloud is agitated because the U.S. Calvary has cut down lots of trees to construct a fortress in the middle of nowhere near Laramie. Captain Glenn Riordan Guy Madison of Payment in Blood and his army engineers have established the fort and have orders to hold it. Our heroic trio marches into Fort Shallan and Captain Riordan hires them as scouts. Deep down inside Jed wants to become a blue coat but Riordan refuses to let him enlist because he feels that Jed isn't civilized enough. Riordan explains the concept of civilization. He specifies that a civilized man has a wife children and knows and works with many people. Jed is just the opposite. He has no wife no children and no sense of responsibility.During the first evening Jed Gus and Mungo get roaring drunk. Jed wanders noisily around the fort and stumbles into a woman's quarters and Corinna Marston Anne Bancroft of The Graduate tolerates his intrusion and he notices a photograph of her husband. Corinna's martinet husband Colonel Frank Marston Robert Preston of Best of the Badmen reminded me of Henry Fonda's ramrodstiff Custer style officer Lieutenant Colonel Owen Thursday. Marston has a reputation for sacrificing men. He fought in the historic battle of Shiloh and his men were slaughtered in a barrage of cannon. When he arrives as Fort Shallan Marston orders that Riordan's men must be trained to be soldiers. Odious Sergeant Major Decker Peter Whitney of The Big Heat whips these engineers into shape but he doesn't cotton to Jed. Eventually Jed and Decker engage in a knockdown dragout fistfight. Marston intends to use the soldiers to launch an attack on Red Cloud. Jed warns everybody that Marston will get them killed. One day Jed and Marston ride out of the fort and spy on Red Cloud's village. Jed explains that the village is only one of many that Red Cloud has established around the fort. Meantime Jed admires Corinna from afar and she senses his lust. During their surveillance of the Indian camp Jed warns Marston that they risk their own exposure if they remain too long. On the way back to their horses Marston plunges into a bear pit. Audaciously Jed refuses to help Marston out of the pit unless he promises not to attack Red Cloud. Marston refuses and Jed leaves him there for a day or two. Reluctantly he returns and helps Marston out of the bear trap.Inevitably Marston attacks Red Cloud and Gus dies during the battle. Jed warns the infantry that they must retreat to Fort Shallan while Marston and his horsemounted troopers are massacred. The ending with Jed ultimately becoming a sergeant is rather to good to be true. Nevertheless everything about this western looks beautiful including the massively built fort and nobody gives a bad performance. This is one of Victor Mature's best performances and Peter Whitney plays against type as a sadistic sergeant who will perform any task that Marston assigns him no matter how beyond the pale it is. Nothing about this wonderful western seems contrived. The Last Frontier is nothing like Mann's westerns with James Stewart.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is set in Oregon during the Civil War. Three trappers Victor Mature James Whitmore and Pat Hogan are dismayed to see that the oncefriendly Indian tribe is now angry and are throwing them of the land. This is because the natives are angry that the US Cavalry has been building forts and it's their land.When the trappers go to the nearby fort to complain they are hired as scoutsmostly because Mature likes the Captain in charge Guy Madison. However later a STUPID Colonel arrives and pretty much ignores Mature's advice. The Colonel Robert Preston wants to just blunder into an attack on the Indiansthough Mature tells him it's suicide. Why? Because he's afraid being assigned to the wilderness means no medals and promotions in the war. And so he seems ready to start one himself! What makes this more complicated is that Mature is a bit of a crazy savage. In the meantime he's fallen inexplicably in love with the Colonel's wife and wants her. And part of him would be very happy to let the Colonel kill himself so he could have her! The film is interesting and looks nice due to the color film and nice locations in the Pacific Northwest. However Mature's alcoholfueled character seemed rather broada bit too much like a savage to seem very real. Subtle he wasn't! Overall I'd say the film has a bit to like and a bit to annoy. Parts of the film are highly reminiscent of John Ford's Fort Apachebut Apache was a masterpiece of subtlety fine acting and an artisan's touch. The Last Frontier is just a bit loud and the characters rather confusing. Interesting but quite flawed and despite the pretty look of the film it comes off more like a Bmovie than anything else.One thing I really really appreciated about the film was the casting of Pat Hogan. It's rare for a REAL AmericanIndian to be cast as an Indian in a 1950s westernespecially in a major role. He was an Oklahomaborn Native American and not some white guy in dark makeup. For example Rock Hudson yes I am NOT kidding was cast as an Indian during this same era!".

So we have Vic clowning around in alcoholinduced rants and Preston forging ahead to commit a series of premeditated killings involving both the enemy natives and his own soldiers.
